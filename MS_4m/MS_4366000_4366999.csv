Just rather have someone shoot it, than tucked away in my safe. Check the list for what I am or am not looking for. I prefer you to have a CCW and/or Valid DL. Must be willing to sign Bill of sale.

It is a variant 7 w/ a bobbed hammer, which means it is DA/SA with a manual safety, and a decocker. I am the second owner. The first owner put around 100 shots through (night stand gun) and I put around 300 or so shots through it. It is one of the older models (pre-2000) but it shoots great (it IS an HK). No box or manual included.

There are two cosmetic discrepancies with the gun. First is there is a slight illegible engraving from the first owner on the slide. It's not hard to miss, but it's not very noticeable unless you are looking for it. The second are dings and scratches on the night sides of the night sights when I (stupidly) installed them with a steel punch. The night sights themselves aren't damaged, and I used a bluing pen to touch them up, but if you look at the sights, you will notice it.

So all together, you will get:
- HK USP Compact .40
- Meprolight Night Sights (installed); unfortunately I don't have the original sights
- Built-To-Fit Leather Holster (no thumb strap, open bottom)
- (2) 10-Round magazines (one with grip extension, one without)
- (4) 12-Round magazines (all with grip extension)
- LEM Kit (uninstalled); I converted it to a variant 7
- Spurred Hammer (uninstalled; a bobbed hammer is on it now)
- Extended Mag Release (installed; the OEM magazine release is included if you want to switch back)
- Around 500-700 loose rounds of LAX Reloaded .40S&W in a plastic 50cal can. If you REALLY want to know the exact amount, let me know...
- 70 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty self-defense ammo

Price for all of it is $800 FIRM or $700 if you don't want the ammo. Cash only, no trades, and I will not ship it. You must pay for all transfer fees. I will work with you on what FFL you'd like to meet at, but I don't really want to drive more than 30 minutes."

When: May 31st - 12:30 PM
Where: Miami Shooters Club location
Contact Number: REDACTED
Website: website www.MiamiShootersClub.com


Next Sunday, May 31st, 12:30pm, we will be teaching an anti-vehicular ambush / anti-car jacking seminar in Miami.  We will meet at the Miami Shooters Club location to practice in the parking lot with rubber guns - and then we'll drive out to a special private range and practice with live ammunition inside and around an actual car.  

To practice with live ammunition, a basic shooting pre-qualification test will be done first, and if you pass, we'll practice with real ammo.  If you fail, no problem, it just means you need more practice, but for safety reasons we'll do the drills with simunitions, which works just like real ammunition except that it shoots a paint bullet.  Simunitions use real guns and are fired with a powder charge like a real gun (not like airsoft) so for the purposes of training, it will be more than sufficient for beginner shooters.

ZERO experience is required - a basic firearms class will be taught for beginners as well.  You do NOT need to own a firearm, we can provide one at no charge.

The seminar will be 4 hours long and the price is $297 for one person.  Since we really encourage spouses to train together, or close friends to train together, the price for two or more people coming together is only $197 each - that's $100 off each person.  Miami Shooters Club members get an additional 10% OFF.  We will also provide firearms if needed at no charge and there is no range fee - however, ammunition is not included.  We do sell ammunition and simunition ammo.  If you're a beginner and would prefer to shoot with simunitions rather than real ammo, that is fine.

Certified NRA instructors Kevin Perez, Victoria Fernandez, Devin Genchi, and myself will be teaching the seminar. The techniques from this particular seminar we learned from two separate ten-day-long trips to Asymmetric Solutions where we got to train under former CIA and military such as Green Berets and Navy Seals.  Now we are bringing the knowledge to our students in Miami.  The video above features Kevin Perez and I at Asymmetric Solutions.

We will have a single vehicle to shoot from - for that reason, we have to limit the class size to eight people.  The first eight people to register will get to participate - first-come, first serve.

If you would like to reserve a spot at the seminar, please call us at REDACTED. 

At the seminar, we'll also share more info about our weekly firearms self defense class that we've been conducting at Miami Shooters Club which includes, but is not limited to:

Firearm Safety 
Pistol 
Rifle 
Shotgun 
Protection Inside the Home (versus home invasion) 
Protection Outside the Home (concealed carry) 
Protection from Inside Your Car 
Close Quarter Combat (with pistol and rifle) 
Gun and Knife Disarms 

We conduct one weekly class at Miami Shooters Club (MSC) and one live fire day at a private tactical range that we have reserved for the first Sunday of every month. We practice at MSC throughout the week and go live, safely, at the range. Live fire is optional but recommended. 

Here is a sample of the sort of training we will practice next Sunday: https://youtu.be/4oTHGxFtFc8

We are also planning another group trip to Asymmetric Solutions to train at their new Jacksonville facility opening up this fall - if you are interested in that too, just let us know.  We have a special relationship with Asymmetric Solutions and get phenomenal discounts. 

Call us at REDACTED or visit our website www.MiamiShootersClub.com if you would like to check out our seminar and/or our weekly gun class at our facility.  You do NOT need a gun to attend (we have loaners at no cost).  The class covers a lot of theory and practical application.  We cover how to use revolvers, semi-auto pistols, shotguns, rifles, and more."

This is a Marlin 512 with a 3"" chamber and a rifled bore. It is in great condition and will serve nicely as a deer/bear gun and is the ideal option when a high powered rifle is not practical or legal.  It will accept a scope mount, though I have never used one.

I see these online in the $400 range in states that do not allow rifle for deer. I have priced mine at $250 the demand for such a tool is different in NW Florida.  I will listen to all reasonable offers, and am interested in the following types of items in trade:

.22lr firearms and ammo
Table saw- 10""/15amp
Circular saw- worm drive 
Router- 2 or more hp with bits
Kayaks and canoes

I have fired 18 rounds through it, and it functions perfectly, and is 100%, scratch & wear free.  
Not much to say it is a Glock,  I think this gun would be a good light weight Concealed Carry Weapon, ready to go, and with the excellent .45 APC caliber.  22.5 ounces.  Very slim, single stack, slimmer than the Glock 30.

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired. In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.
I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my Armlist encounters have been great, but one guy weird-ed me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.

The gun is all original with matching serial number on all of the component, and is complete. The action works, and it seems it could be used to shoot.

This gun has been in my family over 100 years, and was sitting on the fireplace mantle of my family's real estate office in NJ that had been in business since the early 1900's. I don't know the provenance before the early 1900's, but the gun was defintely used and fired many times.

I'm not a gun collector to accurately state the condition of the bluing, etc but the piuctures should demonstrate this, and you can inspect it in person of course.

The close up pics of the Remington stamp on top of the barrel has been photoshopped to see the lettering better so the coloring is not accurate in those specific pics."

This price is firm.  Unless you are prepared to pay the full asking price of the firearm or have any additional questions, please do not contact me with any unsolicited counter-offers or proposals.  Sales will only be conducted locally with Illinois residents at a mutually agreed upon place.  Prior to the sale of this firearm however, the buyer will need to meet with me face-to-face and produce a valid driver's license and FOID card.  Once I obtain copies I will promptly (within 24 hours) contact the State police to initiate the transfer.  Sale will be subject to the buyers execution of a firearm sale agreement, approval of the transfer by the IL State Police, and a waiting 72 hours (as required by IL law) after executing the agreement.  I will ONLY accept a cash sale.  No personal checks, money orders, cashier checks, or wires.

Firearm History:  I bought this firearm at Bass Pro Shop in December 2009 for home defense purposes.  In that time I've taken it to the range a handful of times and did not put more than 600 rounds through it.  Cleaning and oiling was done after every firing no exceptions.  This gun otherwise mostly sat in it's case under my bed.  In my opinion it is in great shape and has no noticeable signs of wear.  Of course that's my opinion...I'm always happy to provide additional pictures to serious buyers upon request.

In 2011 I sent this firearm to Ruger under warranty due to an issue I experienced with the firing pin.  Every so often the pin would strike a round and fail to strike a round hard enough to cause it to fire.  Ruger emailed me a next day air label as I was on the phone with them and completely replaced the pin at no cost, tested, cleaned, and sent the firearm back within a matter of two weeks.  The entire process did not cost me a single  dollar.  Since then, I haven't experienced any other issues.

It has the 4.75 inch barrel and two 9 round magazines. This gun is very accurate and reliable. It is a great pistol for plinking or hunting.

This gun was purchased in 1981 so there is some wear and freckling on it externally but the internals are fine. I purchased if from a retired police officer and it mostly sat in his drawer until he sold it to me.


Also


I have a custom H&R Pump shotgun which is a clone of a Remington 870 only this gun is made from all steel instead of having a few plastic parts in the trigger group like an 870.

This is a great shotgun for home defense. The standard Pardner Pump security model has an 18 inch barrel and only holds 5 + 1. This shotgun however, was modified from the hunting model with the vented rib barrel. The vented rib acts as a built in heat shield, the barrel was cut from 28 inches down to roughly 21 inches to be about flush with the magazine extension. The barrel is 3 inches longer but the gun has almost twice the capacity."

I'm the first owner (I bought it new six weeks ago). It really didn’t need any breaking in; works flawlessly.

This is the new polymer frame version of the gun…very light and it’s easy to make it disappear in any pocket.  The unique tip-up barrel for loading a round in the chamber eliminates the need for racking the slide after inserting the 8-round magazine (but you can still do so if you wish).  This feature makes the gun perfect for those who may not have sufficient hand strength to rack the slide on other small guns. 

The PT22 Poly is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a smooth trigger. Its light weight (11.27 oz.) with an ultra-comfortable grip makes it an outstanding concealed carry gun.

The full package comes with everything that came with the gun from the factory: original box, Taurus locking system with keys, all paperwork, and the 8-round mag with pinkie extension supplied by Taurus.  

I’ve also included a mag loader specifically made for the PT22 and I'll add in 100 rounds of CCI MiniMag ammo to get you started.

The serial number begins with “397...” indicating this is a very recently manufactured gun.  The Taurus lifetime warranty travels with the gun, not just the original owner.  If you aren't familiar with this gun, check out Jeff Quinn's excellent review of it on his Gunblast website: http://www.gunblast.com/Taurus-PT22Poly.htm

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit.

If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

I'll trade up to a Ruger SR22 or a recent gen Ruger LCP and add cash for either one, or I'll gladly consider other handguns in .22lr or .380.   Let me know what you have.  A cash sale is always welcome.

The rifle started out as a $300 Mossberg 715T AR-15 style .22 semi-auto.  I didn't like the look and feel of the upper and lower, so I removed the barrel, trigger group (these are integrated as a single unit, but can be disassembled for cleaning) and I added a $200 Archangel Marauder G36 Kit (the one designed for the Ruger 10/22) and fabricated the setup to marry to the Mossberg barrel and internals.

There isn't another G36 variant out there chambered in .22 that looks this cool.  It gets a lot of attention at the range.

I've got several other .22 rifles and now that I completed this project, I'm moving on to the next one.
