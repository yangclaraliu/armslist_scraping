Still has the original tag hooked to the holster where he brought it back, and with a little searching, I can probably come up with the original paperwork. Both pistol and holster are Nazi proofed. The pistol is a cyq sn/762t coming from the Spree Werke Factory in good working order with nominal wear. Eagle over 88 inspection mark. The holster that the soldier was carrying it in is actually for a Mauser P08 Luger and is marked gxy 42 WaA918. Fits nicely though. Comes with two P38 original mags. Initials of the soldier capturing the pistol are scratched on the front of the holster. Be happy to make copies of some of the associated documents, as the soldier who captured this was my father......saw a lot of action and received a couple of bronze stars among other things during the war."

The Lyman 90MJT is click adjustable and the front globe has all the inserts. They are virtually brand new. The rifle itself has its original magazine but the spring was weak. Luckily there are high quality new ones available and this rifle includes one of those as well.

Serial number puts it in the mid to late 40s. Im pretty sure the stock has been refinished at some point. If the metal has been reblued, then they did a great job at not washing out the lettering during the repolish. The bluing looks great and there is only a slight bit of surface rust near the muzzle.

I still use this rifle so I didn't want to remove the optic or lever for the picture and then have to rezero. You're welcome to test fire it at my range after I see funds able to purchase.

Bushmaster ACR Enhanced model. Original factory box and docs with it. The rifle has less than 200 rounds through it. The charging handle has been replaced with an upgraded all aluminum handle so no polymer to break here. The muzzle brake has also been replaced with a PWS FSC556 which is the exact same brake as used on the SCAR so the gun practically doesn't move when shooting. There have been some rail covers and a red dot added which I'll throw in for free. Comes with 1 30 round PMag, but if you want more or some ammo we can always talk about adding things. For those that don't know much about this rifle you can break it down, even removing the barrel, in less than 1 minute. It is the easiest to clean rifle I've ever owned, and it is NOT ammo picky at all. Using a piston means that it will stay clean and cool near the bolt, and hell with it I'll toss in the Magpul VFG that is on it for free as well. The folding stock is very robust, much more so than the SCAR stock, and it has multiple sling attachment points including quick detach mounts.

$2100 

Sig P229 in excellent condition. It is currently wearing a very nice set of hogue wood grips, but will come with the original E2 grips as well. There have been roughly 400 rounds through this pistol, which is nothing to a Sig. I've taken a picture of the internals so you can see that it is in great condition (the white being Sig grease). The gun has the original box with it as well and will come with 2 15 round magazines. The Hogue Grips are the Pau Ferro Checkered model and are over $100 alone so it is a good deal.

$825
Total: $2925
If you purchase both: $2300. That's $575 off! 
Bonus if purchased together: 2 full magazines for each firearm.

This is the first rifle to enter the US market which combines the handling and reliability of a military-style design, while also presenting the shooter with all the elements of a modern sporting rifle platform. Because the MK22 is manufactured completely with metal parts, it not only exceeds all requirements for durability, but feels like a centerfire weapon even though it is chambered in the .22 LR cartridge. The rifle comes standard with front and rear folding sights, along with Picatinny rail mounts that will accommodate all lighting, aiming, and gripping accessories.

The ESCORT Plate Carrier transforms from an ordinary looking briefcase into a full sized plate carrier - compatible with both 10"" x 12"", and extra-large 11"" x 14"" hard and soft body armor.
•	Quick deployment via YKK Zippers
•	Lightweight Design
•	Front & Back Velcro ID panels
•       External side pocket when folded with zipper closure
•	Handle identifier ensure proper deployment

When closed, the ESCORT carrier resembles a standard briefcase or laptop bag, discrete and cancelability to application, with one swift action of the zipper it deploys into a full plate carrier system. Concealed body armor has never been so inconspicuous and deployable from concealment. The ESCORT Plate carrier is lightweight, concealable, portable, rugged, and functional.
Featuring a slick sided design, the ESCORT has Velcro panels on both the front and rear sides of the plate carrier. These can be used for Velcro ID Panels or compatible magazine and utility pouches. When stowed, the elastic cummerbund strap tucks away into the back side of the carrier. When deploying, simply pull the exposed D-Ring and strap and secure the elastic cummerbund strap. The shoulders are fully adjustable and internal plate retention straps ensure a proper fit.
When folded the ESCORT Plate Carrier features an external side pocket with zipper closure. The main compartment can also be accessed without full deployment of the plate carrier. The handle features an identifying mark which acts as an indicator to ensure the carrier is properly oriented prior to deployment.

Size: Fully adjustable shoulder straps and girth, Medium – XXL (up to a 54” Chest)

Since it is based on the Remington 870 tactical, most Rem 870 components are compatible with it. and it operates exactly the same. 

 Installed: I added a 4 shot side saddle, sling mounts, Blackhawk swivels, and a Blackhawk 15-shell sling and original packaging for those. 

I will also include a padded shotgun bag, an unused cable lock, 10 rifled slugs, 10 '00' buckshot shells, and about 2 boxes of target shells."

These were the very first auto loading shotguns ever made. they never had a name for these until much later and were just referred to as the auto loader.
yes similar to the browning auto 12

This one was produced by Remington under the Browning patent with permission. 
there were quite a few of these made however only approx 8000 of the riot/police special and most survivors are in pretty bad shape. This one looks and operates great.

one thing very common to these were a crack forming in the front stock due to the mounting cap not being tightened enough and from the recoiling barrel slamming the stock against its rest due to the slop. this one has the cracked front stock but has been repaired and everything is good. 
The butt stock has the matching serial number to the receiver.

This is the stainless steel 629 Classic model with hard cast smooth faced wide shoed trigger and hard cast wide spur hammer. The barrel is not pinned nor is it magna-ported. The barrel itself is five inches in length. It is a great example of a Pre-Lock Smith & Wesson 629-5 and would make an awesome addition to any collection. 

Replaceable pinned in front sight paired with windage and elevation adjust rear sight.  

I bought this a couple years back but am not able to mitigate muzzle rise on this .44 magnum like Jerry Miculek can so I would like to part ways with it. 

As far as I can tell it has been used yet respected and locks up tight on all chambers. For what ever it is worth my .006(sixth thousandth of an inch)Blue-Point feeler gauges will not fit in between the cylinder and forcing cone and my .004 drags. 

I have fired less than 100 rounds. Unsure of total round count prior to my ownership. 

Couple hundred rounds included in sale as I do not ever see myself owning another .44 magnum.

A molded canvas covered plastic Bianchi holster with snap closure will be included as well as two Safari Land speed clips. 

No original literature or box included in sale, only because I never had it and is a shooter so I was not concerned.  It does have a Smith & Wesson case thou. 

More pictures are available per your request.    

Only partial trade considered at this time would be an entry level A1 1911 plus a fair amount of cash. 

$850 or best offer. 


The purchaser must be able to show proof of proper Minnesota credentials are essential before any sale will be considered.

The only noticeable wear is where the safety selector has scratched the receiver & there are some minor oil stains on the dust cover from cleaning.

This rifle has the 18"" barrel and it shoots tight groups. This isn't the GI parkerized version, it has the black factory finish. Originally I bought it as a battle rifle but after shooting several tight groups it was destined to be built into a long range tack-driver, hence the additional upgrades. I've punched approximately 40 rds downrange but have to let it go due to a couple personal reasons. What was my glorious investment is now someone elses gain as I'm taking a bath in my losses."

If anyone know s about these rifles it's the best rifle from century arms. Because it's from an original colt m16a1. Google this rifle and it will tell you all about it. I purchased this rifle because of the teardrop forward assist. Which you will see most guys in vietnam carried. I also have included is a 1970 dated 5.56 bandoleer filled with the 20 round mags. I believe 4 of the mags are colt and the other 4 are the hard to find m16a1 marked magazines. This rifle has the a1 style grip and butstock both are colt. This rifle is in amazing condition and you won't be disappointed. There was only so many if these rifles made and w as released to the public a number of years ago. These are pretty hard to find.

From the Nightforce website:
""The U.S. military asked for a scope that is exceptionally fast and applicable to a wide range of targets at various distances. The 3.5-15 x 50 F1 NXS™ is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from up-close to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with rangefinding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable."""

The Hakim Rifle is a gas operated semi-automatic rifle. It was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and early 1960s. It was replaced in the mid-1960s by the Maadi AK-47 (a licensed copy of the Soviet rifle) but was stored in military reserve arsenals. In more recent years, it has been observed in use by some Egyptian police units. Around 70,000 were made.

The Lee–Enfield bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle was the main firearm used by the military forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.
Rifle No. 4[edit]

Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I

Canadian rifleman during Battle of Ortona, December 1943
By the late 1930s the need for new rifles grew and the Rifle, No. 4 Mk I was first issued in 1939 but not officially adopted until 1941.[31] The No. 4 action was similar to the Mk VI, but lighter, stronger, and most importantly, easier to mass-produce.[32] Unlike the SMLE, the No 4 Lee–Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. The No. 4 rifle was heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel and a new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a spike bayonet, which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point and was nicknamed ""pigsticker"" by soldiers.[32] Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed, originally intended for use with the Sten gun—but sharing the same mount as the No. 4's spike bayonet—and subsequently the No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets were issued for use with the No. 4 rifle as well.[33]

During the course of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further simplified for mass-production with the creation of the No. 4 Mk I* in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle's receiver.[34] It was produced only in North America, by Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the USA.[34] The No.4 Mk I rifle was primarily produced in the United Kingdom.[35]"

Call or Text REDACTED.

Carcano is the frequently used name for a series of Italian bolt-action military rifles and carbines. Introduced in 1891, this rifle was chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Mannlicher cartridge (Cartuccia Modello 1895). It was developed by the chief technician Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1890 and called the Modello (model) 91 or simply M91. Successively replacing the previous Vetterli-Vitali rifles and carbines in 10.35×47mmR, it was produced from 1892 to 1945. The M91 was used in both rifle (fucile) and carbine (moschetto) form by most Italian troops during the First World War and by Italian and some German forces during the Second World War. The rifle was also used during the Winter War by Finland, and again by regular and irregular forces in Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria during various postwar conflicts in those countries.

The Type I Carcano rifle was produced by Italy for the Japanese Empire prior to World War II. After the invasion of China, all Arisaka production was required for use of the Imperial Army, so the Imperial Navy contracted with Italy for this weapon in 1937. The Type I is based on the Type 38 rifle and uses a Carcano action, but retains the Arisaka/Mauser type 5-round box magazine. The Type I was used primarily by Japanese Imperial Naval Forces and was chambered for the Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge. Approximately 60,000 Type I rifles were produced by Italian arsenals for Japan. A Carcano was used in the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy."

Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the rifle is aiming; it's easy to sight in any scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark laser bore sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any gun. It's easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark laser bore sight is available in several calibers and gages for use with all the most popular rifles and shotguns."
