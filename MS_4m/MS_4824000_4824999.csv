Rear sights for this model are rare, because they were usually removed, in order to add a rimfire scope, and subsequently lost. To find an original rear sight by itself can cost almost as much as the rifle.   Based on the serial number (26431xxx) and Marlin's use of coding for dating production, this particular Model 99M1 was produced in 1974. It is my understanding that, after 1972, Marlin used the first two digits of the serial number subtracted from 100 to indicate the year of manufacture.   The tube magazine has a 9 rounds capacity with an 18"" barrel. All of the metal parts, including the barrel, receiver, trigger guard and sling loops were professionally stripped and parkerized by the previous owner. While not original to the 99M1, I believe it makes it look more ""GI"" in appearance and suits the rifle.   There are some minor chips around the muzzle, but overall condition of the finish is 98%. The walnut stock has the original finish with some minor handling marks, but no cracks, gouges or major defects. The butt plate is original and has no cracks or chips. Includes a surplus OD green strap. I have tried to provide quality photos, so that you can examine it for yourself.   Must have NH License, face-to-face transaction. Prefer local to the Monadnock Region.   If this listing is still active, the item is still available."

I bought this gun new in 2006, and I test-fired it just enough to verify the reliability and accuracy, probably 100 rounds.  

The Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden pistol on the market today. Starting with a hammer-forged ordnance-grade steel frame, slide and barrel, each and every part is machined to close tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun, then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers.  This aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value.   

This would be a perfect duty pistol for personal, home or automobile security use.  How about giving this as an awesome Christmas gift for somebody special. Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this Taurus .45. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $575 cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license."

As a side note, Windham is run by Richard Dyke.  He founded Bushmaster in 1976, which he eventually sold to Cerebrus Capital Management/Freedom Group in 2006.  When Cerebrus decided to close that Maine plant, he bought the assets and reorganized the company as Windham in 2011.  Just like here in Columbus, when Jim Grote sold Donatos to McDonalds then bought the company back.  Isn't America a great place?"

This pistol is just bad ass. One of my favorite home defense guns. What is not to like about 15+1 rounds of +P .45 ACP right?! Toss a Surefire X300U or a Streamlight TLR-1HL on this baby and you got a serious piece of home defense kit.

The Trijicon HD sights include a 12 year warranty from the date code printed on them which is 2014. The front sight has the orange HD ring and the thing picks up targets QUICK! Rear sight has the flat face cocking ledge for one handed cocking.

This gun has been to the range a couple times but it mostly just going to sit in the safe as I also have the FNX-45 Tactical in TAN.

Also, only selling this one because I also have the FNX-45 Tactical in TAN as mentioned above. Looking to pick up a HK45C or CT if someone is looking to make a trade?

Comes with everything a brand new pistol would include,

- Pistol
- 3, 15 round magazines
- Extra back straps
- Case
- Manual
- Lock

*PRICE DROP* I will take $625.00 FTF in GR.

I would like to get $725.00 OR best reasonable offer. This gun cost $729.00+tax brand new and the Trijicon HD's were another $160.00+$50.00 to install.

Has holster wear and use wear, but nothing ridiculous. Mechanically, as expected, is top notch. Surpreme accuracy and very shootable, large in part due to the excellent trigger. Smith makes great guns now, but they don't stack up to the classics such as this one. Old school craftsmanship at it's finest. It's been sitting in the safe for a year or two and is taking up space. I took it to the range and fired 20 rounds to ensure its time in the safe didn't hurt it; It is good to go and smooth as ever. I already have a Model 15 and don't need two, so off it goes...

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.


The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.


     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Features of this lightweight, semi-automatic rifle include a heavy barrel with chrome lining in both bore and chamber for optimum durability and accuracy. The barrel, and all steel components are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The latest M16A2 rear sight system is incorporated offering dual flip up apertures: the short range aperture (0-200 meters) has a larger opening for greater light gathering as well as better moving target visibility; the smaller aperture is designed for maximum accuracy at longer ranges. Knobs adjust the sight for windage and elevation the elevation knob is graduated from 300 to 800 meters so that range adjustments may be made without the need to compensate for bullet drop. The receivers, of 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum, are precision machined from forging for maximum strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. The ribbed front hand guard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of polymer thermoset composite. Available with a 20"" chrome lined heavy barrel.

That will be an additional cost of $700 if interested in the Optic as well as the rifle. THE OPTIC DOES NOT COME WITH THE RIFLE FOR THE ASKING PRICE THAT IS LISTED, THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL COST IF INTERESTED IN IT. If interested in only the optic it will be $750.

I am looking to sell this as a face to face (FTF) transaction to someone in New Jersey who possesses a NJ FID with a matching Drivers License.

I am not interested in any trades."

It has the correct Russian rear sight and uses a blade bayonet.

Someone has ground the bayonet lug off and the cleaning rod lug off as well. Was gonna keep it and put a new front sight block on it so I can take it back to it's Military form but I've decided to part with it. This SKS functions flawlessly, it's numbers matching except the magazine and stock, which is common with these. Bore is nice and bright with sharp rifling!

The SKS being sold is the one on the top in the pics, the lighter of the two with the sling and without the bayonet, the bottom one(my numbers matching Romanian)IS NOT FOR SALE!

The second mag has something wrong with it so the slide won't lock back after the last round, which is why I only use the good mag.  This is not a .45 acp, its just listed that way because there is no option for 10mm on this website."

Full 
Modified
Improved cylinder

as well as Steelshot Full, modified, and improved cyilnder. 

Only difference is that the steelshot chokes are best used with...well, steel shot which is ideal for hunting, the regular chokes are fine for sport shooting such as clays ect...

Its pretty hard to come by these shotguns in the US so get your hands on one now!

Factory description:
The CZ 85 incorporates ambidextrous features into the basic CZ 75 platform including RH and LH safety and slide stop levers as well as a reversible mag release. The B model has a firing pin block safety that restricts any movement of the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This mechanism prevents discharge in the event that a dropped pistol lands on its muzzle with enough force that the inertia of the firing pin overcomes the firing pin spring enough to touch off the primer.

It is a Dual linyard Officers Issue.

The wood grips have notch marks in them, your quests is as good as mine on that.
I can't swear to the belt and Ammo pouch and holster were issued with the pistol, but the man I got it from said his father carried the gun and that's how it was given to him.
Colt did the refinish on the gun in Officers dress.
As you can see all the markings and lettering are extremely clear, I have before refinish pictures as well somewhere.
The price is firm.
If you buy it I will send back and have it stripped and finish back to original."

I have been hunting for another gun for my collection. On many occasions I emailed sellers with hopes of striking a deal, but without success, mostly disagreeing with the prices asked, some of you don't have the courteous to even return an email.
So, driven to the dealers, I found the gun I wanted, at a lesser price than the models on Armslist, and it's brand new.
So we both get what we want, I got a brand new gun, you get to continue re-posting your used gun at inflated prices.

Grip : Hogue Forearm : Free Float Modular Flash Hider : Anderson Knight Stalker Gas Block : Low Profile, No Rail RF85 Means 85% less friction The Anderson Rifle never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication. An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. 85% Less Friction 23% Faster Action Never Needs Oiling Cleans Up with Soap & Water.

With this gun also comes a 26"" .280 Remington barrel that is was sent to H&R and fitted precisely for this model. It also features a scope rail for easy scope mounting. The .243 as well as the .280 have both only had 40-50 shells put through them and only the .243 has been carried in the field, where it harvested two deer last year. The .243 is a great choice for first time hunters or for any new sportsman, the .280 is for the seasoned hunter that wants the challenge of  single shot rifle. I recently acquired an auto-loader .30-06 that I enjoy very much, and is the only reason I am selling this Handi Rifle combo."
