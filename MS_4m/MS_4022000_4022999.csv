The SAM7UF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.

The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock
The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle.  In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

SAM7UF-85 | SAM7UF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left-hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet / accessory lug, reinforced under-folding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel heat shield, cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine (accepts any mil. spec. magazine), sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

The bluing is about 80-85% it has age wear and functions as it should. It has matching numbers including the upper and lower wood. The wood is laminated and has only some handling marks and no major issues such as chips, splits or cracks. The bore is excellent being bright with no rust or pitting. As the photos show, there are many Nazi Waffenmarks on the gun and matching numbers through out. The sling is also Nazi marked and is an original sling and not a modern reproduction. The sling is in very good condition and has not been repaired. This is a very nice example of an original ""War Trophy"" and would fit great into a Military collection. Thanks for looking."

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects."

It's designed for the Glock 17, 19, 22, and/or 23.
It may work with other guns but I wouldn't know for sure.
I can attest it works perfectly with a Glock 17.
It has a very sturdy retention system that would make it fantastic as a duty or open carry holster.
I'm selling it because I need a competition type holster and this retention system is too firm for my uses.
Where having your weapon taken from you is a concern, this holster would be perfect.

This started as a matte black FNS-9 which then had the slide stripped then had a custom Kryptek Duracoat and clearcoat added to it. I have yet to see another FNS that is similar. I managed to put only 800 rounds down range before being Duracoated and only about 60 rounds afterwards. It has been cleaned and is in wonderful shape.

I do have an absurd amount of 9mm ammo as well. I have critical duty defensive rounds and a lot of ball ammo. If I sell this firearm I won't need the ammo so I can make a fair deal on that as well if it comes to it.

The KAC M5 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M16A4, and with hundreds of thousands of rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M5 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 10 Rib Rail Panels.

It was manufactured in 11/14. I've worn it probably a dozen times. It has always been stored flat.

The carrier is black and is either a Larger or X-Large. Also has Thor-Shield, to protect from getting tazed. I am 6'3"" and 260lbs. The soft armor is made of Dyneema, which is the latest and greatest BR material.

The vest is actually pretty light weight for a IIIA. Maybe 5-6lbs.

This will ONLY be sold to LEO or Security personnel. Why? There is the impending legislation banning BR/armor being owned by a ""civilian"". And then I don't want to sell to someone who would be using the vest for nefarious reasons and it coming back on me.

The vest was $1,020 new. I'm asking $800 it is in ""like new"" condition and always stored flat with the interior facing up/out.

I inherited it from a GI who brought it home after liberating it and other weapons confiscated from citizens in 1945.  Nice little history behind it.  It fires nicely with a decent trigger.  I've only shot a box through it of 20 rds and got around 5moa accuracy...having never shot a mauser action rifle before.  $300 and comes with 60 rounds of HSM/BVAC match 8mm mauser ammo.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I have 2 of these in stock.  Email with any questions.  payment can be made in cash, money order, or cashiers check.  Thanks"

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I have 2 of these in stock.  Shipping is available. E-mail with any questions.  Thanks."

I have the following for sale, as a total package:

Smith & Wesson M&P .40:
Purchased it new one year ago, has had 30 rounds (2 mags) fired through it since then. This pistol has been meticulously cared for, cleaned and oiled every month. Selling this for $450.

Crimson Trace Lightguard Flashlight:
Purchased 1 year ago for $369, selling now for $200. Note: the pistol will not fit in the holsters below with the flashlight on. 

Crimson Trace Laser Grip:
Purchased one year ago for $169, selling now for $80. I have the original grips to replace the laser grip with, in the case that you want to take it off of your pistol. 

Holsters:
Four holsters; 1 Kydex retention holster, 1 in-the-waistband concealed carry holster, 1 out-of-waistband molded holster, and 1 out-of-waistband molded magazine holster. 
These are free.

Ammunition: 
160 rounds of Gold Dot defense rounds (hollow point), worth $160, selling for $110. That's a $50 incentive. 

Magazines: 
1 comes with purchase of the pistol, and 3 more will sell for $20 each, at $60 total. They are priced at $40 each new online, and these are hardly used. 

Sale is for all items - the whole package - and will not be partitioned out. Your total is $900. This is a great deal, with a savings of at least $650 if you were to purchase these separately.

Cash only please, and be prepared to show a valid Oregon ID.

The knife is not included in this sale.Thanks


Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades. It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment .22 LR it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.

Practical, Safe and Reliable

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Beretta.

I installed an extended latch, and Yankee hill annihilator muzzle break. The pistol buffer tube is made by brownells and has a foam pad. I know the pick shows a pistol grip but this will not come with the gun because it will come with a new pistol grip when you buy the lpk. Note* juggernaught has Anderson LPKs for $42.

Comes with everything except the TiRant 45 suppressor (obviously) but does include the Pelican case.
Since you can't buy these by themselves, I'm just going to subtract the price of the TiRant and knock some more off of it. Paid $2200 with suppressor ($750 for TiRant), so by itself the price would be $1450. I'm asking $900 or OBO

Included is a reflex sight, sling, two 10-round Magpul mags., 410 rounds of ammo, and a 25"" Bulldog brand AR Pistol carrying case.
For those not familiar with Kel-tec, this rifle takes AR magazines, it has a 16 inch barrel, and folds at the trigger; making the storage length only 25 inches. The butt stock is capable of stowing a spare 30-round AR mag, even when collapsed. The fore-stock quickly becomes a bi-pod, making this an extremely versatile, great-shooting trunk/camping/packing/plinking rifle."
