Selling an enhanced bushmaster ACR multi-cal assault rifle. It can be set to 5.56, 6.8 and 7.62 It's current configuration is set to 5.56. I've never had the privilege to fire this weapon due to a decline in my health from injuries suffered in the line of duty in the US Military.

If you looking for the perfect assault rifle, then this has your name all over it. It has everything on it you would want or need and is a few pounds lighter making the weapon that much more perfect after being modified. Below is a breakdown of what this weapon has or has been modified to. Also I have the stock parts that were swapped out for lighter and modified Parts (unique folding butt stock, trigger, hand guards etc). 

I have the stock Barrel currently in the weapon. For the other barrel, the ATF stamp/engraving is done on the outside of the trigger guard in a very small font. So yes, this comes with two barrels and the other barrel is NFA stamped/approved as it is 12 inches. The current barell is 16 inches

All together I have over 5500 into the weapon alone. The ammunition and other miscellaneous items is over 1 grand. I am throwing the ammunition and miscellaneous items in it for FREE. Yes I said that, the miscellaneous stuff to include the ammunition is FREE with purchase of the weapon. I still have all the packaging, boxes and receipts for everything and will send the boxes and packaging to you if you like. 

I have a number what I will take for the weapon and currently I am taking all offers. Please make a serious offer and don't waste my time as I won't waste yours. I know realistically I'm not going to get what i paid but keep in mind, everything is still unused, brand new and in the box. 

Once we agree on a price I will send the weapon in the original case and ship it to your local FFL dealer. I will send the remainder items to your local address standard shipping. If you would like to contact me about a certain piece or have any questions on anything please feel free to contact me. Thanks for stopping by and don't miss out on this rare opportunity.

I was told that once issued a CCW in Colorado, that card exempts the need for background checks when purchasing in Colorado.

Is this true? Does the CBI fee still apply? If not, what paperwork if any is needed when going to purchase? 

Also, either way, could you point me towards the statue stating the need or lack of need of CBI check after being issued a CCW.

I'm selling my 2007 Yamaha FZ6 600cc motorcycle in blue with matte black. It has about 5,700 miles on it and looks great. Runs excellent.

Previous owner laid it down once on the right side and there are some scratches and one small crack on the fairing from it. There are also a couple dents in the gas tank on the left side from previous owner. Front tire will need replacing soon. Other than that, the bike is very clean and mechanically perfect. It runs excellent, is fast when you need it, and rides very smooth at cruising speeds. 

I just had the bike inspected and registered on 09-28-15, so it is good for another year. Clean title in my name. Bike is ready for you to hop on and go! 

For the right buyer, I might include a matching blue (same color as bike) ICON Timax jacket in size large. It has titanium armor plates in it as part of the protection built into it. Very nice jacket and very hard to find them.


Asking $2,950 in cash. That's well below KBB and NADA. Asking $3,500 in trade value.

 

 


I'll gladly text more pictures if you want to see more angles of the bike. Call or text anytime.

Description:
The M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories.

Rifle Requirements: 
The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants.

Summary: 
My brother (US Army) intended to use this during his deployment to Afghanistan, but ended up using another quad-rail system instead. This is exactly what's issued to US troops with their M4 Carbines. Box and packaging have been opened, but rail and accessories have never been used and are in excellent condition.

Please check my other listing for the Medallion.

This is the Made in Belgium/Portugal model with the wood stock. I think made in 1984. It is very rare and I'm not sure if ever fired. There is not a mark on this. It's flawless and collector grade.

Inside all the engraving it says Safari on each side.

I have put a new w/box Leupold VX-1 3x9x40 scope, base and rings. It's not sighted in.

Comes with two boxes of ammo. I have $1350 in it, asking $1150

The other is a Browning A-Bolt II 30-06 Medallion. It has the shiny stock. It's a Miroku. I put a new w/box Leupold VX-II 3x9x40 scope, bases and rings on it. It has only less than 1 box of ammo through it from the previous owner. It is in perfect condition except for a couple of nicks in the front of the stock. I have never fired it myself.

Comes with one bag of ammo and an extra never used $50 magazine. I have $1050 in it. Asking $850

I have a Pre Ban Olympic Arms Car AR-15 for sale. With Stop Sign Stamp. Built in Olypia Washington U.S.A.... A little bit about this rifle. Most of this rifles assembly is M-16 built. 
Of course one part of the trigger assembly was changed to make it semi auto. I had it looked over at a few credible gun shops, in Carson City & Reno. It is legal. But barely. It has all the typical Pre Ban Accessories including the bayonet lug. With 3 positions on the selector switch. One safe two semi auto. It fires both .556 & .223 flawlessly. Comes with one grey 30 Rnd mag that reads .556 & one black 40 Rnd mag for .223. But both mags feed both types of ammo. I recently added a Brand new bolt assembly. With new extractor & firing pin. It also has multi select sites for day or night firing. I added a Fab Defense mag well grip which can be easily removed if it's not your thing. It has an SBS Barrel system. And retractable stock. The serial number comes back just months before the Ban. So this rifle is older. It was re-blued at some point before I purchased it. But the stop sign stamp, manufacturing stamp  & serial number are still legible. I've researched this rifle quite a bit. I've seen it for sale at prices ranging from $1200 to $2700. I am asking $1400. It's what I payed for it, minus the cost of the new parts. You must be a NV. Resident. With valid ID. At least 18 yrs old, & Non Felon. If you are not supposed to own a firearm. This deal is not for you. 

I do not need the money. I'm only posting it because I am more of an AK kinda guy. So I may be willing to trade. Just let me know what you've got. Values must Match. 

Also this is arms list, so people that know this site will understand this. If you think you can get this exact style rifle for cheaper. Please do. I'm not in the market for another like it, so I do not need to know about the great deal you found. If you actually want to strike a deal please feel free to contact me. 


Thanks for your time. Have a great day."

The light throughput across the entire zoom range of this riflescope is astounding. Hunting with this scope is almost like having a pair of aces up your sleeve at a poker game. 

This Habicht PV-N riflescope is a premium optic designed for the hunter who needs the additional light-transmission qualities of the larger objective. Remember, an increase in twilight performance can be the deciding factor in whether or not you bring home the bacon from your next hunting excursion. The variable 3-12x magnification will get you on target at close or long distances. 

The Habicht PV-N 3-12x50 is more than just another sighting system. It's an investment in optical excellence, and a commitment to successful hunting. 

- 0.36 MOA windage and elevation adjustments - 30mm main-tube is nitrogen purged for water, fog, & dust proof performance - Four point coil spring suspension ensure shock resistance with high caliber firearms - Patented zero setting system provides precision adjustment of impact point without tools - Micro-structure grooves prevent residual reflections inside the tube for bright contrasty images, even with back lighting. 

Swarovski Mounting Rail 

The innovative SR (Swarovski Rail) mounting rail system is available on select offerings within the Swarovski riflescope family. The integral fine-toothed rail prevents any movement of the riflescope, regardless of the caliber or recoil of your firearm. Two finely crafted mounting bases with matching teeth engage the rail on the underside of the riflescope for a stable, repeatable and dependable mounting solution. By eliminating the need for traditional mounting rings, the SR system eliminates unsightly & devastating gouge marks on your riflescope's main tube. In order to mount a Swarovski riflescope with an SR rail, you will need to purchase and install a slotted Weaver type rail or bases to your receiver. In addition, a pair of Swarovski Cross Slot Mount Bases must be employed in order to fit the scope to the firearm. This is a precision mounting system and as such it is recommended that a qualified gunsmith install the mounting bases to your receiver for a proper fit and perfect alignment with the axis of your bore. 

TDS-Plex Reticle 

The TDS-Plex reticle is a choice option for varminters and long-range hunters. Four medium length posts and fine cross hairs pull your eye directly to your point of aim. The lower portion of the vertical stadia is intersected by four stepped hash marks that assist the shooter in calculating bullet-drop compensation.

This rifle is from the time when Ruger used metal parts vs plastic parts used in rifles made today.  Purchase a Volquartsen target hammer for $35 and have a 2.5# trigger pull. Purchase price 14 years ago was $400.  Call or text REDACTED"
