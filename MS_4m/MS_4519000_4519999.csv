Firearm
Original case
5 round magazines-(2)

SA paddle holster
SA magazine double mag holder

This gun has a flat bolt as well as the original red Ruger recoil pad. The gun is a rescue, the previous owner had done a very bad job trying to shorten the rifle to 18"". When I received the rifle the barrel looked like it had been cut with an angle grinder. The barrel has since been re-cut and crowned with a full width 11 degree target crown. The barrel has been floated and the gun has been completely gone over and cleaned up. The barrel length currently sits right at 17"" if measured off the face of the receiver. The gun came with a 1:10 twist barrel from the factory and as it is pictured it shoots right around 3/4"" at 100 yards with 168 grain ammo. The scope is an older Redfield 3-9x40 that I've had lying around that I tossed onto the gun. The scope has some decent outer wear on it but it still holds a zero and tracks straight. I was ringing silhouette steel at 500 yards with the gun just two weekends ago.

Have a recently purchased hk416 22AR. Is equipped with a bushbell ar22 scope setting on a weaver 1in tactical mount. Great scope and clear glass. Also have a total of 4 twenty rd mags with deal. I took to shooters and ran 80 rounds thru it and no hiccups. Gun is as new as can be without paying taxes or transfer fees LOL. Its a great top of the line 22 that i just dont get to use. Dont have much time to get to outdoor ranges. Its on paper from shooting indoors but would need dialed in better for more distance. This is a real AR22, not a lightweight plastic piece like the mossberg or smith. This has a solid quad rail, dust cover, the hk style stock and is a heavy solid rifle.
Optic, mount, and mags are close to 300 alone. Great training rifle to cut cost and save ur 5.56 ammo. Will also throw in remainder of the high velocity brick of winchester 22 with trade."

There is a little by the muzzle and a little on the rear slide serrations and a few spots that could be buffed out. The other side is overall pretty good. The side pictured is the flawed side. 

I am the 2nd owner. The first guy bought it new in box and rarely ever shot it. I only shot a few hundred rounds through it and works like any other mak should. It's sighted in as well. Internally, it's still like new and the bore is nice and shiny. It's been protected with Eezox. It only comes with one mag. It's a great shooter with just a little cosmetic pitting."

You can see from the photos that this gun is in excellent shape.  It has less than 50 rounds through it.  Its slim, tiny profile makes it perfect for concealed carry.  It really does disappear in any pocket or purse.

You may be sure that this is actually a Gen-2 model of the LCP because there is no dash in the serial number of this gun.  The Gen-2 version of the LCP also has better sights and a new, vastly improved trigger which has a much shorter and lighter trigger pull than the original version of the LCP.  To enhance the grip on this small gun, I’ve added a Talon grip.

To further enhance this gun, I’ve installed a side-mounted red laser on it from LaserLyte.  The laser is easily removed if you don’t wish to use it.  You can remove the laser by replacing the mounting pins with the original frame pins which I am including with the gun.  The whole process takes no more than five minutes using allen-key tools (also provided) and it doesn’t require any gun-smith skills at all.  I’m a klutz and I did it quite easily.

Also includes a nice Remora holster for IWB carry and a Boraii trigger-cover holster for deep concealment pocket carry, factory lock with two keys, the 6-round mag supplied by Ruger (with flat floorplate and pinky extension floorplate) plus a second Ruger factory 6-round mag (also with flat floorplate and pinky extension floorplate), factory box and all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo). 

I prefer a face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

Cash only…sorry, I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers."

From the outside it looks just like an old vending machine. On the inside is a custom made gun cabinet. The old fluorescent backlight has been replaced with efficient LED strips that operate with a small remote control. On the inside there is more LED lights that are on a magnetic switch. The lights turn on as soon as you open the door and turn off when the door is closed. The inside cabinet of the machine is appx. 62” tall 35” wide and 17” deep. It will hold a lot of guns. It is actually wide enough to fit a AR15 long ways on the top shelf. The top shelf is ½” solid pine, not plywood, plenty sturdy enough to hold ammo and any other valuable gear you would like to store with your firearms. The small corner shelf is for shorter rifles like AK's and AR's and the underside of it can be used for ammo/gear storage also. There is also a large compartment with a removable cover at the bottom of the machine where the refrigeration used to be. It needs be used for bulk ammo storage or filled with sand bags to give the machine weight and keep it from getting top heavy. The cabinet is set up for and includes 8 Rifle Rods. Do a google search for them and you will see how they work, you can order more rods if needed from amazon, ebay ect. The outside of the machine is in original condition and is pretty good for its age but it is not perfect, it does have scratches from everyday use. It would look great in a garage, basement, game room or man cave The idea behind storing your firearms in an old vending machine is “hiding in plain sight” If a thief breaks into your house looking for valuables he is going to walk right past the Pepsi machine and look for the safe in the closet. asking $750 but will listen to offers.

Finish is in amazing shape overall.  There is some holster wear at the front of the muzzle, but otherwise nothing noticeable.
The gun is exceptionally accurate and reliable.  I was able to consistently hit a 12-inch plate at 50 yards off hand, which I attribute mostly to the very clear (but simple) sights.
I am selling the gun because I am somewhat recoil sensitive with small handguns, and while the blowback action makes the P-64 very reliable it does mean the recoil is higher.

Also included:
- 193 rounds of PPU 9mm Mak FMJ ammo.  I've used about another 200 rounds of this ammo without a single malfunction.  Because this was my carry gun, I regularly practiced rapid fire from concealed draw and +1 loading of the magazine.
- 2 factory 6-round magazines.
- Wolff spring kit (already installed), factory springs included.  Early on I replaced the recoil, hammer, and firing pin springs with lighter, higher-quality ones from Wolff.  If this concerns you, Google around about the spring kit.  It's a nice upgrade.  Included (but not pictured) are the three factory springs and two additional Wolff hammer springs (19 lb. and 20 lb.  The 18 lb. one is installed.  Factory is somewhere around 22 lb.)
- Basic Uncle Mike's pocket holster.  It's in good shape and fits the gun well.

Sorry about the picture quality.  The gun is a real looker in person, I promise.

Price is for face-to-face transaction at a location in the Cary area.  I must see and record CCW or pistol purchase permit and NCDL information.  If outside the area, add $40 for shipping and outgoing FFL transfer fee.

It also had surface rust under the grips. I contacted him with the pictures shortly after the deal, but he refuses to take the gun back. This leads me to believe he knew about the defects when selling.

It is 6-shot, stainless steel, with a 7.5"" barrel. I bought this gun new in 1983, and I still have the original box in perfect condition.  The gun has the original factory grips.

The Ruger Redhawk revolver was Ruger's first double-action revolver specifically designed for the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. It has many advanced features such as a triple-locking cylinder, a unique single-spring mechanism for lighter trigger pull, replaceable front sights and adjustable rear sights, with all-stainless steel construction.

The Redhawk is reinforced to handle extra stress, making it very popular for use by handloaders as it handles the hottest of magnum loads with ease.  This makes the Redhawk popular as a bear defense gun among hunters and trappers.

This Redhawk was fitted in the past with a Simmons Pro-Hunter 4 X 32 handgun scope, with a silver matte finish to match the gun.    It's waterproof, shockproof, fog-proof, and will easily stand up to the recoil of a .44 Magnum.  It has Weaver-style bases.   I have the original box and papers that came with the scope.

The included B-Square scope mount was made especially for the Ruger Redhawk and clamps firmly on the barrel.  It will not move under recoil.  The silver finish matches the gun and scope.

Two holsters are included in this package:   The Western-style holster and cartridge belt is made by El Paso Saddlery.  There are loops for 47 cartridges, and the holster is lined with suede leather to protect the gun finish.

A nylon shoulder holster is also included for the pistol with the scope mounted.  It is comfortable and supports the pistol for hunting and field carry.  There is also a zipper carrying case for the pistol.

I'm including 50 rounds of .44 magnum ammunition for practice and familiarity.  Do you think a .44 Magnum is too much gun for you?  Then shoot .44 Special ammo with much less recoil and noise.  The .44 Special recoil is negligible in this heavy gun.

This Ruger Redhawk package must be seen to be appreciated.  The pictures just don't do it justice.  Respond to this ad with your name and phone number and I'll call you so we can talk and make arrangements for you to see it.  You will not be disappointed."

This has to be one of the best custom jobs Ive seen in a while. If this were a .54cal... Id never let it go. But, alas, my collection does not include .50cal pieces and I just cannot get setup for a whole new caliber. 

I was very content when I rust blued mine, but this has been antiqued to an extreme. Very nice form of rust bluing, its lightly pitted, very uniformly across the entire surface, even the end cap and the belt clip are done the same way. 
It accents the dull brass and case colored lock very well.

Beyond that the grips has been fully hand checkered on this, the stained finish is not the best but it definitely rounds out the look on this one. Very nice.

Anyhow, I took it on a trade sight unseen thinking it was a .54. So away it goes. 

The bore looks good, fairly bright when I shine a light down it. But again, I dont shoot .50 so I dont have any jags or brushes for a .50cal. It looks free of any major rust or pitting. Im sure you can get some dirty patches out of it... but definitely looks like a nice shooter.

I can ship if needed, give me a zip code and Ill give you a price

You can see in the first picture it is much shorter than the Zouave and very much resembles the Enfield. However, the Enfield had a straighter stock and no patchbox.

Anyhow this is a cool little .58 carbine that while it may not get you into the reenactment world... it will be fun to shoot and will take any four legged game in the area. 

This gun has been refinished by a previous owner as well as having Thompson Center fiber optic sights installed. There are some scratches in the finish and the finish on the stock is in good shape.

This gun is the forerunner of the S&W model 6906 and has the bobbed hammer and an ambidextrous safety/decocker.  Mechanically and cosmetically it's in great condition. There is a downside to all of this-there is no box or manual and it only has one 12 round magazine. However, the 15 round mags from 59 series S&W autos will fit perfectly and aftermarket magazines up to 30 rounds are easy to find on Ebay and other sources.

This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See what you’re missing and pick up an XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size. It redefines what a polymer pistol can be.

This rifle was purchased new by myself less than a year ago and has had under 600rds through it. Cleaned after every session and well looked after. 

The rifle cycles all manner of .22LR rounds, subs to high velocity, without fuss and has been a joy to shoot. I've had a lot of interest in the rifle from fellow shooters every time I use the gun and it certainly seems a favourite for people to want to try out!

In addition to the standard M&P 15-22 MOE Flat Dark Earth Magpul furniture (grip, stock and MBUS sights) I've also added a Magpul AFG2 fore-grip, 16x XT Magpul rail covers, Magpul QD sling point and a Magpul MS4 1/2 piece sling all in FDE colour plus Atlas (BT-10 clone) quick release Bipod.

The rifle has an additional 3x 25rd std black magazines included along with the original FDE coloured 25rd mag. All function flawlessly.

The rifle will come with a Hawke 3-9x40 scope mounted on match rings in addition to a micro red dot (Docter style) mounted on a 45degree mount.. The scopes can both be removed in seconds.

Honestly, I've ummed and ahhed about selling this rifle as it truly fantastic fun. But, I need the cash so it's up and priced to go.  I am undercutting that by some margin AND you are getting hundreds of pounds worth of added extras. thanks for looking"

 This made in the USA knife is hair popping sharp and comes with a black leather sheath. This solid knife is a must for any outdoor enthusiast.

Specifications: 
Name: COLD STEEL Bush Ranger 
Steel Type: CARBON V 



Blade Length: 7.5 inches 
Weight: 8.8 ounces
Knife Length: 12.5
Sheath Material: Black Leather

Item Description:
The Bush Ranger fulfills a need for a light sheath knife that's large enough to be useful, yet small enough to wear on a belt every day. The flat ground blades curve continuously, allowing the blade to be used in a highly efficient draw cut as well as a chopping stroke.

Unlike most clip point knives made today, the Bush Ranger features a Sheffield point with an extra long false edge. The advantage of this point is that it is sharply acute for close, delicate work, yet sturdy enough to resist bending or breaking. The hilt of the Bush Ranger features a highly contoured cross section which resists the hand's backward movement (in response to centrifugal force) when chopping"
