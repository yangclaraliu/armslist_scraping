I inherited the Suzuki from my father a few years ago when he passed away.   I had the quad serviced (oil change and new battery) when I brought it here from Vermont, registered it, drove it a few miles, and it has sat in my garage since.  It currently does not start, and a rear tire has gone flat- I think it got a thorn in it while driving it on my property.  Because it doesn’t start, I’m selling it “as is”.  As you can see from the low mileage, it wasn’t used much (for hunting only), but the down side was my dad stored outside for some time, accounting for the rust on the metal, and the seat cover deteriorating.   The ATV, aside from the surface rust and seat cover, is in quite good condition.  The body is free of cracks & dents.  If you are mechanically inclined, this is quite a find.  I am looking to trade the ATV even up for a firearm.  Please tell me what you have to trade, I prefer “new in box” or “like new in box”, but am open to any rifle, shotgun or pistol.  Please let me know what you have, and I will trade when the right deal becomes available.  The ATV (and it’s owner) are NY residents, so the firearm will need to go through an FFL.   The NY DMV didn’t issue a title- (they said the registration will allow for legal ownership transfer) and a bill of sale will be included."

I'm selling my Taurus M85 revolver. It is chambered for .38 Special +P rounds. It's the Ultra Light version. I've shot maybe 150 rounds down range with it, and kept it clean regularly. 

I've bought a variety of holsters that come with it. Well over $100 worth. There are a 3 from N82 Tactical because I was working with them to have one custom made. 

Great deal for someone who wants a RELIABLE conceal carry revolver! Will shoot 100% of the time - I never had a single failure.

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.

This 870 Special Purpose Marine Magnum is rugged and specifically made to resist corrosion from both fresh and saltwater. The receiver and barrel, and all other metal parts are plated with Electroless nickel, and the black synthetic stock and fore-end are virtually indestructible, as well as impervious to water. It's a great self-defense shotgun to have on a boat or to carry while fishing in bear country. The 18-1/2"" barrel has a fixed cylinder choke for optimum performance with buckshot and slugs at close range. The extended magazine holds 6 rounds of either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shells, plus one in the chamber for a total of 7 rounds. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively. Comes with a sling and a durable, rubber recoil pad that dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target."

Up for sale or trade is a brand new in box VZ 2008 semi auto rifle chambered in 7.62x39mm.

This rifle features a 16"" threaded barrel that accepts all AKM muzzle devices, milled receiver, short stroke gas piston system, metal folding stock, two 30 round original surplus mags, Leather mag pouch & cleaning kit, and box.

2 factory length New barrels 9.9'' one has trunion one piece with barrel. the other has a slide on factory style but brand new trunion.
One complete tapco ak47 double hook trigger assmebly for semi auto build.
2 very nice 71 round drums and two 33 round stick mags.
1 complete mag well guide rails new nicely machined.
also build tools and gauges these were over $200.
1 semi auto bolt machined with machined spring guide rod. and unmodified 2 factory bolts. 
Set of build/blue prints for cclearance and measurements.

These kits are from Finland world war 2 era. have all the parts to build a complete gun as well as another just need to order a mag well parts kit. The other kit is just the bolt/spring lower receiver. If you were to buy all this online it would be close to 600 bucks.
These little 9mm carbines / smg's are going to be a very good investment for the future. Many states are banning parts kits so get them while you still can. Check your local laws all states are different. These kits are legal to send in the mail WITH OUT a FFL. Transfere due to the upper receivers needing to be cut with a dremel tool. I will post pictures soon. Please check all the laws I only go the legal route.
Thanks"

This Rifle Is Brand New, In Stock & Ready To Ship !

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds."

Material: Aluminum

Description:
The M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories.

Rifle Requirements: 
The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants.

Summary: 
My brother (US Army) intended to use this during his deployment to Afghanistan, but ended up using another quad-rail system instead. This is exactly what's issued to US troops with their M4 Carbines. Box and packaging have been opened, but rail and accessories have never been used and are in excellent condition.

It currently wears an elevation adjustable rear sight with a hooded front sight. I have very poor eyesight and have never shot an iron-sighted rifle well at all. My first three shots through this rifle went into a half-inch at 40 yards with fading daylight. It shot so well with the open sights that I never ended up putting a scope on it. It will accept scope mounts, however. The rear base will fit onto two drilled-and-tapped holes in the receiver ring, while the front base should fit into the place currently filled with the rear sight.

The stock has great figure, with the straight grain having prominent regions of light and dark. This straight grain also makes the stock as strong as possible. The checkering is well-done, as is the rosewood end-cap. The monte-carlo cheekpiece places my eyes in just the right place to use the open sights, either shooting left or right handed. The trigger has no discernible creep, and breaks like glass. It is the best trigger that I have ever felt on a rifle.

The only things that keep this rifle from being in completely mint condition are:
•	There are a few minor and small indentations in the stock. These are all very small and do not go through the finish at all; they merely make a slight dimple in the gloss finish.
•	The buttpad is worn. If you need a soft and pliable buttpad, you will want to place a new pad on it. I used a slip-on Pachmyr decelerator pad for a few shots, and it fit well. I ended up taking it off though, as I found recoil with this rifle to be a non-issue.
•	There is a small chip and slight discoloration on the bottom of the gripcap. Again, this is only cosmetic, but I wanted to mention it.

This rifle is a very cool concept. It is only about 41.5” long, despite having a 24” barrel. This is about 3” shorter than most bolt actions. The principle is similar to the straight-pull Blasers and the Merkel KR1. The bolt sits on a rail system, with a receiver piece integral with the bolt body. This entire assembly moves rearward when you pull the bolt back. This rail system allows you to fit a long action cartridge like a 30-06 into a short (308) length action. Additionally, the magazine is moved from the more traditional location in front of the trigger-guard to directly above the trigger. This saves a couple of inches in rifle length for a given barrel length.

This action cycles smooth and feels like it locks up like a bank vault. Despite being very strongly built, it weighs only about 7.4 pounds in its present configuration. This would make a great hunting rifle, as it is strong, accurate, and compact. If you would like more images or images of a specific spot, let me know and I will email them to you. This is one of the most interesting and innovative rifle designs that I have ever seen.

I am happy to ship the rifle to your local FFL, but the buyer will be responsible for all shipping and FFL costs. Additionally, if your FFL does not accept transfers from individuals, add $40 for me to cover my FFL's fee."

The gun has a Hogue grip that makes it feel great to hold and I imagine it would help with the power of the .308 round being fired. I have the one factory mag, and I have added 3 MOE P-mags, one is a 25 round mag with window, the other two are 20 rd pmags. The gun has its original factory box with papers and I bought a case for it. On top of this gun sits a brand new Eotech 552 chambered specifically for the .308 rifles. It is the Eotech optic made to be used on AR-10s, plus behind the Eotech is a factory Eotech G33 3xpower magnifier. Both optics come with all of their original packaging and box with paperwork. I have a receipt showing where I paid $600 a month or so ago for the primary optic. I may be forgetting something, but with 11 boxes of PMC brand FMJ ammo, I have $2575 in this gun and the optics. I am looking to trade for a Colt LE901 AR10, or perhaps other guns. I will sell the whole package as listed for $2400, or will split up, selling the gun itself for $1400 with the MOE add ons still on it. Again, the add ons are on the gun and the original parts are in the packaging for the add ons. I have all of it. Serious inquiries only please toward legit trade offers or cash.

In perfect condition, no scratches, with the rear sight aperture complete and the front sight inserts as well. The forearm adjuster is missing, and so is the rear swivel.
Reason for selling is that I have several .22s that are lighter and are suiting me better in the woods.
The barrel is in A+ condition, 27"" heavy target,and the wood is gorgeous. Bluing is intact, and there are no drilled holes. I was able to get a 3"" group at 100 yards, on a calm day. The gun can do better, in the right hands.
I am asking 290 + shipping to your FFL, and if I get the asking price(or close to it) I will include the scope on it as well.
Local sales FTF, no dealer transaction required for PA residents that meet the criteria for purchasing firearms.
More pics coming today, the Mossberg is the rifle on the top. The other two rifles are for comparison purposes only(yes, the bottom one is a MS420B).
