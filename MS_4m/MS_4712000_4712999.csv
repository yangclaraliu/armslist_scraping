A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle. From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil. Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

Doesn't get much use and only has a few hundred rounds through it. I bought it last year. It comes with only 1 choke. That would be an extra full turkey choke. Also comes with 1 box of #2 shot steel and a shoulder sling. I'm looking to get $500 or best offer. Thank you

Please, Please do not contact me trying to sell a $500 pistol (new) for $500 just because you've bought some ammo and a holster for it. A pistol loses value like a car. Open to all considerations and this is time sensitive as hunting season approaches so I will bite given the right deal.

I value used guns at 60% of MSRP if they are under 500rds and come with all factory packaged items. I may go up to 75% of MSRP if the gun comes with night sights, ammo, or a holster. Thanks for the consideration."

$1,280 firm in cash or $1,400 in trade. The only site I found that still has this rifle in stock is selling them for $1,300 + any shipping and FFL fees and that is with the plastic forend. I might have a set of MagPul flip sites somewhere that I can add for $40 more, if interested.

Not really looking for any trades now, but might consider, depending on what it is and the deal, so please be specific on the offer. I am mostly into semi-autos, but might consider other firearms as well. If the trade offer is not a good deal for me, I will not be interested in trading.

Description:
HK VP9 Semi-automatic 9MM 4.09 Polymer Black 15Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Night Sights 700009LE-A5 - The VP9 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. All controls are completely ambidextrous, slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and magazine release can be easily activated by left or right handed shooters. Pistol features an extended Picatinny MIL-STD 1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The VP9 uses the proven P30 steel magazine, with 15 or 10 round capacity. The trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Shooter has a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. This model ships with 3 magazines.

It is a high quality Ruger P-series pistol, with a polymer frame, and a DA/SA trigger design. It does have the decocker safety feature. This pistol has been highly acclaimed all over reputable firearms blogs, and the reviews of this pistol are outstanding regarding it's accuracy, reliability, and functionality. It comes with all the originals...manual, trigger lock, case and two 8 round magazines. I also will include the Bagmaster black holster that will hold the pistol and an additional magazine. This has been a gently used, and amazingly maintained pistol. I have owned it for about 5 years, and have put less than 500 rounds down the barrel. This is an awesome pistol, and I have a ton of ammo for it...both plinking and self defense ammo if you're interested. I can send more photos of both the gun and the ammo. No trades please, and serious offers only. Thanks!"

The D2 Steel is as good as my Benchmades, if not better. This one is a beauty and weighs over a pound at 1/4"" thick. Survival, Bushcraft, or whatever you throw at it, it will get the job done. I have a similar one with a drop point blade that I have used to teach my kids bushcraft skills and it holds an edge like I have never seen before and is tough as nails. You can literally chop a small tree down with this knife and it will like it. I bought this one on a whim, and have never used or sharpened it. Still has factory razor edge and while the edge could use a little tuning, it will certainly shave hair off your arm as-is. You won't find a better knife anywhere near this price range. There are two small scratches on the micarta on the right side, but they are purely cosmetic and could probably be rubbed out. Any smudges shown up in pic on blade just wipe away. It has a mirror polish on it.
