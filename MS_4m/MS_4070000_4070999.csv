This is what I took directly off of Cabela's website. The rifle is approximately 2 months old with about 300 rounds through it. I'm asking 400.00 price will include 400 rounds of cci and federal ammo, basic bsa red dot scope, and multi position adjustable forehand grip with storage in the handle,  boresighter and a Ruger 10/22 soft case. I am very firm on the price because it was a gift and I'd rather not see it go but I could use the cash in better ways for right now.  Prefer text but can call REDACTED"

*** PRICE IS FIRM *** HOWEVER: I am open to trades. ***
I recently acquired this optic, and let me tell you, it is one of my favorite sights. However, it is to long range for my uses. The glass quality is unreal. However, I cannot justify having an expensive optic like this sitting around not mounted. This ACOG is worth a pretty penny, if you know anything about firearms, you know about this. Please don't low ball me. I will not sell, I'm not trying to be rude, it just wastes both of our time. 

I know the Trijicon website lists these for $1.5k, but I also know you can find them cheaper. I have also seen them as low as $900. But please, do not be confused. A $900 ""new"" ACOG doesn't exist. If you ""have a guy"" or ""you can get them"" fine. Do it that way...don't tell me. They are realistically 1.2-1.3k plus tax and shipping from a LEGIT official dealer. Not some shady website selling the model from 3 years ago.

If you have an questions, shoot me an email. This optic has only 100rds shot while having it mounted. And it has all the paperwork ."

Winchester Model 1912: serial # 118,848 – manufactured in 1914 according to the Cody Polishing Room Records. It is an early gun with the last patent date of July, 22 1913. The barrel is marked Nickel Steel, there is no chamber length stamping, consistent with an early gun. It is numbers matching, with the serial number found on both halves. 12 gauge, 2 ¾” chamber with a full choke 30” barrel. Mechanically sound with a super smooth action that just about pumps itself! The bore is bright & shiny, it functions correctly & safely, the take-down feature works properly & is tight at the halves. There is lots of bluing remaining, turning Patina. There are no rust issues, no dings or dents, just handling marks & some minor pin head pitting. The stocks are walnut; “corn-cob” pump handle, the butt stock is fluted, has a pistol grip, hard rubber butt plate, the LOP is 12 5/8”. There is a repaired hairline crack at the wrist, no movement & it is seen only upon up-close inspection. The stocks have minor handling marks, very nice for a 101 year old gun! Winchester Model 1912 – Nickel Steel – still ready for the field or the range!"

I bought this rifle about a month ago. I've only put about 40 rounds through it, and it shoots great. Last week we went out and were shooting 12oz. soda cans with it at 300 yards, you can take that however you'd like. Its a Ruger American Predator .308 18"" threaded barrel.
* AAC 51T 2 chamber muzzle brake (the brake takes up all the recoil and makes it really fun to shoot, the only downside is it also makes it extremely loud)
* The scope IS NOT INCLUDED; the scope and rings are another $500 if you want them (its a Vortex Viper HS 4-16x50mm scope with V-plex reticle and Vortex rings)
* Caldwell bipod 9"" model 
* The case is included its a Timber Ridge 42"" (it was meant to hold 2 ar15s but this rifle fits in it just perfectly). 
Overall I have over $750 into this rifle and all the accessories, I'm asking $600 because it's like new, I still have the box for the rifle and I have the package and timing washers for the brake. I would like to keep this rifle as a package with everything, but if you would rather I will sell the brake separate. Hate to get rid of, but vehicle problems don't allow me to keep it.

Savage Model 110 chambered in .308 Winchester with a 22” tapered “no sights” barrel & a real wood stock. The rifle is in excellent condition both cosmetically and mechanically, it obviously has seen very little use. The bore is excellent; bright & shiny with no frosting, the bolt face & chamber area are clean & the action is as smooth as silk. The bluing is bright & shiny, deep & rich showing no wear with only minor handling marks. The stock is checkered with a pistol grip, has a high comb, sling studs & a factory installed recoil pad. The stock is in excellent condition, no cracks or repairs just minor handling marks. Topped off with a FREE scope; Simmons 3x9 with duplex crosshairs & an adjustable eye relief. It is crystal clear & it is hard to beat free. Nice low mileage hunting rifle chambered in .308, a great hunting round. The Model 110 is a great shooting rifle & is a good “bang for the buck” & this one has real bluing & a real wood stock."

    Patented One-Piece Bolt Carrier (Nibx and low mass)
    XLP Multi-Adjustable Low Profile Gas Block
    Gas Plug
    Upper Receiver Bushing (you will need one of these if your upper is not adams arms brand)
    Bushing Installation Rod
    Bolt Spring
    Drive Rod with Bushing and Spring
    Installation DVD

The Adams Arms Piston System:

    A short stroke free floating piston system.
    Is Self-Cleaning.
    Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator.
    Corrosive resistant coating processes.
    Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel.
    Adjustable gas settings for various applications.
    Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire.

This system requires a pistol gas length (4.846"" from barrel extension to shoulder) and a .750"" gas seat.

We recommend using a standard barrel nut or barrel nut with similar measurements for proper fit and function of the kit. Many aftermarket proprietary barrel nuts do not offer the clearance for the drive rod or proper seating of the spring and bushing."

I purchased it last year, and put about 50 rounds through it this season. No issues with it at all -- I am selling it only because I have issues in colder weather with my dominant thumb (it's been dislocated several times) and the safety. Otherwise, I fully intended on shooting it for the foreseeable future.

Gun is VERY clean and well taken care of. My best estimate is >90% and closer to 95%. I contacted Mossberg when I purchased it (used) last year, and it was manufactured in 2012 -- so as the years go by, Mossy seems to be making strides with the 935s.

I will have pics within a day or so; please message me with requests. As stated, I am not shipping this gun, so local sales only. If you are located on the I-94 corridor between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, that may be an option. I plan on making a trip down there in the next month.

This model is fairly rare and desirable. It was only cataloged for one year in 2005. It's a synthetic stocked stainless action with a heavy contour 22"" fluted stainless fluted barrel with a factory adjustable muzzle brake. This is a small shank action/barrel. It's got the Accutrigger and the detachable stainless magazine. It also has a silver Barska 3-9x40 on it.

The rifle is in very nice condition.  The gentleman I bought it from shot about 100 rounds out of it.  I had planned on doing a RH build but decided against it as I think tearing this rifle down would be a mistake. Again, this is not the Trophy XP package model which has a lot of plastic in place of metal. I am interested trading for LH Savage bolt action rifles, and Model 16 or 116 left hand would be at the top of the list although any Savage 10/110 variants in LH would be entertained, maybe with some cash on your part depending on what you have.  Not really interested in any RH trades other than Marlin XLRs or big bore Winchester 94 AEs

 This is Crimson Trace Information: 
 Green just got good™. Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light."

Testing the waters: For sale/trade 

Sphinx SDP Subcompact. DA/SA NIB never fired. I purchased this along side my Sphinx SDP compact and find I like the compact much better. This is a stock photo, will post the real deal later. It's a double stack 9mm 13 round capacity. Comes with box, manual, cleaning kit, lock, 2 mags. I'm not set on getting rid of it, but if something interests me maybe. It's about the size of a S&W shield, but a bit thicker.

For those that don't know Sphinx has been around since 1879 making Swiss precision firearms. Their more familiar weapons include the Sphinx AT 2000 and 3000 pistols. These pistols are made to the highest standards using hand crafted parts and fitted by a master gunsmith. Special operations units (including the Swiss nuclear guards) are now utilizing the Sphinx SDP Compact, and Subcompact line of pistols. This firearms are among some of the highest quality firearms available. 

Interests include (no particular order) RMR glock 19, HK's in 9mm and .45 ONLY, SIGs in 9mm and .45 ONLY, Walther's, multi gun trades, guns + cash. No hi points, sigmas, jiminez, cars, motor cycles, etc. etc. Stick to the list. The only long gun I am interested in is a BCM Jack Carbine (clearly a different deal would need to be made)

Please keep in mind, this pistol is NEW IN BOX UNFIRED, meaning 0 rounds been fired by me at all. Factory testing only. Very few of these have trickled into the states so price is fairly firm. Thanks for looking."

This has the black stock with the gray spiderweb running through it.
It is topped with a Leupold VX3 4.5-14x40 with Adjustable Objective, target turret style knobs, Butler Creek scope covers and sun shade. Also included is a Harris swivel bipod.

According to the Leupold rep I spoke with, this scope is the tactical ""black ring"" variation that was manufactured for only one year in 1999.
