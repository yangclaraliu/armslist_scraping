After personally carrying some of the most popular IWB's on the market, we understood why so many people felt the same way. After collecting the proverbial box of holsters, we decided enough was enough and started working on our own holster design. We introduced our Original holster in October of 2009 and since then, thousands of people (some skeptically at first) have enjoyed the opportunity to not only be comforted by carrying a concealed firearm, but learned that you could truly carry all day comfortably. With Nate Squared Tactical, comfort is a reality, NOT JUST A SLOGAN.COMFORTComfort was our biggest motivation in the design of our unique holsters. Each Series of Nate Squared Tactical holsters are made from quality oil-tanned leather, neoprene, and suede leather. Each holster is hand crafted to ensure the highest quality possible. We firmly stand behind the quality & craftsmanship of every holster we build.- The oil-tanned leather will provide a durable, yet safe contact for the handgun.- The soft suede backing allows your skin to breathe, so even when you sweat against the holster, it will still feel cool. - The natural friction coefficient of suede displaces a percentage of the weight of your firearm. This allows you to carry the firearm without it's total weight pulling down against your waistband. It is the suede that allows us to utilize a design with a single clip.- Neoprene is sandwiched between the oil-tanned leather and the suede leather. The neoprene provides the padding to protect you from the various edges of the firearm (slide, rear sight, hammer, beavertail, etc.) even when sitting in a vehicle, but also protects your investment. Neoprene (what wetsuits are made of) is waterproof, creating a moisture barrier that will not allow sweat or skin acids to come in contact with your handgun."

Please contact me with the make and model of your handgun and we will select the right holster to fit your handgunWHAT IS A STICKY HOLSTER?Our original holsters are IWB (In the waist band) holsters for concealed carry. The smaller sizes also work well for in the pocket use. The construction of the holster uses the pressure from your clothing waistband to secure both the holster and the gun. They don’t come with clips or loops to secure it in place, as the outer “sticky” skin adheres to your waistband, undergarments and/or your skin. Since our inception, we have developed these holsters into a modular system, where you can use it IWB, in the pocket, on your ankle using our ankle rig and for police officers, on their tactical/armored vest, using our B.U.G. Pad.HOW DOES IT WORK?The outside skin is a super non-slip material that, with a little pressure, adheres to just about anything. That outer material combined with the inner closed-cell foam and the inner liner keep your pistol and the holster securely in place. In the pocket, it works like any other pocket holster. However, when you pull the gun, the outer layer grabs the inside of your pocket. Our modular products use the same “Sticky” material against itself to hold the holster and gun in place. In addition, with use and body heat, your Sticky Holster will conform to your particular gun, making a custom fit."

Nothing wrong with it but I finally decided to upgrade to a Forster COAX press after wanting one for almost 20 years.

 I am the second owner. The original owner rarely used it. He bought it in the late 1970's so it is one of the better made ones. The press is capable of loading rounds in the .001"" - .003"" concentricity range if you have high quality dies so the ram is perpendicular to the die port. All the joints are tight and show no signs of wear.

 It has the spent primer catcher and the small and large primer seater. I believe the seaters may be replacements that I put on when I was given the press.

I am the second owner and fired around 300 shots through it. The first owner fired around 200 shots through it. 

It is in pretty good condition all around. The frame has some light illegible engravings on the slide that is somewhat hard to notice if you aren't looking for it. The night sights have some dings caused when I (idiotically) installed them with a steel punch (they are aligned and function great though with plenty of life left in them; roughly 6 months old). No original case or documents.

It was originally a Variant 7 with a LEM kit installed, but I converted it to a Variant 1 (DA/SA with manual safety and decocker). I also added night sights and an extended magazine release. The hammer was swapped out with a bobbed hammer.

All together you will get:
- HK USP Compact .40
- Meprolight Night Sights (already installed)
- Extended Magazine Release (already installed; the original release is included too)
- Bobbed Hammer (installed; the original, spurred hammer will also be included)
- LEM Kit (uninstalled; all necessary parts to convert it are included)
- 2x 10-round magazines (both OEM, one with a finger extension, one without)
- 4x 12-round magazines (all OEM and with the finger extension)
- Custom Leather Holster
- Box of 50 Hornady Critical Defense ammo
- 20x Hornady Critical Defense Ammo (loose)
- Around 500-700 loose rounds of LAX Reloaded ammo in a plastic 50cal (MTM) ammo can
- 20x B27 Silhouette paper targets

I don't know the exact number of ammunition included. If you're REALLY on the fence about buying it and want to know the exact amount, I can get that for you.

Price is $500. Cash only, no trades. I'll drive to an FFL of your choice, but I'm not willing to drive hours away (so keep it within half-an-hour to forty-five minutes). You must pay all the transfer fees. 

It may be possible to ship it to your FFL if you aren't local, but the price would remain at $500 + shipping and the ammo would not be included. Payment would be through a money order/cashier's check (no personal checks).

Let me know if you have any questions."

One of the most sought after and collected AK's! These were arguably the first Chinese AK's imported into the US, around the 1983-1984 time frame. Exact number imported is not known. The majority of these Clayco AKS’ get bought by collectors and become a safe queen, never to be shot. This one was a shooter and has developed a wonderful patina over the years. 

The story goes China wanted to compete in the US ‘Black Gun’ market, so they came out with this AK with the bakelite furniture. The bakelite looks black, but once in the sunlight it’s actually a dark forest green.

Clayco Sports AKS Underfolder – Numbers Matching
Chinese Bayonet (Not Serialized – Same Bakelite as the AK)

Hey all, 
	Well, I have decided on another rifle i want to pick up another project. In the end, I plan on having a 458 SOCOM setup (rifle) with a 5.56 with 1:8 twist as the alternative setup. So, here is what I’m looking for. 

-AR15 chambered in 5.56/.223 with 1:8 twist
	Must be all metal upper and lower
	Must have dust cover/forward assist
	Must be in good condition
	Preferably a factory build (unless its a really really great deal)
-458 SOCOM complete rifle length upper assembly
	Flat top (unless a really good deal)
	Preferably factory assembled/complete (unless a real good deal)

	So, Im not unreasonable about what they are going for, or on values. I have cash in hand and will pay a fair price. However, Keep in mind that currently I can order a complete flat top, factory built, 458 socom upper assembly for just under $500 to my door. And I can get a Ruger AR556 for just less than 600 brand new. So, I’m not saying I wouldn’t pay more for other brands, accessories, models, etc, but please be reasonable on your values. Like i said, il pay more for extras, ammo, better models, etc. But I want to stay in that price range unless I’m really “in love” with it. Optics, coatings, etc are not really important as i will be customizing it myself anyways. Need to be able to meet up in Norman or close to if possible, but again, il travel farther for a better deal. Shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here if you have an offer. i have various trade items and cash in hand. 

Thanks for your time and happy hunting,
