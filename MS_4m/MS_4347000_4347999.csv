I purchased this gun brand new a few months ago from a gun store for $620. I only shot 1 box (20 rounds) of Hornady defensive carry ammo through it (it's the only ammo the range had) and cleaned it after. I purchased a pair of Pearl grips for it that are currently on the gun, but have the factory ivory ones that I am including. I am also including a box of 50, 225 grain jacketed soft point Federal American Eagle rounds. It's great stuff for defense or hunting. I will give a $30 discount to you if you don't want the ammo.

I'm selling this gun because I'm really not a revolver guy and there are a million other guns I would rather have. My friend showed this to me on the store and sweet talked me into getting it, which isn't hard to do because it is very beautiful, but it's just not my style.

Yes this rifle does have the X pro mark trigger that was recalled by Remington, and yes I have had it serviced by the aforementioned and she is good to go (took months to get her back from Remington.)

Model: ""Witness Steel Full-size Pistol""

WITNESS DESCRIPTION:

The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. 

You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you're a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA.

The gong measures about 8 inches and it needs some repainting, but it is still good and really great to shoot. It's really nice to get instant feedback on your long range hits. It has had two bullets punch through it because of short range firing from a high-powered rifle, so I do recommend that you shoot this gong from 100 yds or farther. It comes complete with stand, chains, hooks, stakes, and pins. It sets up in less than a minute and can be broken down and put away in a gym bag for easier transport."

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.
Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

	Hey all, 
I have a classic Hunting rifle for sale. This is a Remington 742 Woodsmaster chamber in the hard hitting 30-06 Springfield. This will come with sling mounts installed and a little bit of AMA ammunition. This is already tapped for a scope mount and i ready for you to get a scope setup mounted on it and sighted in with plenty of time before hunting season! I would keep this for myself, but I just picked up a 308 and would prefer to have something else. This is in good overall condition and actually even has the internal plastic “dust cover” on the bolt that most of these do not have any longer (this one is cracked, but still present and functional). Needs a good deep cleaning. Has normal ""sat In a Safe a while"" light spot rusting in the barrel and elsewhere, but would clear easily with scrubber or by shooting it once. Haha. Need to meet up in norman on this if possible. 
	I am wide open for trades on this. Preferably no 22’s, blackpowders, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor. (I already have plenty of these that I do not shoot enough haha). Mostly interested in semi auto rifles, certain lever rifles, semi-auto pistols, compact revolvers and boot, PF9 and boot, DB9 and boot, compact 45s, 1911’s in 45. Would trade with a little boot for certain ARs, AK pistols, AKs, PMR30s, etc. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Model 870™ Express® Combos
OVERVIEW:

Model 870 Express Combo packages are available in both 12- and 20-gauge: a 26-inch vent rib barrel with Modified Rem™ Choke tube and a 20-inch fully rifled, rear-sighted deer barrel.

This affordable pump-action combo is a perfect fit for the smaller shooter. Designed with the same durability and reliability as the legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, this quick-pointing 20-gauge provides rifle-like accuracy with its 20-inch fully rifled barrel with rifle sights, especially when combined with our Premier® Core-Lokt® Ultra Bonded Sabot Slugs or Buckhammer™ Lead Slugs. And the 21-inch vent rib Rem™ Choke barrel with Modified choke tube and bead sight is perfect for small game hunting or clay target shooting.

Both the fore-end and stock are crafted from a durable, weatherproof synthetic material to compliment the non-reflective matte metal finish. The 1-inch shorter stock also includes a solid rubber recoil pad. And like every other Model 870 shotgun, you get twin action bars for smooth cycling and a receiver machined from a solid block of hardened steel for unmatched durability.

KEY FEATURES:

Receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for strength and durability
Twin action bars ensure smooth, reliable non-binding action
Legendary pointability and accuracy

I want to derail any confusion the caliber is not the more popular 38 special caliber but it's a 38 smith & Wesson caliber round. I have 150-160 rounds ammunition to add to the transaction. Buyer is responsible for all transfer/DROS fees. Must be at a local gun store for transfer. $350 or best offer for the gun and ammo. Also please no trades and I have more pics I can text."

Just 6 months ago I upgraded the guide rod to a stainless steel rounded top one, replaced the recoil spring with a extra power spring and added the stippled grip extension with +1 round capacity. The feed lip of this gun has been polished to a mirror finish. These upgrades and polishing make the gun extra reliable for concealed carry.

Hey guys and gals,
I have for sale or trade a in like new condition and it's been used twice a warn m6000 SDP (short drum portable) winch. Looking to trade for a bigger more of a permanently mounted winch for my winch bumper , I will add cash for the right deal , It comes with the 12' wired remote , quick connector . Basically everything that originally came with it except for the manual , it works great and flawlessly ! She fits right into a 2"" receiver. I will not ship , looking for local pickup. Let me know what you have ! And no I'm not interested in a harbor freight winch or of such quality lol


Thanks for looking
