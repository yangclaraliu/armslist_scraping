The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Size & FeaturesWith an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

A cherry Wingmaster manufactured in 1984, which I would rate at NRA Very Good to Excellent (see http://www.armsbid.com/nra-conditions-standards.cfm#). I don’t know about the new ones, but these older models have and action that is smooth as silk. And in the 870 platform it will fit a variety of tactical and hunting accessories such as barrels and magazine extenders. Tube magazine is not plugged, and fits 4 + 1, 2 and 3/4-inch shells. Presently configured with a slug barrel with a white-dot front sight, and a white-arrow rear sight that’s adjustable for windage and elevation. I will also throw in a new-in-box magazine extender, which ups the tube's capacity to 8 rounds.

Equinox is a limited production .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER® Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox features gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."

I have included a picture of what this looks like. When you charge the weapon vigorously to load a round into the chamber the hammer can fall to half cock. I have read that it is a sear issue/spring issue but I'm too nervous to use it in fear of an accidental discharge until the issue is fixed. I also recommend that you have it worked on before you shoot it. This issue only happens when charging the weapon IF it ever does.

Now! I really hate to put this up. It's the most beautiful 1911 I've ever owned. What we have here is a Smith and Wesson 1911 PD scandium framed 1911. I've had a wilson ambi safety installed and it comes with a wilson extended slide release. It locks up nice and tight! The fit and finish is great. It's a great shooter! I've put maybe 200 rounds through it myself with no problems. I've carried it a little bit. It's a lot lighter than a typical 1911. Like with any 1911 it's a dream to shoot. They do not make these 1911's anymore sadly. 

I have a Wilson combat mag, the factory magazines that came with it, original box and a chip Mcormick magazine, I can add cash depending on the deal. I don't expect to get anything crazy like 1000$ for this. Just be reasonable with me and at least know what you're doing with a 1911 please. I'm in no hurry to get rid of this thing. Just seeing what's out there. Thanks for looking friends! I'm able to drive a bit to meet up as well if you are serious in the weapon."

The gun came with one version 2 mag and one version 1 mag.  The other three are version 1 that I bought from Frontier Justice.

I like the steel and the wood, but she is just a little too big for most of the kydex holsters available in local stores.       I'm keeping the original box it came in."

Here are the specs from the Manf website.
Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1:7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92 it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty) private security forces and responsible citizens. The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty. Magazine Capacity: 12 rounds Frame Finish: Black fiberglass reinforced technopolym Caliber: .40 S&W Slide Finish: bruniton coated steel Magazines Included: 2 Safety: Ambidextrous Safety/Decocker spring lo Sights: 3-dot sight system Grips: interchangeable checkered backstraps Action: Double/Single Weight: 27.7 oz

I'm willing to negotiate the price a little, but considering I'm adding two holsters (both around $20-30), I figure $420 is a solid price. No lowball offers, I'm not NEEDING to sale, just have too many guns now.

This gun has only been fired about 2 or 3 times in the indoor range in Ogden. It's in excellent condition and has been used as a home defense weapon, stored bed-side. I may have the owner's manual, but if not it can easily be accessed on Beretta's website. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.

Not sure what year it is, but upon research they have good reviews despite thr fact thats its not a Kimber or Glock- these little guns shoot very accurately. They are very small(perfect for a concealed carry firearm). Its made in the USA, very well built, and functions great. I haven't shot it in a year or so so it could use some oil and a good cleaning.

Carbine length gas systems are OK, but were not designed for a 16” carbine barrel. They were designed for 10.5-12” suppressed applications. They create more FELT recoil, and more wear & tear on the internal parts.

This rifle has a Midlength gas system, which creates a longer lasting and smoother running rifle. 

For $625, you get a LOT of rifle!!!

Only shot 100 rounds.  This is the civilian model of the classic M14 battle rifle.  This is the standard model which features a 22” barrel, 2-stage military trigger, and a walnut wood stock.  A vast array of aftermarket accessories make these rifles fully customizable.

  If your collection lacks a powerful rifle chambered in 7.62x51 ( 308 Winchester or 7.62 NATO) then you need to fill that gap.  And if you already have a rifle like a FAL, HK91, SCAR or other foreign design, you need to get an M1A!  Still in use by our troops in foreign conflicts due to the impact this hard-hitting round makes at distances out to 800 yards and beyond.  If you are looking at this, chances are you already know what you are looking for.

Great carry piece, dimensions almost identical to the Springfield XDS. The gun is slim and I mean extremely slim! This model has the burnt bronze slide from the factory that is a real head turner. A very unique trigger on this gun, it's striker fired but the trigger pull is different than say a glock with no wall to break at the end. Just a smooth consistent pull that drops off at the end smooth as can be. Imagine a double action pull without the heavy weight. 

Great little gun that packs a hell of a punch. Extremely easy to conceal and with up to 8 rounds of 45 you can't beat it. Comes with 3 mags. One Kahr factory mag at 6 rounds. 2 Kimber 1911 officer mags that carry 7 rounds. These mags fit more flush than the factory mags and add a extra round. No issues with the mags after about 300 rounds. Gun was new when I got it. Been to the range about 3 times."

The bow has very little use but the string probably needs wax. The arrows have only been fired a few times each. I got the kit last year thinking I'd pick up a new hobby but it didn't pan out. Now I'm moving to SE Asia and need to get rid of everything.

Setup and ready to go.  Fired 40 times to sight in.  Has tons of extras.  If you are wanting a modern Whitetail, Hog, or large game rifle,  this is your gun!  First research Daniel Defense rifles and watch their tourcher tests on their guns on you-tube.  I will paste the specs below but the video's show how awesome these guns truly are.  Ambush Arms are the same guns, only geared and setup with hunters in mind.  
No longer do you have to compromise weight for takedown power, now you can have both.   Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, the Ambush 6.8 SPCII is not only lightweight, it’s modular, utilizing a Picatinny Rail system, and adjustable buttstock.

The Ambush Firearms 6.8 SPCII hunting rifle features an 18” S2W® profile, Cold Hammer Forged barrel.  The chamber and rifling are created at the same time for the most precise alignment of the chamber to bore possible.  Cold Hammer Forging alters the steel at a molecular level creating the most accurate, longest lasting barrels available.  The barrels are Salt Bath Nitride treated, giving the steel the corrosion and abrasion resistance to stand up season after season.  The Ambush Firearms 6.8 SPCII features a threaded muzzle allowing the installation of a sound suppressor or other muzzle device.

Protecting the barrel is the free-floating MFR 12.0 (Modular Float Rail) with adjustable shotgun-inspired hand grip which is exclusive to Ambush Firearms.  The top of the handgaurd features a continuous picatinny rail for attaching optics and sights.  Included are three 3-Inch modular rail sections for mounting accessories.  These modular rail sections can be easily moved anywhere on the hanguard or removed completely.

Every sportsman has a duty to make clean shots on their game and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger, gives the shooter an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  (Geissele SSA® has a total pull weight of 4.5 lb, 2.5 lb on the first stage and 2 lb on the second stage).   

Ambush Firearms Hunting rifles are available 2 finishes: Black and REALTREE AP®.

I have owned this for over 18 months and was planning on building a suppressed rifle out of it but funds never worked out. I have never shot it and don't remember the person I bought it from saying he did. It might be brand new but I listed it used just in case. I have the previous owners contact information also if you would want that. I have added Troy fixed iron sights which I can sell with it if wanted. I'm asking $850 without sights, $950 with them.

It was taken off with steel wool but most of the blurring is gone from just that area. The rest of the gun is in excellent condition. Prefer a FTF transaction."
