Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Century's semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel.

But holy hell, why in the blue-fire f**k did some ass-ape at Sig Sauer develope this round (freaking GERMAN's!!!)?  I understand the termial ballistics, I like the fact that it has as much kinetic energy as a charging hippo, but DAYUM.  I honestly believe that Law Enforcement isn't opting for 9mm because .357 Sig is a hard to find ammo, I think it is in direct relation to Worker's Comp claims from having to qualify with this artillery piece.

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5? long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.Action Type:  Semi-automaticCaliber:  .22 LRBarrel Length: 16.5"" Capacity:  8 round magazine (comes with 2)Length:  35"" assembled 16.5"" when stowedWeight:  3.5 lbs.Stock:  ABS PlasticSights:  Adjustable rear, blade frontFinish:  Teflon coated receiver and coated steel barrel"

Therefore, the Gen 1's are a superior, proven, and more reliable fire control group. The DB380's are also known as ""micro glocks"" for their looks and reliability  (Gen 1).

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively.  Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance. Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha. The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line. It also features a steel slide machined from billet. The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up. The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip. The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha. The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively.  Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance. Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha. The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line. It also features a steel slide machined from billet. The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up. The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip. The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha. The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.

The MPK will not corrode or dull under any conditions in sea water, making it deal for high use knife in that environment. Extended field test have substantiated that V-ground blade has a durable edge which is not susceptible to wear or chipping. The rounded serration is superior for cutting a variety of materials. Hardness, resistance to abrasion is exceptional on the MPK12-Ti. This will be demonstrated when the edge is resharpened. Mission Knives has found that a diamond coated round sharpener works for this purpose. The MPK has been proven to be the “World Toughest Knife” by 12 years of vigorous SOCOM military usage without a single broken MPK in the field. Use it, abuse it, put it away wet or dirty, the knife will last a lifetime.

Basically, the A300 Xtrema is a mash-up of the cheaper 3"" Outlander and the A400 3.5"" $1600 gun.  I had the outlander and replaced with this one.  Side by side they are night and day.  The outlander (made in USA) feels like crap compared to this one (made in Italy).  The quality difference is amazing.  This is NOTHING LIKE an outlander.

This one is 3.5"" with same action (rotating bolt and optima barrel) as the A400, but it does NOT have the ""kick-off"" system that the 400 has.  

Gun is near new, was used for the last 2 duck hunts of the season, and has less than 2 boxes of 3"" steel through it.
