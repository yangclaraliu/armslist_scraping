Last month I not only rang steel at 1100 yards, I shot a 5"" group at 1100 with this beast. Shooting 190gr SMK I was able to hit two head shots in a row at that distance as well.

It breaks my heart to sell this long range slayer, but hot women can get us to do some crazy things?!? I also have reloading data I'd be willing to share with the buyer. The gun is in great shape obviously being so new, there are three small blemishes. Two on the stock and one on the muzzle break from opening it to reduce recoil. I can send more photos upon request.

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.Caliber: 300 AAC BLACKOUTLength: 16"" Barrel No CC Fees! http://www.blackanklemunitions.com/product.php?product=199"

I did not build this AR-15 pistol nor do I know anything about building AR-15's. I bought it brand new from another seller on Armslist. He did not build it either. I enjoy shooting the pistol and have had great luck with it. I simply don't get attached to firearms and I'm ready for the next project. Please make an appropriate offer if interested.

I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me. I took this bow to Hoffman Archery and they outfitted it with the accys shown. I shot a total of 15 arrows through it at the shop and that is all the bow has seen. It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Mathews Solocam 2 piece quiver
QAD drop away rest
Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling
Tru Glow 4 pin sight

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

(Im sure all of you know it is legal to sell to an 18 year old as long as youre not an ffl) The reason I need one now is I live alone and I've had people try to break into my house with me home twice in the last month.. I have a shotgun but my house is really tight and small and the 2 times I was maneuvering around my home it was extremely difficult.. the police know about my problem, but i live in the country and its an hour response time.  The glock will be staying in my safe until I go to bed.. I am willing to pay $600 and willing to throw in extra for ammo.. Please help me out.. make an offer and ill take it into serious consideration."

Comes with box and all paperwork, warranty card hasn't been filled out yet. 15 rounds of Buffalo Bore 185 grain +P, there were 20 but I gave five to my brother, comes with 45 rounds of FMJ and a VerrsaCarry Holster (my favorite holster.) I polished the barrel, slide stop lever and feed ramp to a mirror polish not a scratch on this gun. I'm a small guy and this gun was easy to conceal with the slide measuring 15/16 of an inch, with the slide release its 1.01 inch's . This gun has the best trigger I've ever felt.

Quality hunting, combat & survival custom knives made in the USA!
Unique designs by: Richard Tingler!
I have been making Knives & Custom Guns since I was 16.
I only sold locally and on eBay but Since the Gun Law are changing All the time, I am now focusing on my knives instead of guns. Mine are made extra heavy duty and of the highest quality and Getting better all the time! I use Damascus steel “352 layers or more of 1095 steel and 15N20 Steel “. Also solid D2 steel and every once in awhile I am asked to use 1095 or 5160 & SUP9 STEEL. Others upon request if needed.
See My Face Book Page – Richard Tingler’s Custom knives
PLEASE LIKE & SHARE!

Please Email me Directly ( REDACTED) if you have any questions or want to design a knife for a special purpose or tell me a “TYPE” you’re looking for and I’ll send you pictures of what I have made and ready to sell. I make Hunting-Fighting-Survival-Swords-Machetes & the most authentic “Book Of Eli Machete”in D2 steel also have my version of the “Tracker Knife” and RAMBO“ONE” in Damascus

This is an email I just received from a customer that I just finished a custom knife for so I emailed him to let him know he could pick it up. He ordered it about 7 months ago after having me make a smaller custom fighting knife for him'''''

How u ding Rich, don't forget I am fighting in the war in Iraq.. I got shipped out on the 2nd of Dec. I'm with a special SOG force.. My they say it will take two yrs to complete.. Sorry can't talk much.. They monitor my txt and my email so I have to be careful of what I say.. Thank u for everything an yeah your knife works great.. ""I'm using it now on my mission"" will contact u when I'm back home.. Good to see u got better my friend... 

Damascus steel

This blade is hand forged with 1095 and 15n20 high and low carbon high nickel steel. This blade is about 58 hrc on Rockwell scale. This will hold an edge and keep it’s sharpness for a long time. Ideal for a long lasting sharp cutting edge when used on tough cutting jobs.


D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles. Bob Dozier is one maker who uses D2-steel. Benchmade Company has begun using D2 in its Axis AFCK also.

I have sold world wide - at this point about seven (7) other countries. And almost every customer has come back and bought more from me. Two (2) customer has bought about ten (10) knives threw the years and one has bought over fifteen (15) from me.

For the person on here “CLAIMING” to have the best knives and all others on here our junk compared to yours well let’s go blade to blade. We can take your knife and my knife blade edge to blade edge and then we can take a sledge hammer to the top one and the one that ends up with the most damage pays for the other one.
So let see go ahead and but “YOUR” junk on the edge and see what on here is REALLY BETTER! Oh and stop stealing designs off of mine will you!"

What it comes with: you'll get the X26 unit & a Bladetech holster (not pictured). No DPM (battery) or cartridges as they are in use with the new one I had to get asap to replace it."

The new TP9SA is a 9mm single action, striker fired pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.
The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.
Comes with two 18 round magazines, poly holster, paddle attachment, belt attachment, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty.

The FN Five-seveN ® pistol was developed in the early 1990s and features a cold hammer-forged barrel that is chrome lined for extended service life. The polymer-framed FN Five-seveNÂ® offers single-action operation, low felt recoil, 20-round magazine capacity and is equipped with an ambidextrous, forward-mounted manual safety and an accessory rail that accepts tactical lights and laser.

It has pretty much everything you could want in an AR lower and has never been fired.  The lower itself started as a stripped Anderson Manufacturing receiver. I finished it with Magpul FDE grip, stock, and enhanced trigger guard. I filled in the roll pin marks to give it a splash of color, and outfitted it with a Magpul MS-3 single/dual point sling.  This Magpul sling is awesome in the fact that it can be used as both a single or a dual point sling.  It is as easy as moving one paraclip to the front sling loop on your rifle.

I also would like to include in the auction 3 Magpul windowed FDE magazines with dust covers. I then took the magazines and cut traction tape to fit the indentations on the magazine to give you a more solid grip when inserting and stripping the magazine from the rifle.  I have pre filled up those magazines with 90rds total of federal lake city ammo. All in all I have invested about $500 in to this build and hate to part with it, but the wife and I just bought a Jeep that became the new play toy.

Since this is the firearm part of the rifle as defined by the ATF I will need to take a look at your New Mexico Drivers License, and draft up a Bill of Sale.

If you have any questions or would like to purchase some of the items separately let me know and maybe we can work something out. No low ballers or scams please, I am in no rush to sell."

  Synthetic stock & it has a Bushnell 3-9 scope on it, nothing fancy but it gets the job done, it's the scope Remington put on it at the factory. 
  Bought it a few years back & I've put about around 100 rounds thru it shooting paper & it shoots really well for a stock gun, excellent groups with Federal factory ammo (dime - nickle size groups at 100yds), really well rounded cartridge with plenty of punch to get the job done hunting but not too much recoil as to be a pain to shoot.   Loaned to a friend last hunting season & he took a nice mulie with it.  
  I have 200rds+ of Federal Premium 150gr soft point rounds in box to go with it. 
   The crappy factory plastic magazine release has been replaced with a custom made aluminum release. The plastic magazine release button breaking is the common gripe about these rifles but it has been eliminated.  
    Excellent starter hunting kit.
      It is in great condition.  Asking $425 for the rifle & ammo, will not separate as it is my only .270 so I have no use for the ammo if the gun is gone.

This gun features back-bored 28"" ported barrels for maximum pattern density and recoil control. The fiber optic front bead and 10mm target rib makes getting on target easy and the adjustable stock and trigger provides the custom fit necessary to smash clays time after time whether it's skeet, trap, or sporting clays. The blue and grey laminate stocks are eye-catching but tasteful. It is certainly a head-turner at the range.

The gun comes with (5) matched extended chokes. The chokes are Skeet(x2), Improved Cylinder, Modified, and Full. The chokes come in a Briley choke case along with the hex key used to adjust the stock. The case shown is an Academy brand one and the foam is cut for the gun. The factory FN case is also available but it is much larger and less handy. 

This gun has been my competition gun for the past year and has served me very well. Regular clay shooting is just getting too expensive for me at this time. 
This is one of the early generation guns (I'm told one of only 200) that FN produced to test the gun's marketability. This has the 28"" barrels and not the 30"" one seen on current generation guns. I prefer the 28's for skeet though which is what I used this for most often.
