1) Lawrence 1C #585. This is a very well made holster in excellent condition. I have been informed that this is for a Beretta 25 bantam. $35 Shipped



2) SOLD
3) SOLD
4) SOLD
5) SOLD
6) The only markings on this is a stamped 160. One of the snaps is marked Schoellkopf Jumbo---I have never heard of them but maybe you have??? The snap on the retention strap needs to be replaced, other than this is seems to be a heavy duty holster with lots of life left in it. I tried a 4"" Security six and it is too short. I tried a 6"" Security six and it hangs out just a hair. $20 Shipped


7) Pair of cheap plastic factory Glock belt slides. These are well used and one has a custom repair with leather where the plastic belt loop broke. These might just be perfect for a creative idea like strapping one on the steering column??? $10 Shipped for the pair.


8)  SOLD
9)  SOLD
10) SOLD
11) SOLD

12) Roys Leather Goods 27-28. This is another very well made holster in great condition. The snap on the retention strap needs to be replaced. I don't know what this was intended to fit but my 4"" Security six fits in it like a glove. $30 Shipped


13) SOLD
14) Unknown maker stamped 4 68 6 on the back. Decent old holster with 2 snaps on the retention strap for adjustable length. I have no idea what might live in this one, but if I were to guess I would say an old pencil barrel 6"" S&W of some sort. $15 Shipped


15) Frisbie Leather, Portland, Oregon is the only markings on this one. Again old school well made holster in pretty nice shape. I am guessing this was made for a S&W, but it fits my 6"" Security six just fine. $25 Shipped


16) Safety Speed Holster stamped 38 and 4 which I would guess back in the day meant 38 caliber and 4"". I think I just saw officers Reed and Malloy on Adam 12 carrying this same holster. This one has definitely been around the block a time or 2. If you collect old cop stuff you will probably should add this to the collection. $20 Shipped 


17) Uncle Mikes size 5 adjustable flap holster. This is a lefty with velcro on one side of the flap. This allows you to adjust how far up or down the flap will be depending on what you have in it. It says size 5 if this helps. My 4"" Security six fits pretty low in it, and my 6"" Security six is a bit long for it. I would say a 5 or 5.5 inch barrel would be a perfect fit. $20 Shipped


18) Ted Blocker Leather. I don't know if this is for a flashlight, baton, or mace can. Used but certainly has plenty of life left in it. $10 Shipped


19) Owners manual for a European American Armory Corp, Model witness P semi automatic pistol. I just hate tossing this sort of thing in the trash. If you can use it let me know."

The A5's in 20ga are not as common. This one would be a true gem except for two things. The stock had some type of repair or modification. It's completely intact and works fine - just not that pretty. The barrel has a vented rib which is great, but it has polychoke that is missing a leaf.

This is a 1987 gun that has seen little use and has barely been fired.  These are not easy guns to find in this condition or with the French Grey finish.  The metal work is all in 100% factory new condition.  The forend is without flaw.  The butt stock has 2-3 tiny handling marks, and there is barely an imprint on the breech face.  Essentially a new gun housed in a nice Browning case.  The Superlight weighs in at 6lbs. 3oz. and balances dead on the hinge pin for a very fast and dynamic handling shotgun.  The wood on the Grade 6 Browning Citoris is very well figured.  Invector screw in chokes give you great versatility.  This is a gorgeous, light weight, easy to carry upland gun that will be a pleasure for the new owner in the pursuit of upland quarry or clay targets .

I'm looking for another 9mm pistol, ideally a Sig but open to offers. This is a great little gun but I inherited a Walther PPK and in the unlikely case that we can ever get CCW permits here in California that's what I'd go with.

I will also sell it for $400.

I also have a Shield specific sight pusher tool to adjust/change the sights. It's brand new in the box and I will sell that for $100 or would make that part of a trade.  If you want to buy both the Shield and the sight pusher I'd sell them for $475.  The sight pusher is perfect for adjusting the sights or if you want to change them out.

Looks like they only made the pump in 30-06 for one year in 1952.  Besides that how cool is it having a big game pump rifle.  Comes with 75 bucks in ammo, and a pretty cool bsa illuminated 3-9 scope.  The picture makes the wood pump handle look worse than it is.  Maybe it cracked but you can’t feel it and it was professionally fixed, hasn’t cracked or had a problem in years.  My grandpa has had this gun for a long time but it’s in really good shape for the age.  The butt could use a slip on limbsaver or something, but the action is smooth.  Clean gun.

Pre-‘64 type action Model 70 dubbed the “Classic”, this action was a return to the things that made the Model 70 famous. Featuring a full-length claw extractor, receiver mounted ejector, coned breech and controlled round feeding (CRF), the Classic had the look, feel, and function of its revered forefather. It wasn’t an exact copy, however, and actually offered several improvements over the Pre-’64 action.

While it remains a measuring stick for all bolt-action rifles, the Pre-’64 Model 70 action wasn’t perfect. The Classic action offers a significant improvement. Unlike the Pre-’64 action, the bolt body of the Classic Model 70 is drilled in two places to divert gases safely down into the magazine and has a gas block mounted to the extractor collar to prevent gas from entering the left lug raceway. This system is widely considered the best gas system of any Model 70, and offers the shooter unparalleled protection. 

At the heart of the Classic line was the Featherweight. Named “Bolt Action of the Century” by Shooting Times, the Featherweight is arguably one of the most attractive rifles ever manufactured. Featuring a light and trim satin finished walnut stock with a Schnable fore-end and cut checkering

- Asgard Rail - ($289.00) http://tacticalshotgun.solutions/Benelli-M4/Benelli-M4-Full-Length-and-Entry-Model-Tactical-Shotgun-Rails/

- Good article on the Benelli M4 - http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/benelli-m4-tactical-12ga/

- This shotgun is currently a registered Short Barreled Shotgun (SBS).  I am selling it with the 18"" standard barrel (shown in pictures) as a standard shotgun (not a SBS), therefore no wait.  It comes with everything shown except the 14"" barrel.  

- If you would like the 14"" barrel, you must first register the Benelli as a SBS (ATF Eforms, takes ~30 days).  After you get the paperwork back, i will give you the barrel, this is the only legal way to do this without waiting 6-9MO for transfer paperwork.

**If there are any questions about this please let me know, happy to discuss and show the part of the NFA that allows this.  Again, you will NOT get the 14"" barrel until you have the proper paperwork (Approx ~30 days after you file on line). 

If you have any questions please let me know...mainly looking for cash right now, unless you have an Alpine Navigation system for a Ford F150 FX4."

This is a very gently used Springfield M1A.  
I probably put a couple hundred rounds through it before retiring it due to ammo costs. I got it sighted, it functioned, and I put it in the closet.
Later trips to the range involved my .22 which I could afford to shoot and could still handle, as well as my handguns for home protection.

Here is the Springfield page, scroll down and click on MP9826 for the specs

DIAGRAM: The purpose for this is cleaning and disassembly: all parts are represented at full scale and whatever you take out, you place on the diagram so that you don't lose (or confuse) anything.

PAYMENT:
If paying by check of any kind, we will wait fully for payment to complete/deposit before finishing the transaction. This includes cashier's checks and money orders.
Paypal and bitcoin accepted.

TRADE:
I am not looking to trade. 
The only thing I have even considered at this point is an FN PS90. If you have one of those, I will consider trade offers.

BACKGROUND:
I bought this when I got out of the army, wanting to have my own battle rifle that fired 7.62 NATO rounds.
But ammo got very expensive, I've gotten older and out of shape, and I was in a motorcycle accident injuring my left arm/shoulder and now I want to get rid of it and get something smaller, lighter, and easier to handle."

Hey all, 
Im in the market for some AR mags. I am mainly looking for ones that I will use with my 458 SOCOM setup, although they will obviously be used with my 5.56 setup as well. The TTSX bullet that I have in some of my loads is incompatible with the Pmags due to the lip that runs the length of the mag. Im mainly looking for get some steel Mil-spec type mags, or Lancer mags.
I am open to most, and open on condition. (it is likely I will be painting the metal mags anyways). Just please price them accordingly. Im located in Norman and have cash or various trades. If you have some you want to get rid of, just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on these if possible.
I am looking primarily for 30rd mags, but am open to any size if the price is right.

I never shoot these (hence them all being new and unfired).  Here they are and what they come with (that being said, if you see something on one that you are interested in and want it on a different gun just let me know and we can work it out).

Gun # 1 - Complete AR Pistol made by Radical Firearms.  Gun has a pistol buffer tube and has a Seekins Precision free float keymod rail.  The rail is a $150 rail by itself.  I have mounted a CAA side saddle on it to serve as a nice cheek piece without losing its pistol classification.  On top of it is a true Fiber Optic Green Dot sight.  NOT a Trijicon but works very well, is clear, holds zero, solid built and has a backup battery/on off button if you are in a low light condition and the fiber optics are not working.  Gun also has a brand new blackhawk 65 lumen flashlight (with batteries) and mount.  Comes with one 30 round mag.  Everything is brand new.  PRICE - $750 (TRADED)

Gun # 2 - Brand new factory built PSA AR15.  Upper has a 16"" barrel and m4 feed ramps.  Also has a Midwest Industries Free Float Key Mod Rail with 3 rail sections that are moveable.  The lower has a Magpul STR stock (amazing!) with cheek weld and storage, magpul grip and enhanced trigger guard.  Also comes with a blackhawk flashlight and mount and a CQB Solutions FDE Sling.  Comes with a 30 round mag.  I may have some other sight options for an additional fee if someone wanted sights/optics on it.  Has a blackhawk foregrip as well.  PRICE is $700 (SOLD)

Gun # 3 - Upper is a brand new factory assembled RGuns 20"" stainless steel bull barrel upper with a free float smooth aluminum handgaurd.  Comes with a Full Auto Stainless BCG.  Lower is a Radical Firearms factory assembled lower with an upgraded Luth AR adjustable stock.  This stock is amazing and has adjustable Length of Pull and Cheek Rest Height.  Optic is a used but in great shape NC Star 10-40x50 Mil Dot reticle, Illuminated scope sitting in heavy duty high rings.  Really a clear optic for being a budget scope.  Comes with a 30 round mag or a 20 rounder if you prefer.  PRICE is $775

I may be interested in trades but prefer cash.  I like AR-10's (Especially a Colt 901), nice over unders, low cost glocks, maybe others.

http://s78.photobucket.com/user/triton_23/slideshow/AR-7
NOTE: There is a scope in part of one photo, but this sale does not include a scope.

This is an AR-7 survival rifle. They have been manufactured for years by multiple companies.
The gun disassembles VERY easily (no tools) and can be stored inside the waterproof stock.
When fully sealed, you can leave it in your boat or other dangerous/wet location. Not only will it stay dry, it supposedly floats.

This gun, like most .22's is highly accurate.

But one problem with the stock gun is a thin barrel that needs to be chamfered so ammo can feed directly and cleanly off the feed ramp.
This replacement barrel is much heavier, and is nicely chamfered. 
The additional weight allows a much easier hold (otherwise it can feel like you are aiming a pencil, because it's so light). It will also last much longer, and due to thickness, stays cooler than the stock barrel.

The barrel came from AR-7 Customized Accessories
http://ar7.imoutdoorshosting.com/store/AR7barrels.html

The auction DOES include the original barrel, as well as the heavy barrel. If you want to use this in its survival form, you will have to use the original barrel because the heavy barrel does not fit in the stock.

I also have some extra magazines, but be wary of 3rd party magazines. Ideal for size are the 30 round because they allow you to hold the magazine like a forward grip.
But aftermarket AR-7 magazines have notorious feed issues, so you should try to get Henry mags or dealers which guarantee their product.

I actually have a holster for this rifle! 

In the pictures, you will notice some electrical tape on the stock which is there to thicken the butt and create a very tight seal. It is not covering any blemishes or defects.
The second piece of tape inside the butt contains the original (pain in the ass) screw for the sight.

I also replaced the annoying rear sight (stock) screw with a thumb screw that can be manipulated by hand, or with the hex key in the stock.

You also get the soft carry case. It's one of the smallest rifle cases made, and is a bit large, but you can fold over the top and tighten it down using the strap, which makes it a good size.
Or use it for your other rifles/shotguns.

I left the 1"" rings mounted to the weapon because I can't use them for any of my other guns. They are yours to keep!

I like this gun, but don't need it any more as I moved into the city (no shooting varmints) and have two other .22's. 
I unfortunately don't have a boat, either.

Check out my other auctions. 
I'm somewhat willing to drive for this auction--StL, KC, Spfld, or Lamar--we might be able to work something out.

Approximately $905 invested with receipts to prove.  PSA CHF chrome-lined SQR upper 8.5"" with free-floated rail system on an Anderson lower with the Phase 5 buffer tube perfect for the brace.  This lower could legally be used on a rifle upper if wanted, a fixed 9"" in length of pull with the Phase 5 tube, and CAN be shouldered based on current law.  PSA upper with PSA premium nickel boron bolt carrier plus a Redfield Pursuit red and green dot ($60 at Bass Pro before taxes) with HOGUE grip, and the Stark SE-5 fixed angle grip forward (yes, this is legal on pistols) plus a Levang Linear muzzle brake perfect for the short barrel.  The Levang has softer recoil than the standard A2 brake that it originally came with and forces the sound forward.  Can include the original A2 brake if wanted.

Right at 80 rounds through the upper and dead-on at 100 yards or less with only 10 rounds needed to zero.  I never fired further than that at the range with this set up.  Basically a toy I occasionally take out so it is expendable.  NO TRADES, please. Clean and well-kept.

First $525 gets it.  Will toss in 2 Magpul P-mags and 1 43"" cobra tactical soft case which will hold this and a lot of extras.  If you find a better deal, take it.  Price is firm.

This steel WW II flare pistol is probably Polish. It was sold to me as a Walther, but it is definitely not a Walther.

I have fired it once, and it works--unsurprisingly as it is incredibly simple, and is heavy steel. 

It comes with a fantastic vintage leather holster for holding the gun and several flares. I believe it holds 4 on top and 6 in the bottom, but flare length varies.
Note that it is all leather and not canvas like all the flare pouches I have seen.
This is the ""official"" holster for the pistol, it is made just to hold this flare gun and flares and is not a repurposed bag, holster, satchel, etc.

I also have (I believe) 19 flares, two boxes of 10 with one shot to verify that they work. 
It looks like one box is white parachute and one box is single flare red.
I think I fired the red flare, so this should be 9 red and 10 white.
The flares appear to be Czech, I don't recall where I got them, only that they were imported Eastern European surplus.

Flares are a huge pain in the ass to get shipped, these are far harder to obtain than the flare gun. The flare gun does not require an FFA license for mailing/transfer.

There is a 12 gauge aluminum insert so that you can fire standard flares which are easily obtained.

This comes with the Vortex Unconditional Warranty--doesn't matter if you are the first owner or the 100th, Vortex warranties the product, not the person. Very few (if any) of the big manufacturers offer a lifetime warranty on their red dots. Most only give you 1-2 years and require receipts, registration, etc. Vortex could care less. If you own it and it breaks, send it in and they fix or replace it free.

Please PM me if you want to purchase this rifle. 1st Photo is before I sent it in to Rifle Dynamics and the next two are after.
