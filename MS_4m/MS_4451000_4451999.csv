http://www.springfield-armory.com/1911-series/

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol."

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.

I had Doc make this beauty for me and was going to use it as my Sunday Go To Meeting pocket knife but it is a little over 9"" long so a little too big for me. It is in new condition and spotless. The fit, finish and leaf spring action are absolutely perfect. The manual action is as smooth as it gets also. The handle material is white bone and the knife (including the liners) have beautiful filework. If you are a knife person and have never owned a custom you are missing out. You will not find a knife like this at sporting good stores.
I may trade for OTF knives (no Benchmades) or subcompact handguns.

The Doc Hagen will be the larger knife in the picture.

I changed some stuff out and made this rifle better.  It comes with the ALG Advanced Combat Trigger, Magpul MIAD Grip, B5 SOPMOD Stock, BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle, and DiamondHead BUIS.  Have about $1600.00 total wrapped up in this rifle.  I'll include the 30 round mag in the picture as well as a soft case.  It's of the tactical variety, but I hate to just throw that word around.  

I bought it for my daughter, but she was interested in other platforms.  She shot it two different times and then I cleaned it and stored it in my temperature and humidity controlled safe.  I always used a bore guide when running a rod down the barrel.  It's got maybe a 150-200 rounds down the pipe.  Anyone who knows their guns will know I'm telling the truth when they actually look at this rifle.  

I can meet at you West Coast Armory North in Everett or on the South End of Whidbey Island at Whidbey Arms in Clinton.  OR, you can choose an FFL in the Lynnwood, Everett, Mukilteo, Whidbey Island area for the transfer.  I'm asking $1,150.00 OBO and I'll pay the transfer fee.  The MSRP on this rifle bone stock with no BUIS and without better furniture, a better trigger, charging handle, etc.... is $1326.60.  

Please, no lowball offers.  I'm not willing to take your offer of $1000.00 cash.  This rifle is priced right.  I am however willing to sell this for $1000.00 even minus the BUIS, and you pay the transfer fee. 

This rifle is known for it's smooth shooting, low recoil, and even lower maintenance.  Adams Arms is top shelf quality when it comes to rifles.  I still have an identical rifle to this with well over 5k-6k down the pipe and she still cries out for more.  Given that the barrel is melonited, it's going to resist fouling more than anything else on the market as well as offer increased velocity.  This is a perfect 3-Gun rifle.  

This is NOT an Heckler & Koch, a Sig Sauer, a Colt, a Daniel Defense, a Whindham Weaponry, a Rock River Arms, or a Smith & Wesson.  This is an ADAMS ARMS.  They pretty much revolutionized the short stroke gas piston system for the AR-15 Modern Sporting Rifle.  If you look at the S&W Gas Piston, it's actually an Adams Arms, as well as many other big name companies who use a gas piston system.  Many have contracted with Adams Arms to build them a reliable, combat worthy rifle."

Features & Specs

 •The Comp M4s retains all the great features as the CompM4, but with the battery rotated to the lower right. This allows easier access the brightness control, and gives the optic a slimmer profile. Just like the CompM4, the enhanced energy-usage provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery. The crisp 2 MOA dot brightness has 16 positions, 9 daylight and 7 optimized for use with all night vision, especially Gen-3 night-vision technology in current government use. Aimpoint's band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness. The front lens opening is threaded for addition of a KillFlash anti-reflective device. A removable one-piece bikini cover keeps dust and scratches off the glass.

•Aimpoint 3X Magnifier with Larue Tactical (Tall) LT755 mount places an Aimpoint 3X Magnifier in perfect, 1.725"" centerline height-alignment... providing proper cheek-weld. With durability and simplicity in-mind, the angled spring-tensioned pivoting arm rotates on a robust shaft. No buttons, no switches, no delicate places to fill with sand. You simply grab the optic one-handed, pull back, move it in-position, release, and you're good-to-go. Once it's in position, it does not move unless you want it to. The design allows the Aimpoint 3X to fit over top of most flip-up rear sights.

•Aimpoint Flip-up Front Cover w/ ARD killFLASH Filter.
Both the flip-up cap and the ARD are integrated into a single piece, allowing the user to maintain better accountability of the ARD. It also allows the ARD to flip out of the way and retain to the housing of the flip-up cap, allowing the removal of the ARD when shooting in low or failing light.

It also comes with a 2 mag holster and a paddle holster I cut down for one of my old XDs years ago as I will have no use for it. This is a fantastic shooter with zero issues. 575 cash. Trades will need to be worth more for me to be interested so please be realistic. ARs, AKs and 1911s are always at the top of my list. Thank you for looking."

Hello everyone, I have for sale 2 handguns which I am going to sell together (or separate if desired). before this new law takes effect where I will have to go through a FFL licensed broker to sell my guns.  Another reason for selling, my brother fronted the money for me to buy these guns, so I need to sell them now to get him his money back. I purchased both of these guns with the intent of re-selling for a profit, but I am selling them for less than I paid before repairs/shipping/FFL broker fees, ETC. 

Smith & Wesson Model 10-7 Revolver, K-Frame, double action, s/n 53323. I have put a lot of time/money/love into this gun and you will not be disappointed.  History: I purchased both of this guns at auction about a year ago with the intention of selling them to make a quick buck. Well... this revolver was a rusty piece of junk when I got it. Originally blued, I sanded the ever loving sh**t out of it with 600 grit sand paper for hours on end, polished the silver/chrome, replaced the main spring, re-finished the wood grips, took the entire gun apart and cleaned/oiled every moving part, etc. Now, this gun shoots more accurately with the 2"" barrel than my fathers Colt .38 4.5"" barrel. The new main spring gives it a very smooth/light trigger pull, the cylinder spins for days when you turn it, and you will L.O.V.E this gun. It still shows evidence of the rust from improper storage which has left cosmetic defects (blemishes) around the frame of the gun, however, it has been sanded COMPLETELY smooth to the touch.

Star Interarms Alexandria Virginia R-9 Cal. 9mm Parabellum s/n OR 2333. Only shot this gun a few times, typical 9mm pistol, 15 round clip which I really like. When I first shot the gun it jammed quite a bit, however, after a good cleaning, it shoots fine. It does not have the rear sight so it only has the front pin which makes it less accurate (obviously). Just a warning, I personally have found it difficult to find parts for this gun, but I also do not know much about guns in general and don't really know where to look (maybe you will have better luck), so plan on the rear sight being difficult to find or talk to a machinist buddy and try making one. 

My goal here was to be as upfront as possible, these guns are nothing to write home about, but they are a very good deal and you are getting the best of both worlds (38 special 6 shooter revolver AND a 9 mm with a large clip). 2 for the price of 1! 

I live in Welches, OR but will drive to Gresham for serious buyers only. You are more than welcome to test the guns if you wish, but will need to drive to me. There is a shooting range just West of welches off Hwy. 26 that I can meet you at to fire the guns (please bring your own ammunition).

Please respond via. E-Mail if interested or if you have any questions, leave your contact info and I will get back to you quickly. My name is Chris, thanks for looking! I also have more pictures of the guns which can be viewed here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o7m3c4gxolxelam/AAAOgcACanhcOSndwmtBHljha?dl=0"

I have very stiff hands, so when the gun recoils, it almost jumps out of my hand (and I have a VERY strong grip) due to my arm staying in the same place, causing my finger to slam into the bottom of the trigger guard with every shot. If I wear gloves this isn't a problem, but i've just decided that with a gun of this size, with recoil that snappy, just isn't a gun for me.

Gun has VERY minor cosmetic blemishes (a few nicks on the slide, a tiny chunk taken out on the rear of the lower receiver, like somebody dropped a nail on it or something, around 90-95%) and works just fine, albeit it's extremely stiff. I'm starting to think this was a unfired gun taken out of its box and just handed around, and sadly now it's fired (due to my father nagging me to fire it before selling it).

I have included a description of the gun below and if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks

 DESCRIPTION:
 Be the envy of your shooting friends with the GSG 522 SD. This GSG MP5 22lr rifle has it all...the looks, accuracy, price and cool accessories. If you're looking for a great shooting tactical 22 rifle that doesn't look like an AR15, the GSG 522 is one of the best options for you. 

 You can easily add on some of the fun GSG 522 accessories like a retractable stock, a nice BSA Red Dot or a 110 round drum magazine.

 The 522 SD has a sling loop built into the left side of the standard stock and one on the trigger guard. The SD does not have a front sling loop like the 522 carbine does.

 All versions of the GSG 522 has a tactical rail up top that allows you to easily mount red dots, reflex red dots or any size scope you'd like to put up there. The rail is built in so there is no added parts to buy.

 The GSG 522 SD features a rubber ribbed hand guard and larger ""SD"" barrel shroud. The GSG 522 carbine features a more rigid plastic hand guard and smaller barrel shroud. You can easily remove the front hand guard for cleaning or to put on an after market front hand guard."

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

   Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear. 

   Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic."

Manufacturer statement: 
The S.C.A.R. or Sawyer Concealment Appendix rig has two designs (SCAR I, and SCAR II) both with distinct features that makes them both exceptionally well at doing their job.  The Original SCAR I is designed to be only .16 thicker than throwing the pistol itself inside your waist band.  Using .080 Kydex T, the SCAR is brings with it one of the smallest foot prints you can have with an IWB holster for any size pistol.  Utilizing an injection molded polymer strut and polymer coated webbing loop you will be able to grab and go with the ability to tuck in your shirt behind the strut allowing only the black loop visible, ideal for business attire or formal gatherings.  This deep conceal holster will keep you armed without raising an eyebrow.
