I usually don't write stuff like this but I had a guy message me and really think this gun was one dollar than when I told him how much P88s go for he said I will NEVER pay that much for a gun. Well aside from being ignorant to the fact that if you know about guns you know that the P88 is one of the platforms that most other 9mm handguns are modeled after, also these guns are some of the most accurate stock handguns ever made. Do your research on these guns they go for 1200 to 1500 depending on condition, I have a compact and full size I estimate at the 1400 range, if you have a better cash offer LMk. If you have a trade or a trade plus cash LMk as well I'm open, but please whatever you do if you don't know your guns and really think anyone on here would sell there gun for a buck I'm gunna do you a favor NO NOT INTERESTED!!!!!!"

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding return-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight saving as well as superior cooling, ergonomics and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The 15"" rail allows the shooter to have their support hand closer to the muzzle, which combined with Daniel Defense's mid-length gas system's smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick and precise rapid fire.The KeyMod rail has an uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and keymod attachments at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions ensuring plenty of real estate for optics and accessories that allow for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. Equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" lightweight profile barrel, the DDM4v11 is almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle is also equipped with the newly designed, rugged, and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding return-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight saving as well as superior cooling, ergonomics and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The 15"" rail allows the shooter to have their support hand closer to the muzzle, which combined with Daniel Defense's mid-length gas system's smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick and precise rapid fire.The KeyMod rail has an uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and keymod attachments at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions ensuring plenty of real estate for optics and accessories that allow for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. Equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" lightweight profile barrel, the DDM4v11 is almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle is also equipped with the newly designed, rugged, and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

It feeds ball ammo and hollow point ammo just fine. I've never had it malfunction on me. I was carrying it for a little bit. It does have holster wear towards the end of the slide. It comes with the original wood grips and the magpul grips as well as the 2 magazines it came with. It is a scandium frame so it is much lighter than a traditional 1911. It's really a beautiful piece. These were discontinued by Smith and Wesson a little while back so they are very rare. I am wlling to drive a little to meet up with you. Make an offer, reasonable of course. Worst I can say is no!

Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

Red Filter for flashlights with 1.62"" diameter bezel

The FM15 is a red filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.62"" diameter bezel. Produces a smooth beam of red light that will not degrade night vision as white light would. Hunters use the red filter to avoid spooking game during pre-dawn hours -- deer see poorly in the red color spectrum. The filter is also useful for close range, non-tactical applications -- such as map reading -- as it reduces the intensity of light output. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight.

Located in La Grange, TX - between Austin & Houston on Hwy 71

Model: RR22B6  Caliber: 22LR
Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want ’em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

The first is 160 rounds of NEW 175g HPBT Match Ammo from Freedom Munitions, still in the box.  The second is 140 rounds of reman 147g FMJ plinking ammo.  Read below about each.

175g HPBT Match Ammo - This is new, in the box, ammo.  This ammo has matched head stamps, not random mixed stuff.  I went out and shot 40 rounds of this this past weekend.  You can see the results below.  I sighted in at 100 yards, then moved to a 200 yard zero to calibrate my scope.  Less than 1"" at 200 yards is 1/2 MOA, that is darn good for ""factory"" ammo.  Freedom is selling this for about $0.75 a round, but they have been out of it for a while, and backorders are 2-3 months right now.  I will sell it for $0.65 a round.  


147g FMJ's - I called this plinking ammo, but it is much more. It is sub-MOA ammo, even from my HK91.  Freedom sells this for about $0.58 a round.  I will sell it for $0.50 a round.

175g's - 160 x $0.65 = $104
147g's - 140 x $0.50 = $70

That is about $175 for all of it.  But, today only, Monday, July 13 - I will do it for $150.  First come, first serve!  I work at Fort Carson, but live in Falcon.  We can find a time and place somewhere between there to meet up!"

789,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4509789,For Sale:  US Palm - 30rd AK Mags - New,"Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, United States",$ 20,"Listed On: Sunday, March 6, 2016",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"PALM USA (30rd) AK MagsBrand New - (Never Used / Never installed / Never loaded)Three (3) avail. ($20.00 ea. + shipping)Factory info:The AK30 is constructed of proprietary aerospace polymers, and sets itself apart from other polymer magazines with its purpose-built design and multiple unique features.By eliminating the removable floor plate we created a stronger design; a five-sided box. This revolutionary design, paired with our advanced polymers gives the AK30 the strength it needs to survive impacts that would destroy other magazines. After the magazine is molded, the body and end-cap are bonded together, so no disassembly is possible or required. The AK30 has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy cleaning and hassle-free maintenance. Just dunk the magazine in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. Dry contamination easily flows free through the vented follower design. The AK30 also features a Mil-Spec spring that is heat-treated and stress relieved.Internal designInside, there is a lot going on! The locking surfaces are reinforced by a stainless steel cage that has been molded into the entire top of the magazine to further ensure reliability for years of trouble free service. We purposely omitted reinforcing the feed-lips with metal, being as our polymer rebounds back to its original shape much more reliably than metal or metal reinforced designs. When examined, the benefit of steel reinforced feed lips was found to be less desirable, as the two dissimilar materials, polymer and steel rebound and flex at differing rates. This can cause delamination between the two materials, which can create an environment for malfunctions. It was also observed that even though the AKM platform is field proven and very robust, attempts at field repairing bent feed lips by end users were unsuccessful.External DesignOutside, our design team created a magazine that can be utilized by an operator in any environmental condition. The aggressive ridges on the front and rear allow a positive purchase when seating the AK30 into the rifle. The deep waffle pattern on the magazine sides assist in rapid extraction from magazine pouches, and 100% positive manipulation within conditions beyond extreme. Every surface of the AK30 was given careful consideration to benefit the operator working in the harshest conditions on earth.Platform SpecificsInitially designed to fit AKM-47 rifles that use detachable double-stack magazines, the AK30 has been successfully deployed in other makes and models similar to the AKM as well. We still advise users of mass-produced/domestically produced rifles to test their individual rifles for compatibility, as there exists a very wide set of “standards” to which rifles are manufactured, and in the rare occasion, the AK30 may be too dimensionally specific to accommodate for a wide tolerance stacking issue.NOTE:We will NOT ship to any state that has a ban / restriction on High Capacity magazines such as:Calf. , Colorado, Conn., Washington DC, Hawii, Illionois, Maryland, New jersey, New York, ect."

HAWKE SCOPE
Hawke 1x32 Crossbow IR Waterproof Riflescope, SR Reticle Product Info 
Hawke 1x32 Crossbow IR Waterproof Riflescope, SR Reticle carries high performance optics and a fully-floating glass-etched illuminated reticle designed to increase your success in the field. The Hawke Sport Optics 1x32 Crossbow IR Waterproof Riflescope, SR Reticle is built around a mono tube design that will hold up to use on crossbows, shotguns, or AR platforms. Unique reticle design allows for 6 aim points when shooting a crossbow. When used on a shotgun for turkey hunting the top cross represents a range finding crosshair. Designed to represent 4"" at 40 yards, when the top of the cross is held at the top of the head, as soon as the bottom of the crosshairs no longer extends into feathers, the bird is in range. The wide angle image is bright and crisp, the long eye relief eyebell design allows the scope to quickly 'come up' to the eye. These performance features make the Hawke 1x32 Illuminated Crossbow Scope w/ SR Reticle ideal for use with high recoil turkey loads, or for CQB situations on your AR platform. Originally designed for crossbows, this multi-purpose scope is truly at home in many applications in the shooting sports marketplace.

The SR crossbow scope features a red/green illuminated glass etched reticle. The rheostat to adjust brightness has 5 levels on each color. The reticle features illuminated hollow circles with a 2"" 'Kill Zone' at the corrospoding distance. Compatible with the Hawke BRC software.

For sale are 2 air bb rifles and 1 air pistol. All have been lightly used by my boys. The rifles were given as a christmas gifts 4 years ago and the BB pistol is one year old now. My boys are old enough now that they want to move on to .22 rimfire and I don't want to store bb guns in the safe just to collect dust from this point forward. THe rifles have had very light use .. likely less then 100 rounds each (I still have the original can of BB's). The pistol has seen likely ~400 round through it. I figure that just based on the number of CO2 canisters I've gone through. Each CO2 canister is good for ~60 shots...we've gone through 7 canisters of CO2.

The items are: 

(2) DAISY MODEL 1998 in Camo:
The BB rifles are air, spring driven. You can't multi-pump them - it's one pump, one shot - period. 
The Model 1998 is a classic-styled BB repeater. It features a blade and ramp front sight and adjustable open rear sight. This spring air .177 caliber BB gun has a maximum velocity of 350 fps and a 650 shot capacity. The Model 1998 Daisy Carbine is recommended for ages 10 and older with adult supervision.

The pistol is CO2 driven by the typical, 12 gram CO2 containers.
18 round mag (3 of them)
typical .177 BB's

Price listed is the TOTAL price for ALL THREE GUNS. Again, pricing it to sell all 3 guns together as I don't want to be bothered with listed and trying to sell them separately.

These are popular for the match grade accuracy and the steel core penetrators within. These are no longer imported and very sought after.

As for why I am parting with them...I sold my dragunov over a year ago and the purchaser wished to pick up the remaining ammunition at a later date. Since he has been not heard of for over a year, they are back up for sale.

I will not open a case since the bands are intact but if you wish to open upon purchase for inspection I'm completely comfortable with that. I will not split a case. I would prefer not to ship. Local sale only. $750 a case firm (2 tins). No discount for purchasing all 4 cases. I can meet in the Bonney Lake/Buckley area.  I will also accept pre-1964 US coins (junk silver) at spot price as partial/full payment.

And I decided that I wanted to take the charger pistol concept to a whole new level. This was what I created.

This firearm started it's life as a simple 10/22 charger.
Wait its threaded, lets add an A2 flash suppressor
Then I added the substructure from the Sr-22
Couldn't have a stock on it so I added a AR pistol buffer tube 
Then I decided it needed a sig pistol brace
I pondered what happens if a given day I don't want to use the brace
So then I made it folding
Then I decided with all this work, it needs a better trigger
So I ordered a bx1 trigger
I was unhappy with the plastic trigger guard
So I got a metal one and moved all the pieces over
I also decided it needed a extended mag release since it wanted to be fed longer mags
So finally it was complete, but wait, no optic?
Then I decided the most fitting opic for a zombie gun would be a zombie killing Eotech xps2-z 
Then this firearm was born
And fear was born in the undead.
