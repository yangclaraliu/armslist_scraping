It will also come with 2-5 round mags one of which has a pinky rest installed, and 1-7 round mag, all 3 factory. Along with that stuff I have a Blackhawk single mag carrier, and a brand new, never worn Alien Gear tuckable IWB holster (RH) I just received. This package is ready to be traded for or bought and carried the same day. 

The SA was one of the XDS' affected by the recall, but it has been sent in for the work. I have EXACTLY 150 rounds through this pistol, I keep a log on all my guns, and all of it was factory .45. No +p ammo was used.

There is a small mark on the left side of the slide, does not intefere with functrion at all, from where I had pocket carried it for a short time. I have learned that if you use the 5 round mag with the flat baseplate, this makes a nice pocket gun, and with summer coming up, who doesn't need a .45 caliber pocket gun?

The only reason I am looking to trade is I just prefer Glocks. Nothing wrong with this pistol at all, and the recoil on such a small pistol was suprisingly soft.

I am looking to trade this for a Glock in .45. My trade preferences, in order, are: Glock 41, Glock 21 Gen 4, Glock 21sf, Glock 30s, Glock 30sf, Glock 30 Gen 3, or maybe a Glock 36. I would be willing to accept one of these Glocks with only 2 factory mags, but I would prefer 3 and maybe a decent concealment holster, but it won't be a deal breaker if one is not included.

Now, I am not interested in a $700 Glock that has a ""custom"" stippling job, and I am eligible for Blue Label Glock purchases so try to keep that in mind if there are any trade offers. I can get a brand new Glock 21 or 41 Gen 4 for under 5 bills. 

Since I have to put a price on the XDS package, I will list it for $600 OBRO for the package, and remember that's with a seperate mag holder and brand new holster. (Just enough cash for a new BL Glock and a decent holster) 

Please gentlemen, the best way to reach me for pics, questions, or offers is through text at REDACTED, and thank you very much for looking."

It was originally designed to be issued to the U. S. Navy, but the U. S. Army purchased most of the guns for their use, especially during the Civil War. It was manufactured from 1850-1873. A total of 215,348 were produced in the Hartford, Connecticut factory. By the end of the Civil War in December 1865, 185,000 had been produced. All 1851 Navy’s were .36 caliber, 6 shot 7.5 inch octagon barrels with attached loading levers. Grips were one piece walnut. Grip straps were silver plated brass. The trigger guard was a large round trigger guard. Three basic barrel markings were used. The standard cylinder scene was the battle between the Texas Navy and Mexico. This particular Colt Model 1851 Navy appears to be all original and is the 4th model with the wedge screw above the wedge. It is not in pristine condition because of its age and use. It was manufactured in 1866 bearing all matching serial number 192,383. It is .36 caliber, 6 shot, 7.5” octagon barrel with legible address marking: ADDRESS COL. SAML. COLT NEW-YORK U.S. AMERICA. Stamped on the left side of the frame: COLTS/PATENT. Has a nice dark patina. One piece walnut wood grips. Mellow brass straps. Cocks and locks up tight. All nipples present and in good condition. No cylinder scene, but faint date marking. A good collectible, authentic, original Colt Model 1851 Navy. NOT FOR FIRING. COLLECTIBLE ONLY. SHIPS DIRECTLY TO BUYER. NO FFL.

German Sport Guns’s tribute to the HK94 Machine Rifle first appeared in our channels in 2007, as our Guns America shoppers pointed out to us. Here you had a slick made, smooth and reliable-functioning, authentic looking copy of a legendary rifle. Since then, the big names have all introduced well made clones. Colt, Sig, and even HK themselves have marketed rimfires from the same German manufacturer. We’ve even sold a good many similar rifles with the word Walther written on them. The GSG-522, writes the Importer, has the established features of MP5-Style-Rifles, but with visual improvements which also meet a better functional purpose. First the better grip of the cocking lever, second the improved open sights for faster aiming, and third the GSG-522 comes with a removable 13 slot Picatinny or Weaver Rail, which allows the customer to fix an optical device at customer's option. The ergonomically handle with anti-Slip-Points are redesigned as well as the safety lever. Manufacturer is German Sport Guns GMbH of Ense-Höingen, Germany. Importer and Warrantor is American Tactical Imports, formerly of Rochester, NY now located in Summerville South Carolina. Type is blowback action semi-automatic rimfire rifle. Construction is principally heavy Zinc alloy, with steel barrel liner, port cover, perforated forend, bolt assembly, springs and internal parts. Metal finish is semi-gloss matte blue. Overall length is 33.6 inches; weight empty is 6.7 pounds. Magazine is correctly colored polymer construction with steel springs. Stock magazine is permanently blocked 10 round capacity, but we will sub a factory GSG / ATI 22 shot magazine for buyers who reside in jurisdictions where those are civilian legal. Each rifle comes in its factory cardboard box with instruction manual, GSG decal, cable lock, chamber protector, ATI catalog, and factory-importer registration card. Please note that the registration card should be mailed to 231 Deming Way, Summerville, SC 29483 and not to Rochester NY. The first specimens of these great little rifles we got in 2010 commanded pricing upwards of $500 apiece. We’re offering the GSG 522 rifle in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 239.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Aurora IL, Chicago Cook County IL, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction with “Any Two” laws that affect rimfire rifles. Civilian buyers in California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Colorado, and Maryland will receive a 10 round magazine, all other buyers will get a 22 rounder.Shipping.$20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.

Stainless steel, 2 1/4"" barrel weighs 26 Oz. I purchased this gun in June 2013, took it to the range and fired it 5 times to check function, cleaned it and put it away. I later added a set of HOGUE MONOGRIPS which just happened to fit my hand better than the original grips. The gun is tight, cycles perfectly and is not marred or beat up, it's like new. Of course, the gun fires both 38 special and 357 magnum ammo.

The gun comes with the HOGUE MONOGRIPS, original grips, and original case and accessories. Optionally, the gun also comes with the below ammo (over 400 rounds) and a HKS36A speed loader.

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a Zero-Energy striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a stainless steel magazine catch to secure its steel magazine, and bar dot sights, all in a lightweight pistol. The DB9’s steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a Finite Element Analysis designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel and internal parts are all hard coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. Manufacturer is Diamondback Arms of Cocoa, Florida. Construction is steel barrel, slide, trigger, and internal parts all in a steel reinforced polymer frame. Frame finish on this main variant is black. Type is striker fired blowback semi automatic. Trigger is .315 smooth faced steel, with a pull at 5 pound vicinity, double action only, with every pull the same. Barrel is 3 inch, 6 groove with 1:16 right hand twist. Slide is Melonite finished steel, with seven lateral serrations fore and aft. Sights are dovetailed low profile combat type white dot rear, with a stake on white bar front. Chambering, of course, is 9mm Luger caliber – 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. This pistol is NOT rated for +P Ammunition, clear specs for standard velocity ammo is on one of the hang tags. From tests, felt recoil is comparable with alloy frame revolvers. Magazine is blue steel body with round count perforations, six round, so 6+1 total capacity. The DB9 does not have a slide stop, so a person needs to be able to count to seven. Overall length is 5.6 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut, 4 inches height from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the semi finger rest magazine floor plate. Thickness is .812 inch, with weight empty at only 11 ounces, centered at the magazine release. Mag release is not reversible, this is not a southpaw friendly pistol. Disassembly is very similar to Glock and Kahr Arms pistols. Each DB9 comes in its factory hard shell case with instruction manual, factory registration card, protective papers, chamber protector, and cable lock.

The DB9’s steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a Finite Element Analysis designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel and internal parts are all hard coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. Manufacturer is Diamondback Arms of Cocoa, Florida. Construction is steel barrel, slide, trigger, and internal parts all in a steel reinforced polymer frame. Frame finish on this main variant is black. Its frame incorporates a six slot Picatinny rail system for light or laser mounting. Type is striker fired blowback semi automatic. Trigger is .315 smooth faced steel, with a pull at 5 pound vicinity, double action only, with every pull the same. Barrel is comparable with a 17L Glock, 4.8 inch, 6 groove with 1:16 right hand twist. Slide is Melonite finished steel, with ten lateral serrations fore and six aft. Sights are dovetailed low profile combat type white dot rear, with a stake on white bar front. Chambering, of course, is 9mm Luger caliber – 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. This pistol will accept any 9mm ammunition, from lead nose reloads to Cor-bon +P. From tests, felt recoil is comparable with alloy frame revolvers. Magazine is blue steel body with round count perforations, fifteen round, so 15+1 total capacity. The Diamondback DB9FS’s magazine body is dimensionally identical to 92FS Beretta Magazines, and the Beretta mags can be adapted to fit with a well placed cut, see the you tube video, Diamondback DB9FS Takes Beretta Mags. Factory Diamondback magazines sell in the $39 vicinity, so using Beretta Magazines will be an attractive option. Note the photo where we inserted a 92FS Magazine, the floorplates aren’t the same, but the bodies are. Overall length is 7 5/8 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut, 5 9/16 inches height from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the semi finger rest magazine floor plate. Slide thickness is a dead 1 inch at the port, with frame thickness of only 1.18 adjacent to the port. Weight empty is only 25 ounces, centered behind the trigger. Mag release is not reversible, this is not a southpaw friendly pistol. Disassembly is very similar to Glock and Kahr Arms pistols. Each DB9FS comes in its factory hard shell case with instruction manual, factory registration card, protective papers, chamber protector, and cable lock. We’ve sold Diamondback Arms pistols since they hit the market six years ago, with excellent customer satisfaction and no problems. Replacement pricing on similar pistols from Glock and Smith & Wesson is upwards of $600. We’re offering the DB9FS Full Size in the photos or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 239.00.

I know you're all getting tired of seeing this ad two or three times a day, but you guys might forget how great it is if I don't keep posting it.  I also have a mixed bag of gun-show reloads which I want retail value for, even though we all know that you should NEVER fire any reloads that you didn't load yourself; not only will it void the warranty, but it is also very dangerous thing to do.  But I still want retail value for them.  You will also have to give me retail value for the generic holster I have for it, even if it's not your style or you have no use for it.  This great bone stock revolver has also had a trigger job done on it by a mystery gunsmith (or me, you'll never know)!  It wasn't done by the Ruger and therefore voids the warranty, but that's okay.  I spent several hours polishing this, and believe me, you're going to have to compensate me for my hours of labor.  You will also have to pay for my hours of labor re-posting this ad every day instead of waiting a week like everyone else.   Hurry up, this revolver will only get more expensive as time goes by."

Several of us own World War II issue U.S. M-1 .30 Carbines, but one never sees a Government Issue case for those fine little rifles. Here are some we bought last year to complement our AOC Para trooper Carbines that we have listed on four venues. These are newly manufactured cases, imported by DKG Trading, that comes awfully close to the original configuration OD Green Canvas Cases. Overall length is 43 inches, so this case will even accommodate most high powered rifles with Scopes, three of our standard photos with this product show it with M1 Carbine, 336C Scoped Marlin .30-30, and Remington 742 scoped Woodsmaster rifles. As a general rule, a 22 inch barreled rifle will go into a 42 inch overall length case, and so forth. This case will even accommodate several rifles with pistol grips on their buttstocks, so long as their barrels are 20 inch or shorter and their magazines are not in battery. Widest width measurement is 9 inches, so this case will even accommodate our photographer’s Colt, although it isn’t quite period correct for Vietnam era weapons and despite the fact that it was manufactured directly north of Vietnam. It is even correct for Military Shotguns with 18 to 20 inch barrels like the Model 1897 and 1912 Winchesters that saw service in both World Wars. Obverse side has correct U.S. Marking, and reverse side has a canvas sling apparatus. Genuine Brass Zipper has leather reinforcement tabs at both ends, recalling the extremely pricey Boyt cases of the WWII – Korea period. We’re offering these fine cases each for only $29.00.

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Will Ship to Verified FFL  $25.00"

It is the duty handgun for the U.S. military as well as 25 other countries. The 92 series operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system that allows for faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. The double/single action trigger system provides a very safe and combat proven design, while the high capacity steel magazines are durable and drop free quickly when the magazine release button is depressed, even when empty.Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. While a unique M9 prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.Specifications and Features:9mm Luger4.9"" barrel15 roundsSingle/double actionRecessed combat muzzle crown protects riflingCheckering on front and back strapsReversible magazine release buttonBruniton, corrosion resistant finishNon reflective black matte finish""Dot-and-Post"" sight systemAmbidextrous manual safetyAutomatic firing pin blockMil-spec Picatinny railOpen slide3 dot sights8.5"" length5.4"" height1.5"" width1.3"" grip width6.1"" sight radius34.4 oz"

I am selling all of these below what I paid and below what it would cost to get new at Walmart or Farm & Fleet. Because of this, I am not interested in playing ""Let's Make A Deal"". The prices are firm, but if someone spends $100 or more, I will give them the option of $5 off their selection or one of those green Plano ammo boxes that should hold around 300 boxed rounds. 

If someone is willing to buy the entire lot, then we can talk about possible further discounts (but keep in mind, it won't be substantial since I am already selling below my costs). The individual prices add up to $361, but I will offer the entire lot for $300 if the sale is completed by the end of the day on Sunday April 5th. 

These are all new in box (not reloads) and were purchased at local places like Gander, Walmart, Farm & Fleet, MC Sports or online at Cabela's. 

Terms:
*Cash only, deal to be done on West side of Madison during daylight hours in public location. To make it worthwhile, I am asking that the minimum purchase be $50.
*Not interested in trades 
*By buying any of this ammo, you confirm that you are legally able to own/purchase ammo in the state of Wisconsin
*No I am not willing to travel outside the Madison area to complete the deal. I am already selling below my costs, so I have no desire to spend extra money on gas or use my much limited free time."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."
