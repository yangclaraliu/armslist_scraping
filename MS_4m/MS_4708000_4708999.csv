This is a pre-Taurus Rossi revolver in stainless steel. Has Rossi medallion, and factory, black checkered rubber shock absorber grips with fingergrooves. SA/DA revolver. Fully adjustable rear sight.

The rare non-fluted cylinder really makes this a beauty. Oh, and stronger too. But boy it's a looker. 

This is a pre-Taurus revolver, one of the last models built before the buyout. After the buyout it took them quite a while to get back to this build quality. 

These were make on S&W tooling to be a clone of the SW 696. Sure, it's not a 696 but it's not $1,000 either.

The 3"" barrel is a comfortable size. A bit more accuracy than a snubby but no long barrel to weigh you down. A 3"", 5 shot, non-fluted combination makes this a very powerful concealed carry.

Great shooter, CWP, hunting companion, or house gun. Find out why the .44 Special is Michael Bane's favorite cartridge. Some good defensive loads in .44 Special.

Eric Hopp of Hopp Custom Leather Holsters is a true craftsman and his leather holsters rank at the very top of all hand made custom leather holsters made today. Eric makes some of the finest holsters that I've ever seen. Two of the areas that impress me the most are in his stitching and the joined edges where two pieces of leather come together. High quality custom hand-made holsters also have a waiting list and for a very good reason. First it takes time to build one high quality holster at a time and once the word gets outs out, everyone gets in line; so then it takes even longer. Everyone likes quality. After seeing the high level finished product that Eric makes, I ordered three holsters a year ago. Unfortunately for me by the time I received them, I had traded or was planning to trade some of the handguns that these three were made for. But if you're in the market for an OWB high quality leather holster for the following handguns, you're in luck, since I have three new and unused examples of Eric's workmanship available with no waiting, and at very reasonable pricing. The remaining one was made for an HK P2000SK and will fit several other similar sized handguns: RH, OWB, saddle tan leather, sweat-shield, light brown double stitch, forward cant, 1.5"" belt slots - Priced: $50 includes shipping and insurance. NOTE: I believe that the H&K USP and H&K P30 are interchangeable with the P2KSK. Eric makes some of the finest quality leather holsters that I've ever seen.

 It uses dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

I have a wooden Fire-arm cabinet for sale. 

It was an original cabinet that held 5 but it was converted to hold 24 long guns although it can hold more it only has 24 holders and Pine wood was used as the add on material. Weighs around 200 lbs. has two doors that are wood framed with glass inserts.

The dimensions are 3 ft 3.5 In Length x 3 Ft .5 In Width x 6 Ft 1.5 In Tall. Just an FYI it will not fit in a NORMAL sized SINGLE door. Would work fine for a Double door or patio door Or great for an attached garage. My dad had to remove the front window to get it in.

It also has an ammunition drawer at the bottom that runs the entire length of the cabinet. Also has White LED lighting running the top of the inside of it, with deer/woods cloth lining it. it wasn't fully finished but there was a turntable made for the middle of the cabinet to add more.

It is very sturdy (top can be used for storing also). It is honestly a one of a kind gun cabinet (and not in a bad way). 

I do not have any pictures to be able to upload but I can text them. Prefer cash (trades considered but not really wanted). You will need to bring a friend or two (it is not extremely heavy just extremely awkward). Also please bring a truck to haul or a trailer. 

Asking $200 OBO. Please either respond to this posting or text/call me at 4 one niner - ate 9 zero - sixer 9 zero seven.

I'm listing this here as ebay decided to pull my listing for this as it was an ""UBER scary"" weapons accessory based off a list that people from california.... You know what, no, I'm not going to make a joke here. What can I say about california that hasn't already been said, what original joke is left unsaid, what can I say that that state doesn't for itself? We all know what those people think of guns and the second amendment, but why the hell their reach expands beyond the confines of that state is beyond me. And ebay, so me a favor and do a search for AR or AK stocks before you try shoving your bullshit down my throat that I'm listing a ""UBER scary"" weapon accessory."

First bps I have is a grade III 3"" 12 gauge with a 28"" barrel. It is a beautiful gun with a nickel plated engraved receiver with ducks and Pheasents. The stocks are beautiful oil finished walnut. It truly is one of the prettiest pump guns ever made. It has an invector plus barrel and I have all the stock choke tubes, as well as an aftermarket terror choke. It is in great shape. The other bps I have is a 10 gauge with a 28"" barrel. It is camo, it is in fair shape, some of the camo is flaking and worn. I have a stock ic choke for it and a terror choke for it. This sucker will reach out and touch stuff. I also have 14 boxes of federal speed shok ammo in 10 gauge. That's 350 rounds. I was hoping to trade straight across for a benelli sbe2. To put it in perspective. The grade III bps is easily a $550-625 gun, they are fairly rare and aren't seen much. The terror choke that comes with it is another $100 new, so being used should be worth $50. The 10 gauge is reasonably worth $400 bucks. The terror choke that goes with it is $100 new, figure it's worth $50 used. 350 rounds of 10 gauge federal speed shok, this stuff sells for on average for $24-30 a box. They have been stored inside in addy environment. So being second hand it should easily be worth half that, so $175 bucks. I'm being realistic with these prices. And it adds up to well over $1200 on the low end. My guns function as should and have never given me a single issue, I expect yours to be the same and you to be honest with me. If you are interested in trading your sbe2 you can contact me at REDACTED, I'm willing to try shipping even though I have never tried it. I'm more than willing to send any pictures you would like or even video or whatever you wish. Thank you for reading my ad."

With sights and three extra mags and tax I've easily got $650 in this setup so my asking price is more than fair. Purchaser pays transfer fee and BG check. Original owner. Purchased a few months back.

Aimpoint® PRO
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.

• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world 
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with 
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
