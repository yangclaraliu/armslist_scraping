Receiver has normal wear from hunting use, internals all function well, action just as smooth as day one. Originally came as a combo with a vented ribbed field barrel and a smooth bore slug barrel with rifle style iron sights - really puts a rifled slug on target well. 

I cut the field barrel down to 18.75 inches (18.5 legal + .25 JIC), removed the ribs and smoothed the whole thing down. I never re-blued it or put a dot sight on it - have shot clay with it that way with no problem so accuracy is not compromised. 

The rifle barrel is unaltered and has a new rear aperature, just sighted in. It has taken several deer quite well and worked great with a 3X9 rifle scope. I prefer the iron sights though.

I replaced the original (composite) wood stock and forearm with an ATI synthetic pistol grip stock and matching forearm - which came with a decent butt pad. 

The receiver is drilled and tapped for two weaver/picitanny mounts. Magazine tube tool included."

I will not make initial offer, let me know what your asking please. Valid OH DL and CCW permit holder with cash in hand. Thanks"

If you want a real WW2 M1 Garand that you can buy and keep as an investment this one is it. Im pricing it fair to what others sell for on GunBroker and the CMP. $1,650 . It will come with ball ammo and tracer ammo you can shoot or display with the rifle."

As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS3 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of one-point attachment for direct action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments and quick-release, positive-locking hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system. Used in conjunction with the Magpul ASAP¬Æ plate (sold separately), the MS3 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS3 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS3 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand. The MS3 GEN 2 incorporates a new low profile quick-adjust Slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless, sling adjustment. Webbing length has also been increased for a comfortable fit with all body types and armor configurations. New colors are available in Ranger Green and Gray along with the original Black and Coyote. Made in U.S.A. and 100% Berry Amendment compliant E.A.R. Export Administration Regulations Controlled Product.

It's been a safe queen for too long. I have it currently mounted on a Tikka T3 .308, and want to guage interest before yanking it off.
I'm the original owner of it, it's only seen a few boxes of ammo fired with it mounted, and never been drug through the woods, only bench/target shooting. 
It is in virtually brand new condition, absolutely NO issues whatsoever.........guaranteed!
(In fact, if you have someplace close and convenient to shoot, I'll come over and let you mount it and sight it in, and THEN pay me for it. The scope is fantastic! )
These are 100% made-in-the USA, with fully multi-coated lenses, 1/4 moa target knobs with threaded covers, side parallax adjustment, 30mm main tube, and Mil-Dot reticle. I've also purchased Butler Creek flip-up lens covers, plus a Leupold 4"" removable sunshade.
It's also covered by Leupold's famous warranty, which means you could have bought it used at a garage sale with a cracked lens, and all you have to do is send it back to Leupold for replacement/repair. No kidding. 
If you're looking for a high-quality, long range Mil-Dot scope, you ain't gonna beat this deal. This scope retails for over $1100, and the absolute cheapest I can find these on-line is $900.
I'm not equipped to take a photo of the actual scope, so I borrowed a photo off the internet. More detailed information, and owner reviews can easily be found on-line.
Please respond via e-mail, using wording that lets me know you're not a spam-bot or a Nigerian scammer (in other words, don't just ask for my phone number, or ask if ""the item is still for sale"". I'll likely just ignore those.)
Only able to meet in N. Columbus/Harris county area.

Finest quality 5.56mm ammo made in Lithuania by GGG to exceed NATO specification. This is ""GP21"" ball ammo which is a ss109 / M855 type load, made to stricter quality standards than NATO requires. The ammo is brass case, non-corrosive and reloadable boxer primer. The projectile does contain a steel penetrator and is magnetic, but it is not color coded with a green tip as is traditional with US manufactured m855. 

Unlike most other ‚ÄòNATO‚Äô ammunition on the market GGG GP21 is new production; not old surplus, product overrun or ‚ÄòNATO like‚Äô imitations. GGG GP21 is 100% authentic military ammunition exceeding all STANAG and MOPI requirements. GGG manufactures and qualifies GGG GP21 ammunition to the same rigorous standards whether the end user is the US commercial market or a front line military combat unit. GGG spares no expenses in the manufacturing process using only the highest grade of brass with deep annealing that is excellent for reloading. The military grade boxer primers are non-corrosive, non-mercuric and exceed all sensitivity requirements for combat use. A high quality double base smokeless propellant is used. The full metal jackets are made from tombac. The case mouth and case primer joint have a waterproof sealing. The M2A1 cases are sealed with a full rubber gasket. There is also a wire and pressed stamp lock around the hinge which must be cut to open. As a result of both the quality manufacturing and the packaging, when stored in this fashion, GGG NATO ammunition has a minimum shelf life of no less than 20 years. GGG NATO qualified ammunition far exceeds the benchmark and typical performance of other NATO ammunition.

It's in GREAT condition for a gun of any age, especially one that's nearly 40 years old. The scope is a 3-9 Tasco.

This rifle doesn't have many rounds through. I believe I have fired only 4 rounds through it. I don't know how many the original owner fired but it's obvious they were very few. 

I will sell the gun, leather sling, scope and approximately 35 rounds of Winchester Cor-lokt for $450. 

The following are the things I am looking to trade my Marlin towards: 
1. Colt series 70 1911 blued, 5 inch. 
2. FNS 9mm
3. Beretta 92, 9, or a1 models in 9mm of course
4. High capacity, Semi-automatic ""assault rifles"" meaning, anything IMI, HK, Colt, Norinco, Arsenal, etc. No junk please.

The initial version of the P290 did not have re-strike capability. Meaning, if you had a round that wouldn't fire for whatever reason, you'd have to rack the slide to clear it and reset the trigger.
The RS model acts like a true double action and makes it to where you can just pull the trigger again to try to re-strike the same round to see if it will fire"

****
A Stun Gun is an electrical self-defense device that uses high voltage to stop an attacker. Touching a person with the prongs on the Stun Gun quickly immobilizes the attacker. However, because the amperage is very low, no serious or permanent injury is inflicted.

Stun Guns are designed to key into the nervous system. They dump their energy into the muscles at a different frequency than the pulse waves emanating from the brain. The pulse waves coming from the brain and those from the stun gun collide at the nerve synapse' which is a type of complex processing switch adjacent to each muscle group. The resulting energy collision makes it difficult for an attacker to move and function. This causes disorientation and loss of balance and leaves the attacker in a passive and confused condition for several minutes. Still, stun guns have no significant effect on the heart and other organs.

As a general rule, a one-half second contact from a stun gun will repel and startle the attacker, giving some pain and muscle contraction. One to two seconds will cause muscle spasms and a dazed mental state. Over three seconds will cause loss of balance and muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation.

However, don't think about how many seconds you should hold the Stun Gun to your attacker. Think about it this way. Throw out what the books say and the online information you have read about Stun Guns. You should hold your stun gun to the assailant until they drop and you can get away and call the police, whether that may be one second or six seconds.

The electrical shock that emits from the stunning device will not pass from the person being stunned to the person doing the stunning. The effect is localized only in the affected area and does not pass through the body."

Don't know why since I had already bought and traded another one away. This one started life as a blue label gun so it has fixed sights instead of adjustable rear that comes on the consumer 34. Comes with a Safariland retention holster and two magazines. In good shape and shoots great but has several blemishes. First, the rear sight has marks on both sides (guessing previous owner used punch to remove and re-install) and has a scratch/wear mark on the top of the slide. Guessing this came from debris in a holster but not sure. Doesn't impact performance and many people don't care about the cosmetics as much as I do but I want people to be aware of what they are looking at. I've adjusted the price down based on condition and number of mags so not willing to drop it any more yet.

****
A Stun Gun is an electrical self-defense device that uses high voltage to stop an attacker. Touching a person with the prongs on the Stun Gun quickly immobilizes the attacker. However, because the amperage is very low, no serious or permanent injury is inflicted.

Stun Guns are designed to key into the nervous system. They dump their energy into the muscles at a different frequency than the pulse waves emanating from the brain. The pulse waves coming from the brain and those from the stun gun collide at the nerve synapse' which is a type of complex processing switch adjacent to each muscle group. The resulting energy collision makes it difficult for an attacker to move and function. This causes disorientation and loss of balance and leaves the attacker in a passive and confused condition for several minutes. Still, stun guns have no significant effect on the heart and other organs.

As a general rule, a one-half second contact from a stun gun will repel and startle the attacker, giving some pain and muscle contraction. One to two seconds will cause muscle spasms and a dazed mental state. Over three seconds will cause loss of balance and muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation.

However, don't think about how many seconds you should hold the Stun Gun to your attacker. Think about it this way. Throw out what the books say and the online information you have read about Stun Guns. You should hold your stun gun to the assailant until they drop and you can get away and call the police, whether that may be one second or six seconds.

The electrical shock that emits from the stunning device will not pass from the person being stunned to the person doing the stunning. The effect is localized only in the affected area and does not pass through the body."

****
A Stun Gun is an electrical self-defense device that uses high voltage to stop an attacker. Touching a person with the prongs on the Stun Gun quickly immobilizes the attacker. However, because the amperage is very low, no serious or permanent injury is inflicted.

Stun Guns are designed to key into the nervous system. They dump their energy into the muscles at a different frequency than the pulse waves emanating from the brain. The pulse waves coming from the brain and those from the stun gun collide at the nerve synapse' which is a type of complex processing switch adjacent to each muscle group. The resulting energy collision makes it difficult for an attacker to move and function. This causes disorientation and loss of balance and leaves the attacker in a passive and confused condition for several minutes. Still, stun guns have no significant effect on the heart and other organs.

As a general rule, a one-half second contact from a stun gun will repel and startle the attacker, giving some pain and muscle contraction. One to two seconds will cause muscle spasms and a dazed mental state. Over three seconds will cause loss of balance and muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation.

However, don't think about how many seconds you should hold the Stun Gun to your attacker. Think about it this way. Throw out what the books say and the online information you have read about Stun Guns. You should hold your stun gun to the assailant until they drop and you can get away and call the police, whether that may be one second or six seconds.

The electrical shock that emits from the stunning device will not pass from the person being stunned to the person doing the stunning. The effect is localized only in the affected area and does not pass through the body."

Features
With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. Available in two compact models‚ÄîPT 111 and PT 140‚Äîthe Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment. 

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

Accessory Rail

###Please no more emails on this item right now.  I just looked at my receipt and I paid about $200 more then I thought I had.  I have a meeting with a guy tomorrow (Friday) morning and if he doesn't take it for $400 I'm raising the price to $500.  I realize now after a flood of emails it may be worth it.  If tomorrow's sale falls through I will reply to all who have emailed me with the new price and I will then update the price on this ad.  If the price says $400 please don't email me unless you are willing to pay $500 and be on standby for a Friday afternoon purchase. Any emails without phone numbers will be ignored.  Here is the text of the damage I have already sent the first several responders:

At one point I fired some over pressure reloads through it.  One of them exploded inside it.  The action was stuck and when I hammered it open the base of the shell broke off leaving the rest of the shell fused to the inside of the chamber. I was able to get it out but in the process I scratched the chamber.  I smoothed that out with a honing brush and a drill.  The base of one of the magazines was blown out at the time.  I put it back together and did the best I could to bend everything back into place but it seems to jam more with that magazine.  The fire control group (trigger, springs, bolt and carrier) all appear undamaged.  Just a heads up, I don‚Äôt want to mislead anybody.

792,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4048792,For Sale:  X26C Taser - 6 Cardriges + Holster [$650],"Salisbury, Maryland, United States",$ 650,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 18, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The TASER X26C Conducted Electrical Weapon(CEW), is based on our law enforcement-grade TASER X26 personal defense products, and gives you the same unprecedented take-down power trusted by thousands of police officers every day.

In a more compact form factor than our Advanced TASER M26C CEW, the X26C is designed to be comfortable to carry and easy to use for personal defense. When you flip the safety into the armed position, the device is ready to deliver an incapacitating pulse that is designed to override the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. This powerful Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology has been effective against even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

TASER CEWs use replaceable cartridges containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing giving you a personal defense product you can count on. The charge is transmitted between the two probes and is designed to jam the sensory and motor functions to inhibit muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 10 second cycles each time you press the trigger. The X26C CEWs can also be used in direct contact stun mode.

Effective

TASER CEWs are the only personal defense products that allow you to take control of your personal safety with the ability to incapacitate aggressive, dangerous people.

Safe

Safer and more effective than other personal defense options, such as sprays or direct contact stuns, which require potentially dangerous chemicals or close range to an attacker and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Keeps You Safe at a Distance

Unlike other personal defense products which require you to be close to the target, TASER CEWs are effective at a range of up to 15 feet, which keeps you out of harm's way.

Easy To Use

The TASER X26C has been designed for easy use during high stress deployment situations. Combining a LASER sight and LED light with a quick flip safety, the X26C allows you to respond quickly and effectively to a threat.

Police Proven

The TASER X26C is based on the same design used by law enforcement worldwide. It's designed to be compact and easy to carry and to give a 10 second cycle of incapacitation that gives you time to get in control of a threatening situation and get to safety

GREAT CONDITION, TASER NEVER FIRED, MINOR SCRATCHES BY THE GRIP, BATTERY IS 82% ( FULLY FUNCTIONAL) , GREAT NON LETHAL WEAPON, FOR SELF DEFENSE SECURITY OR POLICE

-24'' stainless barrel
-Badger Ordnance Rail, Leopold Mark 4 Rings, and a Super Sniper fixed 10x scope (mil-dot reticle) zeroed to 100yds, Harris bipod, all attached by a gunsmith.

Has an illuminated reticle and a tremendous amount of eye relief, giving you both the benefit of a medium-range rifle scope and the functionality of a red dot in a lightweight, compact package. 30mm tube lets in a whole lot of light. Battery life on this thing is ridiculously long due to a built-in motion sensor that shuts off the illuminated reticle after 5 minutes and instantly turns it back on upon any sort of motion. The turrets are customizable to your specific caliber and load (you must purchase any custom turrets from Leupold). The SPR reticle is awesome, and is the most expensive reticle Leupold makes for this line of scopes. Includes front and rear Leupold aluminum ultralight magnetic flip covers, which cost $50 each. No box or paperwork. Price is $500 cash, firm. I will throw in a Burris PEPR QD mount for an additional $25 (will not sell PEPR mount alone for $25, only if scope is purchased for $500). Any cash offers for less than $500 will be ignored. Will trade for Eotech XPS2-0 plus $100 cash on your end. Buyer must pickup in Lake Highlands area. Thanks for looking."

This gun is an absolute hammer with the two calibers I have shot with it. Desert Tech guarantees a 1/2 MOA group at 100yds (1/2"" group) and this gun easily lives up to that standard. Literally nothing wrong with the gun, just needing to move it to clear up some funds for some other life expenses. Everything is priced to move. Gun shows little signs of wear, and everything functions properly. One thing about the DTA worth mentioning is how the recoil is straight back due to the large amount of mass behind the trigger. This makes follow-up shots much easier. Gun weighs 10.5 lbs with the .308 conversion and 11 lbs with the .300 winmag and 6.5 Creedmoor conversion. trigger is tuned to a crisp 3lbs and is fully adjustable for creep and poundage. You will not be disappointed with this rig! Bipod in picture is not included. Willing to ship. Feel free to ask me any questions. Gun is pictured with 26"" 6.5 Creedmoor Conversion."

Browning BDM 9mm Double Action Pistol. It's in excellent condition with original 10rd mag and 2 new 10 round mags. Has had VERY little use if any at all. The Browning BDM was developed in 1991 by the Browning Arms Company, and unlike Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 Hi-Power model, was manufactured only in North America. The pistol is a magazine fed, self-loading, hammer firing type which was designed with a trigger ""mode"" switch installed on the left-hand side of the slide (actually only a flush inlaid disk with a bisecting groove), toggling between double-action/single-action(DA/SA) pistol mode, and the double-action-only (DAO) or ""revolver"" mode‚Äîthough, of course, other than the similarity of the trigger mode, the BDM has no resemblance to revolvers. This mode switch is what gives the handgun its name, with BDM standing for ""Browning Dual Mode"" or ""Browning Double Mode"". Variants of the design lacked the mode operating switch, and so were either full-time revolver mode, model BRM (Browning Revolver Mode), or full-time double action/single action pistol mode, model BPM-D (Browning Pistol Mode Decocker). Finishes included blued, matte-chromed, which Browning advertising called ""silver chrome"", and a two-toned combination of a silver chromed frame and blued slide, called the ""practical"" finish. The BDM and BPM-D variants have an ambidextrous slide-mounted safety/decocker lever, which when operated always returns the pistol to the hammer down double-action setting for the BDM variant or to the pre-cocked setting for the BPM-D variant. After the next fired cartridge cycles the pistol's slide, subsequent rounds are fired in the single-action mode, until the decocker is used to drop the hammer to the ""safe"" position. The BPM-D innovation was the inclusion into the action of the pre-cocked mode in which the hammer is partially cocked and the hammer spring partially depressed resulting in a first shot trigger pull that is shorter and lighter than in the true DA variants. The BRM variant lacks a safety/decocker lever, leaving the pistol in the hammer down ""safe"" double-action position after every shot, i.e. DAO. The BDM and its variants utilize removable cartridge magazines, of the double stack variety with a capacity of 15 rounds of 9x19mm Parabellum ammunition. To comply with the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, BDM magazines were limited to 10 round capacity for civilian purchasers, although 15 round magazines were available for law enforcement use. After the 2004 expiration of the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, 15 round magazines became legal and available in most states for civilian use.   It is estimated that there are less than 800 total of these pistols in existance and less than 100 of those would be in the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù finish."

I fired 3 magazines out of it and like all Hi-points, and many other brands, it's about halfway through a proper break-in period.  Everything should fire without any issues but a new Hi-point should have about 50 rounds through it before you can consider it 100% reliable.  I'm not selling the pistol because I have anything against the brand.  I own a Hi-point 9mm and love it for its reliability and accuracy especially with cast bullets.  The Hi-point return policy is second to none and you could return this piece to them with no questions asked should you ever have any issues.  Besides an almost new JHP, you get two 9-round magazines and a frumpy holster.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.
¬†
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
¬†
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

If you can find one which most dealers cannot new the 2014 production 329s are 999 plus tax and fees. 2003 models are harder to find. Serial number has no recalls. Functions perfectly.

Lets get the nonsense out of the way. Best trigger both sa and da ever. It is rumored online the 329PDs can crack or blow up, truth is there is one verified example of this and that was caused by a double load, some dummy who thought he could reload better than the ammo companies blew his 329 up and blames the airlite frame. Fact is many other S&W models have catastrophic failures at higher rates than all of the PD models combined. Another myth is bullets coming out of their crimp due to the supposed great recoil from the airlite frame, again this is true in a very few cases of reloaded ammo and cheap shelf 44mag. Yet another rumor is it kicks so hard its not fun to shoot. I have another 329PD 2003 model and its been fired over 2000 times shooting the most heavy and hot factory loads one can buy minus a few of the garrett cartridges that are loaded for specific non-smith and wesson revolvers. Never an issue never had to send mine back does not kick as bad as some lead others to believe. You either love magnum loadsnor you dont and if thats the case this can be a great 44 special firearm. The last rumor I already mentioned, price. Ive been told by some that they can grab a 329PD new for 900 out the door, or a great used one for 800. No you cant. Even the beat to crap ones are selling for 800 plus so please dont tell me I am asking too much. Private sale, tons of ammo and extras. This package is a steal.

The 940 was a modification of the original swing out cylinder model 929. The 940 was introduced in 1970 and remained in production until 1980 in two variations. This piece is the first variation with the frame mounted firing pin, 6"" round barrel with vented raised rib and fully adjustable rear sight. The second variation was introduced in 1973 and incorporated the patented ""transfer bar safety/ignition system"". The sister piece to the 940 was the model 939 which had the same features but was equipped with a slab sided 6"" barrel. Both these models were well made and had desirable attributes - but don't seem to have been big sellers at the time.
