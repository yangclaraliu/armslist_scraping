To give you an idea of price this model revolver is for sale at a local gun shop for $898 plus 7% tax and you do not come across them often.  I have fired this as you can see by the cylinder,  the cylinder has a Titanium finish so has only been wiped down so not to damage the finish (you do not want to use solvent on the cylinder, it very well may take the finish off).  The rest of the gun has been cleaned thoroughly.  The key for internal lock is included, the manual is not but just call S&W and they will send a new manual (I am planning on calling next week).

Although this looks like an AK47, it is different in several respects. First, it has a solid milled receiver -- unlike the stamped sheet metal you find on AK-pattern rifles. Second, it uses a striker fired action that its Czech designers felt was superior to the Soviet AK. The rifle has never been fired, so it's truly in new condition. It is flawless. It comes with five 30-round magazines, four of which are still sealed in the factory plastic. It sports the original Czech resin furniture, as does the bayonet that is also included. The bayonet has its original surplus leather scabbard. The scabbard has been decorated by what I'm guessing were soldiers during the Balkans conflicts during the 1990s. There are several pen drawings on it with 1990s references and Cyrillic characters. Pretty cool. In addition to all of the above, I'm including a brand-new Czech military surplus shoulder bag to hold the magazines or whatever else you'd like.

Currently set up for 5.56 / .223 but it is multi caliber so you can purchase additional kits from Bushmaster to shoot larger caliber rounds. Quick change barrel (no tools required) makes it a quick swap to change calibers. I only own the 5.56 / .223 kit.

Less than 500 rounds shot through it and it's in perfect condition. This rifle has been METICULOUSLY cleaned after every use, and it has only been to the range about 6 times

This is a piston rifle so the inside stays extremely clean unlike gas impingement because the recoil gasses and carbon from the round never enter into the chamber

Includes hard case, manual, sights, sling, 10/30 magazine, bullet button

I'm selling it because I just don't use it enough

MSRP is $2766 (I paid about $2400 new) so this is an amazing price in like new condition!

- Gas buster charging handle (for suppressed fire) new, $115

The 10.5"" 5.56 is DI LMT barrel w/ a AAC 51T Brake. never fired

The 8.5 .300 BLK is a Noveske barrel custom made for use w/ a MRP platform.

The 12.5"" piston barrel assembly was upgraded with a POF rollercam upgrade which has significantly smoothed carrier travel. And the plug on the piston is not the standard plug it is the upgraded version, that is offered by LMT's, that is for suppressed and unsuppressed fire. The difference between the standard plug and the upgraded plug is the standard plug only has one side that is open for fire the other is closed. Where as with the suppressed and non-suppressed plug there are holes on both sides of the plug to better regulate gas flow for when you are running either non-suppressed or suppressed fire. (The piston configuration was used with my other MRP, ~120 rounds to function test it.)

Package as is value is easily $3k, I know I'm not going to get $3k so asking $2.5k cash (OBO), open to trades. Going to put this on GB, but thought I'd list locally first.

351,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4361351,"For Sale/Trade:  4,310 Rounds of AK-47 Ammo","Near Faribault, MN, Bloomington, Minnesota",$ 950,"Listed On: Saturday, May 23, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale / trade are 4,310-rounds of factory 7.62 x 39mm ammo.  

I no longer have my AK-47 and I believe the days of having an in-depth plan for bugging out are behind us.  So I am selling a massive amount of 7.62 x 39mm ammo.  

Here is a breakdown of the 4,310-rounds:

122 grain FMJ (x 2,480)
123 grain FMJ (x 510)  
123 grain HP (x 140) 
124 grain FMJ (x 200)
154 grain SP (x 80)
Assorted factory ammo in full boxes (x 900) 

Pricing – I looked up the cheapest price I could find online (Sportsmansguide.com) and the largest lots they sold the ammo in (for lowest price) and I went below that price.  Yes, I am charging less – and they don’t even have the large quantities in stock, plus no tax, no shipping, and no membership fee.  

This is more than a weekends worth of fun!  You could store 4,000 rounds and still have enough for a fun range trip.  Plus the variety of ammo allows you to select your round based on use instead of just what happens to be in stock at Walmart.  

There are some battle packs included with the count above.  There are also three ammo cans and one ammo crate included.  

All of the ammo is labeled as non-corrosive.  Despite that, most of it is made in former Soviet-bloc countries and you should always assume it is corrosive; I believe that’s true of all ammo from those parts of the world.  

Armslist used to allow more pictures, but it would only let me use one.  I have more photos if you like.  

Trade.  I am looking for an AR or handgun.  The handgun can be a 1911 style in .45ACP or a revolver in .357 or bigger.  If our numbers don’t line up I’m open to discussion on that.  

I live near Faribault, MN and I would rather not haul this stuff to Duluth.  So if you can make your way closer to me that helps.

The patent-pending Magpul CTR (Compact / Type Restricted Military Model) is a drop-in replacement butt stock for carbines using mil-spec receiver extension tubes.

The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that eliminates wobble for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The Military Model includes a standard 0.30-Inch rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear."

Beretta has a history steeped in tradition with their Competition Shotguns like the Beretta 692 and DT11, and Field Shotguns like their Beretta 686 and SV10. They also offer modern day firearms like their innovative and exciting Cx4 Storm Rifle, ARX Series Rifles, and their famous Beretta M92/96, and Nano. Beretta USA has something to offer every shooter on the planet regardless of skill level or venue. After all, everyone should own at least 1 Beretta in their collection.Finally, a pistol in .22 caliber that looks like Beretta’s heralded ARX100 military assault rifle. Just like the military version, the ARX160 .22 LR is lightweight, user friendly, and an ergonomic masterpiece. This is a pistol full of cool features that will be a thrill to put its paces at the range. Beyond its striking physical and working similarities to the combat version, it also shares its ambidextrous advantages. The two-position safety, magazine release, and cocking handle can all be set to the right or left hand preference. Picatinny rails allow the user to build on anything they can dream, the rifle can be dissembled for cleaning easily without tools, allowing access to clean the barrel from the back round. There is also easy access to the bolt and trigger system, just like with a .223 Rem rifle. Constructed of reinforced polymer with flip up sights, the ARX160 .22 LR gives shooters the experience of shooting the world’s preeminent military rifle at a price they can afford. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.Specifications and Features:Manufacturer Part #: JXP21300Manufacturer: BerettaModel: ARX 160Action: Semi-automaticSize: FullCaliber: .22 LRBarrel Length: 8.5""Frame/Material: PolymerFinish/Color: BlackGrips/Stock: PolymerSights: Flip Up Front and Rear.  The rear sight is a peephole that rotates so that you can choose the aperture you wish.Ambidextrous, two position safety leverEasy access to the bolt and trigger system like .223 Rem riflePicatinny Rails following MIL STD 1913 in aluminum and polymerAmbidextrous magazine releaseCharging handle convertible from right to left when disassembledAdjustable polymer Flip Up sightsMultiple sling strap attachment points for how you wish to carry it20 rounds STANAG look magazineFor comparision purposes, Grab A Gun, known for their low prices is selling this same gun for $478http://grabagun.com/beretta-jxp21300-ark160-semi-auto.html"

Finish is nice with the only distracting areas being a slight 'arc' on the safety and the claw marks from the optics mounting device which are very typical for this weapon.  Date code HH.

Included is an original Hensoldt Ferro Z24 (Zeiss) third generation optic that is correct for this weapon.  This optic is mounted but was new never issued when I acquired it.  These are becoming increasingly hard to find and often sell for $799 when they can be found in this condition.  Original STANAG claw mount and case is included.

Accessories include original cloth two-point sling, reproduction operation manual and a spare parts survival pack (including rollers).  There are at least 24 magazines included in this sale.  They are a mix of steel and aluminum many still in their original wrappers.  They will be a mix of HK stamped and HK Contractor stamped rollmarks.  Most are 20 round but there are a few 5 and/or 10 round in the mix.  The buyer will receive all the magazines I have for this weapon.

This is a package deal.  I absolutely am not interested in selling the scope separately so please do not ask.  You would spend well over $3500 trying to put this package together on your own.  My advertised price of $3000 is fair and firm.  Please do not contact me to ask what my bottom price is.  No trades please.

Additional pictures are available via e-mail which is the preferred method of contact.  My cell phone number is REDACTED and voice calls are preferred over text messages.  If this ad is still posted the rifle is available so there is no need to send a text asking if it is.
