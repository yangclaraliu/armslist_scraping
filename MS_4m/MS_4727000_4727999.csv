1937 Izkevsk 91/30 7.62x54R with bayonet. Accurate, good clean proud engraving, numbers matching, early squared stock tip, magazine not lined through, buttplate not lined through, very good bore, not counterbored, strong rifling, shiny and smooth bolt, smooth trigger, earlier screwed in escusions, pre-war mfg, no comsmoline. Do not expect perfection...this a mil surplus rifle. This one shoots 2 inches with sorted/weighed silvertip surplus, it shoots under 1 inch with Russian 182 grain match, and surprisingly, under 1 inch with the old 1940's Russian lead core ammo. It shoots 1 inch with my hand loads. It shoots point of aim at 100 yards....exactly with the 182 grain and handloads, and close to POA with the silvertip. I went on a mission to find a very accurate mosin...and I did...after trying 20 plus rifles I found one that shoots 1/2 inch groups....I am keeping that one as well as the hex receiver rifles...this rifle is the runner up on accuracy but is a round receiver.   My goal was to embarrass the youngsters next to me with their modern $5000 tactacool rifles....it has been fun. This rifle is a good one with MUCH better than average mosin accuracy....PROVEN an accurate mosin....much more accurate than the ""sniper"" Mosins I shot against.   A word about russinan snipers......they are mostly fake snipers......even the rifles that were rejected as snipers, or drilled for a sniper scope mount and never used as such are sold as snipers.  Do you really think the russian sources are not drilling and plugging the receivers so they can get a higher price.    Rifle $250.  Also have one sealed can of Russian surplus ammo....lead core....almost impossible to find now.....the ammo is actually more collectible than the rifle at this point.....this is my last can of lead core7.62x54R   This rifle prefers the lead core.....I have the targets to prove it.

Ive shot 200 rnds to break in per manufacturer spec. ONLY high quality new brass. Not one misfire/load or jamb. Just cleaned it. Never seen rain/dirt/sand/salt. Practically new. I just don't shoot it enough. Well over $1500 in gun.

$150 Thrunite 1100 lumen flashlight with extra thrunite batteries and charger. This flashlight is badass! Do some research best light for money. Killer battery life and you can focus the beam to see 300 yds through scope easy. Poormans night vision.  --- make offer

Burris 332 scope best all around----  $make offer

Plus over $200 in Magpul conv. I can sell the whole gun alone or scope/flashlight whatever; also have some ammo but will not be low balled on any of this, so don't try. Im not desperate but make reasonable offers.  ----- make offer $

Oh and add up what you are actually getting with your gun. Some used guns look loaded with good stuff but a lot of it ends up being crap bc people strip their guns of the quality parts before selling it. I have not. I don't intend on having an AR any time soon so here is all of the goods.

History:

George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company. He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995. In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design.

That brings us to the 2nd Pistol. The Keltec PMR-30, is as new, and has only been factory test fired. It too comes with 2 30rd mags, and will additionally include factory case, manual, and other accessories/papers.

This pkg. is $1500. A cash sale is preferred, but a cash plus pistol trade may be considered with more towards the cash end."

Comes with one magazine and no box. Stamped 1957 with 2 import marks and no pitting on the finish. Picture is for reference only and not actual photo of this firearm. The Beretta Model 1934 is a compact, semi-automatic pistol which was issued as a standard service firearm to the Italian armed forces beginning in 1934. It is chambered for the 9 mm Corto, more commonly known as the .380 ACP.Armi Beretta SpA of Gardone Val Trompia has a history in firearms manufacturing reaching back to 1526, when they were established as a maker of barrels. But it was not until 1915 that, responding to the needs of the military during World War I, they produced their first pistol, the model 1915. Beretta has become one of the world's largest pistol makers and the model 1934 (M1934) was their most numerous product in the pre-World War II era.It was designed and purpose-built for the Italian armed forces. In the early 1930s, the Italian army was impressed by the Walther PP pistol. Beretta did not want to lose a big military contract to their German competitor and designed the M1934 for the Italian Army which accepted it in 1937. This model was followed by the M1935, which was similar to the M1934 in most respects, except that it fired a .32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning) cartridge.Pistols made during the Fascist Era are marked with their year of manufacture in two forms: the conventional Julian date in Arabic numerals and the date in the Fascist Era in Roman numerals. The Fascist calendar commenced on 28 October 1922, so a pistol from 1937 may carry either ""XV"" or ""XVI"" as its Fascist year. Pistols taken by the armed forces usually exhibit acceptance marks stamped into the frame on the left just above the grip: ""RE"" (Regio Esercito) for the army, ""RM"" (Regia Marina) for the navy, or ""RA"" (Regia Aeronautica) for the Air Force, always in the form of an Eagle wearing a Royal Crown for the Royal air force. Police pistols may be marked ""PS"" (Pubblica Sicurezza). The Romanian military, at the time an Axis power, also purchased model 1934 (and 1935) pistols. The calibre marking appears as 9 mm Scurt (short in Romanian) rather than 9 mm Corto.[1] Romanian Army M1934's differ from Italian M1934's in that the Romanian pistols use the Russian sight picture, where the Italian pistols use the standard sight picture used by Western armies.An M1934, serial number 606824, was used by Nathuram Godse in the 1948 assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The pistol, manufactured in 1934, was carried by an officer during Italy's invasion of Abyssinia and subsequently taken by a British officer as a war trophy. It is not known how it came to India, but Godse was given the unlicensed firearm by a co-conspirator"

Winchester’s 1873 rifle was the “Rifle that Won the West.” It is chambered in the economical .38/.357 Magnum cartridge. A cowboy could have both a lever-action rifle and his six shooter, and needed only one cartridge belt for both. Most Texas Rangers and every old West cowboy worth his salt carried 1873 rifles. Chappo, the son of Apache war chief Geronimo, packed an 1873. And Buffalo Bill carried an 1873 lever-action rifle along with a pair of .44-40 Colts in 1876 when he worked as an Army scout. This piece of rifle history is available in a variety of distinctive models including this Special Cimarron branded Deluxe Short rifle. Don't let that fool you though, it has a 10+1 capacity and power to spare."

Feels and shoot great! Very accurate, I have managed to get a 1/2 or so sized hole from a full magazine at about 7 yards (yes, that was a very good day for me). The gun is easily more accurate than you or I am. The trigger has a very short amount of take up, but a very light clean break. I managed to get any of the ""grit"" out of it by breaking the trigger in a touch. It's a great trigger, not top competition level, but very respectable. 

Only one or two very light blemishes in the finish, really will only see them if you angle it in the light. 

Reliability has been good if you keep it happy with lube. As with any 1911. 

The amount of movement between the frame and stide or bushing and barrel is pretty much non existent. They made this gun with very tight tolerances. 

Only reason I will sell is if I get a good offer, I am on absolutely no rush to sell or to get rid of it. I love the gun, just looking to try something new. 

Anyways, the gun is in excellent condition, very smooth, very pretty, and fires very well! 

I have the origional case, owners manual, trigger lock and magazine. I will also toss in a barrel bushing tool. Why not."

Need to clear out a little inventory and am getting rid of a few extra items I have. 

The gear:

Item 1: 
AR500 Sentry Plate Carrier w/ Armor & Pouches (Coyote)
SKU: AR500-SNT-CY
Retail: $215 (Originally paid $300)
Priced: $150 

Manufacturer Product Page: 

http://www.ar500armor.com/sentry-plate-carrier-w-armor-and-pouches-coyote.html#.VgbRiY9VhBc

Condition: 

Bought this less than 1 year ago. Thought I would end up using it but never did. It has no wear/tear - it is in pristine condition.

Misc:

- Optional features purchased (included):
- Curved Ergonomic Plates
- PAXCON Coating: PAXCON Line-X Build Up  (+$50.00)
- NOTE: Does NOT come with the ""MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Universal)"" - the price is reduced to account for this value.


Item 2:

Warrior Assault Systems 901 Elite 4 Chest Rig with 2 Utility/Admin/Compass/Single Pistol/4 x M4 Open Mags - Multicam

Condition: 

Purchased this in spring 2013. Used it a few times when shooting for sport, was never used hard in the slightest. Is extremely durable, has no visible wear/tear. 

Misc:

- NOTE: W-EO-901-EL4-MC is the Coyote Tan version, this version is Multicam. Both retail the same.
- NOTE: WAS Chest Rig @ Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Assault-Systems-Utility-Compass/dp/B00M1X1QF2


Other:

As a note for those looking at this, you can remove one of the two armor plates from the AR500 rig and put it in the front plate-carrier section of the 901 rig. Fits very nicely.

I would prefer to sell both at once, but if there is an individual buyer interested in one only, I'll still talk with you. 

If you do buy both, I'll throw in a pair of PIG Full Dexterity Tactical (FDT) Alpha & Alpha Touch Gloves (Large). They retail for $29.99 @ SKDTac (http://www.skdtac.com/PIG-Full-Dexterity-Tactical-FDT-Alpha-Glove-p/pig.700.htm).


As this is already priced to sell, I am not wanting to go much lower than the current listed prices. I am willing to meet in the Chapel Hill / Durham / Raleigh area with buyers. Cash only please. No trades.

Happy Saturday!"

Imported by European American Armory (EEA) Corp. this early 2000s production model is factory fresh, still in Russian oil and packaging. This is the standard stock model, ready to convert to a pistol grip style if desired. It comes with the factory 5-round magazine, but will accept larger capacity magazines.  I also included a 10-round ProMag magazine.  Side rails are included for mounting optics. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resists corrosion, and makes for easy cleaning, and an extended life.  An oversized trigger guard allows for use with gloves.

Hey all,
	I have for trade/sale a used but good shape Mossberg Model Maverick 88 12 gauge. It is in good operating condition and good cosmetic shape. Like most, it could use a good cleaning.This also has the improved cylinder choke installed. This could probably use a new front bead, or just sue it like it is. I would also consider trades for guns in the same price range, 7.62x39 HP ammo, 22 magnum rifles, revolvers, and possibly other items as well.
	Need to meet in Norman on this due to my schedule. To make any offers, either shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here.

Has an awesome trigger brake with minimal recoil. This rifle is suppressor ready. I've shot about 1,000 rounds through it so it has plenty of barrel life still. Weighs approximately 9.5lbs. Barrel and upper receiver has M4 feed ramps. Barrel is chambered for 5.56 NATO. The rifle is fully ambidextrous. I've listed all the parts along with the price that I paid. Plus I'm not counting shipping so its cheaper than what I paid for. I'm also willing to make it an even $2850. This Custom AR has the bells and whistles. You can feel the ruggedness and toughness of the rifle when you hold it in your hands. The greatest features on this rifle are the Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group, 2-Stage Geissele SSA-E Trigger, JP Silent Captured Spring Buffer, Magpul UBR Stock w/ Picatinny Adaptor, Ambi Controls on the Lower, both Upper and Lower are Billet, Advanced Armament Corp Muzzle Brake, and the Adjustable Gas Block. Rifle has a few scratches here and there. The target shown is a 20 shot group at 50 yards with Federal 62gr Green Tip ammunition.

These are fairly rare variants of the AK with the Spike Bayonet. This is one of the guns that sat in customs and languished for years because they were on their way over here when importation from China was banned. They were finally released and had to have their Chinese Receivers destroyed and rebuilt on USA made B-West Receivers. This has all Chinese Polytech parts minus the receiver. It has the highly polished stainless steel bolt and carried as well as the highly polished blued receiver. The action is smooth as butter and overall this is the nicest looking and smoothest firing AK I've ever had the pleasure of owning. I had the B-West receiver properly heat treated at a local smith shop at the cost of $300 just as a precaution as the word around the net is some of these B-West receivers weren't properly heat treated and since then I've put several hundred rounds through it with no signs of deformation and it's been a flat out joy to shoot and it's even nicer to look at. If you look these up you will see original Chinese Spikers bring $1500-$2000 and the Spiker assemblies and Chinese wood furniture bring $400-$500 a piece by themselves so you should find this one quite the bargin. Will come with one 30 round magazine. Will ship to your FFL anywhere in the lower 48 for an extra $30 to cover shipping. Paypal payment is preferred if shipping. Email, call, or text REDACTED"

And the CZ 453 Varmint in .17HMR with hammered Fluted Barrel and Set Trigger mated to a beautiful Turkish Walnut stock redefined the level entirely.
Unfortunately the 453 varmint is no longer produced; the replacement 455 just does not deliver the same performance. This has placed the 453 in high demand.
This rifle although incredible out of the box was immediately handed to Matt Babb of Bentwood Gunsmiths Las Vegas, truly one of the masters of long range performance for a $500 tweak. Crowned, bedded, polished and set up for average ¼ MOA. To say this rifle is accurate is an understatement. At 100yds single hole 5 shot groups are the norm, even with a moderate level shooter. It has seen very few rounds, as I was using it as a long rang trainer. 
This rifle is incredibly fun to shoot, everyone who has shot it from range masters to new shooters falls in love with it.  I said I would never sell it but life dictates otherwise. 
It is very well packaged in a black aluminum wheeled case, scope, bi-pod, cleaning kit, and 200 rounds.

Blurb from Pentel -

USA Made 

Tactical Cobra EDC (Every Day Carry) Belt

Size: Med (31-38"") Based on pant waist size, not true waist size

A 1.5 inch belt featuring a 1"" Cobra Buckle. The 1.5 inch width fits through standard pant loops of all manufacturers.

Color: Black

The Pantel Tactical Cobra EDC Belt uses the pinnacle of heavy duty buckles...Cobra buckles. What is so special about this buckle you might ask? Well a common problem in other belts is that the webbing strength is rated  higher than the buckle. The Cobra Buckle is rated closer to the webbing at 1500lbs. The integrated locking element  permits fast adjustment of strap length. It is both compact and strong.

The quick release functionality is intuitive and smooth in which one pushes the tabs down at the same time. If just one tab is engaged the connection will still hold and fully relock on its own once released. No need to worry about the buckle unlatching while bending at the waste or sitting in a vehicle

 All stitching is clean and uses MIL-SPEC TYPE 92 thread. These specs make the belt about 1.5"" wide, which is a good width and still fits in the vast majority of military/civilian  style pant belt loops. The adjustment end is tapered for ease of use and well melted to prevent fraying.

The end result is a nice stiffness to comfort ratio belt which is great for attaching a holster or sub-load to. It's as stiff as a duty belt, but offers more rigidity than most leather belts. The quick release capability makes it great for everyday use when you just need to go to the bathroom or expose your crotch for other fun activities :) .

This belt isn't cheap by any means ( mostly due to the high cost of Cobra buckles), however those who want a premium belt will be more than pleased. Buy one and be prepared to be spoiled.

Sizing for the Pantel Tactical Cobra Riggers belt is based off industry standards, your pant waist size (not your actual waist measurement)

The Cobra Rigger's Belt is in use by members of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and line troops around the globe.

I have not LIVE fired the gun, so I can not verify that it still shoots, but I have dry fired it and everything seemed to work just fine. Also, the ejector rod head was missing and has since been replaced with a new one to make the gun ""complete"".Per Michigan law, any potential buyer must have a handgun purchase license or a license to carry a concealed handgun in order to complete this sale. I'd like to meet in front of a FedEX Office or OfficeMax/Depot, as I will be making a copy of either the handgun purchase license or CCW permit and attaching it to a signed ""Bill of Sale"" that I will keep for my records. I will also give the buyer a copy of the signed ""Bill of Sale"" for their records as well. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! I am more than willing to work with anyone, but I only ask that you are serious about purchasing this firearm, as I don't want to waste your time, and vice-versa.
