This is a Colt Diamondback revolver, chambered in .38 special. This excellent firearm functions in both single and double action, has very manageable recoil and is flawlessly accurate. Perfect for target practice, home defense, or even as a collectible, this is my favorite gun out of my whole collection. Manufactured by Colt from 1966 to 1988, this model was very popular because of Colt's long-established reputation as an innovator in the manufacture of revolvers.

While the revolver is functioning flawlessly and has no major condition issues such as rust, the exterior appearance is below ""collector"" condition. The finish is discolored somewhat along the barrel, the hammer has a bit of wear, and this is a step below what you would expect in a museum-quality piece. Someone looking to acquire a collectors item could restore this for a few hundred dollars by re-doing the finish and have an heirloom-quality revolver at an excellent price just in time for Christmas.

Sale will take place in Columbus, cash or pre-agreed trade. I can meet Thursday or Friday during the day on the North side. To ensure compliance with federal laws, only Ohio residents with a state-issued ID, and legally allowed to puchase a firearm will be considered.

It is in wonderful condition and this weapon shoots as good as it looks. I purchased this in 2013 with the intention of carrying it at work. I had a custom holster made for it and obtained some additional magazines. I put a few hundred rounds through it to break it in and to qualify with it. I really LOVE this gun and finally understand why 1911's are so popular. Unfortunately, it is simply too heavy to carry on my hip for 40 hours a week. Regrettably, I must sell it and get something a little more practical. My loss is your gain. This sale includes:

(1) Sig Sauer 1911 Carry -Scorpion
(1) Factory case and paperwork
(2) Factory Magazines
(2) Wilson Combat Magazines -Black
(1) International Handgun Leather custom leather holster -left-handed (can likely be used as a cross draw by right-handers)

I know there are several of these out here on Armslist, most are more, some are less but they don't include Wilson Combat magazines and a custom holster. Nothing is worse than buying a gun and then having to wait weeks before it can be carried. Not the case here.

Manufactured in the early 1980s, the model 66-2 was popular with police and the general public for its combination of stopping power, manageable recoil, ease of carry as a sidearm, and the absolute reliability of a revolver. This gun also has the flexibility of using .357 magnum ammunition for home defense or full-size carry, while also using the smaller load of a .38 special for target shooting, better recoil management and less expensive ammunition.

Sale will take place in Columbus, cash or pre-agreed trade. I can meet Thursday or Friday during the day on the North side. To ensure compliance with federal laws, only Ohio residents with a state-issued ID, and legally allowed to puchase a firearm will be considered.

IL Residents:
I am an FFL, so valid IL FOID, background check, 24 hour wait for long guns and 72 hour wait for handguns is required. I can not meet anywhere, as the BATF requires I only do business at the address on my FFL (or gun shows)
Please email a picture of your FOID card if you would like to purchase the firearm.
Once I get the FOID pic and we agree on price via email, the mandatory wait starts (since we have it on record at that point). After the mandatory waiting period, you can come and fill out the form 4473 and pay for the firearm.As long as the background check clears you can take the firearm with you that day.
Since I am home based, business hours are by appointment only.
Out of state/shipping:
I can only ship firearms to your local gun shop/FFL. 
Your local shop/FFL will need to email me a copy of their license."

I will use the money to fund my granddaughter's college account.

I added a few things to this pistol that were optional in 1998. From the invoice: Round complete pistol for tactical; install Madagascar double diamond grips with stainless hex head grip screws; install Trijicon night sights front and rear (full disclosure: they no longer glow); two extra Baer stainless steel magazines (for a total of three).

This pistol was guaranteed at the time for 1.5 inch groups at 50 yards.  This is now a $295 option on 5"" and 6"" steel pistols and the Tactical Package is $70. So new retail on this gun from Baer's website is now $2645 plus shipping.  Selling at what I think is a fair price of $1900 firm  with no wait.

     This particular handgun was designed by S&W with no external safety, geared toward law enforcement so they can draw and shoot without worrying about flipping a safety. On the down side to compensate the trigger pull is much heavier than most other handguns on the market. It's a little tricky at first but the heavy pull forces you to focus on the fundamentals on trigger pull making this, in my opinion, a perfect starter or practice handgun. 
       Comes with original case, first fired shell casing, box of 100rds (opened), 2 magazines, leather Don Hune holster (left handed), Blackhawk paddle holster OWB (right handed, not in pictures).

The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil.The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery(May come as Duracell DL2032 or Energizer ECR2032).Check it out Here"

This has been out just twice for duck and goose so I'd say a total of at most, 15-18 rounds. It comes with the OEM chokes as well as a couple of Carlson waterfowl extended chokes.

The camo pump runs $499.99 new, which is what I paid, minus the sales tax. You aren't going to find a new one any cheaper than that. Benelli doesn't discount their guns.

Although mine is in like new condition, it has still been shot so I'm only asking $399 for it.

So even with the $25 FFL fee (that's what mine charges), you are still saving a $129 off a new one (new is $499.99 plus sales tax for a total of $547)

Meet in S. Hill Puyallup.

I will consider firearm related trades at full retail value of $499. Let me know what you have."

The MX-5 is an excellent middle of the road Perazzi shotgun which never received the sort of marketing push in America that it deserved. As such, many of the MX-5s that made it to the USA were actually imported via British dealers. This shotgun is one of those, and was imported about 10 years ago. It is a beautiful shotgun, made on an SC3 receiver and featuring stunning Perazzi No. 7 engraving (scroll and rose) and an extraordinary walnut stock and forearm. This is an unusual combo, as most SC3 shotguns were plain-sided. And to make things even better, this shotgun comes with an additional forearm and stock, which features an adjustable rubber comb. The LOP is 14 3/8"" and the barrels are choked for I-mod and extra full.

This MX-5 Olympic Trap comes in its original textile and leather factory hard case, and has all original Perazzi tools and manuals. The additional forearm and adjustable stock will ship in a separate box. When this shotgun was purchased, it had a cost of $9000 (6000 english pounds, $9000 USA with current exchange rates). But due to some reasons, this will go for $2499. This is a beautiful gun from one of the premier manufacturers of OU shotguns. Don't let this one pass you by!

We are very proud of our excellent customer service reputation, and ship all purchases within two business days of receipt of cleared payment and FFL information. All firearms must ship to an FFL. NO EXCEPTIONS. Shipping is a flat $30, and while insurance is not included in this cost, it is offered and highly recommended!

Trades: I generally like S&W revolvers, Colt revolvers, Glocks, Sig Sauers, M1 Garands, Arsenal AK's, maybe AR uppers, but I'll consider any quality firearm trade offer.

I'm listing my Wather PPKS pistol in .380 ACP for sale or trade. It's been a fun gun since I bought it, but as I honestly don't carry it much I thought I would see if I could sell it towards a new carry piece or trade it for the same. It has been regularly maintained and lubricated, and the stainless steel finish has some minor scuffs but is at probably 80-90%. If you haven't enjoyed shooting small polymer .380 carry guns due to their recoil, this might be a good choice for you as the steel frame tames a lot of recoil. Made in America by Interarms (not Smith and Wesson) under license by Walther. I've found it to be quite accurate and controllable when firing. 

This pistol comes with: 

-Original Walther hard plastic case
-Original manual and test target from the factory
-Two original Walther ""flush fitting"" magazines
-One original Walther magazine with finger extension
-Cleaning rod

You're getting it as I received it, with an extra magazine. It hasn't been shot too much or endured hard use and has treated me well. The magazines have also recently had the springs replaced with Wolff springs to ensure reliable and consistent feeding.

Price is negotiable and I am open to reasonable offers.

Rugged, Reliable, Always-Deployed Relief Sighting

Lightweight, streamlined backup sights are built on the K.I.S.S. principle to ensure the tactical operator has a reliable, always-deployed sighting option if the main optic fails. One-piece design slides easily on a MIL-STD 1913 rail and clamps securely with a single machine screw. Rounded edges and recessed attachment screws resist snagging on other gear. A1.5 Rear Sight combines the windage adjustment drum of the original USGI A1 rear sight and a flip-up A2 aperture with large .190"" peep for close range and .060"" peep for long-range targeting. Compact profile doesn’t hang over the rear of the receiver to interfere with the shooter’s access to the charging handle.

I' am selling a blued Interarms Walther PP. It comes with original Interarms case, cleaning rod, and 2 magazines. The firearm is is good condition inside and out although it has minor wear on the top left of the slide, scratches on outside of chamber, what looks to be minor wear/small rust spots on the back and front of the grip possibly due to handling and not wiping down, and what could be CLP buildup from previous owner on the front and rear sights (difficult to clean out). The previous owner (owned it 4 years) and I have not fired the firearm. I will send more photos once contacted.

Regardless of the wear on it the firearm still looks great and most likely functions great and that is actually part of the reason why I' am selling it. With the excessive moisture in my household I have to constantly check on it and don't have the time/money (holidays) to invest in better supplies to maintain the overall firearm. I would rather have it under the care of someone who will take better care of this classic! 

Will meet at either Peninsula Guns and Tactical or Jackson Arms.

The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on.

FM63 Infrared Filter for 1.47"" Diameter Bezels
The FM63 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight. 

NOTE: Infrared filters are not useful with white-light LEDs (light emitting diodes), which produce negligible infrared radiation. 

Fits: All flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" bezel

FM63 Infrared Filter for 1.47"" Diameter Bezels
The FM63 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight. 

NOTE: Infrared filters are not useful with white-light LEDs (light emitting diodes), which produce negligible infrared radiation. 

Fits: All flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" bezel
