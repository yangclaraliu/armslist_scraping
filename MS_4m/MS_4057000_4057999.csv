If the price is to good to be true it most likely is. A seller asking for payment in money order sent to a location outside the state that the listing is currently listed in is a HUGE RED FLAG. If the seller gives every excuse in the book for not being able to do a Face to Face transaction it should indicate a HUGE RED FLAG. The seller asking that payment be sent to a P.O Box in some obscure area is another indicator of a scammer. Look at the listing itself does the listing seem rather technical with plenty of very specific details and the pictures seem very professionally set up. While not all will be scams it would be best to check GunBroker to ensure that info and pics didn't come from a GunBroker listing.

People don't allow your excitement and desire to find a great deal get in the way of your common sense. If you send money to these scammers you can basically consider your money lost Law Enforcement has little that they can do and the likelihood of you ever getting your money back is VERY LOW to non-existent.

Helpful tools for your toolbox: Do your research, if the deal seems to good to be true tread carefully. Ask the seller to jump on Skype or use face time on a smart phone. You as a potential buyer get to see the firearm to ensure that the seller is in fact in possession and you get to visually inspect the weapon prior to meeting up with the seller. Also and most important using Skype and or Face Time allows for both parties to get a visual on who they are dealing with and if you feel the need to take a screenshot to ensure that if for any reason any party intends nefarious intentions said party will not get away without Law Enforcement having a mugshot."

I bought this gun for my fiancée, but she won't commit to carrying a gun because she can't take it into work with her and would have to leave it in the car. If she's just going to go shoot targets with me, she can shoot my full size gun which jumps less for her. I have no use for a compact 9mm, so I'm selling it and taking a small loss. These sell in stores for $350, I paid 349.99 and tax. I'm asking $325, and you can save yourself the tax on a brand new gun with a full lifetime manufacturers warranty. A purchase permit or CPL and RI-060 form are necessary. I will have the RI 60 form printed out with the information on it, ready to go. I can send more pictures on request. Thanks.

This rifle was manufactured by Anschutz in Ulm, West Germany and imported by Savage.  It is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle.  It has a grooved receiver for easy scope mounting and the action is fed by a detachable 5-shot (or, 10-shot) magazine.  It has a 22” barrel, folding rear sight, hooded front sight, and the rifle is 40” long, overall.   

According to the proof stamp on the barrel, it was manufactured in 1965.  It is in very good condition for its age, with approximately 97% blue condition and light handling marks on the stock.  The blond walnut stock has a Monte Carlo cheek-piece, skip-line checkering, and a rosewood fore-end tip. There are no real “dings” in the stock, but there are a couple of small areas where the varnish/finish has thinned through to the wood.  The screw-heads are all in excellent condition.  Apart from the butt-plate, there is no plastic on the gun.  

The bore is shiny-bright and the rifling is crisp.  Mechanically, the rifle is excellent and it is a very accurate shooter.  The scope is a Simmons "".22 Mag"" 3-9 x 32 with a plex reticle.  It is mounted with Burris steel rings.  Apart from the stock design, this model 141 is strikingly similar to Anschutz’ current model 1416, which has the same Anschutz 64 receiver and uses the same magazines.  The current model 1416 retails for around $1050.  I’m selling this rifle for $480, delivered.  Will send to your FFL or local gun shop.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Aimpoint® Micro T-1

    Rifles

Excellent night vision compatibility

The clearest, brightest image possible

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

 UPDATED REMINGTON MODEL 700™ TITANIUM GETS A NEW LOOK AND NAME - THE MODEL 700 ALASKAN TI
October 17, 2006

Madison, N.C. - In 2001, Remington revolutionized the world of production rifles when we introduced the Model 700 Titanium Ultimate Lightweight bolt-action rifle - the lightest production rifle on the market, rivaling custom rifles at a fraction of the cost. For 2007, the Model 700 Titanium gets an updated style, enhanced features and a new name - the Model 700 Alaskan Ti, available in nine versatile hunting calibers ranging from the medium range 7mm-08 Rem to the full-power .300 Win Mag. It is incredibly strong, impervious to the weather and amazingly accurate; and it weighs a mere 6 pounds!

At the core of the Model 700 Alaskan Ti is the strong, yet lightweight, receiver milled out of a solid block of Titanium. Spiral flutes are added on the bolt body and the bolt handle is skeletonized to remove additional weight while increasing bolt rigidity and cycling capabilities. And with all the great features of the legendary Model 700 bolt-action platform, this rifle offers the dependability and ""out-of-the-box"" accuracy that hunters and shooters have come to expect.

The addition of several new features to the Model 700 Alaskan Ti enhances performance, durability and updates its look. The new Remington X-MARK PRO™ trigger helps to deliver extraordinary accuracy with a trigger that breaks like glass, has virtually no creep and comes with up to 40% lower factory set pull weight. The clean 24-inch magnum contour barrel with Light Varmint style fluting is constructed of durable 416 stainless steel. The longer barrel length optimizes velocities while the fluting reduces weight and improves heat dissipation. The magnum contour barrel with fluting provides for magnum caliber chamberings (not previously available in the Model 700 Titanium) without adding significant weight. The barreled action is pillar bedded into a rugged Bell & Carlson carbon fiber synthetic stock, enhanced with a black and gray webbed paint scheme. This well-designed stock also features the new MaxxGuard™ protective coating which provides a soft touch, easy-grip finish for solid-handling in even the harshest weather conditions. Also new for 2007 is the addition of a hinged floorplate magazine with four-round magazine capacity in the short and long action calibers and three-round capacity in the magnum offerings. Completing this high tech package is the addition of sling swivel studs; receiver drilled and tapped for scope mounts; and revolutionary R3® Recoil Pad which significantly lessens recoil in this lightweight rifle.

Getting to the top of that mountain won't be as difficult with the amazingly lightweight and durable Model 700 Alaskan Ti. Getting your trophy won't be either.

The Model 700 Alaskan Ti rifle is available in 7mm-08 Rem, .25-06 Rem, .270 Win, .280 Rem, .30-06 Sprg, .270 WSM, .300 WSM, 7mm Rem Mag and .300 Win Mag at suggested retail prices ranging from $2105 to $2225.

Full-size SIGLITE Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts. The SIG Anti-Snag (SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, and has the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. 
Has the short-reset trigger (SRT) with a 10 lb DA trigger and a 4.4 lb SA trigger pull.
Build date is in 2013. Fired a couple of boxes through the gun. Excellent accuracy that is well balanced and has flawless operation.

Comes with (3) 10 Rnd. Mags that fit flush and (1) SIG P229 12 Rnd mag (as shown in pic) with matching grip extender for bigger hands and 2 extra rounds.

If you are looking for a quality controllable .40 for CCW use, then the SIG P224 should be at the top of your list.

SIG's aren't cheap, so don't expect to get one for Glock, SA or M&P prices.

Also selling off one of my NIB Un-worn high end watches. Breitling A74380 for $1850.

Knowledge is a powerful thing when placed in the right hands. Uninformed buyers are paying over $5000 for used Rolex Submariners and $9000+ for new; when the Submariner's can't even come close to this Breitlings specifications: 
1. This Breitling model WR rating to 500m/1650' and accuracy to within 10 seconds per year. Power reserve 8 year battery life.
2. VS. The Rolex Submariner's WR rating of 300m/1000' and accuracy to about 1825 seconds per year. Power reserve is about 48 hours before it stops.

The Breitling B74 “SQ” movement is 182.5 times more accurate than any Rolex automatic ever made and can handle much higher shock ""G"" forces than the Rolex or any automatic watch made.

Will consider handguns as possible trades with cash for my Breitling."

UPDATED REMINGTON MODEL 700™ TITANIUM GETS A NEW LOOK AND NAME - THE MODEL 700 ALASKAN TI
October 17, 2006

Madison, N.C. - In 2001, Remington revolutionized the world of production rifles when we introduced the Model 700 Titanium Ultimate Lightweight bolt-action rifle - the lightest production rifle on the market, rivaling custom rifles at a fraction of the cost. For 2007, the Model 700 Titanium gets an updated style, enhanced features and a new name - the Model 700 Alaskan Ti, available in nine versatile hunting calibers ranging from the medium range 7mm-08 Rem to the full-power .300 Win Mag. It is incredibly strong, impervious to the weather and amazingly accurate; and it weighs a mere 6 pounds!

At the core of the Model 700 Alaskan Ti is the strong, yet lightweight, receiver milled out of a solid block of Titanium. Spiral flutes are added on the bolt body and the bolt handle is skeletonized to remove additional weight while increasing bolt rigidity and cycling capabilities. And with all the great features of the legendary Model 700 bolt-action platform, this rifle offers the dependability and ""out-of-the-box"" accuracy that hunters and shooters have come to expect.

The addition of several new features to the Model 700 Alaskan Ti enhances performance, durability and updates its look. The new Remington X-MARK PRO™ trigger helps to deliver extraordinary accuracy with a trigger that breaks like glass, has virtually no creep and comes with up to 40% lower factory set pull weight. The clean 24-inch magnum contour barrel with Light Varmint style fluting is constructed of durable 416 stainless steel. The longer barrel length optimizes velocities while the fluting reduces weight and improves heat dissipation. The magnum contour barrel with fluting provides for magnum caliber chamberings (not previously available in the Model 700 Titanium) without adding significant weight. The barreled action is pillar bedded into a rugged Bell & Carlson carbon fiber synthetic stock, enhanced with a black and gray webbed paint scheme. This well-designed stock also features the new MaxxGuard™ protective coating which provides a soft touch, easy-grip finish for solid-handling in even the harshest weather conditions. Also new for 2007 is the addition of a hinged floorplate magazine with four-round magazine capacity in the short and long action calibers and three-round capacity in the magnum offerings. Completing this high tech package is the addition of sling swivel studs; receiver drilled and tapped for scope mounts; and revolutionary R3® Recoil Pad which significantly lessens recoil in this lightweight rifle.

Getting to the top of that mountain won't be as difficult with the amazingly lightweight and durable Model 700 Alaskan Ti. Getting your trophy won't be either.

The Model 700 Alaskan Ti rifle is available in 7mm-08 Rem, .25-06 Rem, .270 Win, .280 Rem, .30-06 Sprg, .270 WSM, .300 WSM, 7mm Rem Mag and .300 Win Mag at suggested retail prices ranging from $2105 to $2225.

They knew it was a superior single shot design and they knew it had to be a Winchester. The partnership began in 1885 and the Single Shot became the Model 1885 Winchester."

If I didn't disclose that it had 25 rounds down range you would not have known the difference. Really nice concealed carry gun, just looking for a different caliber and looking at other options.

I verified this by running a few boxes of Winchester white box through it and it functioned perfectly.  I also purchased 4 of the factory 20 round magazines.  It also includes a 2-10 rnd mags plus a 30 round mag that I cannot tell the mfr.  That leaves me in the position of wanting something that will shoot that Russian stuff.  It's a bummer because it's a great functioning firearm, and beautiful.  After doing more research on the topic, it's true that the American Ruger likes American ammo.  So please keep this in mind.  Of course, the trade will all have to be done by a FFL dealer. So arrangements will have to be made...."

i am located between myrtle beach and conway.
i have done some homework in an attempt to ask a fair price.
i am not unreasonable or hard to get along with. i am also open to trade offers.

top is a remington 870 express super mag 12 gauge pump action shotgun. it  holds 2 3/4"", 3"", & 3 1/2"" shells. it has a 26"" barrel and a 10+1 tube. THIS SHOTGUN HOLDS 10+1 of 2 3/4"" shells or 7+1 of the 3 1/2 shells. also has a tactical strap on the fore end and steel follower so no hang ups from the tube extension. msrp is 469 and i see these on sell new for 400. this one shows it's age some in looks but still functions flawlessly. all of this considered with the add ons my cash value is at 350.

in the middle is a lightly used like new mossberg 835 ultimag waterfowl edition with dual bead sights and 28"" ported barrel. this one also holds 2 3/4"", 3"", and 3 1/2"" shells. it is factory setup with no add ons. factory msrp is 530 and i've seen these on sell in the ball park of 450. given the excellent condition of the shot gun my cash value on this one being used is 400.

bottom is a ruger 10/22 40th anniversary edition with less than 150 rounds fired. i have the black factory 10 rd mag and the factory book on this gun but not the clear mag that also came with these special edition rifles. i know it's probably not worth much more than a regular 10/22 but this thing is so much fun it'll probably take some sort of trade that really grabs my interest. trade value really depends on trade but i'll say 300

3000 small pistol primers and 2000 small rifle primers (CCI)

A few hundred large rifle primers (200-300)

Some small quantities of rifle powder (a few lbs total of a few types) and some cartridge boxes.  A cheap digital scale and a bullet puller.  

Estimate it would take over $800 or so to buy this stuff new.

I also have a ton of 9mm and 38 brass, as well as some amount of 380 .40 and .45 brass.  I might consider throwing that in with the right deal.

All the stuff is new or like new.  

The only bad side is that I think the small powder measure may be missing from the setup.  However from what I understand, Dillon will basically replace missing parts for free.

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

I have a one of a kind rare lakeside belt fed ar-15 upper that I bought new and has a 10"" barrel. I had a barrel blank cut to 6"" long and machined (still needs the chamber cut, but thats it) This allows for a suppressor to be positioned under the handguard. So thats 2 barrels. Comes with: 2 100 round cloth belts, 1 200 round cloth belt, 1 200 round disintigrating links. Ammo not included. 3 200 round custom boxes bought from Southern Raider here on gunbroker (they are a must and built like a tank compared to the plastic ones that break). The plastic charging handle was tossed and a new one machined from stainless thats hollow to cut down on weight. On to the bolt. It has a trip that was machined from steel (believed to be stainless too) and secured with a roll pin for those running full auto and its not going to wear out due to size and material. It comes with 5 loaders and 1 belt opener. The quad rail has protectors and a MFT front grip with battery compartment. Has an original lakeside brass catcher that the ammo boxes attach to. Also has the buffer and carbine spacer. Round count is around 400 shot through it. This is one sweat setup that I hate to part with but priorities first. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. It is a short barrel so know your laws. Will ship to your home. No ffl required. If paid by certified check item will be held until it clears. USPS MONEY ORDER IS BEST FOR QUICK DELIVERY. FTF is best    Thanks"

So 1000.00 for this set up is a good price given the condtion of this optic. I have the box and all the manuals for it. it is the EBR-MOA FFP (first focal plane) which means your zero is good at any power level unlike most scopes. DO NOT LOW BALL ME this price is my bottom dollar. I just want to go a different route with my rifle.  I am not looking on a trade or anything. Just 1000.00 cash no lower. Im not trying to sound like a dick but seems no matter what someone always tries to lowball or send a text hey whats your bottom dollar. If you can get this cheaper somewhere else thats awesome but remember shipping costs or tax. i have priced this under what you can get it for on the internet. viper does not allow this optic to be priced under 899.00 plus this is mounted on a safari land mount and has the anti cant.

It's a 1945 Remington Rand 1911 chambered in .45 ACP. At some point it was made in to an NM or bulls-eye gun and has a larger front sight along with a very early Bomar rear. It was also reblued at some point and the finish is polished/glossy with some nitre/plum controls. I've replaced the bushing with a custom fit stainless one from EGW. The grip safety only works about 50% of the time and if I kept it that's one of the few things I'd probably replace along with the rear sight. I'm including the original bushing which is so tight I had to more or less hammer it out as well as two additional sets of grips. It only comes with the original magazine. In person sales only and you'll need a CHP or PPP. We'll also do a bill of sale.

The IBNS can also be used in the field thanks to its strong, waterproof tub floor. Its instant deployment, waterproof floor, and four corner buckles make the IBNS an efficient, fast-access shelter to protect soldiers from insects while asleep or resting on a cot OR in the field. In addition, the IBNS is designed to be upgradable to our EBNS using a single pole and fly. This givesyou protection from the elements in addition to the IBNS’s unsurpassed protection from insects. The IBNS is constructed of 70 Denier 1.9 ounce ripstop nylon and fine mesh. It is EPA registered and has Permethrin bonded to the material for insect repellency. It is supported by a strong and ultra-light .134 diameter pultruded fiberglass rod which winds around the shelter, expanding it to its given shape. When the rolled up IBNS’s cinch strap is removed, the shelter is released and snaps into shape automatically; no assembly or set-up is required. A carry bag is included. The coiled, stored size of the shelter is 13” x 13” x 3”. Since they pack so small they are perfect for ""bug out"" or disaster bags. CPAI-84 Fire Retardant rated. The Improved Bednet System can be upgraded to the Enhanced Bednet System with the Catoma Bednet Upgrade Kit.
