This 16” version of the venerable M1A can be an effective close quarters battle rifle or just a great “ranch gun.” This rifle has the minimum length barrel for a rifle under federal law.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design.

The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant edge finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. This new SIG SAUER P238 edge is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.
 
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
 
With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
 
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

The stock shows normal wear, again a few scratches, not into the wood, and a couple small dings that i think would come out with a little work. A nice piece for it's age. The only negative is the butt pad. It was my grandfather's gun and he was a tall person with long arms hence the homemade butt pad. Would make a very nice shotgun for a youngster starting out.

270,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4169270,For Sale:  Mossberg 12 gauge 18 inch Barrel for model 500 5 shot 3 inch bead Sight with Trench type Heat Shield NIB,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 129,"Listed On: Sunday, April 17, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: XB90015hs Many if not most gun owning households have a Mossberg 500 on the premises. The Mossberg might not be as prestigious as a Remington 870P, but it is just as durable, if not more so. Photos show a specimen of Mossberg’s 18 inch barrel for standard model 500s, and we have outfitted it with a Trench type heat shield. This apparatus will give a wood stocked 12 gauge model 500 an appearance similar to the classic Winchester model 12s issued to many of our soldiers in Conflicts from World War Two through Vietnam. It will also turn a model 500 field gun into a compact and formidable home protection device. Barrel Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg of Torreon, Mexico, the facility where most of the company’s barrels have been made for the past 20 years. Construction is U.S. steel, explicitly labeled on the barrel. Chambering is for 12 gauge shells, both for 2 3/4 inch and for 3 inch shells interchangeably. Finish is semi-gloss blue. Length is 18 5/8 inches of bore proper, measured from the muzzle to the breech face. Overall length is 19 11/16 inches from the muzzle to the end of the chamber hood. Heat shield is black polymer construction, manufactured in the world’s most populous nation. It attaches with four screws in front of the barrel lug, with an additional brace over the chamber area of the barrel, as the photos show. This barrel will fit any Mossberg model 500 shotgun chambered in 12 gauge whose magazine tube will hold 5 each 2 3/4 inch shells, and whose magazine tube measures 13 1/2 inches from the receiver face to the end of its magazine tube. That includes over 95 percent of Mossberg 500s in existence today. It also fits Western Auto Revelation 310 series 12 gauge pump shotguns; it also fits Wards Western Field models 505, 509, 524, 534, 536, 539, 550 all variants, because those were made by Mossberg for Western Auto and for Montgomery Wards beginning in the 1960s. It will not fit an 8 shot model 500 whose magazine tube is 19 inches long. It will not fit a 20 gauge Mossberg; will not fit a .410 gauge Mossberg; will not fit the dump lever of a 1947 John Deere Manure Spreader. It will only fit Mossberg 500 series pump or slide action shotguns whose magazine tubes hold five 2 3/4 inch 12 gauge shells. It will not render 1960s and 1970s production shotguns that were chambered only for 2 3/4 inch shells magnum capable. A similarly configured Winchester model 12 like the one showing in our World War II photo will command prices in the four figure range. We’re offering this brand new Mossberg 18 inch barrel, complete with Trench type Heat Shield, all for only $ 129.00.

( bought him a youth 7mm-08 wetherby). The caliber wasn't too much for him the gun is too long. It has had 2 boxes of shells through it. It has not even been taken into the woods. One trip to the range and it's just too much for him. His new gun came with an adult stock also so he will never need this one. I have kept it in the safe for about 2 years now and Its one that I never take out. Sooooo I'm selling it off. I am looking for a ruger .17 hornet or a youth semi 20 ga shotgun. It has a NRA 3x9x40 with a BDC reticle. They are lines not circles. I am selling the gun with the scope but if your not interested in the scope and rings I'd do 400$ for just the gun and the bases. It has a detachable magazine.

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sonic’s was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.
Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business. 
Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short, they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock for better fit and  reliability.

The gun is equipped with an extended shell tube (8rds) and it has nice aftermarket diopter style iron sites.

The gun itself is in immaculate shape, not a scratch or blemish on it anywhere.  It was only fired a handful of times to insure functionality after the upgrades, beyond that it has sat in my safe untouched.  It was built with the intentions of using it for home defense but I have since upgraded to a biometric safe and handgun and just don't have any use for a shotgun.  I am trying to fund another project and this is the logical choice to liquidate for those funds.  This is a good deal on this shotgun and as such the price is pretty firm.

It is not the new P228/M11. This model precedes the 229 and uses the same mags. It is in great condition, nickel is bright, with a slight amount of discoloration in one spot on the bottom of the slide from a holster rub, otherwise finish is perfect, and is mechanically perfect, shoots great and functions perfect with a variety of ammo, and has a dim set of night sights, may possibly have been original. It comes with the original grey plastic case, manual, and 2 hi-cap factory mags. The 2 new mags in package in photos are extra cost, everything in great condition. If it doesn't sell I am fine with keeping it. Get this one and have something all of your friends don't have. I have had all kinds of cheap guns offered for trade, not even close, so no trades.

I have too many folders and I am paring down a bit.  I do not have boxes for any of these knives.  
All of the knives were professionally sharpened by Precision Sharpening near Lincoln and Seneca.  They are sharper than they were from the factory and I take all of my knives to them to put the best edge on.  Each knife has an individual price. 

1) Cold Steel Ti-Lite (Zy-Ex) 4"".  This is the ""lesser"" expensive version which has a zytel handle instead of a metal handle.  It is super light weight, has a slick double ground long blade.  It has a false edge on the back side (only one side of the knife is sharp).  It was great for pocket carry and didn't get in the way.  I prefer serrations in a blade and didn't end up carrying this around as much. 
[B]$40 obo[/B]

2) Emerson/Benchmade CQC7 Spec War Model Tanto blade (stone washed).  This was my EDC knife for a while.  It proved extremely reliable, tough, sharp, and has been a good knife.  The tanto edge had a minor knick, which I had Precision Sharpening re-work.  Aesthetically, the transition from the 1st edge to the 2nd edge had to be moved but this does not affect function.  If you like having a nice knife and want to have one that you can use and not cringe when you have to cut something, this is your knife.  It was an early model with the bead blast finish.  The blade is clean and smooth, despite the minor discoloration[B]$80[/B]

3) Emerson Mini-Commander 2002 Drop point, partially serrated blade.  This was a backup knife I carried.  I wore it to work but it was never/rarely used.  I carried multiple knives and this was strictly a SHTF knife.  It has a beautiful mirror polish on the edge as a result of the buffing/sharpening.  It also has the wave/crest pocket opening feature.  Just like the other Emerson, the blade is nice and thick.  [B]$135[/B]

These knives were meant to be carried, so I'd rather give them the chance to do their thing versus sit in my drawer.  The only trade I am interested in is an OTF, preferably Microtech Ultratech.
