Look st the price on the bag and look them up online and you will see this is a steal. Changed my carry gun so I got another one of these holsters for my 10mm as they are  the most comfortable IWB holster around.

Details:
The CTAC is an inside the waistband all-Kydex holster for concealed carry. Designed to be worn behind the hip at the 4:00-5:00 range, this holster is perfect for concealed carry in warm weather or humid climates.
The CTAC Kydex body provides a rigid material that is custom fit to each firearm exactly and retains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth, low friction surface allows for fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents. The CTAC is recommended for hot or humid climates.
The holster attaches to the belt by two clips mounted to leather tabs on either side of the holster. These mounting clips distribute the weight of the loaded pistol while holding securely to the belt. A shirt may be tucked in over the gun and holster complete concealment.
Most Comp-Tac Clips offer 5 holes allowing for complete adjustment to the cant and ride depth of the holster."

This particular Hakim still has the Egyptian unit number painted on the stock. It's in amazing condition and is a great shooter. A GAS ADJUSTMENT TOOL IS INCLUDED. The detachable magazine holds 10 rounds. This rifle will always attract attention at the range."

It's time to get an AR 15. Either you need your first one, or another one, or one for your brother, or your girlfriend. 

Get the M&P 15 Sport. The holy grail of budget ARs. Skip the cheap carbon fiber crap. Or the other no name cheapos. Research the 15 sport for about 10 minutes I challenge you to find a single negative review of it. Standard A2 front sight, picatinny rail has enough room for a red dot and magnifier if you use the right mounts.

This one is about 4 months old and has 400 rounds through it. Not a single jam or malfunction and that's with budget ammo. Has been cleaned religiously. Dead balls accurate. 

And you can pick and choose your accessories. I can leave it with all the upgrades I've done and sell it for $675, and then add the pictured ammo as much or as little as you need for $5 a box (total of 480 rounds). Get it all for $775 out the door.

Or I can strip all the upgrades off and it's yours for $550. It came with one P-mag and the magpul flip up rear sight.

Or anything in between.

Here is a little more info on it
7.62 Russian (7.62x54R), Norma Hunting, 180 Grain Jacketed Soft Point Bullet, 20 Round Box.

You can count on Norma.
You have to be able to count on the cartridge you’ve loaded and count on the bullet to do its job. Safe and effective regardless of how or what you’re hunting. We know what’s important when things get serious and we never leave anything to chance. The nature of Scandinavian hunting varies from the beech wood forests of Skåne to open cultivated lands with wild boar, red and roe deer, to pure taiga and tundra with moose, bear and game birds. The span is huge, when it comes to surroundings, weather and hunting conditions. We always consider this when we work on development so that we can create cartridges that you can always count on.

The Soft Point is a conventional half jacketed bullet primarily intended for small to medium sized game. The bullet opens quickly, and at high velocities it is suitable for smaller game where immediate shooting results are desirable.

They are discontinued and are not going to be produced anymore and are appreciating in value.

     I have two Beretta Model 96 (.40 S&W Caliber) Pistols up for sale or trade.  I'm looking to get rid of one or the other, but not both...so take your pick.  Here are the details.

THIS AUCTION IS NOT FOR BOTH GUNS PICTURED!  ONLY ONE OR THE OTHER IS TO BE SOLD OR TRADED!!

Black Version:
*Looks and functions like brand new.
*500+ rounds down the pipe, but NO wear on the frame or barrel.  Bore is still bright, unpitted, unfouled, and the rifling is still sharp.
*Equipped with Trijicon Tritium Night Sights - 6 years of illumination left on the sights, but will still be white 3-dot sights after the tritium fully decays.
*Hogue finger-grooved grips.  Still in good shape, but some mild palm wear.
*Comes with two, 11-round magazines.
*Comes with your choice of case shown in pictures.
*No manuals or literature included.

Stainless (INOX) Version:
*Looks and functions like new.
*Exactly 77 rounds down the barrel.  No wear on the frame or barrel.  Bore is still bright, unpitted, unfouled, and the rifling is still sharp.
*Equipped w/ Novak red 3-dot sights.  These are NOT illuminated, just red in color.    
*Hogue Finger-Grooved Grips.  Like brand new.
*Comes with two, 11-round magazines.
*Comes with your choice of case shown in the pictures.
*No literature or manuals included.

Price is $575 for either one.  
I WILL deal with out of stater's, but only through an FFL.  In-state transactions will be face-to-face with bill of sale, and ID required.

Let me know what you've got to trade, but no low-baller's please.  I expect trade offers to have been worth at least $700 when new - which is what these guns (with their add-ons) cost new.  DON'T BOTHER offering me a trade where the cost of your gun new is what I'm asking for mine used."

Pictures show gun with some finger and oil smudges from the factory bag.(NO DAMAGE) Coloring is pure and perfect. I am willing to take payment via PP gift if you desire. Just an option if wanted. 2300 OBO

Good for concealed carry, the nightstand, or glove box. Doesn't look to have been shot much.   Bore is excellent. Grips are excellent. Real steel in the parts that need it. Nice and tight lock-up.  Not a shot/beat to death gun. Some jerk responded to this listing that it looked duracoated, but it looks original to me.  Even if it was duracoated, I don't see how that would be a negative anyway.   Definitely doesn't seem like a painted redo.  To good a shape for a tackle box gun. Has some minor finish wear, but in very good shape cosmetically for its vintage.   Photos show that front sight is missing. I found a stock replacement sight,which has since been installed.

Up a Fantastic shape, October 1942 M1 Garand Parkerized ($600 process) used in service during the WWII war. This gun WAS NOT BUILD but actually used in the War! It has 2 little scratches in it but overall people have told me ""this is in excellent shape"" for a service rifle. 

This gun is 95% original and I have all the serial numbers of each part as well. The reason its 95% is the bolt and hammer have been changed out when most of the M1's were sent to Korea to be refurbished in the 50's after the war. Since this was a service rifle and corrosive primers were used, the bolts corroded and they replaced them in bulk. Some people like this history of the gun so I left it as is. No worries though on   you can get the original serial numbered Bolt for that year (new in box also) for $89 and its a 100% rifle (I even have the guys email you can get it from)

I have attached a few photos attached, it comes with what is shown in the photos and I can meet anytime as well.

Cash only, no trades. If you have a reasonable offer send it but im pretty close on what im looking for! I can email more pictures, just call/text your email.

Up a Fantastic shape, October 1942 M1 Garand Parkerized ($600 process) used in service during the WWII war. This gun WAS NOT BUILD but actually used in the War! It has 2 little scratches in it but overall people have told me ""this is in excellent shape"" for a service rifle. 

This gun is 95% original and I have all the serial numbers of each part as well. The reason its 95% is the bolt and hammer have been changed out when most of the M1's were sent to Korea to be refurbished in the 50's after the war. Since this was a service rifle and corrosive primers were used, the bolts corroded and they replaced them in bulk. Some people like this history of the gun so I left it as is. No worries though on you can get the original serial numbered Bolt for that year (new in box also) for $89 and its a 100% rifle (I even have the guys email you can get it from)

I have attached a few photos attached, it comes with what is shown in the photos and I can meet anytime as well.

Cash only, no trades. If you have a reasonable offer send it but im pretty close on what im looking for! I can email more pictures, just call/text your email.

Up a Fantastic shape, October 1942 M1 Garand Parkerized ($600 process) used in service during the WWII war. This gun WAS NOT BUILD but actually used in the War! It has 2 little scratches in it but overall people have told me ""this is in excellent shape"" for a service rifle. 

This gun is 95% original and I have all the serial numbers of each part as well. The reason its 95% is the bolt and hammer have been changed out when most of the M1's were sent to Korea to be refurbished in the 50's after the war. Since this was a service rifle and corrosive primers were used, the bolts corroded and they replaced them in bulk. Some people like this history of the gun so I left it as is. No worries though on you can get the original serial numbered Bolt for that year (new in box also) for $89 and its a 100% rifle (I even have the guys email you can get it from)

I have attached a few photos attached, it comes with what is shown in the photos and I can meet anytime as well.

This innovative Fobus tactical holster was created in answer to many requests to provide a carry system that would accommodate a handgun utilizing accessories that were either rail or trigger guard mounted. The GLT answers this request, and more! In addition to allowing the carry of handguns that have accessories such as lights or lasers mounted under the barrel or on the trigger guard. Fobus has addressed safety and retention concerns that are unique to this model holster. The handgun is held securely in place by utilization of a muzzle stud and a safety strap that encircles the trigger guard. While assuring positive retention, rapid presentation of the handgun is made easy due to the open withdrawal slot on the rear of the holster and the design of the safety strap."

Band of Brothers Rifle known as ""The Rifle that Won World War II""

Cash only, no trades. If you have a reasonable offer send it but im pretty close on what im looking for! I can email more pictures, just call/text your email.

Up a Fantastic shape, October 1942 M1 Garand Parkerized ($600 process) used in service during the WWII war. This gun WAS NOT BUILD but actually used in the War! It has 2 little scratches in it but overall people have told me ""this is in excellent shape"" for a service rifle. 

This gun is 95% original and I have all the serial numbers of each part as well. The reason its 95% is the bolt and hammer have been changed out when most of the M1's were sent to Korea to be refurbished in the 50's after the war. Since this was a service rifle and corrosive primers were used, the bolts corroded and they replaced them in bulk. Some people like this history of the gun so I left it as is. No worries though on you can get the original serial numbered Bolt for that year (new in box also) for $89 and its a 100% rifle (I even have the guys email you can get it from)

I have attached a few photos attached, it comes with what is shown in the photos and I can meet anytime as well.
