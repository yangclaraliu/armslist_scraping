I am selling/trading a lot of my 40cals to change over to 9mm, with the exception of maybe one or two. I have the Compact version of this gun and i decided to keep that one instead of this. I'll sell the gun but am very open to trades. Like i said, im looking to replace my 40's with 9mm. However i might consider another 40cal trade depending on the gun. 
Please no shotguns, Highpoints, Kel Tec ect.....
Another S&W, Glock, FN, HK, Walther, CZ, Sig Sauer.
Ill even pay the difference to even out the value of the trade.

Slide coated by Rock Your Glock in their ""DuraBlack"" and the barrel has been hard chromed (also by RYG). The work was done in December 2014. At the same time of the coating, I had them install a set of AmeriGlo pro IDot NS.

I stippled the frame that mates with the slide and recently shot it in a GSSF match as an ""Unlimited"" entry (due to stippling/frame modification). I am keeping the frame and doing a true Unlimited pistol with LWD slide, threaded barrel, etc.
All that being said, if you want a complete gun, please understand that this was my 2nd attempt at stippling, so it doesn't look like your custom shop stuff. However, it doesn't look completely terrible, and it works great, for me (have put it through some shoots and classes, etc.) Nonetheless, I can provide pictures of the frame upon request. I am primarily looking to keep the frame, but you can always knock my socks off with a great offer.
As to what I am looking for in terms of a deal... (in no particular order)
1. Cash - make an offer. But do your HW on what a complete slide goes for.
2. Gun - make an offer. See #1. I can add mags & ammo etc.
I do have a fondness for Gen2 Glocks & RIA 1911's.
3. I am looking for a OD/FDE Gen3 frame for a G22. I would do a straight trade.

specs=  The rifle perfectly replicates the length of pull, sight radius, height of rear sight from the comb of the stock, the distance from the butt stock to the rear sight, distance from the butt stock to the front sling swivel, magazine dimensions and the height of the front sight.
•The rear sight has ¼ min elevation and windage adjustments. To put it in 10 meter terms, it takes roughly 4 clicks to move you a scoring ring, and there’s enough travel in the sight to allow for aiming points ranging from sub-six to 12 o'clock in the aiming black.
•The rifle uses compressed air and gives you up to 130 shots per refill.
•The cylinder is filled using just a normal scuba tank. It takes less than 10 seconds to refill once the cylinder is screwed off and attached to the scuba tank."

Made 1926-1928 only 40 to 50,000 were made. The star stamp was put on by inspectors that felt the gun was exceptional. Following these gun was the HS prefix which is not as valuable as a collector gun as the S prefix only. (Very few) are found today with the Lyman peep sight also. I've seen these gun with dents in the cartridge tubes or kinked cartridge tube springs. This gun is perfect in both areas. Bluing remains on the barrel and some case hardening remains on the receiver. I would rate the gun at 75 to 80% considering it is 85 yrs. old. Blue book of gun values at 80% prices it at $2750.00 and that is the 34th addition not the current book value. Top of the barrel is stamped The Marlin firearms Corporation and underneath that New Haven Conn. Where the barrel sets into the receiver is stamped .22 S-L-LR. The gun cycles perfectly feeding and ejecting the cartridges. Bore shows good rifling. Muzzle crown is excellent. I will accept Money Orders only.

Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.

To register, click on this link: http://nrainstructors.org/SignupStudent.aspx?id=317052

We have four spots still open.

This NRA Basic Pistol Shooting Course is being taught by my, Marcos Avellan, and I'm a certified NRA Instructor who has also trained under Navy Seal Jared Ogden and Green Beret Grady Powell (both as seen on National Geographic's Ultimate Survival Alaska)- and most recently I got to train with former Navy Seal Team 6 member Zak Jackson. This is an 8 hour course (includes range time) that teaches basic handgun knowledge (both for semi-automatics and revolvers), gun handling skills, shooting fundamentals, positions, gun maintenance and much more. 

The price of the course is only $125. There are no range fees - but ammo is not included. We provide guns at no charge.

To register, click on this link: http://nrainstructors.org/SignupStudent.aspx?id=317052

Minimum age to attend the class is 13 years old and all minors must register along with a parent or legal guardian. You do not need any experience to take the course - and experienced shooters alike will learn from this course. You do NOT need to own a gun to participate, we do provide loaners pistols for those that need it.

Finishing the course also meets the state of Florida training requirements towards getting your concealed weapons permit (so you don't need to take a concealed weapons course after).

Lastly, if you have aspirations of being a NRA pistol instructor, this class is a prerequisite towards doing so.

""Danl. Fraser Black Isle Scotland"" is stamped on the barrel of this lever action, single shot, falling block .22 Hornet rifle. I believe from what I can find it is made in Italy. A rather scarce rifle with a miniature, almost Farquaharson style, action. 24"" part round, part octagon barrel has a ramp front bead sight. The rear sight was removed and a base was machined to mount a scope base. I am the second owner of the rifle as I do not have the original double leaf rear sight. Numrich OEM part #1370710 can still be ordered for $20 bucks. The rifle weighs under 5 lbs. and shoots amazing. When I bought the rifle years ago, my research explained this particular rifle had problems with the firing pin because of weak metal pin, so to avoid problems, my local gunsmith years back make one out of drill rod alleviating this potential problem. It has performed flawless. The rifle will out shoot me, under 1"" MOA (even with my shaking hands) with 35 gr. hornady v-max at 100 yards. No known defects, bluing wear on sides of falling block as would be expected because of moving part. One tiny ding on the bottom of the cheek weld (very hard to see). Excellent metal, never carried hunting, always kept in climate control safe. Cash in person or buyer pays all shipping fees to your FFL. I will send from my FFL dealer. Money order, cashier check. I will send shipping confirmation as soon as payment clears. Other photo's upon request. Email is best for response. $600.00 O.B.O. Thanks and God Bless!"

I bought this holster a few months back to carry my P226, but only used it one day and ended up selling the gun, so no longer have a need for the holster. So, it is near new. If you don't know Milt Sparks, you're missing out on the best holsters available for CCW. Make a big gun disappear with this thing. Message me with any questions. Thanks."

I've had it for a while but I've never used it in a game, only plinked with it in the backyard.

The suppressor is foamed and a very small foam block is installed, they do actually reduces the report quite a bit. 

It comes with 4 mags total, the one wrapped in bubble wrap has never been used by me, it's been like that since I've gotten it. The mag pouch has already been sold and will not be included. The ""Brügger & Thomet"" part of the trade has been removed but the ""MP9"" is still intact and visible. 

Overall it's a really fun gun, but I just can't justify having it around since I don't play anymore. 

Asking $275 FTF or shipped!
I think that's a reasonable price, the magazines themselves are quite pricey. Speaking of which, none of the magazines leak last time I checked and I always keep the orings well lubed and maintained."
