Reason for selling is I just haven't gotten much use out of it due to life schedules, etc. Maybe 100 through the chamber.

I will also include an extra magazine, giving you a total of 3. Also included is a custom sewn shoulder carry strap. The big included bonus is AMMO!

Clearly they are too small to count each individual bullet, but I'm estimating there to be around 900 rounds of .22 ammo included. 

M.S.R.P. for the Camo version is $350, though I got it new for about $325. Extra magazine was $15, carrying strap was $12 and ammo, well, we all know the value of that since it's nearly impossible to find these days!

I have over $400 into this setup and looking to get $300 or best offer. I'm not desperate to sell, so don't lowball me on offers, but I'm willing to consider anything reasonable.

Please be 21+ years of age with a valid photo ID at minimum or preferably a permit to purchase or carry. I won't be doing any background checks, just want to make sure you're legit. I will require a signed bill of sale for my records.

Here's a link to the Manufacturers web page with more info on the rifle.

Reason for selling is I just haven't gotten much use out of it due to life schedules, etc. Maybe 100 through the chamber.

I will also include an extra magazine, giving you a total of 3. Also included is a custom sewn shoulder carry strap. The big included bonus is AMMO!

Clearly they are too small to count each individual bullet, but I'm estimating there to be around 900 rounds of .22 ammo included. I also have the original box and paperwork, etc.

M.S.R.P. for the Camo version is $350, though I got it new for about $325. Extra magazine was $15, carrying strap was $12 and the ammo, well, we all know the value of that since it's nearly impossible to find these days!

I have over $400 into this setup and looking to get $300 or best offer. I'm not desperate to sell, so don't lowball me on offers, but I'm willing to consider anything reasonable.

Please be 21+ years of age with a valid photo ID at minimum or preferably a permit to purchase or carry. I won't be doing any background checks, just want to make sure you're legit. I will require a signed bill of sale for my records.

Here's a link to the Manufacturers web page with more info on the rifle.

I'll also be listing a 12g Mossberg Flex 500 OD Green and Camo later on, so be on the lookout for that as well."

•Chrome-lined Gas Key and Bolt Carrier/// S&W 5R rifling ONLY 100 ROUNDS SHOT unlike “ratchet” rifling which is angled on one side only). 5R rifling also places each land opposite a groove. Having lands opposing grooves, along with slanted sides on the lands, is thought to give a better gas seal and reduced fouling. Additionally, some folks believe 5R rifling reduces jacket deformation by displacing less jacket metal. Overall, proponents of 5R rifling say it helps a barrel foul less and deliver more velocity than conventional rifling."

I haven't taken it apart to try and fix this issue so not sure if it's something simple to fix or not (it didn't happen enough for me to justify the risk of making it worse.)  It is .22 caliber and very powerful but also requires a little muscle to cock the barrel, I think it's like 45 lb cocking force or something like that.

I bought this gun for my wife a couple of years ago for her and it has been a great gun. It is very small for female/smaller hands. We went to the range about a month ago and she put a few mags through it until it wouldn't fire anymore. Come to find out, the gun needs a new firing pin. I don't have time to replace the pin nor do we need this gun anymore. So, in order to get it back to prime condition, it just needs the firing pin replaced. My loss is your gain.  I can assure you that this gun is a quality gun. She loved it but has further moved on to another gun. It is also not a PK380 where it was affected with the recall. You can send it to Walther if you'd like through a FFL holder, we just didn't have the time or money to do so. I think it ended up being around $40 or so to have Walther replace the part.

model #4095TS.  17.75"" barrel, fully adjustable peep sights, removable Vertical Forearm Grip, adjustable cheek piece on stock & also adjustable stock length via butt plate.  Paratrooper open stock.

There are tactical accessory rails literally all over this carbine, top, bottom, & both sides, to enable mounting of about anything you may desire, scopes, lights, lazers, etc.

Carbine comes complete with sling & swivel mounts, detachable verticle forearm grip, 10 round magazine , 2 gun locks, full manufactures warranty & owners manual.

Note:  Very Important:  This rifle is designed with a feature in mind that very few other brands even offer.  This carbine comes with a reversible bolt!  The charging lever can be easily switched to either the right or the left side of the bolt.  Left handed shooters know full well how very valuable this feature is! 

This is a well built, wonderful all around carbine, great for hunting, target shooting, personal defense or just plinking.  Very economical to shoot compared to a hi-power rifle, especially if you don't need one for the task at hand.
The powerful 40 caliber round gives you plenty of power for most any purpose, very flat shooting.

I am located in Horseshoe Bend, Arkansas, that is approx. the N.C. part of the state.   
I can also ship gun to any FFL holder or gun dealer in the U.S.  Buyer to pay only actual cost of shipping.

""The Remington XP-100 (from eXperimental Pistol number 100) is a bolt action pistol produced by Remington Arms from 1963 to 1998. The XP-100 was one of the first handguns designed for long range shooting, and introduced the .221 Remington Fireball (often called .221 Fireball), which is still the fastest handgun cartridge ever produced by a major ammunition maker. The XP-100 was noted for its accuracy and is still competitive today in the sport of handgun varminting, which it helped create."" - Wikipedia"

Hard to pin down sepcific dates on these. I am going to put this one between 1952 and 1953 Essentially it is a Model 12 with the exception that is cannot be broken down. The M12 model had a pin that turned and released the barrel and slide. This is one piece gun. The bluing is 98% in my opinion (slight scratch near end of barrel) and the checkered forearm and beautiful stock is almost perfect. I did notice one very slight surface crack near the bottom by the trigger but this is after all a gun that is over 60 years old. It has a Simmons ventilated rib with a center bead. This is usually not seen on many field grade models. 28” full choke barrel in 2-3/4. You will not find one cleaner than this.

Used, Excellent Condition: 1967 Winchester Model 70 Super Grade African in .458 Winchester Magnum Caliber.
Manufactured in 1967, this Model 70 Super Grade African has all of the factory-custom features that Winchester put into these fine hand built rifles prior to 1970. From the Deluxe Walnut stock with a black pistol grip cap and forend tip along with deluxe wraparound checkering; to the raised cheekpiece and Super Grade marked floorplate, the front sling swivel is moved forward, onto the barrel for strength in high-stress hunting situations. Hooded front and African Rear Sights – as well as being Drilled and tapped for scope mounting. Note that the action is double cross bolted into the stock and the BOLT, BOLT BODY, EXRACTOR RING and the FOLLOWER are all JEWELED for smooth reliability. This fine big game rifle has a few honest handling marks and a couple of dings; see the pictures for more detail. We will also include 30 rounds of Winchester 510 Grain Soft Point ammunition for the winner of this fine rifle. Spotless internals, this rifle doesn't look like it's been fired more than a few times. Serial 909207."
