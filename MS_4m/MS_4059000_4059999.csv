The Adams Arms Piston System:

    A short stroke free floating piston system.
    Is Self-Cleaning.
    Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator.
    Corrosive resistant coating processes.
    Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel.
    Adjustable gas settings for various applications.
    Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire.

This system requires a mid gas length (7.866"" from barrel extension to shoulder) and a .625"" gas seat.

We recommend using a standard barrel nut or barrel nut with similar measurements for proper fit and function of the kit. Many aftermarket proprietary barrel nuts do not offer the clearance for the drive rod or proper seating of the spring and bushing."

May be interested in another 9mm that is very similar to these. 

If you have one of these in basically new condition we can negotiate the price. I could also throw in some legitimate silver ounces or .22lr ammo (at real values not the jacked up prices all these crazy fools are trying to get) The 22.lr ammo is NOT for sale just towards a trade if needed.

I have a valid PTC and MN DL. Let me know if you have one and what condition it is in then we can work out a deal.

I noticed that the price where I bought it is still the same.  By the time you add reasonable shipping and transfer, this exact same pistol will still cost you $850 at one of the lowest priced firearm shops on the internet http://grabagun.com/hk-usp-fs-45acp-4-41-bl-v1-2-12rd.html  Now of course, if you are afraid of discount firearm places, you can still buy this exact same pistol from a very reputable online 'discount' store and only have a bit over $1000 in it by the time you receive it.  Here is the place for you if that is what you prefer http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/heckler-koch-usp45-standard-dasa-pistol-wsafety-m704501a5-polymer-grip-blue-finish-sights-p-83246.html?utm_source=slickguns&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=guns&utm_campaign=slickguns

Needless to say, all I'm trying to say, and prove, is the listed price on this pistol is for a limited time for a quick sale.  It is subject to prior sale or if I just change my mind. :-)"

These have really helped me organize my ammo storage. I don't have to open each can to see what's in them.

Its a 16"" 1/9 twist 5.56/.223 chambered barrel, A2 bird cage with crush nut, A2 front sight post mounted in dissipator fashion by bushmaster, carbine length gas system with a low profile gas block and gas tube(Bushmaster were the first to make dissipators this way. It runs far more reliably this way, with all types of ammo, as opposed to rifle length dissipators made by other brands), Front hand guard retaining plate, barrel nut, and hand guard retention spring and assembly, and a Magpul MOE rifle length hand guard. The barrel, as well as everything else, is in excellent condition. The bore is 100%. The barrel is a 2011 model, so it features the m4 style double feed ramps, which everyone wants these days. 


I also have the bushmaster 6 position civillian diameter buffer tube with Magpul MOE but stock, carbine length buffer spring, and carbine buffer tube. (civillian diameter buffer tubes are the most common type found on ar15's. Therefore more but stocks are compatible with this diameter, as opposed to the mil diameter.) 

Again, this is all Bushmaster materials, except for the magpul furniture, which means quality and warranty covered materials. The barrel is chrome lined, head spaced, and high pressure tested by bushmaster. everything is mil spec or better. 

All you need is an upper, bolt, charging handle and a lower, and you have yourself an AR15. Plus, dissipators always turn heads at the range.

Unfortunately, I'm currently unemployed, so I'm resorting to selling this beautiful rifle. 
It's a high quality rifle. The rifle alone retails for almost $1,600, I'm taking a big loss by selling it for my listed price. If i didn't lose my job, I would never sell this rifle, especially for cheaper than what I payed for it. Just need cash for bills asap, until I land a new job.

I am asking $250 for the pin.  I would be looking for trade for a like new pump 12 gauge shotgun in that range.  Something that retails for $250 or less.  Or, I will sell for cash for $250.

 I can send additional pics as needed.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or ammo for the right AR in .308.  Might consider a Full Spikes 5.56 if quality rail and flip up sights or Spikes pistol w/ 10.5"" barrel. Glock 19/23, LCR or M92 ak pistol

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I would consider a .308 Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $800-$1400...Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built. Must be new or like new. I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras. I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new Zastava AK M92 pistol...(I can buy new one stock for $450 or less) .. 

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus.......... Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  basic mods ok but no stippling please (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600) Also might consider LCR .   I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun. Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill sale required. CWP a plus

I have taken GREAT care of this handgun. I have cleaned it after every use. Cleaning it after every use is considered ""overkill"" on modern handguns, but took the time to do so because I wanted this gun to perform the best at all times. 

The only reason I am considering selling my XD is to recoup the money I spent on another CCW handgun. I am in no hurry to sale my gun and I WILL require that you have your ID present so I can copy your information onto a letter and I will require you to sign it. This is to protect both myself and the buyer.

Simply pour your primers from their box into the top, press the blue button and watch it run! No need to purchase additional primer pickup tubes. In under two minutes 100 primers are inside the protective metal housing. Position over the primer magazine and pull the pin at bottom.  That's about 30 rounds you can load WHILE the RF 100 is loading another 100 primers.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

I have a few hundred rounds through this gun and it has been flawless (read no FTF, no FTE).  It will eat any kind of ammo—hardball or hollow point.  The night sights are in perfect condition. The gun comes with brand new wood grips, 10-8 GI guide rod, 10-8 guide rod plug, and Wolff 16# recoil and firing pin springs.  Also installed is a Wilson Combat buffer pad.  It comes with three 8 round mags and all of the original equipment--including the box, SA holster and mag pouch, and all of the paperwork.  The only two cosmetic flaws on the gun are a small wear spot in the finish on the grip safety and on the Trijicon rear sight where my cleaning solvent ate away some of the print.  You can see both of these in the attached photo.  

I will throw in a box of hardball and an IWB holster (it’s just a cheapie, but works well).

My price is fairly firm.  I don’t necessarily have to sell—it’s just a safe queen and I am looking for some more practical weapons to add to my collection.  I will not ship or deal with the hassle of going through FFL’s.  

Bud’s has this gun for $1,308 right now.  That’s $1,386 out the door.  Here you’re getting a gun that is proven to function (let’s be honest, 1911’s can be finicky and they all do not run properly—even when new) with about $100 worth of new, top-shelf add-ons.  You’re saving about $200 overall.  As with all SA guns, it has a lifetime warranty and they have one of, if not the best, customer service departments in the industry.

Interested partial trades:  Glock 19 (G3 or G4), Sig P320 carry model (preferably in 9mm), or a reloading press/equipment.

Call, text or email.  If you call throughout the day I likely will not be able to answer, but leave a message and I will call you back.

Shitty luck, PCS'd from California to Virginia to what I thought was a good place but turned out to be a bust and had to spend a lot of money I didn't have in order to get out of It and into military housing.  Now she is the only thing I have to get rid of that is worth enough to get me out of the hole I am in.

It is a package deal including my custom built AR and a Glock 17 that has had mods done to it. It will come with 2 magpul gen 3fde with window mags with the connector 2 steel mags and a Gen 2 window mag and 3 17rd mags and 2 10rd mags for the Glock and comes in my pelican IM3300 Case. Also comes with a milspec cleaning kit in an ACU pouch as seen in the pics.

I know what I have I know what its worth this package if you went to duplicate it would cost close to 4500 and the only reason I am trying to get rid of it is because the situation I am in.

If you shoot me a reasonable offer I'll throw in 300rds XM855. 
If you can help it please don't lowball me, I would rather just deal with the financial problems I have right now than to sell her for a ridiculously stupid price.

If out of state.
Buyer pays transfer for me to send it to them.

Beautiful wood, and flawless action.  I have always had the snap caps in it.  It has a selectable barrel on it for either top or botton first, and 26"" barrels.  You have to see this gun to appreciate its beauty for its age.  The only flaw is a crack on the left side of the forearm (lack of humidity in our great state).  If it weren't for that it would be 99%  I have to rate it at 95% because of the crack.  The price of a replacement forearm is between $75 and $100.  Listing price reflexes this replacement.

A pacmyer waterproof removable but plate were you can store survival gear. Great for prepers! 
Very nice looking barrel shroud. 
Internal recoil buffer in stock.

Pictanny rails on top and bottom. 

Nice forward, slanted hand grip making this gun very comfortable to hold! 

A red, green dot scope made by Hammers ( 2×42AR ) with dust covers.

Quick on off safety. 

Last round lock open. With stock magazines.

dot 100% American-made parts and assembly with a lifetime warranty through Hipoint. 

This bad boy will also shoot +P Ammo unlike some of the other carbines.

Because of all this it shoots better than any other carbine I've ever seen almost no recoil making it perfect for a first time shooter, or smaller person.

Rifle also comes with case, believe it or not but for $2,500-2,700 brand new these rifles don't come with cases so I had to purchase it separate. I don't need to sell this rifle so please don't waste your time with a low ball offer. This gun is not a beginner gun by any means, it makes a great combat or sniper rifle. The .308 is a fantastic round for long distance shooting but also holds it's own in close to mid-range quarter fighting. I watched a demonstration of the rifle in Dallas TX held by the manufacturer and they ran the gun over in a hummer, buried it, submerged it in water, shot it with a shotgun and basically just beat the hell out of it. Much like the daniel defense video of them doing insane field operations. The gun didn't miss a beat to work correctly every time.  Again tho, I am not in a huge hurry to sell but I am looking to fund a new motorcycle project and the wife says to thin the herd. If you are interested please email me with your location, phone number (if you'd like) and any questions and I will get back with you ASAP. Thanks for your time."
