It's huge; the enclosure measures 19"" wide, 28"" deep and 38"" tall for a internal volume of just under 10 cubic feet. The box isn't for show, opting for an enclosure this large brings out the full potential of the rare and very sought-after Acoustic Elegance AV15x Subwoofer Driver. 

Included is everything required to connect to the SUBWOOFER OUT on your receiver: Subwoofer/enclosure, Behringer EP2500 amplifier and Elemental Designs Subwoofer EQ/Preamp along with required cables. The box isn't the prettiest but it is well built and braced and the Subwoofer itself is top quality. Advanced specs can be provided to those interested."

The STI commitment to making some of the very ﬁnest custom quality handguns that your hard earned money can buy, goes far deeper than some plaque on a lobby wall. It is a personal responsibility of every STI employee owner to put their best into each gun that leaves the building. For them it is more than a job it is innovating and engineering to keep raising the STI standard; it is machining and hand crafting each part for a ﬁt and ﬁnish that ﬁlls your hand with conﬁdence; and it is the integrity to stay the course even if it means doing things diﬀerently. STI is for the discerning shooter who appreciates having the best.

Each STI gun is handcrafted by a certiﬁed gunsmith and goes through over 30 quality checks before it leaves the building. STI uses only the highest quality parts available throughout the builds. Each sear and hammer is EDM wire cut, which is an innovation that helped STI make a name for itself years ago. Every part that STI manufactures is built to oversized tolerances so they can be hand ﬁt to each individual gun. Each gun is fully function tested and meticulously inspected for any blemishes. The completed STI gun represents some of the ﬁnest in handgun custom quality, performance and accuracy.

This is a 2010 model P226 with factory conversion barrel to 40S&W. Round count is unknown, but I personally have put about 500 rounds on the high side of 40 through it, and exactly 37 rounds of 357 through it. It has been a carry piece for me as seen by the wear in some of the pictures.

The pistol sports a set of police trade in crimson trace grips and the factory grips come with it as well. Also included is a box of 50 ct 180 gr Winchester bonded ranger and 20 rounds of Speer gold dots. The factory night sights are still bright and work great.
Available to the buyer at full price is around 1500 +/- spent pieces of brass. Most should be sized. I believe 300 primed. If not I will make that happen. Also have 200+ 180 gr lead bullets that feed great.

Finally, the SUPER HEAVY Tungsten Guide Rod for your Gen4 Glock are in stock and shipping. This SUPER HEAVY Tungsten Guide Rod is guaranteed to reduce felt recoil and significantly reduce muzzle jump. You will be able to shoot faster and more accurately shot to shot and target to target! Uses the same factory weight springs except on a tungsten body which is significantly stronger and heavier. Replaces factory plastic guide rod in seconds. Springs are captured on Guide Rod Assembly, completely assembled, ready to drop in and shoot. PLEASE NOTE: The new G42 Tungsten Guide Rod is designed with a slightly lighter spring to allow it to function with a wider range of ammo. This also makes it much easier to pull back the slide which has been a problem for many of our G42 shooters. Of course, the main advantage of the Tungsten Guide Rod is that the added weight helps reduce much of the felt recoil and also makes the gun function better, returning the slide more consistently and thereby improving overall accuracy!"

This CO2 operated pistol is a strong and reliable shooter with a FPS of 400 with 0.12g BBs. Realistic blowback with full slide cycle makes this gun feel great to shoot either on the field or target practice

This is a CO2 powered Airsoft Pistol which means that it uses CO2 Gas as a propellant. It shoots hard and fast and is extremely lifelike. One feature many CO2 Airsoft Guns have is blowback, meaning that as the BB is propelled forward the slide thrusts backward mimicking the kick of a real gun! This CO2 Airsoft Pistol doesn't require any pumping just simply point and shoot. This is a high end CO2 Airsoft gun.

You get the pistol which is in like new condition.  It looks exactly like an actual Beretta 84FS.  Also, included is an almost full 4000 round Daisy Premium Grade BBs and 36 Crosman CO2 bottles.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Compact Pistol

Comes with the XD(M) Gear Package  
3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

This handgun has been through a pistol class, 415 rounds in one day.  There were no problems, ran flawlessly.  Lubed with lithium grease in the appropriate areas, absolutely no grease nor oil in the striker housing ( I know better ).  
It has had around 630 rounds total through it with no problems.  It is not a safe queen, it begs to be shot.  Rang steel at 85 yards no problem.  
It is used, but just enough to prove it works.  I understand and accept that we all want a new shiny handgun, and that is reflected in the price, but it has already been put through its paces and there are no issues.  It is excellent for defending your life should you need it.

If you want to wow or get bystanders at the gun range, buy this gun.
Had about 1.5 years and built for hog hunt and long range shooting.
Super accurate, some guy at the range had all the bullet holes touching at 100 yards.
Semi automatic fun, the recoil feels like a .223. Everyone who shot it was amazed at accuracy and recoil. We can meet at gun range so you can shoot it. Super fun, trigger is crisp and short.

Replaced extractor, will eat steel ammo.

Spent over $1200 on it, but looking for $850 or high end AK or average AK with cash. Please no hunting rifles, shotguns, ARs, or any pistols.

I have a very nice M1 Garand with an LMR barrel graded at 1.75 MZ and 1.0 TE plus extras like GI cleaning kit extra clips and GI pouches. Certified from CMP.  IHC parts including trigger group from CMP that I'm considering trading for a colt snake gun or multiple colt 1911's. 

To answer some of the PMs coming in, here's the value assessment for trade.

As far as value - looking at the Garand Collector's Association model for placing value on Garands, they have a forumula utilizing a base price method and factors.  Current base price change occurred in 2013 to a base price of $700 for a 'model garand'. They then apply a multiplier factor to that $700 based on year made, manufacture, and type of Garand.  For this one, IHC with LMR barrel, the factor ranges from 4 to 7.  Therefore a retail range would be $2800 to $4900 in retail value based on the GCA scoring.  For trade value that would be near the range I'd be looking to hit, or a little less (so multiple 1911's such as a Gold Cup National Match, Gold Cup Trophy in stainless, a colt python, multiple colt cobra/DS's, colt anaconda, colt diamondback, etc) that would be valued in that range is what I'm looking for.

Add 15 enblocs plus over 200 rounds ammo which adds to the value too.



PM me for options.  Many pix available, including a copy of the article from the GCA Journel from Winter 2013 which I cannot publish here since I don't have permission.  Thanks for looking."

Asking $950 obo for the package or looking to trade for firearms that catch my interest. worst i can say is no.

Zero Tolerance 0360.SKD Knife, Folder w/ SpeedSafe, Carbide Tip
by Joe
Zero Tolerance 0360.SKD Knife *An SKD Exclusive!*- Of coursed this is a biased review, but if it gets carried daily, it deserves mention. The Zero Tolerance 0360.SKD & the ALL-NEW 0360.SKD are by far the best combination of practicality, strength, speed and quality I've ever carried in a folding knife- period. I was a fan of ZT quality before conceiving this model, but the 0300 series was not very practical for daily carry for me due to the width. The 0350 was a quantum leap in EDC practicality, but was still a bit wide in it's profile when folded. The ZT 0360.SKD manages to shave width and weight- one of the coolest thing you notice is the increase in opening speed when compared side by side with the 0350. I'm still trying to abuse it when I can, and it's still holding an awesome edge. When it opens and locks up, it is simply a FISTFUL OF AWESOME. The tastefully installed Carbide Tip Glass Breaker is the ultimate vehicle extrication insurance policy. This latest production 0360.SKD is the first ZT folder EVER to offer 2 (TWO!) pocket clips from the factory and a factory Torx Wrench. View More SKD Staff Picks

The ZT 0360.SKD represents 18 months of collaborative efforts between SKD and Zero Tolerance that started back in August of 2008. Initially based on the ZT 0300 series knives, the concept morphed and gained momentum with the release of the ZT 0350, and eventually migrating to the 0350 platform as the foundation for this new model. In technical parlance, we took a kick-ass knife, and made it KICK MORE ASS. Since our initial short production run back in 2010, there were key personnel changes at ZT and increases in minimum order requirements that made a follow-on production run somewhat elusive. Thanks to some help from Ms. Jennifer Newsome at ZT, and some good ole' grass-roots encouragement from fans at Bladeforums.com, we were able to secure a second production run and introduce a new Tiger Stripe model (0360TS.SKD). 

The 0360.SKD blade is a full 30% lighter than the 0350 blade, which results in a lighter overall weight and a dramatic increase in opening speed. The high-protein low-carb blade profile gives the 0360.SKD a leaner look than the 0350, without compromising strength- the blade thickness on both models is identical. 

The ZT SpeedSafe system makes for easy one-handed assisted opening even when wearing gloves. A small carbide tip is pressed into place at the butt of the handle for emergency glass-breaking use- this capability was put to the test with an actual vehicle extrication by one of our LEO customers! The blade is S30V stainless steel with Tungsten DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) means that the extremely durable corrosion resistant blade is further coated in a non-reflective self-lubricating corrosion resistant finish, so it isn't likely to corrode. Textured, matte-black G-10 scales provide a secure Kung-Fu grip. Includes a quad mounting array for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed clip carry, and all 0360.SKD knives now ship with 2 (TWO!) Pocket Clips and a factory Torx wrench for Dual Clip carry as featured by Military Morons. 

This special edition ZT knife is only available at SKD, and each blade features a unique 3 digit serial number sequence. We ask that anyone planning on buying this knife actually use it- don't be a Nancy and make this a pocket queen. If we see any of these out there without any actual signs of real use, we will revoke your tough-guy card and reclaim our product in the dead of night."

I picked this up in a trade so I am just trying to recoup the value of my items. 

This is a low round count Glock 20 with 3 magazines, case, loader and lock. 

The sidewalls of the grip have been stippled and the slide has been cerakoted in black with a stealth grey ""Molon Labe"" stenciled in. There is a slight mar on each side of the front of the rail that does not affect mounting accessories in any way. 

Also installed on the pistol are a smooth faced trigger and extended mag release. 

The gun feels great in the hand and the stippling adds to the ""stickiness"" of the grip.

Hello Everyone, 
	I have available for trade/sale a used but in great condition Apple Ipad Retina 32gb with Verizon 4G LTE service. This was gently used and has only light use marks. It will come with a new/unused cable and a used (but very rarely) power adapter. As well as a ballistic case and the original box/paperwork. I got this to use briefly as a hotspot provider (and fun tablet) but lately it has just sat on my desk. So I decided I would rather sell it to someone who would actually use it! haha
	I would also consider trades on this. Mostly only interested in firearm trades, (needing a complete 5.56 1:8 twist AR upper), but may consider others. Just shoot em a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. Need to meet up in norman on this. 
Thanks for looking

Best of both worlds, ak action won't fail low maintenance and delivers AR accuracy with the .223 round. It's like a 5.45 without the hassle.

This thing is extremely squared away and ready for a good accuracy setup. Ran my first 3 gun match with it and it did great long distance, shooting on the move, etc. very comfortable shooter.

Archangel OPFOR stock with adjustable cheek riser and length of pull, fitted rock solid to the rifle.

Hogue pistol grip.

Also has Tapco picatinny forend as well as original poly forend.

Ak 74 style muzzle brake.

Midwest industries quality scope rail is rock solid and goes for $100 by itself! Way better than the UTG $30 bullshit. Sits nice and low above the dust cover and the engagement is super tight.

RED DOT AND BIPOD NOT INCLUDED!!

Extremely accurate. Comes with 3 30 round SGM mags 1 20 rounder and 1 10 round.

Asking $850. A true russian AK probably one small step below an arsenal and comes with a qaulity scope rail, stock, and tac forend.

Also up for grabs is a slide fire solutions SSAK-47 stock $100 USED ONCE!!

And KCI .223 100 round drum with pouch speed loader and graphite lube works great $100 USED ONCE!!

$1000 takes it all!!

Tactical Range Box

All the features of the our shooting range box plus this one comes with AR 223 size magazine well fork. The Tactical range box makes cleaning and maintenancing your AR's a pleasure. All you do is slip your AR on this fork and you have a elevated platform to do your work. Works both right and left handed. The 223 fork is red(shown black in picture).

We set out to make a shooting range box that you could turn it into the ultimate cleaning kit and maintenance stand for your shooting needs. Sporting a cleaning kit top and cleaning-station base, the RBMC utilizes a two-piece design for compact transport and convenient use once you get there. The topl section offers loads of divided space for jags, brushes, solvents…etc, keeping items sorted and organized. The base or ‘cleaning station’ offers plenty of deep storage for supplies and ammo. A pair of adjustable gun standard forks featuring soft, over-molded rubber padding offers easy positioning of firearms with a firm, non-marring hold. This range box also includedes the 5.56mm NATO or 223 magazine well fork. The overall length of the Shooting Range Box provides excellent stability for nearly any size firearm, as well as room for hard to fit items like collapsible cleaning rods or tripod extensions.

Outside dimensions: 24.6"" long x 11.3"" wide x 8.3"" high

Note: Pending on how much weight you have in the bottom cleaning stand, whille holding heavy barrels AR's, they may have to be cleaned using the standard forks included. No screwdiver bits or supplies included"
