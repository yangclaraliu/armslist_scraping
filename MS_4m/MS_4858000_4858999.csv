Equinox is a limited production .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER® Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox features gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function"

This rifle is much nicer than the cheap ones you can buy for under $600. This has the forward assist and dust cover, which dont come on those cheap ones, and the cheap ones jam all the time.  You get what you pay for with these things i promise.

Rifle will come with iron sights, it has an upgraded grip, and it will come with a front grip.  In the picture there is a bright flashlight that is mounted on the side of the quad rail that will not be included at my asking price. If you are interested in that we can work something out.

Too many junk emails being sent to me after responding to fake emails! 
For your consideration I have a Taurus 85 No View 38 special. This is the smallest, lightest +P rated 38 spl revolver made. It is an absolute pleasure to carry. This gun is so light you forget it's there. Will be a great backup, pocket or ankle gun. My only issue with the gun is the factory grip is so small it's almost useless. I've fitted an aftermarket set of uncle mikes boot grips. These grips were not designed for this gun so i had to do some fitting. I'm no expert and it's definitely not perfect, but it works great and looks pretty good. Worse part is the bottom where I had to do the cutting and grinding. These grips give you a two finger hold instead of the factory grip which only allows one finger. These aftermarket grips allow for much better control and are much softer than the factory plastic grips, helping absorb the recoil. You will get both sets of grips and the factory box, paperwork and extra sets of keys for the Taurus security lock. I've put 200 rounds through this gun with no problems. The aftermarket grips make it bearable to shoot but I wouldn't want to shoot it all day. It's very light so you feel a pretty good amount of kick. But this is designed to be a self defense gun not a daily shooter.  
Located in St Charles but I'll meet within reason. 
Price is $300 FIRM.
Trades considered, but I'll expect it to be worth more or be prepared to throw in some cash.

Hornady factory ballistics for the original 32 grain V-Max bullet in the .204 Ruger show a Muzzle Velocity of 4225 fps, the fastest factory round ever introduced! The extremely flat trajectory of the 32 grain V-Max bullet, zeroed for a maximum bullet rise of 1.5"", looks like this: +0.1"" at 50 yards, +1.1"" at 100 yards, +1.5"" at 150 yards, +1.1"" at 200 yards, -0.3"" at 250 yards, -2.7"" at 300 yards.

The VTR is designed for accuracy and low recoil. A muzzle break is provided so that the shooter can stay on target throughout the shot, and actually see the impact of his bullet!

This is being offered at a bargain price of $550 OBO, including some ammo and empty brass, but not including scope or bipod. Some slight muzzle wear is visible (see pics) as well as several very small scratches in the stock from handling. Bore is excellent!

May do partial trade and cash. May be interested in high end tools, or well known firearms as partial trade. But please be realistic with your trade offers Thanks...Or trade for FN SCAR or??? But if interested in a trade it has to be at least worth my asking price. The radiator has a leak now. So the first $2000 takes it."

Mohawk Brown edition.  Tube magazine fed through the buttstock.  19 5/8"" barrel / 4 lbs / 38 1/2"" overall length.  Comes with a hard to find Bushnell Sportview 1.5-4.5x21mm scope with lens covers.  Rifle runs great but it's no safe queen.  Freckling and blue loss on the metal plate that covers the receiver.  Manufactured in February, 1959 in Ilion, NY.  No serial number. This rifle is fun to shoot and due to its weight, it's a pleasure to carry around.  When I first purchased this rifle, I test fired it and then disassembled it for cleaning.  Once is was broken down, I noticed a bulge in the barrel.  Although it's still safe to shoot, I know that a barrel bulge can negatively affect long range accuracy.  For that reason, I purchased a replacement barrel and installed it.  I still have the original barrel if you're interested.  I only included this information in case you checked the date code on the barrel and found that it didn't line up with the first year of production.  This would make a fine first rifle for a kid, a knockaround gun for the farm or just a reliable plinker.  Please call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  I'm located in the Cedar Creek area of south Greeneville. I can meet at Walmart or downtown, or down in my area if you live out this way.   I'll possibly trade for ammunition, but cash is preferred.  I can also do a partial trade for ammo + cash.  The ammo calibers & trades I'm interested in are listed below. Feel free to offer something else up in trade.  Trade value is $250.  I'm always open to listen to gun related trades."

	Hey All, 
	I have another really great entry level AR for sale/trade. This is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S AR15 chambered in 5.56/223 REM. This will come with the gun, Ambi single point sling adapter, 4 Used Metal Surplus Mags, Quick Release NC Star Holographic multi reticle sight with blue illumination, forward assist, and dust cover.. This is a 6 inch barrel with 1:9 twist and a standard Bird Cage flash hider installed. This is a awesome little starter gun that I would keep, but i don’t need another AR at the moment. This is in used shape and shows some signs of use, but still feels fine and tight. 
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357 etc., PLR-16, CMR30, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, Black Powder Revolvers, Redhawks, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at 4058212160 and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one.

A Bit about www.TheMosinCrate.com. I'm a fellow collector of military surplus firearms whose been around a relatively short time in the community when compared with some others at just over a decade. When I was a kid I received a Finnish M91 and since then have made my entire life around the firearms we collect. I started my business last year. I hunt down collections, estates, auctions and go to distributors and cherry pick for the best items possible. EVERY item gets listed on my website with pictures, descriptions and a price on EACH item. I get bored with companies that have a set stock of items years round.. that's quite boring. So I try to have new items every few weeks. Some weeks it will be WW2 Sniper rifles, the next Enfields, the next K98 rifles, the next 91/30s, the next Arisaka rifles, the next Swiss K31s the nex.. You get the idea. I love all military surplus firearms and having been a customer of many bigger companies over the years I have learned what I want as a customer and have made that my goal with this business. Honest, every item described and pictured with a price.

Also, price is already atleast 20% less than buying everything new online and everything is in excellent to like new condition.

Trades considered:

About the only wants I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be fine.  Let me know what you will be adding in other firearm(s), cash etc.  A Bersa .380 for the wife.  Also, would like a nice AR-10, something like the DPMS Recon G2 would work, I see them new for around $1,200, so again, let me know what you are adding, and if you value it at $1,200 retail, then my set-up is valued at $2,500.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

One owner blued P230 with one 7-round factory magazine. Pistol was purchased new in 1993 by my late father to accompany him on his night drops. Pistol is in 90+% condition save minor pitting (visible in pics) on underside of slide nose near front of frame and almost imperceptibly around the radius on the front of the slide (where a 1911 bushing would be). Bluing is dark and even. No corrosion on the barrel, beavertail, trigger guard, grasping grooves, etc.
Smoothest, crispest trigger pull you'll find on a DA/SA (not like the later P-series pistols) and functions flawlessly. Has approx. 350 rounds of factory ammo through it (no +P) and was cared for religiously. Marked ""Made in W. Germany"" and ""9mm kurz"". Serial number is S138XXX, and has ""KD"" mark signifying '93 manufacture. Frame and slide numbers match. Also has West German ""Kiel"" proof mark and ""Ulm Nitro"" proof mark.
Price is Or Best Offer and Trades Offers will be given due consideration.

Will meet within 20-mile radius of 45054 (greater Cinci / Dayton area). Buyer must be 21 and legally able to purchase.

OVERVIEW

Firearms are one of the most dangerous threats faced by law enforcement officers, security personnel and members of the armed forces in the United States. During the past three decades, ballistic-resistant soft body armor has saved the lives of more than 3,000 police officers. Body armor is critical safety equipment that law enforcement and corrections officers need for personal protection.

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as bulletproof or stab proof armor. However, ballistic-resistant body armor can protect against a significant number of types of handgun and rifle ammunition, and stab-resistant body armor can help protect against knives and other sharp weapons.

The SIIBOH is designed to conform to Ballistic Resistance NIJ Standard-0101.06, and will stop multiple handgun caliber rounds IAW NIJ-STD-0106.01. Multiple hits at the same point of impact will not penetrate this helmet. 


Ballistic Resistance NIJ Standard-0106.01 Standard & Testing Specification:
Type IIIA (.357 SIG; .44 Magnum)
Type IIIA armor that is new and unworn are tested with .357 SIG FMJ Flat Nose (FN) bullets with a specified mass of 8.1 g (125 gr) and a velocity of 448 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1470 ft/s ± 30 ft/s) and with .44 Magnum Semi Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP) bullets with a specified mass of 15.6 g (240 gr) and a velocity of 436 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1430 ft/s ± 30 ft/s).

JHP bullets.  (This ammo retails for $28.12 per box from Hornady.)

Hornady Critical Defense ammunition is loaded with Hornady's patented Flex Tip bullet. Unlike most hollow point bullets, the Flex Tip bullet features a soft polymer insert that allows for consistent and reliable expansion.  Each bullet is custom designed for individual loads and loaded in nickel plated cases to help prevent corrosion.

This ammunition is designed by Hornady to expand every single time.  Hornady Critical Defense ammunition eliminates clogging with the use of the patented Flex Tip bullet.  Upon entering soft tissue, the tip swells and imparts equal pressure across the entire circumference of the bullet cavity.  The result is unrivaled bullet expansion and performance every single time.

This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases.
