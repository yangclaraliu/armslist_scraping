Cash price is approx $1300 and trade, value of $1400, would be, preferably, a built or higher end Rem 700 (pretty much anything but Savage) but willing to be persuaded towards anything as long as 308 or 30 cal. I was looking at it the other day and realized I barely go hunting much these days, especially for bear, which it was purchased, and already have 4 1911's. I would rather start long range shooting and passively shoot the listless Colts in the stable a little more - that being said, have you any higher end 1911's, I can add cash or trade for the right gun (Nighthawk, Les Baer and etc). 

This particular 1911 is in good shape but, like most 10mms, carried a lot and shot a little. Not ugly or abused, just not as pretty as I like. I was going to send this to Alchemy or APG for a finishing after beavertail install. 

Sounds high, as the going price for a Delta is around a grand, but included is the VERY difficult to find brand spankin' new Colt factory National Match barrel in 40S&W, along with a colt factory mag and a new S&W mag. Colt isnt cheap especially for NIB old stock, if you can actually find one NIB. The actual Colt 10mm/40SW kits are over $2K now.


I am not interested in anything outside .30 cals (stockpiled too many projectiles) or Savage rifles (I have had poor experiences with them and my smith hates em).Not interested in lower end firearms, dont be offended if I am not receptive to offers of pedestrian or poor quality. Also, although optics can be included, I have sufficient glass for what I need and will probably value your offer for less than market.

Pics up manana (dropped my phone in parts cleaner - hopefully she dries out);you know what a 1911 looks like, this looks like that."

The original deep blue finish, called ""Royal Blue"" by Colt is virtually perfect - I cannot find so much as a small scratch on this revolver. It looks like it may have been test fired only, and not the hint of a pawl drag line on the cylinder. The grips are the original checkered wood with Rampant Colt logo. Adjustable rear sight and fixed ramp front sight. Single/Double action with the butter smooth trigger pull from the ""old days"" of Colt. A trigger shoe has been added to the trigger to give a larger surface area to the trigger. The Python series, introduced in 1955, the same year as the S&W Model 29, is also known as a ""Combat Magnum"". Noted author and gun expert Jeff Cooper called the Python the ""Finest production model revolver ever made"". I am a retired Army general, but it can be yours.

This is not a factory refurbished rifle or a clone. I purchased this rifle in 2002 from a SWAT Sniper instructor. This was his personal weapon and was used primarily as a classroom demonstrator. There are NO damages or scuffing anywhere on the gun. Shortly after I purchased the rifle, I used it in a 1000 yard match at Fort Knox, KY. I had never shot a 1000 yard match or even this rifle. A friend had zeroed it at 100 yards and I relied solely on the bullet drop compensator in the Leupold Mark 4 M3 10x scope and my own skills to do the rest. I shot a very respectable 351 out of possible 400. I was pleased with the results, cleaned the rifle and put it away. It has not been shot since. I sincerely believe that less than 300 rounds have been fired through this rifle. This ready-to-go package comes with the as-new M24 rifle; Leupold Mark 4 M3 10x scope with extended sunshield; Palma sights; T-Handle Torque wrench; extra set of new steel scope rings; Harris bi-pod; Starlight Hardigg style hard case; Original Remington box serial numbered to the rifle. If you need additional pictures or have any questions, please let me know. This is not cheap but how many original M24s in 300 Win Mag have you seen?

I bought the rifle earlier this year. It has had a little under 200 rounds put through it. The only noticeable wear is where the safety selector has scratched the receiver, some minor scratches near the under folder stock & some stains on the dust cover from cleaning. The front sight looks to be slightly to the left but when shouldering the rifle I rarely notice it & it has not affected the accuracy during my time of shooting it. This rifle does have a Tapco G2 trigger as well as a Tapco retaining plate. The magazine well also has a nice fit with the magazines. There is little to no mag wobble with this rifle. I would prefer to keep my bakelite grip & polymer handguard but we might can work out a deal or something. However, I will throw in the original Hungarian wood furniture, a quad rail, & Russian Polymer hand guard.

The second rifle I have to offer is a Savage 110 chambering in .270 win. It has the savage accutrigger, free floated barrel , synthetic stock, 4+1 internal box magazine, picatinny swivel stud for bipod & includes a 3-9x40 Simmons scope with low profile rings. The rifle finish is blued. It does have some light rust & pitting.

If interested in purchasing I want to sell these together. Would Consider lowering the price to $800 for both.

If you would like to see more images of either rifle or have any questions about the rifles please feel free to contact me."

It's a pretty cool and handy little rifle that's been enjoyable to plink around with. I got it slopped in Cosmolene from Century arms, unfired since import. I scrubbed all the metal parts and steamed the stock, although the stock does sweat cosmo slightly on hot days. It was made at the Chongqing Chinese State Arsenal in August of 1954 (receiver marked 1954.8). No numbers match on it, as is typical for these reimports. I did, however, have the headspace checked, and it checks out perfectly in spec. I had a little fun with it and did some ""trench-art"" markings on the stock. I also put one of those $4 inexpensive trigger kits in it with the small shim and spring, it VASTLY improved the trigger. Additionally, I actually shot and zeroed this thing to exact Point of Aim. It will shoot about a 3-3.5"" pattern at 100 yards with standard light ball, and it improves a little with heavy ball. So it's definitely your run of the mill Type 53, but a blast none the less! I should disclose it does have a small hairline crack in the upper handguard, but it really is hardly noticeable when the guard is on the rifle.

Anyways, I'm most looking to trade for something different. I could take cash, but I think a trade would be preferred. Let's start at maybe $250 trade value or $230 cash. I would like to trade for an M.95-30 Steyr mostly, maybe some odd 7mm Mausers, Antiques, I'm open to anything. PM me with offers, and I can send more detailed pics at that time. Located in Temecula. Thanks for looking!"

This one sports the slab-side 3-inch barrel and tritium night sight.  This is a private sale from an ordinary hunter and shooter.  I am not a dealer or collector.  The gun is in 100% perfect condition and has only been fired around 50 times.  I’m only selling it to fund a deer rifle project.

See all the high-resolution pictures here at this photo-sharing site …… 

https://model60pro.smugmug.com/Smith-and-Wesson-60-Pro-Series/ 

This is truly the slickest S&W J-frame you will ever handle.  The barrel-to-cylinder gap is almost imperceptible and paper thin.   The double action trigger pull is smooth and light and in single action the hammer falls with the slightest press.   The cylinder locks up rock solid with no shake whatsoever.  

It is very accurate and sighted in to hit with 158 grain .357 magnum loads.  With .357 loads the point of impact “sits” right on top of the front sight.  Light .38 special 158 grain loads hit right behind the Trijicon tritium night sight dot and are also very, very accurate.

The gun weighs only 23 oz unloaded and would make a great concealed carry revolver, or sidearm for a hunter or outdoorsman.  With the included holster it sits tight on your hip and you don’t even realize it’s there.

INCLUDED as a whole package with the gun are: the original case and all the literature, keys and factory-fired case, an additional soft zipper case, an additional hard-side case, three new speedloaders, three belt pouches for the speedloaders, and over 400 rounds of factory ammunition (a blend of heavy .357 loads, mild .357 loads, and premium .38 special defense loads.)

The price is $800 cash, and the sale is for gun and all the accessories as one lot.   (Sorry, but I don’t wish to sell any of it individually.)

The sale will be 100% documented with the usual common-sense precautions taken.  I will need to see and keep a copy an original Nebraska Driver’s license PLUS either a current Nebraska purchase permit or a current Nebraska concealed carry permit."
