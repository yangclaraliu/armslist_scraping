Its integral flat-top mount, offers out-of-the-box compatibility with Civilian A3 and M4 carbines, and it attaches directly to any 1913 Picatinny rail for use on a variety of other systems as well. The 3x25 tactical scope has a new .223/5.56 62 gr. BDC Knob from 100 to 500 yds with 50 yds fine adjustment clicks; windage knob has 1/4 moa finger adjustments and provides precise corrections on small arms in most sizes and calibers, for various ranges. The illuminated center dot is extremely accurate for long range applications and the MIL lines under the center dot could be used by experienced shooters, as fast bullet drop compensating marks or for quick ranging. All of these features make this compact CQB-type tactical scope significantly superior to any red dot or EOtech type scopes, especially at long range, due to its higher magnification, uncomparable image quality, field of view, adjustable reticle image and reliability. This scope will function perfectly even with a dead battery. When the illumination is off, all the reticle lines appear in standard black and are razor sharp. Also, our scope can be used with both eyes open, with reticle illumination ""ON"" and front lens cap closed. The 3x25 tactical scope features a fully-illuminated reticle w/7 brightness levels for day/night use as well as a unique, 3-position, detachable Picatinny accessory collar for mounting lights, lasers and other accessories.

This pistol is practically brand new, I purchased it and put less than 40 rounds through it.  I was hoping it would be a good pistol for my mother, but the 9mm round still has a little more recoil than she can handle in a short-barrel.  It feels really good in your hand and shoots great, but like I said, it is a little ""snappy"".  I like the idea of having the common 9mm cartridge in a revolver like this but I am not a revolver guy.

I am a dealer and am required to do a background check and verify proof if OK residency.  Cost out the door is $433.00 which INCLUDES sales tax ($400.00 plus $33.00 sales tax).  It comes with a total of 6 moon clips."

It has a standard duplex reticle.  I don't have the original rings, uses standard dovetail style.

The 20rd fixed mag is also steel.  I'm not sure on the manufacture as it's unmarked and I've owned it for at least 15 years.  It worked perfectly with my Russian SKS.  The mag is designed as a fixed box style mag that holds 20rds.

Recoil isn't bad and it very easily carries in a jacket or pants pocket.

It comes with all factory stuff including box, two extended 6rd factory magazines, a Remora pocket holster, has a Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight installed as well as Talon grips, which are removable but they're good quality grips.  

Asking $375 or best offer.  The fiber optic sight, two extended factory mags, Remora holster and grip total up to over $150 worth of extras.

This gun uses 4150 steel and has a melonite treatment inside and out. Government profile with a .750"" shoulder/journal for the gas block. 

It was used for a brief period on a pistol. The flash hider was never pinned and the only marks on the barrel are where the gas block set screws clamped to the barrel (see pics). I have the same barrel on a rifle and it shoots right at MOA with a good scope. I've used the 16"" version on another rifle which also shoots around MOA.

The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations.

The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. 
You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

There have been numerous inquiries about having a winter class and being able to train/test gear during winter conditions. We don't usually do winter classes because of the many holidays and students willingness to train under such conditions.

The recent demand of such training has persuaded me to hold a compressed version of our Carbine: Reactive class. 

Details:

Location: Hudson Rod & Gun Club

Date: December 13th, 2015

Time: 11:00am - 3:00pm 

Ammunition: 300 rounds

Cost: $25 deposit (refunded if class is cancelled only) $100 total (includes deposit) 

There is a heated building right next to the range that we will be using for the training. In addition, we will have some snacks and drinks available in the building for breaks. We don't want this to be miserable, but it needs to be effective as well. 

We need at least 10 students to sign up for this by November 30th in order for this to happen.  

On November 30th, if we have reached the 10 student minimum I will send another link to those of you who paid your deposit to pay the remaining $75.00 balance.

As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon. 

Available in 12 gauge 2 3/4"", it has a custom-quality finish and handsome American walnut woodwork. The receiver and barrel are richly blued and highly polished for classic appeal. The vent rib barrel is 28 inches in length with a fixed modified choke.

 Crimson Trace MVF-515 Vertical Foregrip For AR-15 Rifles takes the hassle out of weapon lights. For years, attaching a gun light to a Picatinny rail equipped rifle has involved clamping a rather large flashlight to the rails, and attaching an activation pad to the rifle foregrip via an external wire. Enter the MVF-515 Modular Vertical Foregrip. With its compact and rugged design and totally instinctive activation system, the Crimson Trace MVF-515 allows the shooter to activate all combinations of gunlight & laser sight, instinctively, while maintaining a natural shooting grip. And there are no external wires or loosely attached activation pads."

It's an amazing shooter with an impressive trigger.
It's not in the best condition as there's some pitting corrosion on the left side of the slide, but doesn't affect any sort of function.
There's also a couple scratches here and there just from handling.
It'll make a great project gun if you want to reblue or hard chrome/nickel plate it.
Comes with one mag.
This gun was based on the browning 1911 design and made in Spain, with many of them shipped to nazi Germany to be used for the war.

It was a TN lower conversion with the bolt and piston changed to US made parts to make it 922r compliant.  Tbostic from HKPRO did the magwell conversion and swapped the TN stock for a replica KV stock.  I like how it looks but the kv Does not lock as tight to it and was eventually going to replace it with a g36c stock with riser.  Tbostic also cut and rethreaded the barrel from 20 to 16 in.  I have 1 magpul mag and 2 g36 mags.  I also have the extra magwell so you can us ar15 magazines.  It requires the removal of the front mag catch which is just punching the pin out if you are so inclined.  I added the rails from hkparts and the top rail is from a g36 purchased off a hkpro member.  The flash suppressor in the pic is aac brakeout but i will keep that and put a thread protector back on.  Gun is unfired in both sl8 and g36 configurations.

Every item goes through a prep process prior to dipping.  The first step in the process is to sand and scuff the item to get it ready for the paint.  The item it is then primed and painted.  After the paint has dried  the item is the stratically submerged into a water tank with the film and activator to transfer the image.  The item is then dried. The last step is the clear coat process.  The clear coat is the same you would see in the automotive industry making it very durable.
