The rifle was sporterized before I bought it. It has a Timney trigger and a Champion synthetic stock (complete with sling mounting points). Everyone knows the Mauser action - reliable, accurate, and, well, bullet proof. This gun will be around for a long time.

The rifle is in very good condition. I don't have a round count, but it doesn't show much wear. The bolt is clean and bright, the action is smooth and locks up solid. The barrel is clean inside and out, no pitting and the rifling looks great too. It's got a 29"" barrel. Would make a great hunting rifle. The top of the receiver has already been drilled and tapped for scope mounts by the previous owner. It appears this is a 1918 model, but part of the date is obscured by one of the drill points. 

****SOLD**** Price is $275 and includes the BGC and transfer through my preferred FFL, Tigard Pawn 4 More. If you want to meet at a different FFL, you will cover any additional transfer costs.

This AR-15 is originally from Massachusetts, and thus had to adhere to the laws of Massachusetts. As such, the compensator on the barrel is pinned and welded in place. It is reversible but will need an experienced gun smith to do so. The stock is fixed but replaceable, and the two magazines that are included only have a capacity of 10 rds. 

Good news is, every piece of this gun has been hand picked to is of the utmost quality. 

She has only seen 500 rounds, all clean high quality rounds."

This is a very nice pistol and it shoots like a full size gun. It's been superbly reliable in the shots I've put through it (FMJ, JHP, 115gr, 124gr), impressively accurate and very soft shooting. Just looking for something else (on the compact side) since I have a P226 as a shooter--can't afford to keep everything.

It's a late-90's vintage P239 (Sigarms era), and, from what I can tell it's built tighter and has a nicer finish that newer P239's. Zero rattle or play in the slide to frame fit. I think... at this point... they were still importing the alloy frames from Germany and making the slides in New Hampshire. Could be wrong on that... but the mags do have German proof marks on them. Serial # is: SA-28426.

Its primary essential task was to disrupt side concussion while keeping or enhancing the characteristics of the Gamma and Epsilon series of muzzle devices. It accomplishes this with ease. The CAGE does not use a large tubular construction because gas dynamics used for muzzle brakes do not operate efficiently when transferring energy into them. Instead it features a close wrap fit. This allows the CAGE to distribute the gases in a manner conducive to both muzzle control and concussion disruption. The sides of the CAGE utilize a series/pattern of small holes which move over the chambers of the Gamma and Epsilon devices. This allows the gasses to expend energy more uniformly and slows them down while moving through the porting thus disrupting horizontal concussion AND allowing the muzzle brake to have more time to influence the gaseous escape through all the ports. This leads to an extremely smooth recoil and zero muzzle flip by “bleeding off energy” rather than abruptly losing energy. The CAGE device offers absolute control while sparing the concussion of a bare muzzle brake.

The EPSILON 556 Ti ust outperforms everything on the market.Designed for the discriminating shooter and professional end-users, VG6 Precision's EPSILON 556 affords you the best muzzle control and recoil mitigation the industry has to offer. This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device.The VG6 Epsilon556 Ti carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control. The VG6 Epsilon556 Ti carries all these specs and is priced well below our competitors.  EPSILON556 Ti is produced for light weight build. This item will be supplied as limited edition.   SpecificationsMaterial : Grade 5 TitaniumWeight : 1.38 Oz (39g)Caliber :  5.56mm/ .223 Rem only Thread : 1/2x28 RHInstallation : Crush Washer (included), Installation should be done by a qualified gunsmith. * Do not use with any other muzzle attachment devices like sound suppressor.

The options are as follows:

-Ruger M77 Mark II .308 with 16.5"" barrel and Laminate woodgrain stock with a green woodgrain tint. The stock is a great mix of traditional and tactical woodgrain. Setup roughly runs about $700 (gun only).

- Nikon Monarch scope 4-16x42mm with Bullet Drop Compensator from 100-1,000 yards on the fly. This scope runs $469.99.

- ACIS CNC machined Ruger custom bottom metal which makes this have a detachable magazine. These run 240.00 for the replacement and require only 3 screws to change from the BDL to the Detachable magazine. It come with both the internal factory mag and the detachable kit. $240.

-2x Detachable Magazines. 1x AICS metal 10 round mag from Brownwells $80. 1x Magpul Poly mag 5 rounder. This detachable mag is great for hunting due to light weight and it fits flush with the gun, but you get 2 extra rounds versus the internal magazine. $40.

-Harris Bipod. $80

- Butler Creek subzero see thru flip up scope protectors. $40.00

This gun has over $1,600 in it with accessories and will make a great rifle for someone.

I will consider some trades plus cash, but I only look for quality firearms in good condition like the one I'm selling. No junk! Will entertain offers, but I'm looking for an AR-10 lower, .308 BCG, .308 Charging handle etc. Preferably with Magpul furniture or better. Interested in some other things but no hunting shotguns or rifles.

Mechanically, everything is in good shape. The exterior does show some marks and wear from use with minor dings in wood and metal but no chips, splits, or cracks. The most wear shows on the slide just forward of the receiver. Overall I rate the gun at around 90% condition, give or take.

Serial Number is 166683 and the date of manufacture is 1903. This fine Winchester includes its Cody Museum research sheet and Letters up PERFECTLY. Any original 1892 Full Deluxe with factory H checkering and Fancy wood is a rare find. The extra factory features of set triggers and takedown make this example about as rare as it gets in 1892 collecting. The condition is very nice and all original. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. The original blue is strong and bright (not brown) with some small areas of spotting on the receiver and barrel. Strong original case color remains on the lever. The screws, mechanics and bore are all excellent. We rate the bore at near mint, probably a 9.5 out of 10. The takedown is tight and this rifle shows signs that is was fired and used very little over the years. The stock and forend are in excellent original shape and look to never have been removed from the rifle. The original factory H checkering is strong and the wood to metal fit is outstanding everywhere. If you collect Deluxe Winchester Rifles, you don't want to miss out on this one as it has rarity, condition , originality and beauty. We only see about one original 1892 Full Fancy Deluxe about every 2 years and this is the first with the original set triggers."

Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, this rifle has a 16-1/4"" chrome lined barrel. The Chinese AK's are highly respected and are among the best available but thanks to the Clinton era import ban, they have been getting harder and harder to come by. The thicker 1.5mm stamped receivers are more durable than many of the 1mm thick Eastern block rifles, and the Chinese guns really are built to last. This rifle is in excellent original condition with just a few minor handling marks. I'd grade it about 95-96% overall. There is no rust or pitting."

You can simply adjust the zoom according to the conditions as you move through the hunting terrain. When the forest is thickest and the game is closer you can easily move the zoom to the lowest setting. This has the result of increasing your field of view so that the target can easily be seen without delay. Later when you move to more open fields the quick adjustment of the zoom will allow accurate shots on the furthest targets. Suitable for optical clarity enhancement allowing you greater contrast in the field. Coatings designed to reduce the reflection of light as it passes through your riflescope to your eye. Parallax and fine focus are critical on riflescopes used to hunt game over a large range of distances. Under the watertight adjustment caps you find accurate finger adjustable bezels for quickly adjusting the windage and elevation in your scope. All illuminated scopes have glass reticle. Glass etched Mil Dot reticles provide crisp illumination without glare that can blind the hunter in low light. The illumination is easily adjusted for brightness allowing use in daylight or twilight. Actual magnification is 3.5-10. Objective diameter is 44 millimeters. Field of view at 100 yards is 38-12.67. Eye relief is 3.25 Inch.
