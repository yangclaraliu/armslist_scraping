13,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4235013,For Sale:  Surefire P116 light for Beretta 92 & clones WITHOUT RAILS,"Montgomery area, Montgomery, Alabama",$ 75,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 6, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an older Surefire weapons light designed to fit Beretta 92/96 and Taurus clones that don't have a built-in rail.  The light comes with its own rail that attaches to the front of the trigger guard.  

The housing of this lightweight two-battery, 6-volt SureFire P 116 pistol flashlight system is constructed of Nitrolon, a proprietary polymer that is impact and corrosion-resistant. The shock-isolated bezel is constructed of aerospace grade aluminum with a super-hard MilSpec Type III anodized finish. A side-by-side battery housing keeps the Surefire Beretta flashlight P101 system compact, and like all SureFire Weapon-Lights, the bezel and lamp assembly are shock isolated to withstand repeated recoil. SureFire Nitrolon P-Series Beretta Hand Gun Weapon-Lights produce 65 lumens of light for one hour with the standard P60 high-output lamp, or 120 lumens of light for 20 minutes with the P61 ultra-high output lamp assembly.

This is a used weapons light.  At some point someone did something to the Pyrex lens, which blurs the light beam a little, but not enough to matter (picture of beam available).  The grip switch also doesn't work, but the manual switch is perfectly located to be operated by either the trigger finger or the offhand thumb. Otherwise the light is in outstanding shape, with very few handling marks.  Installation requires certification in the operation of a screwdriver to tighten four screws.  That simple."

""This is the much requested short stroke trigger bar upgrade for both BG380 and MP380 pistols.

-Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%.
-Made from high grade alloy steel and fully heat treated for long service life. 
-It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected. 
-After the early break the trigger will stop about 1/8 past break. 
-Drop in design requires no modification to your hammer or other trigger parts.
-Now includes the Edge trigger. The trigger ads adjustable stops to remove unneeded pre-travel and over-travel for the ultimate performance setup.
-**Now includes the reduced power firing pin return spring, reduced power blocker spring, and heavy hammer springs for complete package.

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider a Glock 26, or an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm, Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs.

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $500.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

The purchase will require tax and a $30 background check. If you know that you cant pass a background check, do not bother contacting me!


The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Everyone owns one, everyone loves them. It was for that reason I picked this thing up. However, after taking it to the range I came to the realization that I did not find it to my liking. The higher bore axis and the slender grip are not ideal for me, and ultimately to own a 1000 dollar handgun that I do not absolutely cherish is not someone something a guy with my income can afford to do.

The gun has a hair over 100 rounds through it. These things are known to eat anything according to peoples reviews, it did just that with my factory load ammo. It all around seems to be a great gun in terms of finish, fit, comfort in hand, and performance. Included is the factory hard case, two factory magazines, paper work, tools, manual, etc.

The Good....
.45 acp. Uses D-cut grease gun mags (30 round mags cost about $15)
It is basically a Thompson or ""Tommy gun"" clone made in 1973
Barrel is in great shape and the gun runs like a clock!!
The barrel is 16.5 in and the butt stock can be removed
Its quite for a 45 and it very accurate up to about 75 yards
This model has the metal receiver - not the problematic plastic one
The internals of the gun are good..no rust or repair needed - just a good cleaning!!
Comes with a box of ammo and 1x 30 rnd mag topped off with ammo in case you want to shoot it before you buy it...

The Bad....
The front sight is missing :-(
The finish is either missing or in rough shape overall
Trigger pull is heavy & the pistol grip is a little short... in my opinion

Overall its not a bad gun. Would make an excellent project gun, I just don't have the time right now. Great caliber, size and capacity for a home defense rifle!! With a little paint and TLC you could have an awesome Tommy gun or something else if you want to get creative.

I'm asking $275 as is... I'm not desperate for cash & there is nothing wrong with the gun other than cosmetics... just short on time to devote to another project."

I bought it used, but it’s in great shape.  You can read more about it on the Kel-Tec website at:  http://www.keltecweapons.com/.  Kel-Tec guarantees their guns for life to the original owner, so this is no piece of junk.  Cash only, no trades.  Local area only, no shipping.

For those of you that don't know, Norinco AK47 / MAK 90's are some of the higher quality AK's on the market. They have been banned from import during the Clinton gun ban in the 90's. Because of this they are getting pretty rare. They usually sell from $750.00 to $1,400 depending on condition. The reason I want to trade is because I have two MAK 90's and I would like to get a 5.56 / 223 firearm. I'm also interested in cash but more interested in trade.

I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
Therefore, I am looking to make a trade for a Sig Sauer P938 in new or like new condition.

A crisp 4.5 – 5lb National Match tuned two-stage trigger will ensure you can place your shots exactly where and when you intend. The .0595” hooded rear aperture sight gives precise ½ MOA adjustments for both windage and elevation. The rear sight combined with the .062” front sight blade gives the shooter precise target acquisition capability. A National Match recoil spring guide and match-tuned gas cylinder ensure that the rifle will operate with reliable accuracy.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29SF 10 mm with a 10 round magazine capacity standard.

I'll need to see your NCDL and CCW. If you want a bill of sale I can provide, or not, as you wish.

 I bought this new approximately a year ago. Approx. 150 rounds through it. Box, papers, lock, factory test shell casing, and case included.

 -  Do you like 9MM or .38 Special but the recoil in a small gun is just a little too much? Or you settled on .380 already in an LCP or Bodyguard but they are just too small for your hands? Here is your next carry weapon.

 - Identical frame as the LC9 and LC9s. Nice and skinny for deep concealment. Carries 7 rounds+1. That's right, 7, not 6. Count 'em.

 - This will come with an extra mag. $39.95 from Ruger, and $29.95 from Midway, if you have to fork over for one.

 - Heard about those long, heavy triggers in the LC9 and LC380? Not this one. The ""take up"", (length of trigger pull), is reduced by 35% by a Galloway Shorter Stroke Trigger bar. A lower power Galloway hammer spring is also installed to make for a pleasantly smooth 7lb trigger pull that still has the safety of a DAO (double action only) trigger. No need in putting a hole in something before you're ready to.

 - Don't like those bothersome magazine disconnect/safeties that keep you from firing the gun if you accidentally eject the mag in a panic? ( they got smart and removed these from the LC9s Pro). The mag safety is removed on this one also, and is still perfectly intact. There is no outward evidence that anything is removed. I can reinstall if you wish.

 - Ammo also available at market price.
 45 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 90 grain, for $32.
 150 rounds of PMC 90 grain FMJ target ammo, for $50.
 I will not sell ammo separate till the gun is sold."

Ford Guns in Florida did all the radius work and polished the matte finish to a mirror stainless finish. The gun looks amazing and there is not a machine mark on it any where. The finish is nicer than any bright stainless gun or nickel gun out there. Grant Cunningham did one of his super trigger jobs on it. All springs in the trigger pack were replaced and everything polished. The single action pull is SCARY and breaks under a pound. The double action feels like its on ICE. The gun will cut the same hole at 15 yards freehanded all day long. Comes with HI VIZ sights. The green pipe is on the gun now the red and white have never been out of the pack. Also has Hogue Rosewood grip and comes with the Ruger Grips as well. Over 1300 invested but will consider all reasonable offers. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks for looking.
