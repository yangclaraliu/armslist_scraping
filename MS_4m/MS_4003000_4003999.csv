I'll also throw in 500 pellets.

Unfortunately in the amazing state of New Jersey, this is considered a rifle, so you will need a valid FID card.

I'm super hesitant about selling it because I freakin love it and its kind of a rarity out here behind enemy lines in Ca but I have other hobbies to support as well. I dont think Vector Arms even makes them anymore. The gun is in great shape, basically looks brand new. Round count is really low, 300 is overestimated.  Runs like a champ. I'll add some pics to this thread, but for now here's a video of it so you get the idea:

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

A hand made miniature 1:3 scale Colt M1911 complete with walnut presentation box and 7 rounds of brass ammunition (dummies). Every piece of this pistol is hand milled from solid brass and then cast in pure .925 silver with hand made rose wood grips. This masterpiece took almost 2 months to be completed. 

For generations this small consortium of gifted craftsmen have been painstakingly milling and assembling a variety of historically relevant miniature firearms from scratch on a commissioned basis. These 1:3 miniature Colt 1911's aren't just accurate from the outside but are actually composed from over 60 working parts just like the actual automatic pistol. In fact they are required to plug the center of each barrel in accordance with very strict gun control laws present in certain countries due to their functional realism. Each component is completely assembled by hand. There is accuracy down to the jewelry laser inscribed etchings and serial number on the gun.

This miniature Colt functions just like its real big brother. The clip can be removed and loaded with the hand made brass .45 caliber bullets. The slide can by cycled back loading and ejecting a round. The slide lock holds the slide back when an empty magazine is inserted and releases the slide when dropped. The hammer lock keeps the Colt in ""cocked and locked"" position identical to that of the real automatic. The trigger can be depressed dropping the hammer. It's a perfect replica of the Colt only one third the size.

These miniature firearms are truly AMAZING feats of manufacturing that must be seen to be believed. Included with this beautiful matte silver finished Colt M1911 is a hand made, felt lined walnut presentation box which holds the pistol along with its 7 miniature rounds of .45 caliber brass ammunition.


- THIS 1:3 SCALE FIREARM WILL NOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION OF ANY SORT.  IT IS SOLELY TO BE APPRECIATED AS A MINIATURE WORK OF ART -


Please contact me for additional information or photographs. Special orders can also be placed for the same Colt made in .925 silver with either a matte blued finish or a polished silver finish. Other miniature firearms are also available upon request. Please see some of my other listings for examples.

A completely hand made and assembled miniature 1:6 scale Colt 1911A1 complete with 8 rounds of miniature brass ammunition (dummies). Every piece of this pistol is hand milled from solid brass and then cast in pure .925 silver with hand made rose wood grips. This masterpiece took almost 2 months to be completed. 

For generations this small consortium of gifted craftsmen have been painstakingly milling and assembling a variety of historically relevant miniature firearms from scratch on a commissioned basis. This 1:6 miniature Colt 1911A1 isn't just accurate from the outside but is actually composed from 33 working parts just like the actual automatic pistol. Each component is completely assembled by hand. Every detail down to the jewelry laser inscribed etchings is accurate.

The miniature Colt functions just like its real big brother. The clip (made of 0.2mm thick stainless steel) can be removed and loaded with the hand made brass .45 caliber bullets (each just 1.6mm in diameter). The slide can by cycled back loading and ejecting a round. The slide lock holds the slide back when an empty magazine is inserted and releases the slide when dropped. The hammer lock keeps the Colt in ""cocked and locked"" position identical to that of the real automatic. The trigger can be depressed dropping the hammer. It's a perfect replica of the Colt 1911A1 only one sixth the original size.

These miniature firearms are truly AMAZING feats of manufacturing that must be seen to be believed. Included with this beautiful blued silver finished Colt 1911A1 are 8 miniature handmade .45 caliber bullets and a black glass top presentation box.


- THIS 1:6 SCALE FIREARM WILL NOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION OF ANY SORT.  IT IS SOLELY TO BE APPRECIATED AS A MINIATURE WORK OF ART -


Please contact me for additional information or photographs. Special orders can also be placed for a 1:3 scale Colt M1911 (twice the size) made in pure .925 silver . Other miniature firearms are also available upon request.

I'd like to sell them all, to fund new guns. I'm not really interested in trading, but shoot your trades anyway, I'm a sucker for cool guns. Only firearms though.

RIFLES
1.Mossberg 715 t in black, in 22lr, with a bushnell 3x9 scope, a red or green dot sight, a foregrip, a laser pointer and a flashlight wired to the foregrip, two 25 round magazines, and a sling. Its zeroed at 150, and is a tack driver at 150. 450 obo
2. Hi-point 995 in stainless, in 9mm, with 4 extended (15) round mags and 2 factory mags and a sling 350obo

SHOTGUNS
1.Ithaca Model 37 Featherlight pump action, in 16 gauge, holds 4+1, ejects out the bottom, original orange sight,  manufactured in 1956, with slight fading of the bluing, but it was rarely shot and is in spectacular condition internally, and good condition externally and everything works like a dream. This is a rare safe queen, but still a great hunting/fun gun for kids/women/men. 350 obo
2.Stevens/Savage model 58 Bolt action 12 gauge, magazine fed. I just do not have the magazine. It should be buyable online or in a local store, I've just never needed it because you can only load one round at a time at the skeet range I go to. I forget the year, but I can look it up upon request. Its in good shape for being old as it is though, minus a nick out of the stock on the left side. 100 and its yours
3.(not in picture) h&r pardner pump in 12 gauge, in good shape with an army tan paint job 150 and its yours (Sold)

PISTOLS
1. H&R model 676 convertible 22lr/22mag made in 1978, with a twelve inch barrel. I just don't have the 22lr cylinder. This is a true collectors item as they just don't make them like this anymore. The bluing is unique and is made that way from the factory. The rifling and bluing and all mechanisms are in spectacular condition especially thanks to it never being shot by the last owner, ever. He didn't even know it was a 22mag, and not 22lr. This is super rare and super fun. You could bird hunt if you liked or drive 75 yard tacks all day from what I've been told. For this one, with no 22lr cylinder, I'd take 350 obo.

2. Smith & Wesson m&p 22, in 22lr. Its in fantastic shape and is light as a cloud. It comes in the box with the original papers, and tools, and a 12 round mag. 500 obo (being held)

3. Taurus Tracker in 22lr, in stainless steel, with a 7 shot cylinder, and a brand new Hogue grip and a nice leather holster and the safety key to lockup the gun, and a copy of.the breakdown diagram 550 obo (being held)

4.Taurus Tracker in 22lr/22mag, in black, with both a 9 round 22lr cylinder, and a 9 round 22 mag cylinder, Hogue grip, in pristine shape, with the original box, and all the original paper work and safety key to lock up the gun. 700 obo

These revolver range from $ 700.00-$1000.00 depending on condition. Please no low ball offers. Please send email for more pictures and info.

USAK47 Machined Buffer Tube Adapter, attached to the Phase 5 Pistol Buffer Tube
USMACHINEGUN Buffer Tube folding stock adapter 
I am selling all parts together. This assembly is range tested on my own M92 - the pull is very short and gives the M92 the feel of a sub mg. 
The buffer tube is VERY tight in the arm brace, so no slipping or rotating from normal use. 
The buffer tube adapter mounts underneath the pistol grip with the same screw the grip uses to secure to the gun frame and is about as solid as a bolt on stock. 
The folding adapter has some wear on the point of contact that locks it when folded, so it won't lock completely when folded (Shown in picture) The side of the lock used to lock the adapter open is perfectly secure, so the lock works flawless to keep the adapter unfolded. It isn't shown as connected, but can be mounted between the buffer tube adapter and the buffer tube.

This is probably the stoutest (thickest) knife we have ever made. The strength of this 3/8"" thick piece of 5160 spring steel is awesome. It is a full tang, covered with canvas Micarta handles.
As the name implies, the 'Lil Roughneck' is very much like the hearty guys who do the hard and heavy work on the oil rigs. The term ""Roughneck"" is now a commonly-known term associated with rough and tumble guys.
The Roughnecks are of strong resolve, hardworking, and they 'Keep on Truckin.' With this in mind...this is definitely a specialty knife...for a special guy...

Melonite Nitriding treatment turns a standard chrome moly steel barrel into a very slick, hard and corrosion resistant barrel. Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment."

Milled from solid brass, every piece of the pistol is then cast in pure .925 silver and hand assembled. The finish is then blued and miniature wooden grips are screwed in. This beauty took over a month to complete. 

For generations this small consortium of gifted craftsmen have been painstakingly milling and assembling a variety of historically relevant miniature firearms from scratch on a commissioned basis. This 1:6 miniature S&W M36 Chief's Special is not only accurately recreated in scale from the outside but is actually composed from 20 separate working parts just like the actual revolver. Each component is completely assembled by hand. Every detail down to the jewelry laser inscribed etchings is accurate.

This miniature S&W functions like its real big brother. The spinning cylinder (must be spun by hand, does not index automatically) which can be opened and closed by means of a tiny release, can be loaded with 5 rounds of the handmade brass .38 caliber ammunition. The hammer can be pulled to the rear position and cocked. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer (of course the pistol DOES NOT actually fire). It's a perfect replica of the Smith & Wesson M36 only one sixth its original size.

These miniature firearms are truly AMAZING feats of manufacturing that must be seen to be believed. Included with this beautiful .925 silver with blued finish S&W Chief's Special are 5 miniature handmade .38 caliber bullets and a white leather glass top presentation box.


- THIS 1:6 SCALE FIREARM WILL NOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION OF ANY SORT.  IT IS SOLELY TO BE APPRECIATED AS A MINIATURE WORK OF ART -


Please contact me for additional information or photographs. Special orders can also be placed for the same gun with ivory grips. Numerous other miniature firearms (eg. 1:6 or 1:3 scale Colt 1911) are also available upon request.
