The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.
The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

I bought a brand new Sig 516 from Cabellas a few months ago for my bug out bag. 
I have not yet shot it. 
I paid $1,420 with Tax. It included (1) 25 mag.
I also bought (2) brand new 40 round mags for $60
I also bought a brand new Pursuit x3 & X1 Prism Sight and Mini Reflex Sight Combo for $140.
Plus Ammo, Whats loaded in the mags and a bit more. (this is included)

All together I spent $1620 on everything you see in the pictures. And everything is brand new and in perfect condition.

I am asking $1150 for everything together. This is more than fair. Save yourself the Cabellas headache and over $450.

I'm looking to up my stocks of 45 colt/long colt. Factory loads only and prefer premium rounds. I'm not too excited about ""cowboy loads"", but I might consider a mix.

I have 47 rounds of .44 Mag Winchester Super-X 240 grain JSP, and 11 rounds of the HSP. I also have 60 clean 45-70  and 43 .40 S&W brass. They have never been loaded.

The .44 mag stays together, but they can go with or without the brass. I'm open for trades in any combination, or straight out purchase of your .45 colt/long colt.

The .44 Mag ammo is all ""out of the box"" in a 100 round plastic case.

I would also consider trading out the .44 Mag ammo and/or brass for other premium calibers/loads. I would be most interested in:

.380, 2 1/2"" .410 defense, 12 gauge #4 or 00 in either 2 3/4"" or 3"", or 30-30.

Do some research on the mosin snipers imported about a year ago from Molot.  This one came from classic firearms but all the big importers of mosins were selling them last year.  You can search on gunboards or any forum that deals with military surplus rifles and there were a million threads about these guns last year.  The consensus from all the big time collectors of Russian firearms was that these are legit refurbished mosin snipers."

Two Remington 81 Woodsmasters, one is a .35 Rem. in outstanding condition with the earlier beavertail forearm. They both have vintage Marbels tang sights and both have two front sights, the standard ramp and a vintage Lyman or Marbles adjustable sight your choice.
Neither one has had their stock or forearm drilled for a sling swivel but I do have one sling swivel to install on the barrel in the proper location that Remington intended. I also acquired a spare extractor in case of breakage since these rifles are no longer made and parts are hard to find. Additionally I have the tang screw if you desire to take the folding tang sight off.
Both function properly with no malfunctions and lock back solid.
$800 for the .35 Rem. ($850 if shipped) , cash only no trades."

 An amazing Saiga 12 gauge. I've put about 200 rounds through it and have never had a jam that people complain about(I'm very meticulous about cleaning it too) As close to new as you will get. Have all boxes and paper work. Even have my receipt where I paid $1000. This is what it comes with:
 *The IZ109 Saiga 12
 *5 round magazine
 *10 round promag
 *Around 100 rounds of birdshot(cant remember if I used any)
 *5 rounds of buckshot
 **Buds gun shop has them for $895(a dealer will charge you $50-$75 to have it shipped to them) http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/81156/RWC+Group+IZ109+Saiga+Shotgun+5%2B1+12ga+19%22
 **Heres the promag for $32.50
 **$30 worth of ammo
 So you can get all of that new for $1002.50-$1027.50(plus $70 in taxes) and this ones as good as new and you wont have to wait weeks to receive it. Used a little but 200 rounds is nothing and it was extremely cleaned after. $850 plus $25 for the gun transfer and you will own a rare gun that is no longer being imported. This is the last post I will make for the Saiga because after tomorrow the gun I was wanting to sell this to get is off sale so I will just keep the Saiga because its a fun shotgun."
