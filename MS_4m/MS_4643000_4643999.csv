The previous owner had a personal firearms museum he was selling off and claimed the gun was used in the Original Buffalo Bill Wild West Show in the early 1900s but did not have any documentation. I contacted the Cody Firearms Museum to verify this fact but they we unable to verify it since most of their records were lost in fire years back. They did say that this was a common gun used for trick shooting and the brass inlays were seen on some of the firearms from the show, and were of period as well, not added later. The inlays on the stock include: a 1902 Indian Head Penny, BBWS Brass inlay, WC Brass inlay, and 1 Brass Inlay. Definitely professionally done and not hacked into the stock.

This was a first year production run (1909) for the 12-B GALLERY SPECIAL, and the serial number makes it an early production. The GALLERY SPECIAL was produced not for average retail but for use in carnivals, side-shows, shooting galleries, etc. back when real rifles were used in games and not air rifles. Because of this it is only chambered in .22 short. Most of these GALLERY SPECIAL rifles you find are in very rough shape because of their constant use and often have replaced parts.

The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided.

The Model 1936 is one of the more uncommon models you’ll find since it was soon changed to the Model 36 and then todays version the Model 336. This rifle, with a 1941 production date, was also the last year for the case hardened receiver which makes it more desirable than the Model 1936’s with later production years. It is chambered in 30-30 and does have a Williams rear gun sight mounted on the receiver. It looks like its been there a while."

I'm a shotgun guy, I've had them all.  This is the only autoloading shotgun that I've ever owned or tested that I would absolutely trust my life, hunt, or family to.  They just don't fail.  

As I said, I have two of these.  The one I'm keeping has at least 2000 shells through it from 2"" all the way up to 3.5"" big boys.  I've only cleaned it once and it cycles like the day I bought it.  They just eat everything.  If it says ""12ga"" on it, it will cycle.  I had about 500 2"" shells that I got super cheap and I ran them all without one single failure, zero.  

I bought this one (the one for sale) as a backup because, like everyone else, I was skeptical that it would be as durable as advertised.  Well, it is, so I don't have a problem letting the ""spare"" go.  

It's brand new (just bought it 4 months ago), I'm the original owner, I paid $1300 for it, broke it down and cleaned it thoroughly out of the box, fired 20 3"" slugs through it to make sure the slug accuracy was on the money (it is, some early Vera Max guns were a little off on slugs), broke it down and cleaned it again and stuck it back in the box.  It is dead nuts accurate with slugs and it was manufactured in 2015 so its the latest generation. 

It comes with everything as if brand new from the store.  Two chokes (IC and breacher), 1913 Pic rail (installed), stock comb and angle adjustment plates, manual, etc.  It's good to go.  I'm super anal about all my guns and pick them apart, if it didn't measure up it would have went back to Rem.  It's flawless in every way and It's the lightest shooting 12ga. you will ever shoot.  I've done all the nit picking so you know you're getting one that's perfect.   

Some say they don't like to hunt deer with the ""tactical"" version because of the mag extension being so long, well that's bogus.  I took two deer with mine last year.  I just put a longer dowel rod in the mag to limit the shells, done deal.  I have found that the 22"" barrel is the ideal sweet spot for just about everything.  Turkey, deer, ducks, home defense, it does everything well.  For home defense it's excellent.  I load mine up with the first shell being a 3.5"" High Velocity Turkey shell, then 00, then the rest with slugs.  If it ain't making someones day bad enough with the 3.5"" HV, then comes the 00.  If for some reason that's not enough deterrent, we get down to business with slugs.  It feed that setup flawlessly (even with mixing shell lengths) and you can dump the mag in 5sec or less (just depends on how fast you can pull the trigger, you won't out run it). 

If you've read this far then you already know what you want and what you're looking at.  Please don't low ball me, I've already knocked $500 off for something you would do if you bought the gun anyway (or should. Clean and check function).  The lowest price online you can get one is $1100 from Bud's and that's kind of a crap shoot.  I paid the full $1300 because I got both of mine directly from Remington.  I had an FFL friend of mine special order them because wanted to make sure I wasn't getting guns that had set on a gun store shelf for a year.  

I wouldn't trade for anything unless you are an aftermarket Rover parts dealer and you want to trade me a 3"" Prosport Terrafirma Lift and some other goodies.

i had plans on making it a dragster truck but i am no longer able to have it.

would be a great drag vehicle or a farm truck its been sitting a little bit and the brakes are rusty so it needs new brakes and should be bled.
it has dents and doesnt look too great but it runs and the engine alone is worth $2,000 so what im asking is not a bad deal at all.

For those who are unfamiliar with this rifle, it was the first standard issue semi-automatic rifle and is chambered in 30-06. Some say that the M1 Garand is the reason we won WW2 because it was so much more effective than the enemy's bolt action rifles. It takes clips of 8 rounds that are inserted into the receiver (I will show you how to load it so you don't lose part of your hand). Interesting fact: the Nazi's discovered that the clip would make a loud ""ping"" sound when the 8 rounds were expired and so they would pop up and shoot the Americans while they reloaded. The Americans figured this out and so, with additional rounds still in the clip, they would take an empty clip and mimic the ping sound. When the Nazis would pop up, the Americans would take them out. Considering that our military largely uses 5.56 or .300 blackout nowadays, it's incredible to think they used to use a 30.06 for combat purposes.

This particular rifle was manufactured by Springfield Armory in 1943. It still has the battle scars from use in the war and was later repurposed (as many of the WW2 rifles were) for use in the Korean War in 1952. The gun still has the original cartouche. Aside from the battle scars on the stock, the rifle is in excellent condition. This is a beautiful rifle and is extremely accurate with the iron sights. I paid over $1000 for this rifle and I am not in a rush to sell. However, I do have the trader bug and am interested in seeing what else is out there. I will also include a gunsock as well as 4 military bandoliers. Each of the bandoliers have multiple clips loaded with 30-60 (a total of ~170 rounds of 30.06). I also have several empty clips for reloading. Feel free to make an offer."

Bluing shows some assorted wear and light evidence of freckling in areas though it is overall very decent. Wood is solid though it does show some light wear as well. Overall a very decent option for deer when hunting in a shotgun zone.Ambidextrous. That is how many shooters describe the BPS. And it is true. But the advantages are more than just being a great shotgun for the left- OR right-handed shooter. The bottom ejection design and full, two-sided steel receiver combine for a level of durability and strength that is not common among pump action shotguns today. The design is totally balanced, with matching dual steel slide action bars -- one on each side -- that balance forces for very smooth pumping. Top tang safety is functional convenience to the max. The receiver forms a ""roof"" over the action-- there is no opening on either side for an ejection port, so a drenching rain won't drip into the action. When you shoot bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight,  to distract your aim. Those that shoot a BPS are a unique bunch . . . a bit more serious about their hunting guns than most? Yes!Bottom Ejection and LoadingBottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.Reliable Pump-ActionThe proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots. A convenient serrated slide release is located at the rear of the trigger guard. SafetyThe thumb-operated, top-tang safety on the BPS can be easily operated by right- and left-handed shooters alike, even with gloved fingers.Magazine Capacity2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.Back-Bored Barrels12 and 20 gauge BPS shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

The rifle has been reworked and re-blued by a professional gun smith.  The metal is original except the magazine tube.  There is some pitting visible throughout the gun.   The bore has shiny and dark spots with pitting appropriate for a 127 year old gun.  The rifling is solid.  The barrel is 24"" overall length is 43 & 1/2.  The wood is replacement.  The brass butt plate is not original to the gun.  The action is tight and the gun functions perfectly.  It was redone 20 years ago and has seen very little use.  This is antique and requires no paper work in most states.  I will check individual state codes before I complete a transaction so if you live where the law requires this gun go through an FFL check it out before you try to deal. You must be 18 to purchase.  MD resident terms are cash.  Out of state the terms are USPS M/O with the buyer paying actual shipping costs.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Weight empty 6.9lbsWeight loaded 8.5lbsLength 26.1""Height 7"""
