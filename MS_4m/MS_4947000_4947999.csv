What you see is what you get. What I have for sale is a Ruger SP 101 .357 magnum (1 3/4"" barrel) that is been shot a total of just five times!!! I still have the original box of shells. The revolver is in excellent shape, it's just not for me. 
The pistol comes with the factory case (with all the paperwork), 20 rounds of 357 ammunition, 50 rounds of 38 special ammunition, and a Fobus saddle holster ( there is some wear on the holster) but the holster is still in great shape. 
This is a cash only transaction, no trades. I am asking $575 or  best offer. This is a great deal.

This is the gun that has been issued to the Navy SEALs for a number of years, and it includes SIGLIGHT night sights, a white Navy anchor engraved on the slide, and a DOD UID label on the frame. On top of that, the entire gun (and mags) has an anti-corrosion coating applied to all of the internal and external surfaces to survive the abuse the SEALs put it through.

It comes with everything that came with it from the factory including the Sig hard case, gun, cable-lock, small tube of lubricant, and 3 15-round Sig magazines.

At $875, this is priced well below market value for a quick sale. Not interested in any trades, and the price is firm. If you're looking for a MK25, don't hesitate.

I prefer to make the transfer at Fuquay Gun (where I bought the gun), and I'm happy to pay the $25 transfer fee."

This Saiga 20 has a Kushnapup (bullpup) stock conversion with extra accessories.
1ea. - 10 round Csspecs magazine (steel)
3ea. - 5 round magazines -2 for 2 ¾” shells and 1 for 3” (polymer)

Only has light ring marks. Just came back from Swarovski Service, all new inside parts Prestine  With papers and Box! $700 OBO Desperate Just in time for Christmas Gift! 

Swarovski AV4-12x50 - TDS-Plex Reticle Rifle scope. Extremely light and very handy. Swarovski AV rifle scope. Top quality resolution and amazing brightness in a 1"" tube. Ideal for mountain hunting and stalking. Lightweight, variable magnification, very compact construction and guaranteed protection from recoils with at least 90 mm (3.5"") of eye relief. Reticle in 2nd image plane for clear recognition and low target obscuration, even with long-distance precision shooting.
With small or large caliber firearms, on your own reserve or on an expedition - when out hunting, the precision of your riflescope is crucial. This means with everyshot, and that is why you can rely on our riflescopes. The patented Swarovski leaf spring system® ensures reliable reticle adjustment, and means absolute shot resistance, even with large caliber firearms. Get the best performance out of your quality rifle with a Swarovski riflescope for all hunting applications.

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. From their beginnings in 1905 until today, founder Daniel Swarovski's ""Constantly improving what is good"" motto has endured as a company mantra. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.
The lightweight and compact construction of Swarovski's Habicht AV 4-12x50 SR Riflescope makes it an ideal choice for stalking and hunting game across difficult terrain. Like all riflescopes from Swarovski, this highly-refined sighting optic features world-class resolution, and amazing brightness.
The 4-12x50 configuration of this scope offers the hunter an edge in light-transmission, and magnification. At 4x your field of view is remarkably wide, comfortable, and bright. Dialing the power up to 12x narrows the field of view and magnifies your target, isolating it from disturbing backgrounds. Accurate long-range shot-placement is now a possibility.
The twilight performance of this Habicht AV scope is remarkable, particularly at the lower end of the magnification range. The 50mm objective lens enhances the light-transmission significantly, affording you the ability to hunt during twilight with success.
1.0"" main-tube is nitrogen purged for water, fog, & dust proof performance
Patented zero setting system provides precision adjustment of impact point without tools
Micro-structure grooves prevent residual reflections inside the tube for bright contrasty images, even with back lighting.

Swarovski's Habicht AV (American Variable) riflescopes feature a lightweight low-profile 1.0"" main-tube, variable power, 1/4 MOA precision adjustments, Swarotop and Swarodur multilayer, anti-reflective lens coatings, and a reticle positioned in the second (non-magnifying) focal plane.

TDS-Plex Reticle in the Second Focal Plane
The TDS-Plex reticle is a choice option for varminters and long-range hunters. Four medium length posts and fine cross hairs pull your eye directly to your point of aim. The lower portion of the vertical stadia is intersected by four stepped hash marks that assist the shooter in calculating bullet-drop compensation. 
This scope has the reticle positioned in the second focal plane so its dimension does not change when adjusting the magnification level. This leaves the sight picture unobstructed for a clear view at all times.
