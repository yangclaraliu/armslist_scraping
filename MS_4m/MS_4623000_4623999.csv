I NEED a complete Upper (with BCG and Charging Handle, folks). Seeking something fun, tactical and enjoyable.   This is not for long-range or competition shooting.   It's for fun range and sport shooting. Of course, it must be the envy of my base camp during the PZA (post-zombie apocalypse).

I am Active Duty military with CCW permit and good sense of humor; building ARs is great (practical) therapy! 

Threaded barrels are a plus (I may get a suppressor with Tax Stamp later). Barrel length must be 14"" - 18"" (not building a pistol or SBR). I am not a fan of the A2 flash-hider (boooooring!).

I am interested in 5.56/.223 caliber or .300 Blackout, primarily, but I will listen to anything that sings to me! .308 or. 50 Beowolf could be awesome, too!

This is over $140 worth of targets, asking $100 for all.

From the Shooter's Element website:

Q: How close can I shoot the targets?

A: That’s really going to depend on several factors. However a general rule to follow is 10 yards for pistol calibers (9MM, .40 S&W and .45 ACP etc…). As for rifle rounds we suggest for .223 REM, .308 WIN that the targets are at a minimum of 75 yards. With larger and faster moving calibers, such as 22-250, 30-06, 300 WIN Mag, .338 Lapua etc… we suggest a minimum of 120-150 yards. This is primarily due to the speed and size/mass of the bullet.  However, in our torture testing we have shot the targets much closer without issue.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!"

I am a Florida licensed attorney and offer comprehensive NFA gun trust drafting services. My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Florida, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at REDACTED to inquire about my services."

The purpose of these kits is for Law Enforcement and Military training using Simunition® FX and CQT ammunition only. The barrel will not accept standard 9mm small arms ammunition; if it did, anyone stupid enough to chamber it would be in danger of injury because even though these barrels are steel, they are not designed to withstand standard cartridge pressures, and their chamber hood right side area is ported. They are only for training, and only for Simunition® cartridges. Each kit is in its original factory box with factory instructional papers. All these are in excellent to near mint condition; from our inspection, they have been fired fewer than 50 rounds apiece.

For your consideration is a Smith and Wesson K 22 Masterpiece. This revolver is in great condition, with only a very small amount of muzzle wear and handling marks, and for a 59 year old pistol with the original finish, it still looks great. This is a rare example of the model because it's a 4 screw without a model number stamping. S&W discontinued the fifth screw on the sideplate in 1955, resulting in a four screw variation, and started stamping model numbers on their guns in 1957. This revolver was manufactured in this two year time frame, more specifically, 1956, and sometimes is referred to as a ""transitional gun"". The diamond magna service grips are correct for this period and are in good condition with a few handling marks. They're matching serial numbers on the barrel flat, frame butt, cylinder and behind theextractor star (K275XXX). The barrel is bright with great rifling and the mechanics function flawlessly, with great lockup. This is a very good representation of a transitional period revolver, and would add to a collection or serve as a great shooter. Will ship to lower 47 (no California sells) from my dealer to yours for $25. Contact me if you have any questions."
