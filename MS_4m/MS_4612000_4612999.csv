Below is manufacture description:

 The Gemtech 7.62mm QUICKMOUNT is a precision machined, heat treated suppressor adapter. It is available in a number of thread patterns to fit most popular 7.62mm rifles currently on the market. 

 There are three main types of QUICKMOUNTS available: Tensioning, VORTEX, and Standard ""Phantom"" style mounts. 

 The Tensioning style, which is generally for longer bolt action rifles not requiring a true flash hider. It is threaded from the front, telescoping back over the barrel, which must be specially profiled to fit this mount. This makes a shorter overall profile, moving the suppressor back further, and also tensions the last inches of barrel for accuracy. It has no flash hider slots, as this portion of the mount is behind the crown. 

 The VORTEX is for the ultimate in flash reduction and accuracy: GEMTECH and Smith Enterprises have joined forces to offer a QUICKMOUNT version of the proven Vortex tm flash hider (5/8-24 only). This gives the best flash reduction available when using your rifle with or without the suppressor mounted. 

 The Standard 7.62mm QUICKMOUNT fits our HVT, QUICKSAND and older TPR-S suppressors. It features a more conventional flash hider design, and is available in the most thread pitches for a wide variety of host weapons, such as: 5/8-24 (DPMS, Armalite, etc.), M18x1mm (Sako TRG or Tikka, Blaser LRS), M18x1.5 (Accuracy International), M14x1mm LH (AK-47), 9/16-24 LH ( FN FAL), and 1/2-28 (does not fit 5.56mm suppressors, some 6.8SPC and 6.5 rifles use this pitch, and it may be used to fit an HVT or QUICKSAND for subcaliber usage on 5.56mm weapons), M15x1mm (HK 91),and M13x1mm RH ( Galil). 

 For M1A rifles (except SOCOM 16"") you can utilize a 5/8-24 threaded flash hider mount (Phantom or Vortex) with our M1A Adapter. 

 As a safety feature, our 5.56mm suppressors will *not* fit onto our 7.62mm adapters.

The musket was well cared for by its previous owner, and I have not had the opportunity to use it myself. Included with the musket are a sling, bayonet and scabbard, and a homemade canvas storage bag.

Overall, the musket is in great shape. The action works well and doesn't stick. There are some light wear marks - about what you'd expect from a used firearm. Nothing more than light scratches. The only problem I noticed - which does not affect its function - is that one of the spring-loaded barrel band retainers is loose. I imagine this can be fixed relatively cheaply if it bothers you too much.

I'm asking $600.00 o.b.o. I am not shipping, so you'll have to be willing to meet me somewhere within a reasonable driving distance to view or purchase. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, or if you are looking for any other reenacting gear."

DESIGNED II DOMINATE. The 16” GII DPMS Recon is just as battle ready as the original .308 Recon, but weighing less means, you can run it at your next high round count carbine course without needing to bulk up your upper body first. 16” stainless steel bead blasted barrel, DPMS hunter gas block, 4 rail free-float tube, and MagPul Unfailing  Reliability.Revolutionary improvements make the GII the most reliable, longest lasting MSR platform on the market. Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions. The result: the most consistent, efficient, and reliable Extraction and ejection pattern of any MSR.The biggest revolution to the GII might just be the smallest. Improved extractor & elastomer Extractor spring. Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.Dual Ejectors The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.Steel feed ramp. GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types. Enlarged ejection port Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.Smaller. Lighter. Stronger.The rifle simply feels better when you pick it up.The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.Reduced weight, yet lighter recoil.Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.Reduced mass, forged, monolithic bolt carrierwith forward assist. New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension. Beveled mag well. The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes. Improved bolt & barrel extension. An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength. This MSR is adaptable,versatile and has the accuracy you’d expect from DPMS.With its adaptability in accepting standard MSR fire control and more .223 two piece hand guards than before, the GII core also remains versatile in both tactical and hunting configurations. A true game-changer.Increased .223 platform hand guard adaptability Accepts more 2 piece MSR handguards than previous LR-308. Newly designed barrel nut allows the use of .223 diameter free float hand guard systems.Accepts standard MSR fire controls DPMS GII rifles accept standard MSR fire controls for even more adaptability. An exceptional tactical rifle. Contoured steel feed ramps, revolutionary redesigned extraction system, and a dual ejector design decrease feeding, extraction and ejection malfunctions.Completely re-designed gas delivery system utilizes a monolithic bolt carrier and optimized gas ring clearances to eliminate the possibility of gas leakage during operation.

It has a really nice Euro mount stag head and a cross on the face, and that is what makes it so unique.

The 460 Magnum chambering in a revolver is special because of its versatility. It can shoot anything from 45 Colt loads, to 45 Colt +P, 45 Long Colt, 454 Casull and 460 Magnum cartridges in bullet weights ranging from 200 to 400 grains. In a first for a production revolver, the S&W 460 series of revolvers were designed from their conception to also shoot spire-point bullets.

The gun itself is a premium firearm. It is finished in satin stainless with a bead-blasted finish on the top of the receiver to reduce glare. It features a red-notch front sight and a target adjustable rear sight. 

The chambers are polished to a mirror-like shine for ease of extraction which I have found to be more of a necessity than a luxury when dealing with cartridges that operate at 60,000 P.S.I. The forcing cone has been polished to reduce gas-cutting of the cone and receiver. The muzzle has a recessed crown. 

The action is very slick and it has the typical “Smooth and Wesson” trigger that at an estimate breaks at a little over 3 lbs. in single action. 

Its proportions look right and it balances very well in the hand being slightly muzzle heavy but not overly so. The grips are an excellent shape and do their job of absorbing recoil well. 

Also included are a brand new Galco holster and black Pachmayr Decelerator grips."

This it a strange rifle from the beginning.  I bought it in pieces, then built it from there.  I bought the FN SPR action and bottom metal together from a dealer.  It was intended to be a replacement part for the FBI training center, but too many were bought, so it was sold as an action only.  These actions are based on the pre-1964 Winchester actions with the giant claw extractor.  I bought the A1 stock from the training center as a used take-off (more about the stock later).  I ordered a custom Super Match Stainless barrel from Pac Nor in a #8 contour ending in a 0.900 tip.  It is not a lightweight barrel, it was bent to be a bench rest rifle.  I have fired exactly 60 rounds through it during the barrel break in process.  I fired 5 shots, cleaning with bore cleaner, cleaner, lube, then dry after each shot.  It was then extended to 5 sets of 5 shots, cleaning after every 5 shots, then 3 shots of 10 rounds, cleaning after each round.  While doing this, I zero'd and shot groups.  After getting dialed in, I shot a best of 0.38"" with all groups (except 1 because I a messed up) were under 0.50"". The barrel still needs more rounds to break it in, another 140 rounds or so should get it shooting optimal groups, cleaning after about 30 rounds.  Once past the 200 round point, it should be perfect.  The trigger adjustment was glued, and set at about 6 lbs pull.  I cleansed the glue off and lowered it to about 2 lbs (since it is a bench rifle).

The stock was a used takeoff, but it is a true McMillian stock.  I talked to McMillian about it, and it is covered under the lifetime warranty.  There is a very small nick in the stock near the 4 round magazine.  Because of this, it can be sent to McMillian for repair/refurbishment, or a new stock.  The stock will be returned as new.  I just didn't do it because I ordered a Manners CF gap camo stock for it.  That stock will be done in October, and t is yours, if you want it.  I was waiting to have the rifle Cerakoted after the stock gets here to kind of color match the action, barrel, bolt, and scope.

This will be one of the finest and most accurate rifles you will see outside of a $5000+ rifle!  I would not hesitate to put it against anything available.  600-1000 yards should be simple.  I really don't want to sell it, but I need the money due to the recent issues of the lightning strike.  Insurance just doesn't cover everything!

What you get:
FN SPR rifle with a McMillian stock.

Cheap soft case to put it in."

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.Superior ReliabilityThe 92FS is a double/single-action semi-auto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.  Match-Grade Accuracy out of the BoxRegardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.Packed with Useful Tactical FeaturesThis pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.  SpecificationsAction: Single/DoubleBarrel length (mm): 125Barrel length (in): 4.9Caliber: 9x19 (PARA)Magazine: 15Overall height (mm): 137Overall height (in): 5.4Overall length (mm): 217Overall length (in): 8.5Overall width (in): 1.5Sight radius (in): 6.1Sight radius (mm): 155Weight unloaded (g): 945Weight unloaded (oz): 33.3"

Great concealment  gun at 25 oz.
Made entirely in the Kimber Custom Shop, the Ultra CDP II pistol is one of Kimber's most popular concealed carry pistols. The Ultra CDP II has a stainless steel slide and a compact aluminum frame to create a lightweight carry package that also resists the elements. The match-grade ramped 3-inch bushingless bull barrel allows for unequaled Kimber accuracy. The front strap is checked (30 lines-per-inch) to ensure positive grip, regardless of conditions. Kimber's carry melt treatment leaves no corners to catch clothing or dig into a holster. The self-illuminating Tritium night sights glow without batteries or charging, a low light tactical advantage.

New old stock Israeli IMI (Israel Military Industries) 9mm Uzi pistol imported by Action Arms.  This is sometimes called a micro or mini but the semi auto is correctly called a pistol and these are what are modified into the micro, the full auto machine gun.  This can be modified into full auto with correct NFA paperwork.  This is a super nice, unfired 9mm I purchased new back in the early 90's. This has been stored correctly and has been oiled periodically.   This has the angled trigger guard(instead of a rounded trigger guard) which is the newer model.   nice, blue plastic box and Uzi factory outer sleeve which are both in great shape.   The plastic blue box alone is worth $225 and a 25 round magazine and a 32 round (not shown) included and I have many at a real cheap price.    You can't find one this nice for this good of price.  Don't let an over priced one fool you....this is the top of the line Uzi from Israel and some people list them real high priced to make them look more desirable.  The only one better and higher priced is a full auto $6-10K or a mini(different model) which will go for about $2,500.  I've been collecting these for 30 years and I only ever bought the best.  Liquidating my collection and have a few more also.  $1,650.

It was made in 1990 and has been a safe queen for most of its life until I bought it a few months ago. I have taken it to the range a few times since I purchased it and love how it shoots. It gave me no issues and performs as well as my full size Beretta 92FS.

This is essentially a 92FS Compact without a rail, which are getting hard to find these days. As far as ergonomics go, it only differs from the 92FS in that the safety is on the frame instead of the slide, a feature than many prefer to the original design. Has the benefit of having a durable frame, but it's short enough to not poke out when holstered in a waistband like a full size 92FS.

The pistol comes with 1 aftermarket 13-round magazine, and the original 12 round magazine. Also included is the original owners manual, and a soft case. Another bonus is the Taurus unlimited lifetime warranty that stays with the gun, NOT the owner. More info on that here: http://www.taurususa.com/repair-policy.cfm"

Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting.With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots.An Ultra-Reliable Professional Choice for Holster CarryAs you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.Modular, Easy to Customize and Full of User-Friendly ChoicesThe Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange back straps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand. Other features include a retractable lanyard loop, as well as user-adjustable sights and a number of accessories that make this pistol a true champion in its class.Safe, Easy to Use and MaintainThis handgun offers intuitive controls and an absolutely safe mechanism. In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.Specifications:Action: Single/DoubleBarrel length (mm): 83Barrel length (in): 3.27Caliber: 9x19 (PARA)Magazine: 15Overall height (mm): 129Overall height (in): 5Overall length (mm): 173Overall length (in): 6.8Overall width (mm): 36Overall width (in): 1.42Sight radius (in): 5.2Sight radius (mm): 131Weight unloaded (g): 770Weight unloaded (oz): 27.2"

The Astra A-100 is much like a SIG P228 but this pistol is constructed entirely of steel; no polymer or alloy. It shoots great, shows very little mechanical wear, has modern controls and ergonomics, bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. I've shot about 50 rds thru this pistol and it has never jammed or misfired in any way. It is easy to take apart and reassemble, and it fires the inexpensive, easy to find standard 9mm ammo. This Astra was imported by Interarms of Alexandria, VA, and is so marked. Interarms imported Astra pistols were made to a higher standard of fit and finish than the Astra pistols later imported and marked by EAA after Interarms went out of business.  The 17 rd magazine does not come with the pistol because by MD law, I cannot transfer, swap, give, or sell you the hi cap mag within the state of Maryland, but by the same MD law, I can legally send the magazine out of the State of Maryland to another state where they are legal, or the FFL I use in Southern Maryland will send it to a gunshop in King George VA where you legally pick it up and bring back to MD. No charge or cost for sending the hi cap mag out of state. Additional hi cap magazines and 10 rd Maryland Compliant magazines for the Astra A-100 are readily available. Buyer must have HQL or be HQL exempt. Will meet at the gunshop of your choice in Southern Maryland but I prefer to use ALL PAWN in White Plains, they only charge $35 for a MSP Compliant transfer. This pistol is on the MSP approved handgun roster. Buyer pays FFL fee. Thanks for looking, pls feel free to ask questions."

I have for sale a beautiful Sig Sauer P238 ESP. I have never shot this gun, but I have shot the P938 that I own. The P938 is essentially the same gun, but in 9mm. It shoots very well and is very comfortable to carry. This is the perfect gun for the wife, girlfriend, or daughter. Conversely, it's also the perfect gun for male 1911 enthusiast when equipped with the white pearl grips that also come with the gun. I am unsure of how much 380 ammo I have to give with this gun, but I would guess its around 150 - 250 rounds, if not more. I will double check and give an exact number when I can.

The Sub-compact does not sacrifice any of the features of its larger counterpart, while offering superior concealability and light weight.Low Recoil in a Lightweight PackageIn spite of its diminutive size, the Px4 Storm Sub-compact was designed to be pleasant to shoot, offering minimal muzzle-jump and keeping recoil mild. The tilt-breech system was designed to work with the rest of the frame to dissipate both the kick in the web of the shooting hand and the muzzle rise that happens at every shot, making this handgun far less punishing on the hand than others in its class, the PX4 Sub-compact is quick back on target--a best-of-both-worlds situation combining superior concealment and low weight with a full-size shooting experience.Superior Durability and Ease of MaintenanceThe stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion- and sweat-resistant, making it perfectly suited for concealment even in hot and active conditions. This is a tactical pistol that is designed to work as hard as you while being as low-maintenance as possible. Disassembly is extremely easy and quick and requires no tools, while the tough and surface-treated steels enable you to keep it as good as new with a quick wipe even after a whole day in the holster.User-Friendly, Feature-Rich and AmbidextrousWith the included interchangeable back straps, the PX4 Storm Sub-compact is easy and quick to adapt to different hand sizes (for instance, male or female) and grip styles. A built-in Picatinny rail further adds to its flexibility, making it possible to attach a variety of tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or alteration. Furthermore, most controls are either ambidextrous or reversible, making it easy to shoot and train with either hand dominant. Any shooter considering a reliable and soft-shooting subcompact for concealed carry or personal defense should give the PX4 Sub-compact a very close look.Commander-Style HammerBesides being a custom-looking touch, the Commander-style hammer is lighter; hammer-fall during firing is therefore crisper and will not disrupt your aim.Ambidextrous SafetyEasily and safely train or shoot with either handAutomatic Firing Pin BlockThe PX4 gives you an extra level of safety while in the holster or not in use--the firing pin is blocked automatically to prevent any type of accidental firing. Non-Reflective Black Bruniton FinishThe Beretta Bruniton finish gives you two distinct advantages: it is non-reflective, and it is highly resistant to water, sand, salt-spray and powder.Picatinny RailThe built-in Picatinny rail makes it easy to complement the PX4 with a variety of tactical accessories such as lighting devices, with no gunsmithing required. Reversible Mag ReleaseMost controls on the PX4 are reversible or ambidextrous, making it possible to train or shoot right- or left-handed. Interchangeable BackstrapsThe interchangeable back straps will make the PX4 grip fit ergonomically most hand-sizes and shooting styles. SnapGrip ExtensionThe SnapGrip extension is a device located at the front of the magazine floor plate; when snapped forward, it enables the use of the little finger of the dominant hand for a more secure grip.Drop-Free MagazineTactical magazine-exchanges on the PX4 are easy and lightning-fast. When you operate the magazine-release, the magazine falls free and does not require the use of the off-hand.SpecificationsAction: Single/DoubleBarrel length (mm): 76Barrel length (in): 3Caliber: 9x19mm (Para)Magazine: 13Overall height (mm): 122Overall height (in): 4.8Overall length (mm): 158Overall length (in): 6.22Overall width (mm): 36Overall width (in): 1.42Sight radius (in): 4.8Sight radius (mm): 122Weight unloaded (g): 740Weight unloaded (oz): 26.1"

Based on the famous Uzi SMG, the Uzi Pro Pistol is purpose-built, with only one goal - uncompromising performance and reliability on a robust design. This 9mm Luger Parabellum version for the American public sports an advanced polymer pistol grip that incorporates an integrated magazine release button for fast and easy magazine changes. The cocking handle is located on the receiver side allowing for a full-length Picatinny rail on the top receiver cover. A short Picatinny rail is also mounted below the barrel for additional accessories. Safety is always a primary concern with the Uzi brand and this pistol features three safety mechanisms: a conventional manual safety, a firing pin block, and a proven grip safety that must be fully depressed before the gun can be cocked or fired.             SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num:       UPP9S       Category:           SPECIALTY                     Type                :PistolAction              :Semi-AutomaticCaliber             :9mmBarrel Length       :4.5""Capacity            :20+1Safety              :ManualGrips               :Black PolymerSights              :AdjustableWeight              :3.6lbsMetal Finish        :Black Hard Coat AnodizedOAL                 :9.5""Barrel Length Range :4.00"" to 4.99""Weight Range        :3.00 lbs to 3.99 lbs"
