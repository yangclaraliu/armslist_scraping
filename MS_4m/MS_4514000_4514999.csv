I ran this gun for about 3/4 of a season after I first got it and then IDPA removed it from SSP (Its still ESP legal) and since I wanted an IDPA/USPSA gun I switched to SP01 Shadows. I have put around 2500 or so rounds downrange with this pistol. It does have some very minor holster wear towards the front of the slide, other than that this pistol is in like new condition.

I actually hate to sell it, but I wont be shooting it much anymore and I cant justify leaving it in the safe. Save yourself a long wait if you have been looking for one of these pistols and buy it right MEOW! (CZ Custom is always sold out of these)

Long story short, I ended up with this vest in place of a crappy pistol and some cash. In my rather mundane and suburban middle class life, I am rarely if ever in need of such accrutriments. As such, make me an offer - I would like to trade. I am building an AR and need lower parts (Giselle trigger, Stock, BCG etc) but, as my possession of the vest shows, open to completely random offers if they are cool. 

This comes with the vest, brand new, neck liner/collar and cod (dong) protector. These are soft kevlar, meant to protect from shrapnel and small pistol rounds. To valiantly/stupidly stand in front of any real firepower, you will need to invest in a ceramic or steel set of plates. Or dont... just dont come trying to get a refund when you have gone and gotten yourself all shot full of holes. 

These are not military walk-offs; when they replaced these with the newer models with the kidney plates and better drag tags the remaining contract vests were sold."

It is a matte stainless finish. It has an accessory rail. It comes with 3 factory 8 round magazines. I have a factory straight or curved grip or brand new Hogue rubber grips. I also have a Desantis paddle holster for left handers like me if you want to buy for additional $25.00.

I love this gun but have come across something that I think I can't live without so this might have to go.

I am not interested in trades unless you have a Sig P220 Carry or a S&W M&P 45 4"" without manual safety that you want to trade.


I am in Charlotte and will travel an hour to meet up. Must have ccw or purchase permit and fill out bill of sale.

Price is $500.00 firm.

Lee 3pc die set (full length size, collet sizer, seating die)

I'm not pressed to get rid of this, I'm just not a fan of  small caliber revolvers, with that being said, I will not take less than what it's worth. Thanks for your time!"

The original stock was swapped out for an Archangel Deluxe Target Stock,  and the barrel was replaced with an 18 inch Green Mountain bull barrel. It has also had trigger parts replaced with a Tactical Solutions hammer, sear, and spring kit. This transformed the trigger into a light, crisp pull that breaks right around 2 pounds. Included with the rifle is:  4-16x Centerpoint scope, quick release bolt stop, bipod, and hard carrying case. I will also include the original wood stock and stainless barrel, as well as a couple boxes of CCI Standard Velocity .22lr ammo.

Shoots great and very accurate. From 50 yards and just using a bipod for support, dime sized groups were regularly attainable under proper wind conditions. Selling because I don't get into target shooting with .22lr that much anymore, and need the money to fund another purchase. Only asking $375 for a rifle that has roughly $650 in it altogether."

Bought it on a whim and now I kinda wish I had gotten something a bit smaller. As mentioned this is almost new and has only had 150 rounds through it. Comes with its case and all the stuff it came with, including two 18 round mags. Excellent trigger as most of the excellent reviews on this gun mention, I'd say better than a VP9 and comparable to the PPQ I had.
Would like to trade for a Glock 42, M&P Shield in 9mm, XDs 9mm essential, or a Ruger SR9c or SR40c. Would also look at S&W J frames in 38 special. Would consider other 9mm or 40 handguns, but no rifles, shotguns, Taurus or Kel Tec please, I'd be willing to add some cash depending on what you have.

We have received several requests for a 1911 style pistol with as thin of grip as possible. The reasons vary from something that is easier to grip for more control, smaller hands, or something for ladies to use. Based on these requests we are proud to introduce our collaboration with Richard Heinie: the new Lady Hawk.
The Lady Hawk uses a both a frame and a mainspring housing that have been thinned down and scalloped to reduce the overall circumference of the grip. We also install thin Alumagrips to further reduce the circumference of the pistol grip. These features make for a pistol grip like no other, a perfect fit for those with small hands or for a female shooter.
The first thing we were asked was ""Can I get it without the Lady Hawk model name on it?"". So we have decided not to put ""Lady Hawk"" on the slide unless the customer requests it. The Lady Hawk comes standard in 9mm, but is also available in .45ACP. The Lady Hawk also comes standard with a Titanium Blue Frame and Slide finish with polished Stainless Steel controls, but is also available in any other Nighthawk colors. All black with stainless steel controls is a popular option.

Now, I know the paint job will not be appealing to most, but I never intended to sell it, and I wanted to paint it, so there ya go. Anyway, the rifle is a Bushmaster lower with an Alexander Arms Overwatch upper on it. I bought this from an older benchrest shooter who thought it would be fun to shoot an AR, but he never got used to the recoil spring noise……. Everything else he shot was a bolt gun. Go figure. He had someone install a trigger over travel adjustment screw into the selector – I’ve never seen that before, but it’s pretty cool. It’s in one of the pics. I replaced the factory handguard with a Yankee Hill free float quad rail, and added the rings and 20x Super Sniper scope. Will ship with Lee dies, two boxes of Alexander Arms ammo (three rounds missing from one box), and a bag of loaded and empty rounds (gotta dig the bag up so I can get an accurate count), and three magazines. (I have a 5 rounder, but it didn’t make it into the pic – but it’s here.)
I bought this rifle to use as a coyote rifle, hence the paint job, but I have yet to fire a round thru it. I haven’t had the time to work with it, and have decided to sell it and put the money towards an old CJ7 rebuild project."

This is a revolver holding 5 shots per cylinder. This gun is being sold ''as is'' due to its age. I contacted Smith & Wesson via email to find out the age of this revolver. And they said it was made between 1890 and 1898. Doing some tracking on the serial number I suspect it to be made in about 1894. This revolver is a piece of history not a range gun, I shot almost a whole box of modern factory loads through it and it fired them safely. But the firing pin seems to be damaged or striking weak. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Price $100 firm. Buyer pays transfer."
