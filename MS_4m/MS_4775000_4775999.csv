Its phenomenal versatility makes it the premier choice for Law Enforcement Professionals as well.  PVS-14’s can be mounted on helmets for hands-free use, behind weapon optics, or simply as a handheld device.  As a monocular, the PVS-14 provides Gen3 night vision aid to one of the operator’s eyes, leaving the other to retain its natural night-adapted vision.  This is important when changing light conditions in the field cause the user to go back and forth between aided and un-aided vision.  Military and Law Enforcement operators need the ability to instantly switch between night vision and white light as the situation develops.
The TNV/PVS-14 is a U.S.-made Generation 3 night vision monocular based on the standard issue AN/PVS-14.  These are assembled according to U.S. Military guide lines, using factory-new parts and hand-selected image intensifier tubes.  
This version of the TNV/PVS-14 is built with a new-production ITT Gen3 PINNACLE image intensifier tube.  These tubes are hand-selected to meet current U.S. Military OMNI VIII contract specs and provide some of the cleanest images available.  ITT is one of two factory manufacturers of image intensifier tubes in the United States and the largest producer of night vision in the world.  They provide build the standard issue AN/PVS-14 for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.  ITT PINNACLE tubes are feature a thinner thin –film than their L3 counterparts.  This makes allows them to capture and process more light, providing the user with a brighter image.  But, the thin-film means they do not hold up as well to weapon recoil.  These  tubes are weapons rated for 5.56x45mm NATO.  Please note that while the ITT PINNACLE tube is an OMNI VIII Gen3 equivalent tube, the entire TNV/PVS-14 system cannot be classified as MILSPEC because it is assembled by TNVC at our facility.  Only fully factory-assembled L3 and ITT systems, built for a U.S. Military contract can be called MILSPEC.  However, the TNV/PVS-14 provides the same performance. 
Because TNV/PVS-14’s are built to such a high standard, they require very little maintenance.  At TNVC, they use the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine corps standards for both Maintenance and Repair of our PVS-14 monocular systems.  These Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services are outlined in:  ARMY TM 11-5855-306-10, MARINE CORPS 10271A-10/ 1A.  These U.S. Military maintenance standards state that upkeep maintenance is not required unless something is visibly broken or the unit is malfunctioning.  If you feel the need to send your TNV/PVS-14 in for them to check over, you can do so once a year at no charge.  However, un-needed disassembly can lead to premature parts wear and fatigue of your system.  Preventative maintenance is not recommended.

Top to bottom
Springfield Model 67 series E, manufactured by Savage Arms. 12 guage pump 3"" chamber. I don't recall ever firing, no mechanical or condition issues that I can see. Only asking $200. /

Revelation model 400, semi auto 2 3/4"" chamber, no mechanical or condition issues to really speak of. The bluing seems to more of a paint than actual bluing process because a bit of it is peeling off of the receiver.  This is a Browning A5 clone. Rare opportunity to own a semi auto shotgun for $200. /


Tradewinds Automatic Model H-170 12ga semi auto. Gun was produed in Italy by Farms Brescia and imported and sold by Tradewinds Inc, of Tacoma, Wa.  This is a Franchi AL48 clone. This one does have an issue- a small hook shaped piece on the hammer broke off. Anyone that can do metal work could weld something back on or a replacement hammer could be found.  My research found that this gun is so close to being exactly the franchi AL48 that most of the parts are interchangeable. The gun is in great shape other than that issue.  $100 takes it.

Prices are pretty firm as they are low to begin with, I would consider going down if someone says "" I will take them all and I will drive to you"". 
Probably prefer cash this time but trades are always on the table. I am trying to clear up some room so I would like pistols or a single rifle trade for all 3 shotguns. I do have other things I could throw in for the right trade. I can ship to an ffl  if you are out of area for actual shipping charges. 
I could arrange a time to meet in Olympia area but probably not farther north than that unless I am going up that way anyways. Prefer someone come down to Grays Harbor."

Info: The Caldwell AR Mag Charger revolutionizes the way ammo is handled and loaded into AR magazines. It is designed to accept 50 loaded rounds directly from any common 50 round ammo manufacturer box or from aftermarket 50 round plastic storage boxes. Simply align bullet tips and dump a box of ammo into the Mag Charger. The ammo is automatically aligned without touching a single round. Once filled with ammo, insert any AR magazine into the Mag Charger just as you would into a rifle. Then actuate the plunger back and forth loading 5 rounds per stroke as the spring loaded ammo carrier automatically advances aligning the next five rounds until magazine is fully loaded. The entire process of filling the Mag Charger with ammo and loading all 50 rounds into two magazines takes less than 15 seconds. An Ammo Transfer Tray is included to invert ammo that is positioned in boxes with the bullet tips oriented down or to stage bulk ammo for dumping into Mag Charger. Highly durable Polycarbonate construction, compatible with.223, 5.56 and.204 ammo. Patent Pending."

It's an amazing one-of-a-kind pistol. The gun brand-new is a Crimson carrying $1300 new but with all the parts that I put into it and all the labor of working on it that's about $3000 worth of labor and parts and work and everything on the gun so I think 3500 is actually a fair price because I've been offered 3000 for it more than once before and I was offered 4500 for about six months ago I should've taken the deal but I didn't think I was going to sell it. It is one of the best Race guns  I've ever used also it has a little finger catch on the top rear of the slide so it's easier to caulk back and it comes with two magazines with rubber bumpers on the bottom so it fits smoothly with the extended mag well also the slide release has been extended it is specially machine every part on here is completely different from original it's either been machine made or it has been replaced with something else is gotten really is amazing I am firm on my price and no trades cash only pick up only must meet in broken arrow or south Tulsa REDACTED Charlie thanks

The reason im trading is my apartment complex will only allow 2 vehicles per household and they are really cracking down on parking spots so it has to go. I will accept partial or full trades for guns or sell cash for 3300$ or best offer. Please be somewhat value conscious as ive been getting quite a bit of trades that are not close to the same value (yes even your 1500$ AR is not worth the trade but maybe a few more guns). Please feel free to text me at REDACTED and please no scams/tweekers or stolen crap. This bike has not been laid down and mainly garage kept accept for the last month. Its a great beginner bike or even for the advanced as its fast but also less than your typical Harley."

But, still work flawlessly as a day time shooter sight. (I believe they are rebuildable through Trijicon for a fee) They are all ""Red Dot"" reticle sights, which are much more desirable than the more popular ""amber"" colored counterparts. What is pictured is what you get.. i'm keeping the weaver mounts and hardware for my new optics.. (that's why they were removed before taking the pictures)
I'm asking $200 per sight, or $500 for all 3 reflex sights. I am open to trades of all sorts, so let me know what you have.

This model complies with NIJ Standard-0101.06 for Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor.**
AR500 Armor® Lightweight 10” x 12” Level III+ ALSC Body Armor (Advanced Lightweight Shooters Cut) - BUILD-UP PAXCON COATING - CURVED

AR500 Armor® Lightweight Level III+ Body Armor is the pinnacle of evolution in steel body armor; the result of breaking down barriers through innovation and dedication to providing the ultimate ballistic steel core body armor. Genetically similar to our standard level III+ ballistic core, we’ve taken our re-engineered formula which yields a 30% increase in strength, and made it thinner and lighter. The result is an evolved form of steel body armor, and an industry first ballistic steel core chest plate weighing in at just over 5lb, in our 10” x 12” Advanced Lightweight Shooters Cut (ALSC).

Not only is our Lightweight Level III+ body armor the lightest steel body armor on the market, it’s also the thinnest measuring in with a core thickness of only .21”. The ultra-thin profile improves comfort when shouldering a rifle and reduces overall bulk of your gear. Our Advanced Lightweight Shooters Cut (ALSC) provides protection of your vitals with strategic material reduction in locations to mitigate bulk, reduce weight, and improve ergonomics and function. Our ALSC is slightly undersized on the horizontal axis to ensure compatibility with all plate carriers.

Rugged and reliable, our Lightweight level III+ body armor retains many of the benefits AR500 Armor® Body Armor is known for. Including stress fracture resistance, multi-hit performance, and the longest shelf life in the industry. Multi-Hit capabilities are reduced in comparison to our Level III, and standard Level III+ body armor, in addition to a slight increase in back face deformation on impact due to the thinner profile of our lightweight ballistic core. Although performance still exceeds alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic/Composite, Dyneema, and UHMWPE body armor by a significant margin at a fraction of the cost!

AR500 Armor® level III+ lightweight body armor is capable of defeating 5.56x45 M193, 5.56x45 M855/SS109, 7.62x39 (AK), and 7.62x51 M80 Ball (.308 Winchester) rounds. Independent and in-house testing has shown our armor well exceeds standard level III threats; our philosophy has always been to over deliver! Coated with industry leading PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating.

Threat Rating: Level III+/Special Threat Tested AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat the most common rifle threats in existence. 5.56x45 M193 and 5.56x45 M855 SS109 at a velocity of up to 3,000 feet per second, and 7.62x39, 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,850 feet per second. (Not rated for AP rounds)

Ballistic Resistance Certifications and Tests:

V50 - (5.56 M193, and 7.62x51 M80 Ball) by Oregon Ballistics Laboratory - (V50 testing consists of increasing bullet velocity on each subsequent shot until penetration is achieved, and then determining at which point 50% of the rounds at a given velocity penetrate the body armor. V50 is used to determine top end velocity limits of body armor)

Penetration Test - (5.56 M855/SS109, 7.62x39 Mild Steel Core) by H.P. White Laboratory, Inc. - (Penetration tests test for complete penetration of a given round at a specific velocity in a controlled setting)

The Adams Arms Voodoo Innovation (VDI) Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel is finished inside and out with Voodoo barrels' proprietary QPQ (Quench-Polish-Quench) Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion, increases corrosion resistance, and reduces barrel bore friction offering both improved performance and increased barrel life which is a significant upgrade from a chrome lined barrel. The end result is a superior quality Voodoo Innovation (VDI) barrel that produces accuracy on par with a match grade stainless steel barrel.

The Adams Arms Short Stroke Gas Piston System is one of the best engineered designs available today! No hot gas and carbon fouling crud going into your receiver and baking onto the Bolt Carrier Group and cooking off your bolt lube. Your receiver stays nice and clean and runs cool with a gas piston system making maintenance and cleaning quick and easy.

They don't seem to care that they are disrespecting other member's posts by posting so many consecutive pages of ads. 

 It looks like private party members have about given up on Armslist due to dealer HOGS, and moved to another site to post their items.  

No, ""The FILTER"" does not change the fact that the page after page of consecutive ads are pushing your 1 or 2 posts many pages to the rear.  

You can let them know by calling, emails, not putting them on your Christmas card list, keeping your money, etc.

The upper rcvr is nickel boron coated, along with the BCG, which makes for a lower friction operation and easily cleaned combination. Charging handle is a BCM oversized (Mod 3, I think). Buffer is a Spikes Tactical heavy-weighted buffer to reduce felt recoil and get rid of that annoying rattle of buffer weights. The stock, grips, and flip up sights are Magpul. It has a single point sling adapter attached. Paint is Duracoat and color was chosen by my wife. She says it is magenta, I say it is pink.

The easy-to-shoot PS90 represents a flexible, compact bullpup carbine design that's ideal for personal security and sporting use. Chambered in the high velocity 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s 16"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Models with 10- or 30-round polymer detachable magazines are available. The PS90’s safety switch is located inside the trigger guard for easy access. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

I purchased this Blackhawk .45 brand new over 20 years ago in original box with packaging.  I am selling to fund a project. I've purchased one box (20 rounds) and shot them through it - that's all.  Very low round count, the gun has been a ""safe queen"".  As you can see from the pictures, it has adjustable rear sights and is VERY clean.  The bluing on the right side of the trigger guard has some imperfections. it might have been something I placed in the box with the gun (see close ups in pics)

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23 / Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALS and the Army Special Forces.On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition.All pistols exceed the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!
