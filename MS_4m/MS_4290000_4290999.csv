I have 2 extra factory mags with the finger extension for them too (and I just found the flat plates to swap if you like). I also have a Crimson Trace® Laserguard® laser sight for it (that cost me almost as much as the gun). This Lightweight Compact 9mm is a recoil-operated, locked breech, hammer-fired, double action only, semi-automatic pistol by Sturm, Ruger & Co. This pistols safety features include: a loaded chamber indicator and magazine disconnect safety. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. At 6"" (L) x 4 1/2"" (H) and less than 1"" thick (0.9""/23mm), and weighing just over 17 oz with an empty mag, the LC9 is perfect for concealed carry. The Ruger LC9 features a black polymer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel. The pistol shipped with one magazine, including two interchangeable base pads—one that fits flush with the frame, and the other (fitted to the magazine from the factory) that provides a grip extension of about 0.5 inches (13 mm) I know that since the new LC9-S (~$450) is out these older LC9's are going for ~$350 new, but the Crimson Trace® Laserguard® can go on either version. Best price I could find on the Crimson Trace® Laserguard® alone is $230, but of course it was ""Out Of Stock."" The gun with the Crimson Trace installed is running $500+ with one mag. I have 2 extra factory mags that cost $29.99+ each (if you can find them). Purchase will come with the original box, the zippered black fabric padded Ruger case, and the pistol with all 3 mags. I'll take $550 for the gun with all 3 mags and the Crimson Trace® Laserguard®. (Crimson Trace® Laserguard® will also come with it's original box.)Will consider trades for an entry level AK, or .357 revolverIf this is still posted, it is available. If you are NOT a NEVADA resident, with NEVADA ID showing you are over 21, and willing to sign a ""bill of sale"" certifying that you are legally eligible to own a firearm (or you don't hold a current Nevada CCW) then please don't waste my time."

This listing is for One Magazine; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have in stock for the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. KSI of South Korea is associated with the Daewoo Conglomerate. Since shortly after the War in the mid 1950s, they’ve had access to classic US Weapons; and KSI magazines are second to none with their considerable experience and provenness of their magazines for the M1 Carbines and M14 / M1A series rifles. They even manufacture some of the best Glock magazines in the world, and we all remember their fine little DP-51 pistols whose magazines are interchangeable with the 6906 series Smith & Wessons. For just as long, KSI has been manufacturing magazines for Kalashnikov rifles. We haven’t seen many of theirs in the US, because they’re not price competitive. Here, however, is an excellent huge capacity magazine manufactured by KSI for the AK47 series rifles, their steel 75 shot drum. Construction is entirely matte blue steel, and capacity is 75 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition. Each magazine comes individually packaged with instructions page. Since there is such a wide variety of AK rifles on the market, manufactured all over the world, these will occasionally need to be fitted to the individual rifle, note the massive construction of the forward lock wedge on the mouth face of the magazine, plenty of metal there in the rare event that might be necessary. This magazine will not fit an SKS 59/66 type rifle, or a Ruger Mini 30, will not fit a Saiga Rifle, or the engine manifold of a 1952 Chevrolet. It will only fit AK type rifles, including models WASR, AK-47S, MAK-90, and similar chambered in 7.62x39 caliber. Similar Domestic US Magazines, like the ones made by Auto Ordnance, often price out at over $300 apiece. We’re offering the magazine in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 89.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, Oak Park IL, District of Colombia, Hawaii, South Bend IN, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, or any jurisdiction where 31 round or higher capacity magazines are restricted for law enforcement only.

Three packs Sold Together.  No individual pack sales.

I put 75.00 in the ad because it forces you to put some price, this is NOT THE PRICE.

Best Reasonable offer cash.

I am not one of the guys buying and over inflating prices on ammo.  I don't really want to sell it, but have bills I have to pay, so I'm leaving the price up to you.

Make an offer, and I'll take the highest cash offer.
I can deliver, if not too far from NE Lincoln

Just for anyone that has the idea I am one of the hated price gougers, I have never sold even one round of ammo to anyone ever before.  I actually do not want to sell this ammo.  I would love to keep it, but need the money.

After further inspection for a potential buyer, it appears to not feed properly. Looks like the device which pushes the cartridge up into the extractor / bolt face is broken and missing. Also speckling of rust on the metal. The feed tube and spring work great."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.  The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.  Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Named for the Toklat River in central Alaska, this Talo version of the Ruger Super Redhawk would make an excellent general purpose handgun. This revolver has a satin stainless finish and an unfluted cylinder with a 5″ slab sided barrel and adjustable sights (red insert ramp front/white outline notch rear). The textured rubber finger groove grips help manage recoil. The powerful .454 Casull is a capable round for defense against bears and other dangerous game. The gun is also capable of shooting the common .45 Colt round allowing for practice without the stiff recoil of the .454. The frame is machined to accept Ruger scope rings (Included). This gun weighs 3 lbs. 2 oz.
The potent Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are popular among hunters, metallic silhouette shooters and those looking for an added level of safety when outdoors in dangerous game country.
   We have 2 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $839 each.

Both the jig and Saw are new never used. It is ready to plug in and start cutting. This anodized jig is mounted into a chop saw and is sold together. You can accurately, rapidly and consistently rough cut your cases to within a few thousands of an inch of final size. 20 rounds a minute is about average for a person just starting to use this jig with some people getting 30 rounds a minute. The interesting thing about the jig is the case is accurately located and locked into the jig for cutting. Once you chop it you press the next case in from the left and the cut case AUTOMATICALLY ejects out the right side. Keep your left hand on fresh brass and your right on the saw handle. Put a bucket below it to catch all those cases spitting out!

NOTE:  This improved chamber was cut from a standard .223 chamber. It is not a true improved chamber. Yes it is safe but will need to be fired with handloaded ammo for full potential due to headspace concerns. This was done intentionally for a project I was interested in.  Barrel could, easily and relatively expensively,  be rechambered to any .22 caliber centerfire cartridge larger than .223AI. Any additional info regarding this barrel will be answered upon request. Price reflects the lack of commonality of the barrel. Less than 200 total rounds fired. Also included 43 pieces of fireformed brass. Can add dies if interested for additional price. Can be discussed if interested.

The rifle comes with two magazines whih are tough to come by apparently ( I ordered the rifle and magazines from cz and it took about 7 weeks) and if the offer is right the scope (leupold vx2 1-4 x20mm on maxima scope mounts) the blurring is perfect, the wood is great quality for being a production rifle and it comes stock with a set trigger.

Mainly looking for lighter weight AR with fixed FSB and magpul polymer handguard.

For sale is an AR-15 made up of a YHM upper, handguard, and barrel, on an Anderson lower. It has a 16 inch barrel with a 1:8 twist, to handle a wider range of ammo. Has a YHM bcg, properly staked and in great shape. Shoots great, does not malfunction, and has been kept well cleaned and lubed. The YHM quad rail is about 12 inches long, and is free floated. The rifle weighs about 8.5 lbs unloaded. The buffer tube and both stocks are commercial-spec. I have fired about 400 rounds through it since I purchased it, and it works great, even eats up steel cased ammo like it's candy and asks for more. I am not willing to split up the parts. There is a good amount of money in parts and the lot will all be sold together. The list of all the parts included are as follows:

Magpul XTM handstop kit (pictured)
Magpul XTM enhanced rail covers x4 (pictured)
Magpul MBUS Pro steel flip up sights (pictured)
Magpul ACS carbine stock (pictured)
Magpul 30 round Pmag (pictured)
Magpul MOE+ grip (pictured)
Allen tactical one point sling (pictured)
Ambidextrous sling attachment receiver end plate (pictured)

FDE off-brand angled foregrip (not pictured)
FDE standard AR collapsible stock (not pictured)
Brown NCSTAR red dot sight with cantilever mount (not pictured)

The off-brand angled foregrip and red dot came with the rifle when I bought it. The previous owner had painted them brown. On the Angled Foregrip and stock, I took paint thinner and wire brush and scrubbed 80% of the paint off leaving it about 80% FDE with about 20% brown paint I couldn't / didn't care to remove. The red dot seems to function fine, but personally I just don't know how sturdy it is so I opted not to run it on my rifle. The Angled Foregrip and red dot are the only two cheap pieces that comes with this rifle. Everything else is in great shape and the iron sights are awesome!

Text me with any offers, I am not looking to trade for other rifles / handguns / bows / fishing boats / 4 wheelers / dirtbikes / 1980 Honda Civics... Please don't waste my time, money talks. Must be a carry permit holder willing to sign a bill of sale. If you want more pictures I will be happy to send them. If you're sketchy or offering me a low ball price, do not expect a text back.

It is in a tapco t6 tactical stock. I have 3 magazines for it (20 rounders ""most reliable). Two tapco and a pro mag great condition. Also has a sling. It has an upgrade match grade trigger (not the clunky 8 pound pull original). It has a new buffer spring and a great bolt/carrier. This rifle shoots great and you will not find a better trigger. I am selling this as a package deal. It comes with a hard case, the rifle + sling, 3 magazines, and a long rifle stock made for the sks which can be used if you want to use the built in original sks magazine + stripper clips. The long rifle stock is not a cheap thin polymer. It is heavy and thick and feels great. If you add all of this up in which I paid for it:
Sks Gun $325
Tapco t6 stock $100
Long Rifle Comp $90
Tapco mag $20
tapco mag$ 20
pro mag $20
Case $30
sling $15
Match Grade trigger $140 (yes i paid 140 for it and i will let you dry fire it and you will see why, and no it is not a rip off. This is not a factory clunker)
New Buffer Spring $25
All of this comes up to 785 bucks. And I am asking 400. Gun is in great shape the metal has some blemishes due to age but no gouges and or damage. Barrel is in great shape and I only fire brass winchester. Yes you can call me a snob :). No Surplus/Corrosive ammo. I have gotten some grief over the trigger and its price but if you know anything about the old SKS and stiff trigger when you feel this you will know why I paid the price that I did. I am not in a rush to sell this and I think 400 bucks is a pretty awesome deal. This gun does not jam and it shoots clean. I have shot cheap tula through it before and it still shoots just as good although I dont like cheap ammo. Again I am a snob when it comes to my weapons and I take very good care of them and clean them well. I am looking to buy an Ak so I am selling this as I already own to other SKS. The recevier cover of this rifle does have a rail mount built in for a scope but I have never recomended scoping on the receiver cover. They dont stay zeroed in well and if you MUST scope you want to buy one you can mount in front of the bolt. If you do not like this rail cover you can buy an original for 40 bucks online. I like mine because i mount a pressure switched flash light which lights up the front and rear sights for night time shooting :D While this gun is not an AR or an AK I prefer it over my zavasta ak due to the fact it can shoot pass 150 yards. The only downsize to the SKS in my opnion is they are longer then the ak and hold 20 rounds. You can buy the 30 rounders but i like my vertical grip on it and it leaves more room with the 20s."

Price $399 will take some trade's let me know what you got...

The Career 707 blew the doors off the PCP market when it was introduced in the US in the 1990s. Even after all these years, this airgun continues to be a favorite among hunters.

The variable power levels give you a huge range of energy for taking small- and medium-sized game at distances previously reserved only for firearms. The gun is manufactured by ShinSung, a Korean company that knows what hunters need and want, because Koreans have been using the Career far longer to hunt all types of game.

The Monte Carlo Indonesian hardwood stock has a raised cheekpiece and checkering on the wrist (directly above the lever). The forearm also has checkering to ensure a firm grip when you're in the thick of things. The lever-action cocking mechanism works quickly, smoothly and effortlessly as you chamber each pellet from the multi-shot magazine.

The number of shots you can load in the mag depends on the length of the pellets, but most people load about 6 pellets (although you can fit 10 Crosman Premiers!). Longer ones take up more room, so you won't be able to load as many. 

The built-in manometer (air pressure gauge) shows you how much air remains in the two built-in air reservoirs, located directly below the barrel. This air rifle was the first to offer adjustable velocities with its integral power wheel. Adjust the wheel to accommodate heavy or light pellets, long or short distances and the type of game you're shooting. The gun adjusts to YOUR needs instead of the other way around! Max velocity is 1,250 fps in .22 cal. and 1,000 fps in .25 cal. You'll get up to 20 full-power shots.

I have 7 boxes of Hansen Cartridge Company ammo.  This is good stuff that I bought years ago. Hansen was popular in the 1990's and made in Yugoslavia or Czech Republic.  Here is a forum quote concerning the quality of this ammo.

""Bought some Hansen (Cartridge Company) ammo in the 1990s. It shot very well and I reloaded the brass my usual 8 or 9 times, then put it in the recycle bin. The brass was actually slightly thicker than American-made brass. You should have no problem with it"".

150 Grain Pointed Soft Point bullet. Reloadable brass. Non-Corrosive.

$80 for 140 rounds, less than .59 a round. If you can find quality 308. ammo with reloadable brass .308 ammo cheaper not including tax, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BE BOTHERING ME WITH RIDICULOUS LOW BALL OFFERS.

FTF in Allendale or buyer pays shipping.

Can't even reload non-quality 308 ammo for that price when piecing together all the components.  Great deal.

If so, and you want to make EVERY guy on the range jealous, this is your rifle.  This is, hands down, the best AR platform rifle on the market. If you are unfamiliar with the rifle, please read up on its history and you will greatly appreciate this fine rifle. Very few were ever imported, and this one is number #131. It was imported by Kimber in Clackamak, OR. It is in very good condition and has a Stormwerks rail and Stormwerks 90 degree selector. Both can easily be removed to restore to original, and original parts will come with the rifle. The rifle is piston fired, (almost identical to the LWRC and LMT systems, because they copied daewoo!). It has a foldable, retractable stock (think mp5 style) and is extremely clean and ridiculously accurate. If you think high-end ARs are accurrate, wait till you shoot this! It has less than 300rnds thru the gun since import, and you can tell. Its in immaculate condition. Please, don't bother trying to lowball me. Its not eating anything in the safe and it won't bother me a bit to let it sit there for awhile. I have more photos on request, (including ones of the stock being folded!).

857,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4290857,For Sale/Trade:  Custom Blueprinted Remington 700 - 6.5x284 - HS precison stock,"Carson City, Sparks, Reno, Nevada","$ 1,500","Listed On: Tuesday, July 7, 2015",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,6.5x284                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For your consideration is a blueprinted Remington 700 chambered in a 6.5x284. The action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

For this build we used a Shilen match grade chrome barrel with a 1-8 twist rate. The contour is a ""Sendero"" contour which is a light bull barrel. The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown. I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was given a caustic blue matte finish. This rifle can still be customized to your needs - spiral flute the bolt; add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; ect.

Rifle is being offered with an HS precision ""sendero"" stock with a BDL trigger guard and the factory trigger adjusted to a crsip 3lbs. with zero creep. The BDL trigger guard and trigger are not in the pic because the BDL was being cerakoted...  This rifle will easily shoot 1/2 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/4 MOA using hand loaded ammo. I have other stocks that can be used for this build if you prefer a different color or style. I can even sell just the barreled action with trigger for 1200.  I will also include a set of RBCS 6.5x284 reloading dies with the complete rifle.

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s avalible as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probally have it or can build it.

Will ship to your FFL if needed.  As far as trading - any firearms I will consider...  worst I can say is no thanks."

The Model 92SB Compact had a shortened barrel length of 4.29” vs. 4.92” and a 13-round double-stack magazine vs. 15.  This piece shows no holster wear; the slide’s bluing is deep and rich as is the matching dark anodized frame (I regret not removing the dust).  There are no dings or pitting.  It bears the Beretta proofing mark of “AM” on the trigger guard denoting entirely Italian-made in 1984 (not Beretta USA) - with an easy life ever since.  Aside from simple handling and probable test firing I would rank its condition as close to near mint.  The purchase price includes three 13-round mags marked “PB CAL 9 PARA  MADE IN ITALY”.  Two are 92SB-C originals and one is a 92FS type with pronounced finger rest floorplate – see pics.  A foam-lined, polymer Doskosil transportation case is also included.
