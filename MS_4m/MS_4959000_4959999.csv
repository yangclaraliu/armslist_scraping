These are interesting in several ways. First of all, in that there is a true series. Not one that emerged over time as variants were introducted, but a series conceived and sold all at the same time. This offered small, single-stack pistols in 9 mm Parabellum, .40 S&Wand .45 ACP, and a double-column — but otherwise identical — 9 mm as well.Secondly, these are a mix of mechanical features. Though constructed firmly in the modern era, they are still single action. Slide rails are inverted, and the locking system is generally of the most modern styling, with coned barrels which did not otherwise emerge until the M31 and Megastar. The trigger system is, however, almost identical to that of the classic series, even forsaking the removable backstrap of the modern series pistols.Other mechanical differences include the lack of a firing pin stop plate. To remove the firing pin, the rear sight must be removed (by hammering it off), and the drop safety pull out the top. The trigger is basically that of the 1911 clones like the B series, and retains the disappointing single side transfer bar.I have a great used gun for sale. It is a Firestar Model M43 it is a Single Action 9mm with a 7 round Magazine. With a 3.39 lenght barrel. This Gun is in good shape and is in 100% working order!!!! Great for your first gun or just to add to the collection!!!!!"

Comes in a box and has papers but not original to this Colt. Everything is as if you stepped back in 1969 and bought this one new in the sporting goods store. It is impossible to improve upon this Colt Diamondback and you will not find a Diamondback made in 1969 that is any better than the 100% condition that this one is in today. This Colt is for a person that wants to have the best condition Diamondback possible. Judge from the pictures on the condition and the person that owns this Colt will be 100% happy with this 100% conditioned Diamondback. No need to state bores are shiny and handles are crisp as 100% condition does not need explaining. All we can say about this Colt is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Description from Trijicon Website: Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

Runs good. Plenty of power.

BFG all terrain t/a ko tires
Drivers seat is broken on one side, rear glass is busted (have vinyl replacement). cosmetically it's not the prettiest but a good solid 4x4 rig. Brakes are weak because one wheel cylinder is leaking, but I bought new wheel cylinders for all 4 corners, just haven't had time to install. Steering is a bit sloppy as is typically with the older CJs. 
This would be a good right for the winter, hunting, trail riding, or tinker a bit and make it your daily driver. Would also make a hell of a rock crawler project!

 These units were Dell's highest in class models. Though these systems are often referred to as 'Day Trader Computers' we like the term 'Productivity stations' better because in addition to Stock Traders, these systems are ideal for making Professionals and Powers Users alike more productive. While systems like these have been marketed for years to the Stock Trade crowd, those in Finance, and the Engineering & Architecture fields; these computer configurations optimize the work process for people of all professions. Power users and avid multi-taskers will be blown away with how efficient their working time becomes when they spread out their visual computing workspace across an increased field of screen real estate. This is especially true for anyone in Technology, Banking, Healthcare, Legal, or other advanced degreed professions. All professionals will see immense benefits from taking a step back and redesigning their approach to business processes in a manner that leverage these advanced platform configuration. We have been at this a long time and (8)x LCD Monitors tends to be the magic number of displays for spreading out all your open windows.

 A general use case scenario would be the ability to keep your inbox and calendar open, work in one document while referring to a source on an adjacent screen for reference and content; all the while still leaving room to display additional windows for things like line of business apps specific to your industry, web browsers, a video or audio streaming application, and other programs convenient to have open at a moment's notice. 

 For some industry specific use case examples consider the below:
 - Realtors can view multiple MLS listings side by side, while inputting a new listing, reviewing the Property Appraisers Site, drafting an email, monitoring their inbox, browsing the web and they'd still have an available screen to open up that contract offering when it comes through.
 - Accountings and CPA's could view multiple spreadsheets including one that is sized to stretch across over 2 monitors, have Quickbooks open an up, access their banking websites, mail client, and draft a message all simulations open on the screen without the need to hunt and peck through minimized windows. 
 - Attorneys and Paralegals can see and compare multiple drafts of documents side by side all while being able to reference the Public Record Website, their matter management software, time tracking program, Inbox, and Calendar all on their own individual screens. 

 I myself am a System Architect and need really powerful and robust machines for my processes. The computers being offered are the same exact spec setups I have on my desk at work and at home for my own uses."

Compact model, same size as a 19 but holds 14 rounds of .40 caliber, with factory porting to offset muzzle rise. Comes with slide cut-outs and a ported barrel straight from Glock. You can drop a 9mm conversion barrel in it to shoot and train with a cheaper caliber with even less muzzle rise and lower recoil, which is great for less experienced shooters to practice with (and only 20 cents per round). You can also go in the other direction and get a .357 barrel for it as well. So this is a very versatile mulit-purpose gun that you can easily carry. It's a Gen 3 so it came with 2 mags, and has a rail for a weapon light or laser. The first $460 cash gets it and that is the bottom dollar cash price so no need to ask, please only reply if you actually have $460 cash and want to spend it, thanks."

One tool, any job.The Sphinx SDP Compact Sand is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Sand features a full anodized aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Sand is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allows for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Sand. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.Technical SpecificationsCaliber9x19 mm / 9x21 mmOverall Length7.4 Inches / 188 mm Overall Height5.4 Inches / 136 mmOverall Width1.4 Inches / 35 mmWeight29.06 Ounces / 824 GramsBarrel Length3.7 Inches / 95 mmSight Radius5.7 Inches / 145 mmSightsFront: Iron blade with white dotRear: Serrated fixed sightActionDouble Action / Single Action Ambidextrous decocking leverTrigger Pull WeightSingle Action: 4.0+lb / 1.8+kgDouble Action:10.0+lb / 4.5+kgSlide MaterialSteelSlide FinishBlack with TIAIN coatingFrame MaterialUpper: Hard Anodized AluminumLower: Hard Anodized AluminumGripFinger moldsInterchangeable Inserts: Polymer base with RubberSize: Small, Medium, LargeMagazine CatchLeft / Right - reversibleMagazine Capacity 17 Rounds"

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast.

It has a faint cylinder drag line with no fading or peeling of the nickel. The wood grips are also in excellent condition showing no signs of wear and abuse. Below is an article and history of the COLT COBRA written by Concealed Carry of ArizonaPosted on August 12, 2013 November 8, 2014 by CCAZIn 1950 Colt introduced a lightweight aluminum alloy frame revolver called the Cobra. It was built on the same D series design as the Detective Special that was introduced in 1927. Colt made the Cobra from the using raw forgings purchased from The Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), and the alloy was a special one formulated for Colt for use in the Cobra. The material was proprietary and named Coltalloy. This material was also used in the Colt lightweight Commander model.The Cobra was chambered in the following calibers: .38 Special, .38 N.P., .32 N.P., and .22 LR. I am going to focus on the .38 special model. The .38 Cobra came in blued and nickel. it has 2″, 3″ or 4″ barrels. The 2″ barrel model weighed 15 oz. until around 1972 when the weight went up to 16oz.The Cobra which was a spinoff from the Detective Special, had a few spinoffs of its own:The Colt Aircrewman made from 1951-1957 for use by Air Force Aircrews. It has gold USAF medallions instead of silver Colt medallions. it weighed 11 oz. They did not hold up well in service.The Colt Courier made from 1954-1956 in .22 Long Rifle and 32 Colt NP.The Colt Agent was a cheaper version of the Cobra made from 1962-1979. It weighed 14 ounces and was available only in .38 Special caliber, with a 2-inch barrel and blued finish.The Colt Viper was essentially made as a 4″ Colt Cobra in .38 Special. It was discontinued the same year.In the Shooting Times from March 1978 issue, writer Clair Rees included a side-box in a Colt Viper review that claimed just as the issue was going to press, Colt had announced on December 2, 1977 that it was discontinuing all of its D series revolvers (Detective Special, Viper, Diamondback, Agent, and Cobra). Colt stated that it intended to totally phase out the production of all D series revolvers by October 1978. Colt stated that it had made this cutback because it wanted to focus its resources on other lines. Thus ended the Colt D series revolver.From what I can pick up from various internet articles and other publications there were a few changes/modifications on the design, the below may not be 100% accurate:Early 1950s: Full length grip frame. Narrow front sight. Small rear sight notch. Shortened ejector rod.Mid 1950′ s : Larger front sight. Lengthened ejector rod. Larger profile rear sight1966 : Shortened grip frame.1972 Shrouded ejector rod.1973 Heavier barrel. Smaller low ramped front and rear sights .Here is serial number information for the Cobra and it’s spinoffs:Model Year Serial NumberCobra Introduced 1950 1LWAircrewman Introduced 1951 1500LW19527000LW195320200LWCourier Introduced 1954 26150LW195533900LWCourier Discontinued 1956 44600LW195756201LW195871450LWAircrewman Discontinued 1959 85000LW196094800LWREDACTEDLWAgent Introduced 1962 122500LWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLWREDACTEDLW-275115LW1969A600001970A84900 -A999991970B60000 -B617001971B61701-B835501972B83551-B999991972C61001-C689501970C68951-C999991974F60001-F999991974H60001-H660001975H66001-H999991975M60001-M849001976M52001-M599991976M84901-M99999197660001M-71400MViper Introduced 1977 71401M-99999MViper Discontinued 1977 60001R-71400R197863401RThere has been much talk about using +P in older revolvers especially the alloy ones such as the Colt Cobra.What Colt says about +P ammo, off of Grant Cunningham’s website:Post-1972 (shrouded ejector rod) models: The owner’s manual says that these guns are rated for +P ammunition. The manual calls for a factory (gunsmith) inspection every 1,000 rounds for the alloy models (Cobra and Agent), and every 3,000 rounds for the steel-framed guns (Detective Special, Police Positive Special, Diamondback.)Pre-1972 (unshrouded ejector rod) models: None of the Colt guns with unshrouded ejector rods are rated by Colt for +P use. These guns, made prior to 1972, were sold before the advent of +P ammunition.In my opinion, I shoot and practice with standard pressure 38 in my Cobra, but carry +P in it. I train with a few cylinders of the +P every once in a while. Why? Here is why I have that opinion on the matter:Before the adaptation of the .38 special +P standard in 1974 there was .38 Special High Speed.If you look at some old factory data compared to the new load data and new factory data, you can clearly see the .38 special load standards were higher than they are today. This data is straight out of books I own.Standard:1958 Federal 158 grain lead 855 fps1971 Federal 158 grain lead 855 fps2013 Federal American Eagle 158 LRN 770 fps2013 Remington 158 gr LRN 755 fps2013 Winchester 158 Gr LRN or LSWCHP 755 fpsReload data:2007 book 158 grain lead 708-844 fps start2007 book158 grain lead 781 to 967 fps maxHigh Speed / Modern +P1971 Federal 158 grain lead 1090 fps2013 Winchester 158 grain LSWCHP 890 fps2013 Remington 158 gr +P LSWCHP 890 fpsReload Data:2007 Book 158 gr lead 781-938 start2007 Book 158 grain lead 843-1037 fps maxIn comparison in 1972 the FBI introduced their +P standard 158ge LSWCHP load @ around 1000 fps. ( According to others: The Law Enforcement Handgun Digest of 1972 has a velocity chart on p. 188, which shows 1014 fps for this load (W38SPD) it has since been rated in modern times @ 890 fps)Most standard factory 158 grain lead offerings run around 740-790 fps while most standard available 38 special +P lead offerings run 900-950. With some manufacturers such as Buffalo Bore advertising +P at 1000-1250 fps.In 1956 The USAF Ball M41 130 grain round going 725 fps was designed to replace the old .38 Special 158 grain ball round going 850 fps that was causing the issues in the Colt Aircrewman and S&W M13 models. The problem was the M41 was scarce so airmen got a hold of whatever ammo they could find, some of it high speed. There were quite a few stretched frames and kabooms even after the adoption of the M41. The Air Force decided to scrap both the Colt Aircrewman and S&W M13. These were stripped down allow versions as well. The Aircrewman only weighed 11 oz as compared to the Cobra at 15 oz at the time.So as you can clearly see, that over the years the standard has been lowered a bit even though alloys and materials have advanced in strength and durability. Obviously there are more quality powders, more choices, and more recipes. That is why I feel comfortable shooting certain +P offerings lightly out of my Cobra. There has been no evidence of premature wear on it. I carry 135gr +P Speer Gold Dot for Short Barrel at 860 fps or 158gr +P LSWCHP at 890 fps.My Cobra was manufactured in 1970, it has carry wear and other wear from years of use, but it still runs like a Swiss clock and locks up like a bank vault. It weighs just around 18.5 oz. loaded with my carry ammo and offers 1 extra round than current j-frames or my LCR.For additional pictures, to purchase this item or to schedule am appointment to see it please go to: www.bugoutguns.com"

I'm looking for an original type or reproduction Monte Carlo, Right Handed Stock and Handguard for a 94 production year SKS Model M. This model did not come with the bayonet groove and the bayonet lug was an unfinished blank. The model M stock is different in that the mag well is enlarged because the rifle uses AK mags from the factory. I need both the wood stock and wood handguard and the mounting hardware/screws if any,
I have a synthetic Dragonov type stock on mine ( purchased that way ) I want to restore it to original as new condition. I'd be willing to sell or trade the Dragonov stock. Finish condition not super important as I will probably strip and refinish myself, I dont want one that's cracked or has huge chips or dents in it though. Would also like original cleaning kit etc... when done, it's most likely to be a wall hanger in my reloading room for people to eyeball... unless that SHTF day comes and then it's just a backup... there are better rifles with better range in the safe. :)"

This Mil-Dot Reticle can also be illuminated to either red or green with adjustable brightness settings for accurate targeting in any lighting situation. Fully Multicoated optics and a built-in Sniper Edge sunshade help reduce glare and increase light transmission, giving the SWAT-AR 1-4x28 Rifle Scope impressive viewing clarity. External windage/elevation turrets assist the user in quickly zeroing in the SWAT-AR, and can then be locked into place to prevent any unintentional movement. The 1-4x28 SWAT-AR Rifle Scope includes a 30mm cantilever ring mount, which makes the SWAT-AR ready for rail mounted use with any flat-top AR-style rifle.

Unfortunately, my deployment did not end in time and I missed deer season entirely. I decided just to use my old gear whenever I get the chance to go again. 

The rifle was special ordered and has been handled very little and comes new in the box. The rifle also comes 220 (11 boxes) of high quality Hornady 325 grain Lever Evolution ammo.

I paid 950.00 for the rifle and 350.00 for the ammo. I will entertain trades, but I am not interested in other hunting rifles. I will also entertain cash offers, but please do not low ball me.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

996,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4959996,"For Sale:  Colt Python, 1969, 6"" barrel, Extra set of Colt grips, blue","Northwest of town, Santa Fe, New Mexico","$ 2,300","Listed On: Monday, February 8, 2016",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"I bought this gun in 1969 and have been the only owner.  It is totally stock, having never been worked on or tinkered with.  I never so much as adjusted the sights.  It has seen very limited usage, maybe 1,000 rounds at most, I'd guess.  Some slight bluing marks at end of barrel and slight line around cylinder.

Serial number is 984XX.  There are web site you can access to verify that this gun was manufactured in 1969 as stated.  I've seen some Pythons made in the mid to late 70s that don't have as smooth an action as this gun, so I think Pythons from this era represent the best of the best.

Comes with box it came in,  the original stock grips and extra set of Colt manufactured grips, NOT after market.  These form fitting, polymer type grips have the Colt logo on them.

Price is less than current market.  You can pick up at my house or have the gun shipped to you by a licensed dealer.  You would pay all ACTUAL UPS, FedEx and dealer handling fees.  I think the local dealer here in Santa Fe charges about a $25 handling fee.
