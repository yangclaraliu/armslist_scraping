Utilizing the ubiquitous STANAG magazine used in the AR-15/M16, the 805’s action is housed in a one-piece aluminum upper receiver with a monolithic Picatinny rail. At the rear of the action is a multipurpose mounting point, fit from the factory with a single-point sling attachment. The addition of our accessory arm brace adapter coupled with the effective factory-equipped two-port brake makes the Bren impressively stable to shoot in pistol form. It shares the same low-profile sights as our Scorpion — an adjustable aperture rear and post front. The CZ 805 Bren PS1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ 805 Bren PS1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.THIS FIREARM MAY OR MAY NOT BE LEGAL FOR CIVILIAN PURCHASE IN CALIFORNIA, PLEASE ASK US FOR DETAILS."

I had to leave on a disability retirement after being injured on duty and had to turn in my issued weapon. To add insult to injury, I missed the chance to buy back the G22 I had carried daily since 1998!
It was sold to an LE dealer near here- Keisler's/Orion Arms back in the beginning of the 2013. From there it was sold to a dealer in South Carolina, who has since gone out of business and turned in his FFL so I hit a dead end tracking it. I had this same gun in my hand when I received my career-ending injury, so you can imagine the sentimental value it has for me.
If you have this Glock, or know where it it, pleas contact me!

Here are some detailed reviews of this gun http://ezine.m1911.org/showthread.php?140-Armscor-M200-Series-Revolver-Review and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfAeAn7PS3Y

This gun makes an ideal “spare” or “stash away” gun thanks to its price and  parkerized finish (traditionally used on military weapons), which is extremely tough, resistant to the mother nature, and requires no TLC.

Note this is NOT officially  rated for the higher pressure +P rounds, though enthusiasts who claim to have contacted Armscor say they were told it is acceptable to use +P on occasion, but frequent use will accelerate wear & tear. Since Armscor  is providing a lifetime warranty, one can conclude that is why +P  is not officially endorsed. I used no +P in this gun. In non +P ammo, for home protection and personal defense use, I recommend Hornady’s “Critical Defense” round.  That said, if the purpose of this gun is to spend its life in a quick access safe in a nightstand drawer, guarding against a home intruder,  load it with +P.

I got this new in March 2015, fired exactly 36 rounds and it shoots to point of aim, tested at 7 yards, single action (hammer pre-cocked), my target below, all in the 10 ring with 4 in the X ring.  Gets the job done well.  Note the tight side-to-side variance (the most important one)  is only about an inch as shown by the Silver Dollar,  and centered around the X …  that’s the performance you hope for in a fixed sight gun that you never know for sure about until you shoot it.  Note this was done without any kind of gun/hand rest, so it’s capable of even tighter shot grouping, especially in the up & down variance.  The single action trigger pull is quite crisp and nice. Double action is appropriately firm, but still smooth.  I’m only selling because I was attracted to its concept and value, but have since acquired other revolvers and I want to help pay for those.  It’s worth what I’m asking, as it’s cheaper than new, good as new, and offers proven point-of-aim = point-of-impact, which is something you never can know for sure on a fixed sight gun until you shoot it. Everything pictured is included … box, instruction manual, test fired case, literature. Exactly what you’d get if purchased new, plus you’re saving sales tax and/or shipping and FFL fees if you ordered from an online retailer. Freshly cleaned and oiled, ready to go.

BONUS … I added the Hogue one-piece overmolded pebble finish grip to this, which cost $25. This grip is outstanding and really makes for a comfortable, cushioned feel that fits like a glove, as well as absorbs recoil.  I’m throwing in no charge, and will provide the original two-piece grip panels as well, but you’ll never want to put those back on after feeling the Hogue. I also painted the front sight bright orange and then clear nail polish and it stands out well in sun and low light. Easily removed if desired, but recommend keeping it versus the stock black-on-black sight picture.

Note … Must be a MO resident, provide Driver’s License or equivalent ID as proof and complete a bill of sale.  By purchasing this firearm you are confirming you are able to legally purchase and possess a firearm.  You are not purchasing this firearm for someone that is not legally able to do so (a.k.a ""straw man"" purchase).

$20 discount for showing your  CCW license, that would make this an outstanding value for any CCW’er … an enhanced gun thanks to the Hogue grip, good as new, proven to shoot to point-of-aim, with a lifetime warranty.

Mark V model with programmable dwell times. Perfect condition, perfect working order appears barely used. Drained hydraulic fluid to move it and fluid looked brand new. I bought the press at auction, the previous owner was an eccentric millionaire who was sort of ADD with his hobbies. It appears that he swaged jacketed 45 and 223 (224) bullets. 

For more info on the Press: http://www.corbins.com/prchp-1.htm

Press comes with several hydraulic rated Corbin Dies and some custom dies. Also has quite a bit of copper 45 jackets and 224 brass jackets formed from 22 cal brass. Also a fair bit of lead rods in various diameters ready to be cut and swaged into jackets. I am a reloading novice, I don't have the expertise or time to identify it all, consider the aforementioned extras a bonus in addition to the press.

Due to the weight of the press and extras I would strongly prefer pickup at the current location. However, for a serious buyer I would be willing to consider palletizing it and shipping at buyers expense. LTL is likely to run $500. I use this as a ballpark, buyer responsible for getting their own quote. 

Current list price on the Corbin Website is $8,950 plus shipping plus two months wait time. Asking $5,500 OBO including the extras. I am willing to consider trading for high end 50 BMG or 338 Lapua. Or partial trade on a RZR. 

I have a large list of other reloading items that would likely be of interest to the prospective buyer:
1. ~3,000 pounds of high grade 99%+ pure lead billets and pigs.
2. Over 1,500 pounds of brass, a mix of 9mm, 40 and 45. The 45 brass is 95% large primer, most of the brass has been rough tumbled.

I'd love to make a package deal on it all. Serious inquiries only. I am not interested in trading for junk. More pictures available upon request.

This thing is essentially brand spanking new in the box with everything that comes with it from the factory. 2 mags, all the different sized back straps, a lock, a safety (came with a decocker installed that you can swap for a manual safety, pretty sweet feature) and (shockingly) a damn nice rail-mounted light that even has a strobe feature. Yeah, they just threw that in from the factory, pretty cool I know. 

Anyway, this is the second generation P-09 where they re-did a couple things. Primarily I guess they messed with the feed ramp and the magazine followers a bit because the first generation had some feed issues. My limited experience with this pistol has been flawless, and the ergonomics are really top of the range for the budget-tier polymer framed pistols...also the stipling is super nice and they put it in all the rice places. This thing is seriously good to go as a nightstand or glove box pistol. I've had more than a few CZs down the years, and they're as reliable as any Glock or Sig or you-name-it that I've ever owned, just really high quality and high value pistols. If I weren't obsessed with purging redundancy from my collection, I'd just keep the thing.

It stayed in storage until Christmas Day 2013 (that was the first and only time it was shot)
I put 250 rounds down the pipe; 50 of which were FN SS197SR the remaining 200 were American Eagle.
I zero'ed the iron sights at 50yds, and the Optic at 100yds. It was ringing steel at 200yds. Cracked a IIIA ballsitic plate in 5 shots (SS197SR did that).
That day was in Dublin, NH - it was snowing and, around 15 degrees. The cold had no adverse effect.
It was cleaned and put back into storage.
I haven't laid fingers on it since Dec 2014

It has the Gen 2 trigger pack; gray housing with black hammer and auto sear.
The trigger is ugly as hell, and it is big but it is smooth. Recoil is a non-issue. T
he ergonomics are pretty good once you get a feel for it; it is fully ambi-dexterous, the charging handle is on both sides, and the 5.7 brass deposits out of the bottom of the rifle.
The top rail was added at the factory, it is very sturdy; I mounted a Sun Optics tube style RDS on it - can't remember the model of the top of my head - it held the zero just fine and did good in the cold

Asking price is $1700. $1900 trade value.

The Kahr CW380 is a true pocket gun size.

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.  The pistol comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, nnovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol."

The barrel's 20"" Length is great to keep a rifle reasonably maneuverable and lightweight while also producing good velocities in order to benefit from the 243 Winchester's long range ballistic performance. Whether building a new rifle from scratch, or simply to change calibers in an existing gun, this SST Barrel is an equally excellent selection for the hunter, competitor or recreational shooter with a need for accuracy at extended ranges. It is constructed of 416 Stainless Steel that's finished with an attractive Black Teflon coating for corrosion protection, and is compatible with any LR-308 based upper receiver. 
NOTE: This is the same barrel used in DPMS LR-243 factory rifles, meaning it will fit other DPMS LR receivers including the LR-260, LR-6.5 Creedmoor, LR-308 and LR-338. Barrel is not compatible with any AR-15 based receiver.

Whether building a new rifle from scratch, or simply to change calibers in an existing gun, this SST Barrel is an equally excellent selection for the hunter, competitor or recreational shooter with a need for accuracy at extended ranges. It is constructed of 416 Stainless Steel that's finished with an attractive Black Teflon coating for corrosion protection, and is compatible with any LR-308 based upper receiver. 
NOTE: This is the same barrel used in DPMS LR-243 factory rifles, meaning it will fit other DPMS LR receivers including the LR-260, LR-6.5 Creedmoor, LR-308 and LR-338. Barrel is not compatible with any AR-15 based receiver.

It was a mix of brass and steel cased ammo and I had no issues with either type.  The lower is from Anderson Mfg. with a CMMG parts kit.  It has a six position adjustable BCM Gunfighter stock on it.  The upper is made by Radical Firearms, with a 16"" melonite treated 4150V Chrome Moly barrel with a 1:7 twist.  The rifle has a low profile gas block on a mid-length gas system, and has a 12"" Seekins Precision free floating keymod handguard.  The bolt carrier group is an M16 profile and has a Nickel Boron finish, making it incredibly easy to clean.  I also have a set of Gen 2 Magpul MBUS sights and a Bushnell TRS-32 red dot on the rifle.

The ONLY trades I will consider at this time are:

- Glock 30S or 30SF w/extremely low round count (must have night sights)

All trades must come with appropriate cash differential based on the age, condition, and round count of what you have.


**UPDATE** I have received many lowball offers and butthurt dudes trying to haggle. 1) If it's not on the trade list chances are I will not be interested. 2) If you want to throw an internet deal price at me please factor in sales tax, shipping, FFL transfer fees, AND the price of the 4 extra mags (sales tax and shipping included) before questioning my asking price. 

Quality comes at a price - If you don't want to pay that price go get yourself and High Point and throw a threaded barrel in it."
