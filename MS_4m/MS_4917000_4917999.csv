SILENCER DETAILS:
The Ti-Rant is the next chapter in ultra-high-performance 9mm handgun sound and flash suppression. Careful material selection has made it possible to design a 9mm silencer that delivers class defining performance in a light-weight package that does not have an adverse effect on the balance and handling traits of the host pistol. The Ti-Rant is designed around a new generation of A.S.A.P. System (Assured Semi Automatic Performance). The fully integrated A.S.A.P. System facilitates flawless semi-automatic operation on all popular 9mm sidearms and can be quickly and easily disassembled for service by the end-user without the use of tools.

Constructed of Grade 9 Titanium, heat treated 17-4 PH stainless steel, and high strength hard coat anodized 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, the Ti-RANT re-writes the book on 9mm silencer efficiency and long-term durability.

PISTON(S) DETAILS:
A single Evolution 9 or Ti-RANT 9 silencer can be used on a variety of host firearms with different barrel threads by quickly and easily swapping out the threaded A.S.A.P. piston in the rear of the silencer. We manufacture A.S.A.P. pistons to match the barrel threads of all popular factory threaded pistol barrels and many aftermarket barrels. All Evolution/Ti-Rant Series Pistons feature heat treated stainless steel construction, a matte bead blasted finish, and engraving to identify the thread diameter, pitch, and direction of rotation for installation (Left Hand threads or Right Hand threads)."

This rifle was built and professionally converted from a brand new unfired USC by Dave Akins (AviatorDave from HKPRO forums). The UMP parts are from HKparts & HDPS and were used by Dave for the conversion and comply 100% with BATFE regulations, regarding imported parts count in an Imported Assault Rifle 18-U.S.C. section 922(r). I put the rifle on a Form 1 and added the correct 7.87 inch HDPS barrel. The EOTech 552 optic and 4x 25rd magazines marked ""Restricted Law Enforcement/ Government Use Only"" are included. This rifle is in excellent condition and the conversion was done right; the pictures don't do it justice. I've only put about 150 rds through it.  This rifle is currently on a Form 1 in TN and just requires a Form 4 transfer direct from me to you if you are a TN resident.  Historically Form 4 transfers are taking about 4-5 months.  This is a great piece for your collection. I am only selling so that I may welcome another piece into my collection soon. I don't NEED to sell but I am basically selling the rifle at cost (minus my fees to the ATF), so the price is firm.  USC rifle ($1550); conversion ($1500); HDPS 7.87 inch barrel ($280); 4x 25rd magazines ($300 [$75 each]); EOTech 552 optic ($400).  I am an individual, not a company.

SILENCER DETAILS:
The Ti-RANT .45 is the world’s first silencer for .45 ACP pistols that is truly stealthy when fired dry. The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. 

The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded M16 x 1 Right Hand, M16 x 1 Left Hand, and two pistons threaded .578-28; one extended for the Sig P-220 and 1911’s with a full length guide rod, and a flush mount for 1911’s with a standard G.I. guide rod. For multi-caliber use, pistons are available in the most common 9mm and .40 thread patterns to allow use of the Ti-RANT 45 on hosts in those calibers.

PISTON(S) DETAILS:
A single Ti-RANT 45™ series silencer can be used on a variety of host firearms with different barrel threads by quickly and easily swapping out the threaded A.S.A.P. piston in the rear of the silencer. We manufacture A.S.A.P. pistons to match the barrel threads of all popular factory threaded pistol barrels and many aftermarket barrels. All Ti-RANT™ series pistons feature heat treated stainless steel construction, a matte bead blasted finish, and engraving to identify the thread diameter, pitch, and direction of rotation for installation (Right or Left Hand threads). There is a ""SHORT"" model piston, designed only for use on 1911 pistols WITHOUT a full-length guide rod and on the FN FNP Tactical 45. 

*Conversion pistons available* Get a Ti-RANT 45 piston threaded in 1/2-28, 1/2-36, or 13.5x1LH to use the Ti-RANT 45 on your 9mm host, or a 9/16x24 threaded piston for use on common .40 cal host pistols."

SILENCER DETAILS:
The Mini4™ (5.56) is an ultra-compact silencer for CQC rifles and carbines. Don't let the size fool you; the Mini4™ is packed with hard-use technology. It has a fully-welded Inconel® 718 baffle core and uses the best-selling 51T Ratchet Mount™ fast-attach system that enables users to install or remove the silencer in seconds. Includes 51T 1/2x28 Blackout® Flash Hider Mount. Although it is designed to present a compact profile, the Mini4™ significantly reduces the sound and flash signatures of its intended host firearms; below the 140 decibel threshold at the shooter's ear on 14.5"" and longer barrels. Recommended for use with barrels longer than 14.5"" for best results.

MUZZLE DEVICE DETAILS:
The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 is a silencer mounting muzzle device that is both a flash suppressor and muzzle brake in one. Redesigned for 2014, the BRAKEOUT® 2.0 offers the best of both worlds in a truly compromise-free design. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 offers outstanding recoil reduction tested to be fully equal to the best conventional muzzle brakes, along with excellent flash reduction performance. The new symmetrical design of the BRAKEOUT® 2.0 does not need to be timed with shims like a conventional muzzle brake, simplifying installation. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 will initially be offered as 51T variants with 1/2-28 and 5/8-24 threads. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 is fully compatible with the AAC BLACKOUT™ flash hider installation tool. 

*NOT FOR USE ON SCAR 17 OR RUGER GUNSITE SCOUT

INSTALLATION TOOL DETAILS: 
The BLACKOUT™ Flash Hider Installation Tool from Advanced Armament Corp. enables armorers to quickly and easily install and remove a three-prong BLACKOUT™ flash hider. The tool uses a 3/8 drive."

It’s not the Pavona or the Compact.

It’s full size, but it has a thin grip.  Even people that don’t have huge hand can comfortably grip and shoot this gun.  Even with the smallish grip, it still holds 16 + 1.

The P is for polymer and the S is for either great ergonomic small frame or standard frame, which is smaller than the huge grips that many folks have a hard time shooting.

The slide riding inside the frame, like a CZ 75, cuts down on recoil and makes it easier to shoot and control.

Black slide, but the frame is pretty neat dark blue color.  The Blue is very difficult to find.

24 oz with no magazine and 32 oz with a fully loaded magazine and one in the pipe

Tanfoglio makes it in Italy, but EAA imports it.

Can be converted to a .22lr or 40 cal.

SILENCER DETAILS:
The AAC® 7.62-SDN-6™ is a compact fast-attach sound and flash suppressor for 7.62x51mm and 300 AAC BLACKOUT® (7.62x35mm) weapons. 1.25” shorter than the 762-SD™, it features a 360-degree fully welded Inconel® baffle stack and front end cap to maximize durability on select fire 7.62mm SBRs. The 762-SDN-6™ also functions as a superb multi-caliber suppressor for multiple hosts, providing excellent performance on 7.62 NATO, 300 AAC®, 6.8 SPC, 6.5, and 5.56mm NATO. When employed on a 300 AAC BLACKOUT®, the overall SPL of 126 dB with subsonic ammo is quieter than the 9mm HK MP5-SD.

MUZZLE DEVICE DETAILS:
The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 is a silencer mounting muzzle device that is both a flash suppressor and muzzle brake in one. Redesigned for 2014, the BRAKEOUT® 2.0 offers the best of both worlds in a truly compromise-free design. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 offers outstanding recoil reduction tested to be fully equal to the best conventional muzzle brakes, along with excellent flash reduction performance. The new symmetrical design of the BRAKEOUT® 2.0 does not need to be timed with shims like a conventional muzzle brake, simplifying installation. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 will initially be offered as 51T variants with 1/2-28 and 5/8-24 threads. The BRAKEOUT® 2.0 is fully compatible with the AAC BLACKOUT™ flash hider installation tool. 

*NOT FOR USE ON SCAR 17 OR RUGER GUNSITE SCOUT

INSTALLATION TOOL DETAILS: 
The BLACKOUT™ Flash Hider Installation Tool from Advanced Armament Corp. enables armorers to quickly and easily install and remove a three-prong BLACKOUT™ flash hider. The tool uses a 3/8 drive."

It’s not the Pavona or the Compact.

It’s full size, but it has a thin grip.  Even people that don’t have huge hand can comfortably grip and shoot this gun.  Even with the smallish grip, it still holds 16 + 1.

The P is for polymer and the S is for either great ergonomic small frame or standard frame, which is smaller than the huge grips that many folks have a hard time shooting.

The slide riding inside the frame, like a CZ 75, cuts down on recoil and makes it easier to shoot and control.

Black slide, but the frame is pretty neat dark blue color.  The Blue is very difficult to find.

24 oz with no magazine and 32 oz with a fully loaded magazine and one in the pipe

Tanfoglio makes it in Italy, but EAA imports it.

Can be converted to a .22lr or 40 cal.

I am like some of you on here who buys, sells and trades guns on Armslist. I have had an account since 2012. I have bought, sold and traded over 100 firearms in that time span until now. 
When I first started, I would price my guns $40-$50 lower than the average national on every other similar Armslist listing. And people who saw what I had for sell back then knew that I was giving a deal. They would call, buy it for what I asked and on their merry way. 

Well, here in the last 6 months, we have had an influx of cheap stupidity coming mostly from under 25 year olds, but I also have seen it from the older crowd. Recently made a deal on a S&W .38 revolver I had for sell. I had it for $300. They go for $365. Guy in his 50's in a blue Subaru said he had $280. I met up with him and he pulled out $265. This is after he threw the gun in his passenger seat from his driver's door. It's just been slipping on here as far as good, decent people.

 It is really despicable(I just spit when I said that like Sylvester the Cat) to have a great price up there and some BillyBob from Brent tell you ""he'll go"" X amount of dollars--- that is like $150 cheaper than your price. And then want you to drive halfway to meet them. Hahaha. Nope. Sorry you disrespectful degenerate. You're not going to insult anyone else with your Craigslist, flea market mentality. 

This is a reputable firearms site. It is not Craigslist. Because Craigslist restricts the selling or trading of firearms, I guess those creeps come here. If you see a good deal that you know is a good deal, don't be ""that guy"" who tries to see just how free you can get something. You are not Monty Hall. This is not Neverland. 

*If you email me and your name pops up, I Google that name before I meet you to sell a gun. If your Facebook page shows you standing in Walmart with gold teeth throwing gang signs with your pants sagging, then I just put you in the ""you're an idiot I will not meet"" category.

*If you tell me that you can buy a brand new one for that price, THEN GO BUY IT! I don't care what the Taurus rebate is or if your uncle knows a guy at Colt. I really don't care. If you can go do that, then why are you telling me about it? I only care if you are giving me the money I want. That's the only time I care. 

*Oh, and stop telling me, "" I'll give you $---- CASH!"" Do you think I'm taking a personal check? Or swiping your card when we meet up? Of course it's cash. That's the only option available here you dummy. Stop thinking that is an advantage or incentive to take your low ball offer. Duhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

OK, this concludes this PSA. Have a nice day and please stop being cheap. There's haggling and then there is just being a jerk. It is a thin line. It is disrespectful and insulting when crossed."

Description:
Serial #8355, 9mm Para., 4” barrel with a fine, bright bore that has very faint traces of freckling within the grooves. This is a 1919 dated pistol that has all matching numbers (except for the unnumbered grips) and the metal retaining 80-85% of the original blue finish that has silvered along the exposed edges and surfaces. Additionally, there is some pinprick pitting at the muzzle (which exhibits some cleaning as well) and on the left sides of the take-down lever, trigger, and safety lever. The trigger and take-down lever have lots of original straw color remaining on the right side, as do the magazine release and ejector. The checkered wooden grips are in very good shape with light flattening of the points on either side as well as some slightly heavier wear at the butt. The pistol comes with a single matching numbered wood base magazine and is a very good-fine example of a World War I Luger overall. must sign firearms bill of sale thanks"

Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES 
•  100% new-production parts and components. 
•  Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
•  Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
•  Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
•  Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.

It is the Special edition Two-tone that has Diamond Plating.


Included with it is the: Carrying Case, Holster, Extra Clip, Clip Holster, Speed Loader and Case Lock. All came together in the package I bought.


The gun is in Used but Great Condition. I bought this gun new at the end of 2013 and it has only fired 150 rounds in its lifetime. I purchased it with the intention of having it as a home defense firearm. That same day I fired 100 rounds to ensure it worked as expected and didn't jam (it shot beautifully). The other 50 rounds were fired this past July. I took it out to the range to make sure everything was still good. Though it still fired great, my wife took some shots with it (for the first time) and mentioned how it had a little too much kick for her to feel good control with it. Of course, I want her to feel comfortable with whatever firearm we have in the house so I decided to switch to a 9mm. Hense the sale of my beloved P250 =[ 





Below is the description (pulled from the Sig Sauer website). If you have any questions at all, please feel free to let me know. Also, I don't mind personally deliving it to the Orlando area. However, anything more than 50 miles out and we will have to agree on either a shipping charge or meeting halfway.


Finally, I would consider trading it for a compact 9mm (preferably with a thumb safety). Especially if it is new.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The wide scabbard also allows it to serve as an excellent laptop or military radio compartment, and because it's also wide at the bottom, users have the option of carrying weapons butt-down or butt-up. The pack features both front loading and top loading features, giving exceptional versatility and flexibility of use. The G2 comes standard with the Intex-II frame system. The Intex-II is an Eberlestock innovation; it out-performs both traditional external frames and internal frames, and has the best qualities of both: the structure of an external frame without the noise and with minimal weight, and the close-ride and comfort of an internal frame pack. The G2 is a great platform to make the ultimate ""go bag."" It is relatively compact, yet capable of internally storing a sniper rifle or an M-16/M-4/AR type weapon, water, ammo, and survival gear. Once in the field, the pack has good capacity, but has the added benefit of being really easy to lash additional gear to, simply by cranking on an external load with its built-in compression straps. The top pocket assembly features a handy internal organizer, with several small pockets, pen holders, and a padded pocket which serves equally well for AR mags or for a PDA.""On Amazon, the Coyote Brown version is going for $330. This bag is very lightly used, shows no wear, and is in like new condition. Included for free is the Eberlestock Saddle Bag, which is $28 on Amazon. I am willing to ship, it'll just cost a little extra. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for looking!"

EOTech XPS2-300 .300 Blackout Whisper Ball CR123 HWS Holographic Weapon Sight Description:

Eotech Transverse Red Dot Sight, 65 MOA Circle w/ Two 1-MOA Dots Reticle, Black

Eotech Transverse XPS 2 Red Dot Sight is the non-Night Vision-compatible version of the Eotech Transverse XPS 3. This sight is even smaller than the popular EOTech 550 HoloSight. The EOTech Transverse XPS Two runs on a single 123 battery, with a longer battery life than previous HOLO sight models. The EOTech XPS2 is smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the single battery configuration, the EOTech Xps-2 allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.

Specifications:

- Return to Zero: repeatable up to 2mOa after re-mounting
- Power Source: (1) 123 lithium battery
- Battery Life: approx. 600 hours

- Color/Finish: non reflective black with hard coat finish
- Mount: 1""Weaver or (mIl-stD- 1913) rail

Features:

- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length.
- Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 of rail space compared to the 4"" N battery sights.
- Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap. Better sealing is achieved.
- Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over delta ring of rife.
- Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, tripling the battery life of the N sights.
- 0- 65MOA ring with 1 MOA aiming dot., 1- Single 1MOA aiming dot, 2- 65MOA ring with (2) 1 MOA aiming dots.
