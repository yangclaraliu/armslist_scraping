43,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4376043,For Sale:  (NEW) Thunder Beast Model 30CB9 Suppressor,"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,077","Listed On: Sunday, May 29, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"CALL TO VERIFY IN STOCK STATUS BEFORE DRIVING TO STORE OR BUYING ONLINE>(NEW) Thunder Beast Model 30CB9 SuppressorThunder Beast MODEL 30CB9 SUPPRESSORThe model 30CB9 is the new ""Compact Brake""-attach version of our flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. This model replaces the 30BA. It shares the same competition-proven baffle stack as the 30BA and 30P-1 (with a few new optimizations), but we've designed a new brake that is smaller and more efficient than the old one.When used alone, the new ""CB"" brake is approx 30-40% more effective at recoil reduction than the old 30BA brake. The new brake is proportioned correctly for .223 and .30 caliber rifles, but it provides a suppressor mounting surface just as solid as the old 30BA series.The way to interpret the model number for the 30CB9 is: .30 caliber, COMPACT BRAKE, 9-inch long (full size)The 30CBx series replaces the 30BA/BAS series as of May 2014. We will continue to sell 30BA series brakes and suppressors to existing ""BA""-series customers if requested.The 30CB9 offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30CB9 is designed to mount over our new compact muzzle brake. It is particularly suited to applications where the rifle will be shot suppressed and unsuppressed, and a brake is desired when shooting without the suppressor.The ""CB"" series suppressors was designed to mount over our new compact brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30CB9 features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 30CB9 was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.The 30CB9 uses the baffle stack of the 30P-1, which has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The 30CB9 is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The 30CB9 is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.

For those not familiar with one, it is basically a single shot 44 magnum attachment, called a powerhead, mounted on an aluminum pole. It is fired when the powerhead is activated by removing the safety pin and then forcibly jabbed into target. This is predominantly used for alligator hunting or to ""ride shotgun"" for divers and spearfishermen as safety against aggressive sharks. Although this will fire a typical 44 magnum cartridge, blanks are used for safety. The blank kills because of the sudden gas compression. These fall outside FFL requirements and are not considered firearms. This was purchased brand new two years ago but has not been used."

The 338BA effectively suppresses the extreme muzzle blast of the .338 magnums down to levels similar to suppressed .308. The 338BA brake is left attached to the rifle at all times, and reduces recoil when the suppressor is not used. When the 338BA suppressor is mounted to the brake, the rifle's ""suppressed zero"" returns and the mount design ensures accuracy.We developed the 30BA and 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 338BA, like the 338P-1, has additional volume to handle the gas pressure of the .338 Lapua Magnum, but only weighs fractionally more than a .308 suppressor.The 338BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and method of construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. Our suppressors are designed from the ground up for superior accuracy. The 338BA can take whatever your big-bore precision rifle can dish out while keeping all your rounds on target.The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake. Special FeaturesBrake-in-suppressor designConical shoulder surfaceHelical Baffle Technology100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreRock-Solid POI RepeatabilityExtreme suppression levels for .338 cartridgesCustomers who desire a ""direct thread"" version of the 338BA can order one with a brake fixed in place.Application NotesThis suppressor was designed around the .338 Lapua Magnum in long-range applications. Minimum recommended barrel length is 20"" for the 338BA. For .338 caliber cartridges, it is not recommended to exceed 100 grains of powder. For .30 caliber cartridges, it is not recommended to exceed 90 grains of powder. For 7mm cartridges, not to exceed 80 grains. The 338BA is not rated for the .30-378. For questions about a particular rifle/load combination please contact us.Barrett MRAD NotesBarrett .338 MRAD and 98 Bravo rifles produced prior to 1/2013 must use the 338BA suppressor with special MRAD brake. 98B and MRAD rifles manufactured after this date are 3/4-24 and use the regular 3/4-24 338BA brake.

These are far better carry guns than the G2s. 
Why?
For most people, your trigger finger can fit BEHIND the trigger (which is important if someone tries to grab it from you). 
Also the DA style trigger allows you to pull the trigger again without cocking if the round fails to fire. 

Comes a 12rnd magazine, Heine sights and Ill fill the magazine with some defensive ammo too

Boringly reliable. Ive not had an issue with this gun after about 6 boxes of various ammo.

The 338BA effectively suppresses the extreme muzzle blast of the .338 magnums down to levels similar to suppressed .308. The 338BA brake is left attached to the rifle at all times, and reduces recoil when the suppressor is not used. When the 338BA suppressor is mounted to the brake, the rifle's ""suppressed zero"" returns and the mount design ensures accuracy.We developed the 30BA and 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 338BA, like the 338P-1, has additional volume to handle the gas pressure of the .338 Lapua Magnum, but only weighs fractionally more than a .308 suppressor.The 338BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and method of construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. Our suppressors are designed from the ground up for superior accuracy. The 338BA can take whatever your big-bore precision rifle can dish out while keeping all your rounds on target.The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake.Special FeaturesBrake-in-suppressor designConical shoulder surfaceHelical Baffle Technology100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreRock-Solid POI RepeatabilityExtreme suppression levels for .338 cartridgesSpecificationsCaliber: .338 caliber, up to .338 Lapua Magnum or .338 RUMMaterial:TitaniumLength: 10.4 inches.Diameter: 1.8 inches.Weight: 25.1 ouncesBrake Threads: 5/8-24, 3/4-20, 3/4-24, 3/4-28, M18x1.0, M18x1.5Finish: Black CeraKote; OD Green and FDE availableUse: Precision/Long-range on big-bore magnumsMSRP: $1795 (one brake included).Extra brakes $145/ea(not included - sold separately)"

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full-size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?
The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.
The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.
The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.
Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION• LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Serial #227xx, This gun absolutely pristine. Shoots exactly to the point of aim and even have ammo and dies to go with. What makes this gun so rare is the characteristics of a 99B vs. other model 99's is full Octagonal barrel 26"" long. Straight grip with a ""Perch Belly"" Steel rifle butt that is curved, schnoble tip knife edge dovetail. As you can tell in the pictures this gun is beautiful. This gun has never been drilled and tapped.. 

Model 99b's are rare and in this condition its even more rare. Model 99's used a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. It also has a counter to indicate how many shots are left. This guns counter works perfect and functions flawless.

The rotating magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. Another safety feature was that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. This design was ahead of its time. This is a very early model 99. 

This is a great deer rifle or collector piece in its current refurbished condition. This gun will not disappoint. Email or text if interested 918-four02-0854. FTF in tulsa area only."

A little history:

I believe these to be very similar to a Colt Trooper Mark V.  In the 80's some of Colt's workers went on strike which lead to them not polishing these models, thus the mat black finish. They were only made for a few years. (from 1985 to 1987)

Ti-RANT .45 AUTO Advanced Armament Corp. Ti-RANT .45 AUTO The Ti-RANT .45 is the world’s first silencer for .45 ACP pistols that is truly stealthy when fired dry. The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded M16 x 1 Right Hand, M16 x 1 Left Hand, and two pistons threaded .578-28; one extended for the Sig P-220 and 1911’s with a full length guide rod, and a flush mount for 1911’s with a standard G.I. guide rod. For multi-caliber use, pistons are available in the most common 9mm and .40 thread patterns to allow use of the Ti-RANT 45 on hosts in those calibers.Weight:11.5 ozLength:8.74""Diameter:1.38""Finish:Cerakote™Sound Reduction:(Dry/Wet):  -30dB/-41dBMount:ThreadsMaterials:Grade 9 Ti, 17-4PH, 7075-T6"

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. —the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

The SpecterDR™ dual fields-of-view (DFOV) sight provides both close quarter and precision fire ranged capability in a single package.

Whether utilizing the red dot in 1x magnification or the ranging reticle in 4x mode, the SpecterDR™ DFOV sight provides ultral-wide viewing angles for optimal situational awareness and unmatched low-light performance. The SpecterDR™ DFOV sight allows the user to safely and effectively transition in and out of building for close quarter or extended range without changing sights. The 1x FOV provides a generous viewing angle (24° in the 1-4x) and an extremely fast, ""both eyes open"" target acquisition capability. The second FOV provides 4x magnified sight (FOV 6°), a range compensating reticle, long-range target identification and precision marksmanship capability. The two unique fields-of-view are easily and quickly interchanged by means of the patent-pending, locking lever mechanism on the side of the optical housing.

Selected by USSOCOM for elite SpecOps mission, the SpecterDR™ dual role rifle sigh by ELCAN is reliable, amazingly bright and deadly accurate.

Whether the mission calls for clearing a building or open-terrain patrol, SpecterDR™ gives you both fast acquisition and long-range target identification.

The unique locking lever mechanism brings you accurately back on target every time. The remarkably bright, clear ELCAN optics extend your daylight operations. Why risk yourself and the mission with red dot or fixed telescopic sights that do only half the job? Carry the one and only combat sight that switches between CQB and precision ranged fire mode - in the blink of an eye.

Like all the Benellis, a person needs to fire several rounds of high powered ammunition before he or she expects this inertia semi auto to cycle light load shells. The TriStar Raptor A-TAC, writes the factory, was made with function and affordability in mind. This 3 inch, gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun boasts a bridge-front sight with fiber optic bead, picatinny rail mounted on top of the receiver with a ghost ring sight installed, fixed pistol grip stock, swivel studs, and a tactical style operating handle. The Raptor A-TAC comes with an Extended Tactical Beretta®/Benelli®/ Style Choke. Manufacturer and warrantor is Kral of Konya, Turkey. Importer is Tri Star of Kansas City, MO. Type is inertia semi-automatic shotgun. The Raptor is every bit as slick, or even slicker finished than their rivals, Turkish made on Italian machinery, and their smoothness, fit and finish outrank even the standard production Mossbergs. The only deficiency we notice on their finish is some roughness to the lettering on the barrels. Construction is steel barrel, magazine tube, bolt assembly and internal parts with a strong light weight alloy receiver and sight hardware. Trigger guard assembly is high impact polymer. Caliber is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch interchangeably. Magazine capacity is 5 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch, or 4 + 1 on 3 inch shells. Barrel length is 20 inch Chrome Lined bore, with Benelli threaded muzzle. Extension ported .722 Cylinder Tube and .720 flush fit stainless cylinder bore chokes are included. Weight empty is a light but well balanced 6.6 pounds, with center of gravity beneath the extractor. Overall length is 40 1/2 inches. Forend is serrated injection molded black polymer; buttstock body is identical, but with rubberized pistol grip and 3/4 inch recoil pad. Length of pull measures 14 5/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the buttpad. Blue steel swivel studs are included as the photos show. Finish is a very smooth, weather-resistant matte blue. We're offering these slick Turkish made Tri Star Raptor semi-automatic shotguns, the one in the photos or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 289.00.

Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each. I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience.

Bordering the Okefenokee Swamp to the west.This is awesome hunting land. It has virgin pine, planted short pine, hardwood, swamps. Power line runs (east-west)through entire bottom half of property. Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
I am limiting to 10 members.  10 members will be $1000 each. I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."
