This optic has been on my AR since I purchased it and typically in a safe. It's a great close/midrange optic that allows quick site acquisition. If you do any research you'll see that this is a battle tested and reliable optic. The reticle appears small in the picture but it is actually bigger. There is a small scratch on the optic housing from a previous owner that doesn't effect the performance at all.

Retail price for this optic is $500. Included is a CR123 battery (used less than 2 hours) and the box it came in. I'm willing to meet in a public place in Yukon or NW OKC. Feel free to email with any questions and I'll respond quickly.

I would never have sold it otherwise.

This gun is almost brand new. I bought it in brand new “never-been-fired” condition and I have only shot about 300 rounds through it. I have also cleaned and oiled it since I last took it to the range.
This is one of the most accurate pistols you can buy and the MKII 5-1/2 inch bull barrel version is highly sought after, especially in this kind of condition. The Mk III versions have some significant changes so this mark II is the model that everyone is after. The bull barrel and nice adjustable sights give this thing “tack driving” accuracy.
It comes with the original case, manual and lock and has two magazines. I have included 800 rounds of .22LR ammo which is probably over $100 worth and some snap caps.



Please, no trades or offers & cash only.  It is priced to sell, especially considering the ammo, so I am not interested in offers so please don’t ask.
Buyer must have current concealed handgun permit and photo ID that I can photo as a record of who I sold it to.

This rifle features a Stainless Steel 23 inch barrel, Black Synthetic stock with Dura Touch Armor coating, Stainless Steel Sling swivel studs, Angles bolt knob, 3 round drop magazine, Drilled and tapped receiver, and a black cushioned recoil pad. This rifle I find to be extremely comfortable on the hands, and in my opinion is an excellent choice for deer hunters that are hunting rain or shine. The stock feels cushioned to the touch and is very easy to grip, while maintaining a waterproof coating. The Barrel is a comfortable length, giving this rifle excellent balance and the Stainless finish has a slight Matte look to it, which will reduce glare from the Sun. The bolt is also just like all Browning's, amazing and responsive to the feel. The angled knob is actually very natural for cycling rounds out. Overall, I would recommend this rifle to shooters that are looking for an all weather gun, with a lot of power for big game hunting, and a very high quality finish and action.

I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me. I took this bow to Hoffman Archery and they outfitted it with the accys shown. I shot a total of 15 arrows through it at the shop and that is all the bow has seen. It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Mathews Solocam 2 piece quiver
QAD drop away rest
Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling
Tru Glow 4 pin sight

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

*OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION* 

AR500 Armor® 10” x 12” Curved III Body Armor

AR500 Armor® Level III Body Armor is manufactured from an extremely rugged ballistic grade steel core and coated with our PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating. Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then tested to NIJ standards. Our ballistic plate core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile of only .25”, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 Armor® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.

Level III Rating: AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second and all pistol calibers.

Our 10” x 12” Advanced Shooters Cut (ASC) armor plates fit nearly all industry standard plate carriers and all plate carriers capable of accepting Medium and Large SAPI body armor plates. Our 10” x 12” ASC body armor offers adequate coverage of your vitals which include your heart, lungs, and surrounding blood vessels on most people. 10” x 12” is the most common size and fits the widest selection of plate carriers available on the market.

Featuring and ergonomic form, our curved 10"" x 12"" plate further improves ergonomics over standard flat body armor plates. The curve contours to your body and is recommended if you wear your body armor on a regular basis, or for duty use. A specific radius has been chosen for maximum comfort as a front or back plate for operators of varying height and weight; our curved 10"" x 12"" body armor can be used in either position in your plate carrier. To achieve the best ergonomics possible we recommend a curved front and back plate.

AR500 Armor® 10” x 12” Body Armor Features:
• 10” x 12” body armor will fit in Plate Carriers capable of accepting up to Medium and Large SAPI plates
• Outlasts Ceramic, Dyneema, and UHMWPE constructed body armor

SHIPPING AND FFL transfer available.  For IL FOID holders, transfer on FOID card now possible, WITH state police confirmation of card validity.  For NH residents, personal transfer with either NH permit and or state residency and confirmed validity of paperwork from your local police department.  Please note, in some localities, this gun may be classified as an assault weapon.  It generally is considered ""legal exempt"" in CA.
Tool kit shown in the case is NOT correct for the gun, and not included.  The CORRECT tool kit for the gun is included in the revised $1400 price, but is not in the illustration.  It is in a green Hammerli case.

LargeLH grip also available.

Excellent condition and accuracy, independent of the prior use in competitions (note the stickers).  About as good as the Hammerli 160, not as accurate as the Pfuff or Steyr (which also are available).  In my experience, more accurate and more reliable than the TOZ35 and 35M.

The fore-end has a wood filler, and does not contain a weight at this time.  The fore-end can be equipped with a recoil absorbing weight if desired, or a tuning weight interior to the fore-end.  No key for the case.

These guns can use any .22lr ammunition including the high velocity rounds, or if desired, .22L CB.  The .22s can be used, but is not recommended due to the twist rate of the barrel.

It is the civilian version, which has an adjustable rear sight. This is a great gun--fun to shoot and surprisingly accurate due to it being a fixed barrel design. It's amazing how few parts these things are made of, which contributes to the Makarov's legacy--less to go wrong and break. I've heard that there's only 27 parts on the entire gun. Not sure if that's true or not, but internally it looks quite simple.
This one comes with two magazines and an original leather flap holster. It also includes more than 250 rounds of 9mm Makarov (9x18mm) ammo of which 150 rounds are jacketed hollow points.

This particular model 1400 is the New Model as previously stated meaning it was produced from the late 80's to early 90's and is the top of the line model when it comes to the 1400 series. The low end begins with the 1400 ranger, the 1400 standard is midrange, and the new model is at the top of the list with a jeweled bolt, fully checkered solid walnut stock, and a vent rib barrel. This particular shotgun was acquired by myself from someone I know. The shotgun was purchased new around 1990 and has only had 150, yes only 150, rounds put through this. The owner unfortunately passed away and as a result I now have ownership of this firearm. As you can imagine, this shotgun has spent all of its life in the safe with regular oiling and is in amazing shape. The receiver has a very small and unnoticeable nick from being bumped, but again the pictures do not do this firearm justice. I am including in the trade a plastic case, two boxes of Remington Trap shells, an extra choke tube, and for the right deal I will throw in a brand new Galco kydex in the waist right hand holster designed for a Glock model 19/23/32. This shotgun in its current condition and model considered is valued at $375+ according to blue book values and so forth plus I have the ammo, case, and Galco holster on top of that. I am interested in trading for the below listed items only however I may entertain other offers. If you are interested or would like further photos please text me at 513-six30-six551. I do not answer phone calls so please text only. I am also willing to drive up to a half hour depending on the terms of the deal and my schedule on that particular day. Thanks for looking"

Long version : 
    I bought this scope for an AR build I was hoping to do. Unfortunately, I never had the time.  This scope has been sitting in it's box unused on my shelf collecting dust over the past few months. I've decided to let it go.

    The scope is optically and mechanically flawless. I've not used it, and have only taken it out of the box on a few occasions. This scope new costs $750-$850! And Warne QD rings aren't cheap either (somewhere around $75 I think)! But I have other things I'd rather be putting money towards than an AR build right now. So my loss is your gain.

    I'm primarily a collector of classic 60's - 80's Era bolt action rifles. But all trades will be considered. The worst I can do is politely decline, so just ask me if you have anything you're thinking of trading.

All of them are new in package (no box), and are Asian Military (NOT factory Glock).  They should fit all Gen 3 or earlier 9mm pistols (I don't know about Gen 4).  Don't e-mail asking my lowest price or if I still have these, as I will update the quantity as I sell them:

2x 50 round Glock 9 mm drums
2x 33 round extended drop-free Glock 9 mm magazines

Whether you're wanting to limit your reloads on the range, in a home invasion, or the zombie apocalypse, one of these will keep you firing long after others have run out of all their magazines.

The drums I've seen selling for as high as $120 each online, but I'm only asking $65.
The 33-round magazines I want $20 each.  If you buy all 4 with cash I'll knock off a few bucks.  Must meet me locally, but if you buy all of them I might travel as far as Johnson Creek or Cabela's in Richfield to meet."

The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.
The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.
This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.
The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.

You Can Never Be Too Prepared. The Ruger SP101® revolver boasts the strength to handle the powerful 357 Magnum cartridge in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver. Among the most powerful small-frame revolvers on the market, they are engineered for solid performance. Featuring a recoil-reducing grip, the SP101® is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense or field use. Strong and reliable shot after shot, all SP101® revolvers have solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This one is Double-Action-Only (DAO) defensive weapon.  Great for concealment or to be carried in a purse.
I am the original owner and have the original box  and all that came with it.  I have fired maybe 35 round through it.  It is in excellent near new condition.  I am reducing the herd since I have not carried this or shot it in over 1 year. 

Great concealed/defensive weapon for a man or women !!

This gun was shipped to me and I took it to the range 1 time. It's been shot 2 boxes exactly. 40 rounds. There are no cosmetic blemishes marks or anything else. This auction includes 1 20-round LaRue magazine. The only alteration is the addition of an AAC breakout muzzle break. This gun is in 99% or better condition. I have all paperwork, Test target and owners man etc...I would rather not ship, it is very expensive and time consuming. If you want it shipped let me know and I will work a price. The PredatOBR retails for $3370.00 (after waiting a year) plus shipping, tax, and FFL fee.

It also includes a unfired 14.5"" Field Grade PredatOBR barrel pinned and welded w/ SOCOM Surefire Brake, Larue Toolbox and OD gun wrap (with a separate Larue OD sock for the 18"" barrel) (not pictured)

This is a sub-MOA takedown gun that fits nicely into the wrap and tool box (Last picture). This is a 18"" barrel w/ associated hand guard, the 14.5 barrel will also work w/ this but the shoulder of the barrel will be just under the hand guard (2nd Pic). 

I am asking $4000 obo for everything. 

would be interested in trades+cash...interested in a SCAR 17, IWI Tavor, make an offer, worse i can say is no thanks!

The can is not for sale, the Nightforce and Aimpoint are not included in the asking price, but can be included if you would like them...no, they are not cheap.

I will include the original LaRue Rat Stock not the CTR as shown, the CTR w/ the LaRue Cheek weld is MUCH better than the RAT stock (Opinion only).  The CTR w/ everything included cost around $225.

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

I have up for sale/trade a super rare and fun gun. This is a Coharie Arms CA89 which is a truly remarkable MP5K variant. The Coharie is unique in that it does not require any modifications to accept any of the class 3 items so unlike the other clones these are the only ones that are more exact replicas. I am not certain but I was told they produced less than 500 of these total. It has been fired but is immaculate and spent most of its like as a safe queen (since 1998). Comes with factory hard case, 4 mags, and paperwork, oh and the front sight was swapped to a night sight.

First $2000 cash owns it.

Please look these up before assuming value, the last one I saw sold online for over $3000 and didn't have the case or extra mags.

FTF or FFL to FFL only and yes I will ship.
Thanks

Serial number is 897xxE, which according to my research was built in 1978. I purchased this gun almost 10 years ago from a friend with MS who had been confined to a wheelchair and could no longer shoot. This gun has been very well taken care of and I have fired less than 100 rounds through it since I bought it. Didn't ask my friend how much he had fired it but I don't think it was very much. The only distracting flaw to the gun are the slight marks to the left grip, which I've shown in the second pic. Mechanically perfect and still a very attractive Colt.

I never shoot this gun so I thought it might be time for this one to have a new home. No box or paperwork unfortunately, just the old padded leather Allen case I got it in. Looking for handguns or long guns you just don't see every day in trade. I won't consider ARs, Glocks, XDs or M&Ps in trade. Looking for the best trade offer I can get over this weekend.
