This is all virtually new except the leather 226 holster , all below retail. I don't own these guns anymore so I dont need the accessories for them. If you want the lot you can have it for 375 and part it out yourself. Yes you can fit 229 and 220 into 226 stuff. The safari land is the only thing that doesn't accept rails. Everything else DOES. If I forgot to mention something in the pic let me know I'll message you the price. Prices firm. I have to spend 5 bucks to get to town each time so it's a trip. Thanks :)"

Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

Where did Windham Weaponry come from?

When Bushmaster was sold off to Freedom Group and the manufacturing plant moved out of town, the local gunsmiths cried in unison “screw you guys, we’re starting our own manufacturing company!” Using the skills and techniques learned from years on the Bushmaster assembly line, Windham Weaponry set to work producing AR-15 rifles targeted for the same market as their former corporate overlords."

My interest has shifted to another rifle I seem to lust for so I am selling this one. As the pictures show, it has the original box and owner manual. The pictures also show the only flaw on the left forestock which has a very small ding on it that I almost went to the trouble of fixing with Tru Oil. I think one drop of that will cure the one blemish on the gun. The only item not true to original on the firearm is that I have had a Pachmeyer Decelerator recoil pad.

These are quite rare as there was no importation from communist countries during the time of manufacture.  Most all of the 241's in the United States were brought back by GI's after WWII.             
  The CZ 241 shotgun was made from 1946-1950.  The said shotgun was developed during II. WW by the group of the Czech designers, namely Ladislav Schmitmayer, Vaclav Jindra and Jindrich Brejcha in CZ plant at Uhersky Brod.  They received help from an another six gunsmiths working at that time in R&D shop.  Work was done secretly as an above mentioned group kept development of CZ 241 from the Germans, who occupied the factory at that time.  During the years 1942-1944 the CZ 241 underwent a heavy testing and the tests proved that CZ 241 is an excellent shotgun.  In the last test, before full production was introduced, the gun was successfully fired eighty thousand times without one problem.  After liberation of former Czechoslovakia, the CZ 241 went into a full production in 1946.  It was produced in three gauges:  12, 16 & 20.  Weight of the shotgun is 6 1/2 lbs.  Production started in a factory at City of Strakonice, but very shortly after, the production of the CZ 241 was shifted to Uhersky Brod.    In years 1946-1947 the receiver of CZ 241 have been made from light alloy material sourced from the propellers of the American planes shot down over this area by the Germans during the war.  The barrels have been made of an excellent material which was used to make the barrels for an aircraft machine gun MG 131."

The last time I used it, it worked flawlessly, but I now have no way to test it.  I did replace two of the tabs that hold the side supports with metal screws as they were flimsy and broke off. This seems to be a rather common problem.

There is a crack in the Body where you mount it to a tripod. 

I am pricing this at a bargain price and you'll be buying it ""As is"".  This is certainly a value when you look at the prices for replacement parts should anything break on your unit.

Additionally, I did open the ""Start"" Skyscreen as the wire insulation was loose, this also seems to be common with these. I pushed it in to where the body would hold the wires.  It worked fine after this repair. 

Instructions are also included.

I will accept a return if you find that either of the Skyscreens don't function.  Return shipping will be at the buyer expense."

Excellent grain and really nice skip line checkering. Checkered grip cap and butt plate.

Full stock with 18.5"" barrel. Low recoil, with a  reputation for hard hitting. Online info is easily found if one is to look on how respected this round is world wide.

REALLY nice iron sights and the rifle shoulders perfectly for using both the iron sights or for installing a scope on the included Weaver style mounts. A few small dings and the end cap on the forearm could use a little blue touch up but in EXCELLENT condition overall with sharp rifling, and updated safety.

Monte Carlo style, roll over cheek piece stock. Jeweled bolt.  Much custom work has went into this really nice deer rifle and is a good one for someone wishing to use something other than the ""same ol"" rifles normally around.

Has some wear. This is not a NEW rifle but over all better than most M96 rifles. I have other photos as well available on request with SERIOUS buyers.

The use of standard rounds for deer in Indiana has not yet completely passed but the final vote is allegedly in May. That said only one proposal, that I could find, has ever been turned down in Indiana's history so personally I expect this proposal to pass.

I also have 28 factory rounds, 280 Speer and Hornady 6.5 bullets, Lee collet die set available but not included in this price for the person who reloads and is interested.
They are listed here as well for additional funds.

425 dollars locally, cash only for pick up sales. You cannot replace the stock and stock work for this price.

USPS money order only for payment for your safety and mine if shipping to your FFL
**NOTE**
TO SHIP.........I MUST HAVE an FFL copy to ship the rifle to.  No exceptions. Dealer can mark the ffl ""ONE TIME USE ONLY"" for transfer of this rifle making it impossible to use for anything else. Common practice on Gunbroker transactions. Shipping is 25 dollars extra.

I have a Colt 1851 Navy 2nd gen with Treso nipples for sale. I bought this in January in unfired condition and fired maybe 6 cylinders through it before completely breaking it down, cleaning and oiling it.

Accessories include Colt style powder flask, powder, wads, balls, caps  and a nipple wrench. Powder, balls, wads and caps are minus whatever I shot.

There are a few minor issues with the gun, the barrel wedge is marred up from improper disassembly by the previous owner, the wedge works perfectly fine it's just a little ugly, replacements can be found a lot of places online I just didn't see a need to replace it. The left side of the grip has some small dings in it that would probably steam/sand out."

Mine has been used twice and great shape and fits m&p 
The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster is the ultimate IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster. It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!"

I am not sure if this was fitted later into this stock but I am assuming it is original, especially since it has a super early serial number. These guns are absolutely legendary and very rare to come by. This one is overall in beautiful condition for its age as evident in the photos. Bluing is still overall in very good shape, a real collectors piece. 

I am really wanting a decent AR15, AR-10, Something in the 5.7X28 family such as a five seven pistol or ps90, or multiple gun trade offer. 
I will also listen to any cash offers.

FTF or FFL to FFL only and yes I will ship.

From Arsenal:
Widely recognized in the gun world as the best of the best 

It has been a decade since we have imported these rifles from Arsenal Co of Bulgaria. This milled receiver rifle sets the standard for superior accuracy and reliability. This modern sporting rifle will easily become the centerpiece of any collection and will be the one handed down from generation to generation. 

The quality comes from the original hot hammer forged and milled receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and trigger, the cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrel, and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes. 

Summary: SLR-101S - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

I have several sights I’ve taken off pistols over the last year.  These are either new, or near new (less than 2 years old).  I have the following:

SIG P-Series 9mm front sights (4) – Asking $10 each
SIG P-Series 9mm sight set (front and rear) – Asking $40
SIG P-Series 9mm rear sight (TRUGLO) – Asking $15
GLOCK 9mm Front Sight – Asking $10

These are all in top shape, they all have great Tritium glow remaining (except the TRUGLO which are not night sights).  I have more pictures I can send if you'd like to see the sights.  NOTE:  I have not used a punch to remove these, they were removed with a sight pusher tool.  All sights are factory SIG, TRUGLO or Trijicon Glock sights. 

If you would like any of these installed, please let me know - happy to do it while you wait, but for a few additional $$$ depending on the sights you choose.  

Thanks for looking."

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots.
