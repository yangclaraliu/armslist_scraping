Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the WolfPack™ Series Replacement Frame.  If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.

The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system.

Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.

This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/19,23,32,38. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"". Other than a ""Slim Frame Trigger housing is needed"" Parts # LWD-30275 or GLO-30275 for 9mm, LWD-28927 or GLO-28927 (GLO-4361 locking block required) Drop them in, perform the basic safety function test and you are ready to go."

Has Sarco/Germany import marks on barrel, which means it was probably a German Barrel and not original to the receiver, bore is shootable but I'd rate it less then 7/10 - so still plenty fine. No import marks on the receiver. Receiver has the Serbian Crest and Preduzece 44 marking, but the German K98 marking does not bear the /44 stamp meaning it was german produced and reworked in the late 1940s by the Serbs. Numbers mostly match through, but I think there is an odd ball one or two that are different - nothing significant. Bolt match's itself and the gun. There are Waffenamt markings (Wa 263 I believe) on the rear sight, but I suspect that's not from when the Serbs had it (they rarely left any of the german Markings). 

There is also an SS stamp and a deathhead mark on the barrel. I'm almost positive these were not original, and is typical of a Mitchell's Mauser or any number that had previous owners with a hammer and stamp (common in the 80s). Just letting you know they are there. Stock is solid. Includes nice re-production leather sling. 

Asking $325 FTF or shipped on your dime. Got it as part of a trade, wanted to get it out shooting, but haven't even had the time. Looking a move coming up so paring down.

This has very good lockup, with a millimeter of difference within the primer strike, it doesn't strike dead center every time but you'll be damned sure that it'll strike it every time! I've never had a single failure with this gun and I'm positive you won't either.

Bore is good. Shows use and age, but dates to the 40's I believe. Sweet little shooter (notch and bead post sight). There was some rust on and under the buttplate when I got it, I dressed it up and oiled it, but you'll need to watch it and re-oil it. The rest of the gun is fine. I thoroughly cleaned it and stripped, and cleaned up the stock without ruining it's character. It has plenty of usage marks, but it's solid. Finish is brown, but even and nice.

Get shooter/practice plinking gun for kids or someone new to shooting that wants to learn a notch and bead front sight. Very quiet for those with adequately sized backyard range practice space, but still want to be courteous neighbors. Used to have just that kind of space but moved.

Receiver whole (not drilled and tapped) with matching Remington bolt that headspaces well. 03/A3 stock FJA marked, with OG (Ogden Armory) re-work markings and proof P. Stock has one big ding mark up forward.  The handguard is a replacement with new old stock USGI wood. Barrel was a New Old Stock replacement 2 groove barrel, and is in the white, bore is mint. These 2 groove barrels can shoot (they prefer heavier bullets) and this one is no exception.

Asking $650 with the barrel in the white, but I'll be having it reparked soon and the price will bump to $700 FTF. Shipped on your dime. Great chance to get a historic rifle at a great price that looks great and you won't feel bad shooting it. New bore makes it a Springfield match contender (it's in as issued condition). Cheaper then a ""collectable"" mixmaster sold online and cheaper then a James River shooter with a new barrel.

Molot VEPR 12 ga. Auto Shotgun

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface.

Hey all,
	I have a use but great condition classic smith and Wesson revolver. This is a model 66-7 in stainless finish with a 2.5 inch barrel. It is in great shape for a used pistol and would be a great addition to any collection. I would keep this myself, but I already have a carry revolver and don't want this one to just collect dust in a safe. This will also come with a cylinder of defense Ammo to get you started. 
	I would also consider trades on this. Possibly for folder AK47s, Marlin lever guns in 357/44, M1 carbines, CMR30s, 45 LC Schofield revolvers, certain black powder revolvers, break over black powder rifles, SP101, RedHawks, Takedown/survival  22lr, etc Honestly, shoot me a message on here or a text only at REDACTED and we can go from there. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will on mine. Just please be reasonable on your values and I will as well. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

National Match, Service Rifle Match Set. This rifle has less than 2000 rounds of light handloads during competitions. It has been cleaned, oiled and cared for after each shooting. It is in 100% condition with the exception of couple of scratches on the carry handle due to limited space in my safe. While this is a great match rifle, it can also be used as a tactical stand off rifle or just a fun range tack driver. It shoots less than 1 MAO. Now I have young kids and do not compete, it is just sitting in my safe and this rifle deserves to be out there being used. I have all paperwork, everything it came with.

 I have spent over $1400 and will let it go for $750. I am open to trades, the worst can happen is I'll say no. Must have Florida Drivers license.

The file has very slight use on the metal side only. Other than the aforementioned all tools are brand new never used. PRICE $20

All tools on the swiss army knife are in perfect/great condition. The plastics scales on the sides are tight and in great condition they just show slight scuffing typical of carry/use. The only major thing wrong is its missing both the tweezers and the toothpick. Which I'm sure are replaceable if you really want them. PRICE $15

I'd prefer to ship USPS flat rate which costs $5 insured anywhere in the US, and will only take USPS MONEY ORDER for payment. save cost on shipping and buy both. I have more pics and can answer any questions if you have any, just msg me. THANKS.

This rifle shoots great, with it's weight (around 9lbs)  the recoil is reduced. This is a short, handy rifle that would be great for a truck carry rifle that is hard hitting.

The CMMG Drop In .22 LR AR15 Conversion Kit is what you need to turn your AR-15 rifle into a plinking machine. This conversion kit converts a standard .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO chambered AR-15 into .22 Long Rifle, allowing you to practice without spending a fortune at the range. The magazine holds 25 rounds of ammunition. For best performance use a round style hammer as notched hammers can cause function issues and 36 grain plated nose bullets have proven to be the best choice for function.

It shoots 175 SMK's very accurately, it's a 1/2 moa rifle and I've shot better than that a couple of times. There are between 110-120 rounds down the barrel and I broke it in one round at a time which it quit copper fouling at 8 rounds, just like all of the barrels that I have gotten from Mark. If you are familiar with Mark's work then you know it's a shooter. Only selling to finance other hobbies as I'm moving out of shooting (race cars... Another expensive hobby)

The revolver by design — and the Pit Bull in particular — is a weapon that requires minimal training to be used effectively in defensive circumstances. Training should be at the top of any shooter or concealed-carry user’s list, but the basic simplicity of the revolver allows the user to concentrate on the threat and not on safeties, de-cockers and other assorted levers, as on semiautomatic pistols.

I have a brand new (never fired) Tikka T3 Lite in 270 WSM, got rifle new a few weeks ago, clean it, oil it and was put on the safe, but changed my mind and I need to free up funds for a new build.
Rifle is located in Gresham, so need to meet at a local FFL for transfer (you paid transfer), it comes with Box, manual, rings a box of 19rds of ammo that a friend of mine give me.
I paid over $600 for it (with background check), will sell for $450 cash.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks"
