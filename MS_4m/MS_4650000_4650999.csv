It is geared up one tooth in the front to help keep the front end on the ground. I replaced the chain and sprockets last year. The bike doesn't idle but as I understand, most modded blasters don't. The rear tires are about 30% and I have another set of rear tires that are about 50% as well as the stock steel wheels and a set of nerf bars to go with it. There is a tear in the seat. I do not have a title but the title status is clean and a title could be easily obtained. I would be willing to sell outright for $800 or I would be willing to trade for an AR, a wood stock ak or a Russian or yugo sks plus cash or any other military type semi auto. I would also be interested in a bolt gun with a scope .270 or larger. I may be interested in other trades so let me know what you have. The worst I'll do is say no.

This slim design makes it perfect for those looking for a concealed carry pistol. Like the whole XD® line of pistols, the XD-S® offers an ergonomic design that makes it easier to point and shoot. The design offers a single-position Picatinny rail, making this one of the only pistols of its size that can be accessorized with lights and lasers. The low profile sight also makes this firearm more holster-friendly.

In addition to the slim contour frame, the XD-S® pistol has many features that make it more comfortable and easy to shoot. Two interchangeable backstraps allow you to customize your grip. The modified contour of the grip also makes it possible for nearly any size hand to release the magazine without twisting or moving from your firing grasp.

The XD-S® has many of the safety features found in other XD® models, such as Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, and grip safety. The XD-S® also has an enhanced secure grip texture.

Combined, all of these features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S® provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and ergonomic point and shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

The 99T is the hardest of the 99’s to come across, as they were only made for 5 years and even then they were competing with the more common 99’s on the assembly line. Very few of these were made and the most common caliber is the .300 Savage making this rifle the rarest of the rare. The giveaway on a “T” is that the stock and forearm are beefier than the regular models, which this is by about 1/8”. The proof of the pudding is Savages are marked on the front of the receiver and the model can be seen when the handguard is removed which can clearly be seen in the picture. According to the serial number it was manufactured in 1935, the first year of manufacture for this rifle. Note the super rare letter “Z” in the boss of the lever. The condition is almost NRA excellent. Note that there is no butt plate but original/modern replacements can be bought but the original screws are included. Most people have never seen a “T” let alone handled one. This rifle sports a Leupold 4X scope ..

BRAND: WINCHESTER
MODEL: 94 AE BIG BORE
GAUGE: 356 WIN
Swarovski Habicht 1.5X6X42   Made in Austria 
With ammo.  11 boxes unfired , 1 box almost full and 1 box of brass

I have had this gun over 15years. Today they ammo is expensive if you can even did it, the rile usually goes on gunbroker for over $800 and the scope about the same.  Boxes of this ammo can go for $50 to 60 a box. 

When I lived in Georgia, this was my go to gun for close hunting in thick areas. It packs a punch and will handle minor brush better than a magnum, yet can still reach out for a two hundred yard shot as it's very flat, not your old mans 30/30 for sure.  I am only parting with it because I need to get me a bow.  I've shot maybe 150 rounds through it, yes I bought it new along with scope, right and mount.  Comes with butler creek slung, easy on the back and nice to carry. 

Looking to sell, but may consider a trade.  I can list it on gunbroker and get over 2k for this package easy. So that is my bottom dollar.  If,you buy and resell the ammo you could easily make 1k if your not in a hurry just on the ammo.

Kahr CW45

I've had this gun Cerakoted in burnt bronze as well as some of the parts like the mag release, slide release and trigger.

Has 1 factory mag and 1 1911 mag. The factory mag makes the gun 7+1, the 1911 mag makes it 8+1. This is one of the few 1911 mags that actually feeds perfectly in this gun and also allows the slide to lock back on empty, just like the factory mags do.  All other brands of 1911 mags (in 45ACP) will work in this gun, just won't always lock the slide back on empty.  Kind of makes it a cool back up gun to the 1911's if you want something really concealable.  Just pull the mag from your 1911 and throw it in the Kahr and go.  

Oh, I forgot, I had to replace the front sight when I had the gun Cerakoted and put the Trijicon night sight on the front."

- I have had it for about six years and have never had a single problem with it.

Up for sale I have a Hardened Arms 223 upper tricked-out with a Vortex Strikefire, muzzle brake, flip sights, swivel sling mount, and Blackhawk vertical grip.  

About the upper:
- M4 flat top black anodized mil-spec finished upper receiver
- Feed ramps for increased feeding reliability on barrel and upper
- Laser etched T-Marked upper receiver
- Melonite coated chrome moly 5.56 Barrel
- 1/7 Barrel Twist (great for 55gr-77+gr bullets)
- Chambered in 5.56 NATO (will also fire .223 ammo)
- 16"" M4 Profile barrel with M4 Extension
- .750"" diameter at gas block
- 1/2x28 threaded muzzle/barrel
- Low profile gas block
- Barrel dimpled to secure gas block
- Carbine length gas system
- Tactical Quad Rail free float 15"" handguard with end cap
- Melonited full-auto BCG with staked gas key
- Standard mil-spec charging handle

To this setup I added a competition muzzle brake / compensator.  Louder for people standing next to you, but it virtually eliminates ANY muzzle rise no matter how fast you pull the trigger.

I put fewer than 300 rounds through this--brought it to a family reunion to give my brothers-in-law a chance to shoot an AR.  Unfortunately, I never had any good range time with this, but my sense is that this is a fairly decent tack driver.  I got the Strikefire zeroed in and was shooting 2"" groups at 50 yards with 55 grain cheap brass cased ammo off hand.  I suspect those groups would tighten up fairly quick if you actually sat down at a bench.  For reloaders, this barrel with a load of Reloader 15 behind a 77gr bullet should shoot ragged holes at 100 yards.

About the optic:  Vortex is one of the FEW manufacturers that fully warranties their red dot scopes for LIFE!  That's the life of the product, not your life.  So anyone who has the red dot in their possession has the warranty.  If it fails, breaks, falls out of a treestand and onto a rock, or in any way fails you, Vortex will fix it or give you a new one.  It's a GREAT dot!  I have another one and two of their scopes.  Vortex is a fantastic company!  Great products, great pricing, unbeatable warranty.

-- 4 MOA dot
-- Switch between red and green
-- has a night vision setting if you plan to run it with a night vision optic for some fun late-night predator hunting!
-- Several brightness settings allow it to be seen clearly any time of day or night
-- Auto off feature prevents you from findning a dead optic
-- Battery life of something like 5000 hours
-- I have the box, but somewhere along the way lost the 2x mulitplier (which would give you an 8 MOA dot--do you really want that big a dot anyway? :) )

The flip sights--nothing earth-shatteringly amazing, but they work AND they seem to cowitness.  I lined them up after zeroing the dot, but never used them, so I can't guarantee how on target they are (or even anything about the quality--wish I could but I never used them).

I also added the QD swivel for your convenience if you want to run a two point sling.

This is zeroed in and ready to rock.  Just drop it in any mil-spec lower and you should be good to go!

If you want MORE adventure, I have a Bumpfire stock I'm clearing out as well.  With a Bumpfire stock, you get the ability to simulate full-auto.  Keep your finger across the trigger, apply continual forward pressure, and the recoil will keep the rounds flying.  Takes some practice, but once you get the hang of it, you can control the rate--two round bursts, all the way up to full 30-round mag dumps in just a few seconds!  With the muzzle brake on this thing, it should keep you on target without having to worry about the muzzle rising off into space.  Just $90!  No FFL or stamp needed!  Completely legal to own and operate!

If you want the bumpfire mounted on a complete PSA lower (also used, but very low round count), I can do that for just $250 for the lower AND Bumpfire!  I WILL need to either send that to your FFL (if shipping out of state) or insist on getting a picture of your CCL (I'll reciprocate).  (happy to throw in a standard adjustable stock if you want to switch out the bumpfire from time-to-time).

If you want me to ship the upper, it will be an additional $25 for shipping costs.  

Payment:
-- Face-to-face, cash only on paypal gift (transfer after you look at it and want to buy)
-- Shipping, PMO or Paypal VERY VERY DISCRETE!!!!!!  Any hint that this is firearms related and Paypal suspends both our accounts and seizes all assets.  Paypal would require an additional 3.5%."
