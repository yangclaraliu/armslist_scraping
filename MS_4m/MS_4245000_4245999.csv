The rifle has good wood & metal (all original).  The loading tube holds 17 rounds of .22 long rifle.  This gun retains about 90% of its metal finish.  The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp and deep.  The barrel is marked “Savage Arms / Stevens Westfield, Mass. U.S.A. Model 887 / CAL 22 Long Rifle” - Serial #228981. 

I have not shot this rifle in a long time - 20+ plus years.  If I remember correctly it likes hotter ammo for better functioning - you may have to experiment with ammo to find what it likes.  Also, this model functions a bit odd.  The bolt stays back after firing a round until you let go of the trigger.  So, tap the trigger and release for efficient funtioning.  Put a scope on it and you'll have a nice plinker.

I'm selling this to fund an AR-15.  This has been in my closet for many years, and I have not taken it out forever.  Time to part with it.   Sorry...... the armlist only let me upload one picture.  $100 /obo   Call or text Al REDACTED.   **SOLD**"

Posting from work and haven't gotten photos yet. If interested, email and I'll get photos to interested parties first and foremost. And here we go!

Up for sale is a Springfield Armory 1911, Loaded Lightweight Champion model with the rare OD Green frame/black slide combination with a heck of a lot of upgrades. This model features a 4"" ramped bull barrel, bright Trijicon night sights, novak sight cuts, and a lightweight aluminum frame. Upgrade include:

-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Sear
-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Sear Spring
-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Firing Pin and Spring
-Harrison Design Long Matte Black Match Trigger

All parts were installed and tuned by a professional gun smith and a reliability upgrade was done by Springfield to increase feeding reliability for hollow points. Gun functions flawlessly.

Has had about 1,000 rounds through it. Has some normal wearing on the blued portion and a small amount on the frame, but still in excellent condition and the trigger is outstanding. So if you're looking for a quality carry 1911, this one is a winner! 

Please, no low ball offers, we all know it is a waste of your time and mine, so let's be respectful of eachother here. Thanks!"

This is a Plug and play upper.   Pin to any milspec lower and you are ready to go. Includes 90rds of green tip M855 62gr new ammo.   This is the upper that ammo was originally designed for.  It will run anything .223 or 5.56 you may have.  Wilde chamber.

If you want to add to the package, I also have an FNMI 4 position carbine stock with the super heavy H6 Buffer.   This is what the Corps is using for when the Marines are in vehicles and need their rifle to be more compact.   The heavier buffer also helps with felt recoil to reduce recovery time between rounds.   $150.00 for this option

The price of this upper is more than fair.  At least with this one, you know what you are getting, unlike the market saturated with mystery parts.   This is a 6-800m rifle, and is built to last.  All parts are marked with either the cage number for FNMI or the letter F.  Prefer to sell locally.

FYI, I am NOT one of those who buy ammo for resale! So, for those who will not buy from resellers (myself included), I offer this information. 

Because of health considerations, I no longer hunt, and my recreational shooting is now very limited. So, my firearms and shooting has been adjusted to only those weapons and ammunition necessary for home and personal defense. I no longer have a .45acp or .44mag firearm, and I have limited my 38/357 to two specific Remington rounds. Careful observation and examination will show this ammunition is new older stock, the boxes of which show evidence of being handled and shuffled around over a period of time, as most enthusiasts are aware and know.

I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
I would like to trade for a full size pistol in 9mm. I am not very interested in Stryker fire guns (Glocks, etc), I am mainly interested in something SA/DA with a metal frame. My top choice would be a Beretta 92, but I would also be interested in a CZ-75 and other similar items. I would also be interested in a Ruger GP100 4"". That being said, I will consider most any reasonable offer.
The best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. I have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. FTF Wichita area only."

The HIPERTOUCH® 24 fire-control drop-in is a high performance, high precision, service rifle upgrade that installs in AR-15® and AR-10® type rifles. The HIPERTOUCH® name is short for HIgh PERformance TOUCH and 24 for user adjustable trigger weights between 2 and 4 lbs. It’s the “AR” fire-control upgrade we’ve all dreamed of. For installation and operational features of the HIPERTOUCH® family of AR fire-controls watch the 24 videos above. View this graphic, AR-15LowerCavity.PDF. HIPERTOUCH® FCGs may not work in lowers with pivot holes that are outside the MIL-Spec dimensions shown in RED.
The Genius of the HIPERTOUCH® Fire-Control

HIPERTOUCH® FCGs have uniquely solved two problems with stock AR triggers and AR trigger upgrades respectively: 1) High Trigger Weight, and 2) Low Hammer Fall Energy.
Trigger Weight: The real culprit behind high trigger pull weight is high sear impingement force that produces high friction. To get around that, the stock “AR” trigger and hammer mechanical advantage was changed and the toggle spring feature added to reduce the impingement force on the trigger sear. Designers of two-stage products changed the functional location of the primary sear; HIPERFIRE®'s design has not, retaining the stock design’s single-stage simplicity. This is important for when stock triggers are pulled, the hammer cam-action signals hammer fall is imminent. When 2-stage triggers are pulled, the final higher weight stage also signals hammer fall. This can lead to the flinching problem we all know about. Some like to say the better 2-stage triggers have glass rod or candy-cane like breaks to sell the idea that they don't signal hammer fall. In any case, the HIPERTOUCH® 24 does not signal hammer fall because the trigger weight is constant over the entire stroke.
Hammer Fall Energy: HIPERTOUCH® features the unique toggle spring functionality that reduces trigger weight, but while doing so, it also increases hammer fall energy by over 35% over the MIL-spec stock design and every trigger upgrade in the market. This permits the shooter to ignite hard MIL and foreign primers as well as hard to ignite 22 rimfire ammunition.
HIPERTOUCH® FCGs retain Eugene Stoner's design of simple elegance while remaining very robust, without the gritty feel. Shooting for high accuracy is no longer an almost impossible chore. It's no longer necessary to improve the stock performance by manually polishing the high-friction trigger and hammer sear surfaces, where the end result was only marginally better anyway.
Ambitious sportsmen and marksmen have been turning to trigger upgrades with varying degrees of satisfaction. The better replacements have been one and two-stage triggers with fixed final weights ranging from between 2½ and 4½ pounds with what some have called a glass rod or candy cane trigger break. Some of these devices require factory or user calibration, maintenance, and/or replacement for wear or doubling. Some of these devices also employ reduced power springs, which have compromised reliable ignition for a ""dream"" trigger weight.
The HIPERFIRE® ""AR"" accessory response to those shooter’s looking for a single-stage and very much improved, match quality, “AR” trigger upgrade that delivers high performance is the HIPERTOUCH® 24. It nests in unmodified standard AR-15® and AR-10® type lower receivers in the same way as stock “AR” triggers and hammers without having to remove the safety selector. It is comprised of three subassemblies: the trigger, hammer, and toggle, spring groups. All the parts are made from carbon steel alloys that have been hardened for wear and strength. It features exceptionally low trigger weights with smooth pre-travel, a very clean hammer release with no report to break, match action response, and faster hammer lock-up. Only now with HIPERTOUCH® trigger and hammer actions does ""AR"" trigger ""squeeze"" have real meaning."

Also, its shorter trigger-reach will make it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands--and even for that first double-action pull. While in the holster, its super-resistant Stainless-Steel slide and barrel makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning.Full of Tactical FeaturesThis handgun offers a great number of useful tactical features, without compromising on its military-style sturdiness and toughness. The magazine well is beveled, for lightning-quick tactical mag-changes without taking your eyes off the target. The combat trigger guard facilitates the use of the handgun while wearing gloves, as well as an ideal and secure placement of the off-hand; also, the front and backstrap are checkered to ensure a positive and consistent grip. Lastly, an integral Picatinny rail enables the easy mounting of tactical accessories such as lighting and sighting systems--without any gunsmithing or modification to the pistol.Reliable and Easy to ShootEngineered to withstand the hardest use in the most demanding conditions around the world, the M9A1 meets and exceeds the standards of reliability of professional military and law enforcement. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow-points and the hardest-hitting +P. An attractive, perfectly-engineered pistol for most uses including competition."

This barrel accepts standard Remington chokes and currently has a Modified installed. Wood is in solid condition with no cracks. The 870 is the most adaptable and best selling pump shotgun of all time! More info from Remington:
This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.
 
Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.
 
Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.
 
KEY FEATURES:
 
28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

What I am offering is to do any work you need done on your ar15 or build one for you from the parts of your choice. If you are completely new to this platform I can help guide you through the whole process. I can help you decide on the quality components that fit your budget and your needs. This is a great time to discover America's most popular rifle. Prices have finally come down, and you can save a lot of money by building your AR over buying one already assembled.

Need to swap out the plastic handguards for a nice free floating railed handguard? Need to replace a barrel? Want to convert to a gas piston system? Or perhaps you just need to install a new trigger. Contact me with your needs and I will see if I can help you out.

Labor costs:
1) Lower receiver complete build: $35
2) Upper receiver complete build (direct impingement or gas piston) : $35
3) Complete AR build (lower + upper): $65
4) Miscellaneous (trigger replacement, handguard replacement etc.): contact for details

Any complete build includes test firing at the range. Included with an AR build is an optional introductory session to familiarize you with all the controls and basic handling skills.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of Military and Police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. The reversible magazine and slide catch/release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of Military and Police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. The reversible magazine and slide catch/release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."
