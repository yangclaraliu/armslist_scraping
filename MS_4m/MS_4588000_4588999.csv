Speer Gold Dot® Pistol Ammunition
• Preferred by law enforcement
• Engineered to prevent jacket separation
• Optimal expansion and penetration
• Decisive terminal performance
• Superior weight retention
• Reliable function and feeding

Speer Gold Dot® ammunition continues to dominate the law enforcement market. It's the first high-performance handgun ammunition to be loaded with true, bonded-core bullets. Speer Gold Dot uses an exclusive Uni-Cor® process where they bond the jacket to the core one molecule at a time. This virtually eliminates core-jacket separation, the leading cause of handgun bullet failures. Only the highest quality, nickel-plated brass cases are used for smooth feeding and corrosion-resistance. Famous CCI® primers and low-flash propellants are used for the best ballistic performance. Made in USA. Per 20.

FROGLUBE® is a cutting edge biodegradable lubricant made from “USDA Certified Food-Grade”. All ingredients are produced in the USA using a proprietary formula. It is a non-toxic substance that dissolves carbon on contact. It has a heavy specific gravity, which enables it to ‘season’ the metal by absorption deep into the pores. Using FROGLUBE® results in a durable dry slick wax-like surface that reduces friction, eliminates fouling, and destroys rust. FROGLUBE® is safe for plastic, urethane, nylon, and wood. FROGLUBE®will give your weapon many extended years of service.

FROGLUBE® will not harm the environment. It can be disposed of without the need for prohibitive HAZMAT controls. Employees will be protected from the affects of working in and around toxic chemicals.

FROGLUBE® IS A BIODEGRADABLE LUBRICANT, CLEANER AND PROTECTANT.

This is a tactical set up equiped with optic and magnifier for close to mid quarters scenarios or drills. Equiped with a brand new Eotech 516.A65, New Primary Arms 3x eye relief magnifier which I believe is just as good as my eotech magnifier I used in the military, and a Samson 30mm quick flip magnifier mount. A perfect set up for engaging targets. Also a new Ergo F93 PRO Stock makes for a perfectly fine tuned and comfortable shooting position. Seekins Lower and internals with a nickel boron trigger, Strike Industries enhanced pins, WMD nickel boron bolt carrier, and a Jp Enterprise Silent Capture Buffer Spring. All this makes this gun a quality weapon. Comes with 3 or 4 new box's of Barnes ammo. And 3 or 4 new Wilson Combat 300 blackout magazines. Here's a few specs below in regards to the barrel and rail. Serious inquiries welcomed. Must have a valid PTP or PTP along with Minnesota I.D.

All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. Magazine capacity is up to 7+1 on models with extended magazine tube. To complete the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel and fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty system. By depressing the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. All 930 Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation. 930 SPX models conveniently come with a factory-mounted Picatinny rail and LPA/M16-Style Ghost Ring combination sight right out of the box."

Brand: Bear Ammo 

The Barnaul Machine Plant JSC is one of the leading producers of industrial goods and ammunition in Russia. The plant's history goes far in the past to the period of Alexander I. The Emperor ordered the opening of the first cartridge plants in St. Petersburg in 1869. During World War I the plant supplied the Russian Army and operated out of St. Petersburg, During World War II, the plant was relocated to Barnaul, where production of various types of cartridges began.
This high quality ammo features lacquered steel case construction; hence the “Brown” Bear name. Brown Bear offers high quality at reasonable prices. This product uses Berdan priming for long shelf life and sure-fire ignition. Brown Bear is loaded to exacting standards normally reserved for military ammo.

It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip.

I'm also throwing in a Real Avid 1911 Smart Wrench and some Buffer Technologies recoil buffers.   I've had one installed from the beginning and highly recommend them for reducing both felt recoil and wear and tear on the gun. 

As far as I'm concerned, SRs are the best kept secret in 1911s.   I'd put them right next to Kimber and S&W and well ahead of Remington.  For the price?   Forget about it.  

So, this is Illinois.  There are rules and all will be followed.  ISP background check/transfer approval and 3 day waiting period. 

ONLY two trades will considered and that is a new or like new Volquartsen TF-22 or Scorpion (depending on configuration of the Scorpion, plus cash on my end in both cases.)  The answer to just about anything else is no."

Either way, there is no bead on the barrel.  It has a Nickle Steel barrel.  There is wear on the receiver where it was carried in a gun lock of the course of its life and I'm sure the receiver has been reblued as there is some pitting that is covered.

Also replaced the bolt handle to a low profile one, allowing more clearance between the handle and a scope.  It is in very good shape and functions as it should.

Also included:  1in scope rings, 2 5-round magazines, 2 alternate height rear sights, Otis 30 cal cleaning brush, 5 practice rounds, original bolt handle, and ~ 200 rounds of assorted Russian ammo.  I also have a soft case I can throw in if you are interested.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

For sale is a LNIB Sig Sauer P250c in 9mm that also comes with the caliber exchange kit for 45acp.  In a matter of seconds, you can easily convert your 9mm pistol into a 45 auto, or vice versa.  Both the pistol and the exchange kit come in Sig's compact (mid-size) frame.  Both have night sights.  This pistol is an excellent shooter, and is built with the quality you expect from Sig Sauer.  The pistol has a very nice double action trigger.  It's like the double action triggers on those classic Colt snake guns and S&W revolvers.  Less than 100 rounds have been shot through this.  Both the pistol and the exchange kit came with one magazine, but I'm including 2 factory unopened 9mm magazines and 2 factory unopened 45acp magazines.  That's a total of 6 magazines included.  Still have everything that came in the boxes including the Sig holster.  The 9mm mags hold 15 rounds, and the 45acp mags hold 9 rounds.  I'm also including 50 rounds of 9mm and 50 rounds of 45acp.  
Sig's MSRP for the 9mm pistol is $584.  
Sig's MSRP for the 45acp exchange kit is is $399.  
Sig's MSRP for the extra mags is $46 each for a total of $186.    
And there's about $35 worth of ammo included.  
I'm asking $650 for all of it.  

Face to face sales only in NWA. Must be an Arkansas resident of legal age to purchase this firearm and not have any legal restrictions from owning it. I will require that you sign a bill of sale acknowledging this. If you refuse to sign, then no sale. This will be a deal breaker with me. 

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.  The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comALG DEFENSE QUALITY MIL-SPEC (QMS) TRIGGER, SMALL PINThe ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter:  The ALG Defense QMS trigger pull is smoother than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by honing the sear surfaces smooth while not removing metal below the valleys of the stock surface finish. Sear geometry has not been changed from standard so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.5lbs.  2. Advantages for the Armorer:  The ALG Defense QMS trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged. There is spare parts commonality between the QMS and stock triggers Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets. Since it is a trigger meeting the U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense QMS can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comTRIGGER PULL DYNAMICSA clean, crisp trigger release and 3.5 pound nominal pull weight. Key elements to any trigger group that allows the shooter's performance to meet the potential of the firearms. CMC's drop-in AR-15 trigger modules are factory set to a nominal trigger pull weight of 3.5 pounds. To most people, a truly clean, crisp breaking trigger pull set at 3.5 lbs. seems much lighter. OVER-TRAVEL & TAKE-UPThese elements are critical to the overall performance of a world class shooter, but are also important to any shooter who wants to demonstrate precision shooting. Unlike traditional AR-15 trigger groups, one of the most spectacular elements of the CMC AR-15 drop-in trigger modules is that tactical grade over-travel and take-up can be accomplished with geometry and without the need for screws or other moving parts. Sure, some people have different preferences, but due to the many years CMC's trigger modules have been in production and the many thousands sold, customer feedback has made us very confident that the design of these products is such that take-up and over-travel is right in the sweet spot for both. And it won't change because it's done with geometry on not moving parts that can come loose (usually at the worst time). 1. Every component of the CMC drop-in trigger modules maintain tolerances of +/- .001"" (one thousandth of an inch) or less wherever two critical surfaces engage or interface. The same tolerances apply to each and every hole location. 2. Surface finish is critical for obtaining that magic ""feel"" that is absolutely necessary with a tactical grade Quality trigger group. It's not easy and takes of a lot of time to develop an effective, precision tooling setup for producing mirror finishes on the components with critical surfaces as are incorporated in the CMC trigger modules. COMPATIBILITYWhich AR-15 Rifles Are Compatible – The CMC drop-in AR-15 trigger modules are designed to fit any lower receiver manufactured to be within the standard military specifications for nominal dimensions and tolerances, except Colts® with sear blocks.INCLUDES:   Drop In Trigger Group, Pre-Assembled  Anti-Walk Pins  Screws  Torx Wrenches   Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: CMC TRIGGERS AR-15 SINGLE STAGE DROP IN TRIGGER GROUP, CURVED, 3.5 LB."
