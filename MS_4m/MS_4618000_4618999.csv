Bought from optics planet for this price but have decided to get the MRAD instead. Optics Planet will take it back at no loss to me, but I figured I would give the opportunity to someone else to pick this up at a great price they sold it to me for. MSRP is $2000, and it sells for $1399 everywhere online that is not sold out. Save yourself about $180 and pick this one up. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks.

It embodies many advanced features such as a “double-locking” cylinder, a unique “single spring” mechanism for relatively lighter trigger pull, replaceable front sights and adjustable rear sights, with an all-stainless steel construction. The Redhawk is reinforced to handle extra stress, making it very popular for use by handloaders as it handles the hottest of Magnum loads with ease. In addition, the cylinder itself is longer than most competitors’, allowing ammunition to be loaded to a longer overall length. This allows for either increased powder capacity, heavier (and therefore longer) bullets without compromising the powder load, or a combination of both. The Redhawk also features a hard plastic case.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $745.00  SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 5004Category: FIREARMS – HANDGUNSType :RevolverAction :DoubleCaliber :44 MagBarrel Length :5.5″Overall Length :11″Twist :1:16″ RHCapacity :6 rdSafety :Transfer BarGrips :WoodSights :Front Blade Rear/AdjustableWeight :46 ozFinish :Stainless Steel"

Product DescriptionAt 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.  SPECIFICATIONSProduct NameCZ 75 Compact – 9mm (low capacity) Sku01190 Firearm TypeHandgun PurposeConcealed Carry MSRP$581.00 Chambering9mm Luger Magazine Capacity10 Magazine TypeDouble Stack FrameSteel GripsPlastic Trigger MechDA/SA SightsFixed BarrelCold Hammer Forged Barrel Length3.8 in Weight2.03 lbs Overall Length7.24 in Height5.03 in Width1.38 in SafetyManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety Product NameCZ 75 Compact – 9mm Sku91190 Firearm TypeHandgun PurposeConcealed Carry MSRP$544.00 Chambering9mm Luger Magazine Capacity14 Magazine TypeDouble Stack FrameSteel GripsPlastic Trigger MechDA/SA SightsFixed BarrelCold Hammer Forged Barrel Length3.8 in Weight2.03 lbs Overall Length7.24 in Height5.03 in Width1.38 in SafetyManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety Product NameCZ 75 Compact – 9mm (low capacity) Sku01190 Firearm TypeHandgun PurposeConcealed Carry MSRP$581.00 Chambering9mm Luger Magazine Capacity10 Magazine TypeDouble Stack FrameSteel GripsPlastic Trigger MechDA/SA SightsFixed BarrelCold Hammer Forged Barrel Length3.8 in Weight2.03 lbs Overall Length7.24 in Height5.03 in Width1.38 in SafetyManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety Product NameCZ 75 Compact – 9mm Sku91190 Firearm TypeHandgun PurposeConcealed Carry MSRP$544.00 Chambering9mm Luger Magazine Capacity14 Magazine TypeDouble Stack FrameSteel GripsPlastic Trigger MechDA/SA SightsFixed BarrelCold Hammer Forged Barrel Length3.8 in Weight2.03 lbs Overall Length7.24 in Height5.03 in Width1.38 in SafetyManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

**Copy over from craigslist**
Hello, thanks for checking out my listing. I really hate to see it go, but I've put a deposit down on another bike for sale through a friend of the family, so it's time for me to move on to the next! For sale is my 2006 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 bobber with LOTS of upgrades and modifications.

The bike is in excellent condition. It is fuel injected so no messing with carbs, which I prefer. Maintenance is much easier. It runs like a top, 0 issues mechanically and it is very clean cosmetically. Paint is perfect, completed by a local builder recently. It is ready to get on and ride. As of this posting, it has 28,2xx miles. I ride pretty frequently so it will go up over time. It is a 5 speed manual with heel shifter. This IS a soft tail, it has a full rear suspension so the ride is very comfortable.

The title is clean, clear and in hand ready to transfer.

Over the last 2 years, the bike was basically pulled apart by a local builder and had a lot of work done. I'll try to list everything, but I'm sure I'll miss something. Maintenance is up to date, it needs nothing until Spring, 2016, which will just be an oil change, check tire pressure, etc. Normal maintenance. 

The bike has never been down or dropped, these were modifications I made to suit my taste. I'm a big bobber-style fan so that's the direction I went.

New items include;

Tires (front and back, spring, 2015). It's a 230 rear, largest you can fit to the Vulcan 900.
20"" front wheel was added spring, 2015
Oil change, spring, 2015
La Rosa sea with ghost black flames in fall, 2014
Bobber modifications completed in fall, 2014
-Any needed maintenance was completed during this time while the bike was mostly apart
Custom front fender, fall, 2014
Custom battery tray, fall, 2014
Custom tail light with integrated turn signals, fall, 2014
Paint was completed (matte black) in fall, 2014 (while bike was apart)
Freedom Performance slash cut exhaust, spring, 2014
Battery tender quick detach cable included, already installed.

The bike sounds mean with the slash-cut exhaust, it's a very throaty growl. It's also surprisingly sporty for what was a cruiser bike. I rode sport bikes the prior 10 or so years (moved on to this when my dad bought his first bike so we could ride together). This bike, while not as quick as a super sport, has definitely kept my interest since purchase.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I work 9am - 6pm M-F and I'm on the phone a lot, so if you call and I don't answer, please leave me a voicemail and I'll get back to you. Text and email are both fine as well.

I'll update this post with any additional information if there's anything else I think of.

A high def video walk around of the bike (with engine off and on so you can hear it running) is available on Youtube here;

Test rides are welcome with cash in my hand.

Thank you for your interest!"

Stock is solid though there is a crack on left side forearm in wood. Butt plate had been buffed as was barrel near front sight, rear sight and receiver area. See pics. Also there is a ""G"" on right side of stock, uncles last name started with a ""G""!
Values on GunBroker range from a rough looking/broken rifle for 75.00 up to 850.00 for a nice looking Mod 1904 rifle.
  I can text or email you more pics!!. 350.00."

I'm counting out 50 rounds out into ziplock bags. Remington Golden HP's and Winchester HP's so I'm trying to keep them as separated as I can but when boxes break there are some bags that have both brands. Sorry about the mixture. Also have 1400 round Bucket o Bullets just check my other listings...thanks... 50 rounds per bag. $5.50 per bag meet face to face in Lexington Kmart or Mall area.
Any ammo no matter how shitty is going for $5.99 +tax or better for a 50 (fifty) round box. These either cam out as loose rounds or out of a busted multipack of fifty round boxes. Meaning you may get a solid 50 round box or a ziplock bag with 50 loose rounds in them. First come first serve... I also have 22 shorts if your looking just haven't made a separate add for them. Please stop the hateful messages like I'm some kind of gouger . One day I believe 22 ammo will be like some sort of currency. I do have plenty and am only trying to help just call or email these other guys and ask what they want for them...hell most of them don't even list their price.... If you wanna wait in line early in the morning good luck & go ahead. If you wanna wait till your online ammo supplier gets them back instock good luck & go ahead. I get these when I can even if I can't afford them from gun stores. Most I've ever marked up a multipack was 4 bucks and that was meeting a guy in Georgetown and I live south of Lexington . And for that I get hate mail emailed to me... Get a life...if you don't like it move on or flag it. But don't be a dick cause I'm trying to give anyone the opportunity to have something that is in high demand. I have paid far greater sums of money for ammo when I desperately needed it. And if I was out right now I would still jump at the offer I have listed here before you. I'm not going to respond to unwarranted remarks or replies. I could put everything I have on gunbroker and be done with it. But I believe in buying local and keeping my business local. Why I put up with half of the crap from those few on this website I don't know. But I would hope you all have better things to do besides surf ArmsList for people to talk shit to."

Serial # Indicates this gun was produced in 1924! 

 This one is a little more rare then the others as most were 12 or 16 GA. Condition is above fair. Gun was reblued at some point in its life and whoever polished it got a little over zealous with the buffer as the writing on the barrel is ""washed"" out some...still legible but not a  true professional job. Receiver is freckled on top and right side as pictures show. Left side of receiver is very nice. Action is tight and the bore is in good shape. This would be a great shooter or wall hanger. Chamber Size is 2 3/4. Furniture is very nice with the exception of a small hairline crack under pistol grip near rear screw of trigger guard. LOP is a bit short at around 12 3/4"" so I'm guessing someone of small stature or maybe a youth used the gun. Stock has a round medallion inletted into toeline with initials engraved in it. I'm asking 400 firm for this beauty you could also bring a trade. Look online and you'll see there aren't many 20's out there especially this old and in this shape. If I dont get any hits on here will post on GunBroker for higher price.
