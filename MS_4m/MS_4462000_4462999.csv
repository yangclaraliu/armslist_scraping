Magpul MIAD Gen 5.56 Receivers Black 1.1 Grip Kit
Magpul CTR Carbine Mil-Spec Buttstock - Black
Magpul MOE Handguard Carb IMP/PSTN, Black
Magpul Gen 2 MBUS Rear Flip Sight, Black
Vortex StrikeFire Red Dot Scope SF-BR-AR15

I also have 2 P-MAGs (as well as the stock mag), and this carrying bag for the rifle:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VRVJXK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I have fired only 30 rounds through this rifle after I first got it. Since then, it has been sitting in a safe while not receiving the same attention as my other firearms. It is essentially new in that respect.

Asking $900 for everything though I will entertain lower offers, but do not lowball me. NOT LOOKING TO TRADE.

I would also consider returning the rifle to its ""stock"" state (as shipped from FN) and selling it that way.

This is a one owner rifle I bought it and built it. The weapon has had less than 200 Rounds through it and that is rounding way up , almost all have been match grade except  5 rounds of wolf put through it just to help a friend at the range determine if his issue was his M1A Or his ammo.  Well that is what I can remember for now there is quite possibly even more I will find as I keep digging. So if there are any more questions please feel free to ask anything and everything and I will make sure to do my best to reply in a timely fashion. 
And as always remember it is your responsibility to ensure this is legal in your area! , I Prefer face to face however if it comes to it, Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost! And I will not ship to the obvious places this is not allowed. All accessories and such if shipped will ship direct to you but the rifle will ship only to your local FFL. Again any fees accrued are your responsibility. 

And finally, I am looking to sell, so with that said I am not really looking for trades, however if it is something truly equal in value I am willing to listen to offers, worst I can say is no right, but I am not desperate either and I don’t need the low-ball offers or those who want to trade 12 cheap pawn shop guns and an old pick up for my rifle either as most of you who read this know exactly what I am talking about ….

Walther came up with a really cool design on this gun.  It is Gas Delayed Blowback.  It requires less of a recoil spring and the action is easier to work.  Unlike the PPS, the mag release is in the right place.  

It has a manual safety and shoots very straight.  The #1 front sight is installed, but the #0  and #2 are included.  The tool to change the sights, drift pin driver, takedown tool, gas chamber brush, lock, case and two magazines are all there.  The only thing missing is the bag that the gun was inside of.  I do, however, have the bag the magazine was inside of.  

I'm putting the gun up here for a few days before I put it on Gunbroker.  If you are really and truly interested, drop me a note and we'll arrange a time to meet.  If you are kicking tires, but don't have the money nor anything I am interested in trading for, please don't contact me."

I've only shot the gun at the range at 25 yards, and it shoots spot on with where it's being aimed...very accurate at that distance. Only Federal and Winchester ammo through this barrel. She could use a little cleaning through the barrel and chamber, but otherwise she looks good. Shoots like a dream too...I've never once had it jam, and I've put roughly 300-400 rounds through it.

This gun has a full length 16 inch barrel and the whole gun folds exactly in half to fit in most backpacks. The slide can be locked open by the charging handle when the gun is folded or opened and there is a push button safety located near the trigger guard.

Here's what you get with this sale:

--Sub2000 folding rifle
--Thirteen 31 round magazines made by KCI (Glock only makes 22 rd capacity for .40 cal, hence why I got these). They have never caused my Keltec to misfire and they have always properly fed rounds into the chamber.
--One 10 round Glock brand magazine, and one 15 round Glock brand magazine
--403 rounds of 180 grain Winchester Ranger hollow point ammo

I currently have all of the magazines loaded to capacity (31 rounds each) with the Winchester Ranger hollow point ammo.That is where the 403 rounds are coming from.

Asking $1,200 for everything. Might be a little flexible on price. Just let me know if you're thinking of a different number. Not interested in parting out, unless you just want the magazines, with or without the ammo in them. I won't sell the gun by itself unless the magazines are already sold."

With the Bushnell HOLO sight you'll be on target as soon as you raise your firearm. Sighting through this holographic daytime optic is different than any other type of sight you've experienced; the eye relief is unlimited, and your field of view is as wide as you want it to be. Without projecting light of any kind, an illuminated circle and cross hair reticle seems to float out 50 yd from your muzzle. In a flash you can get a bead on any moving target, and your follow-up shots will come quickly and easily

100% water, fog, & shock proof

Low battery warning and auto shut-off

40 Hour run-time on two 1.5V ""N"" type batteries

Compatible with any firearms with Weaver-type mounts, including shotguns.
Illuminated Ring & Cross Hair Reticle 
The illuminated 1 MOA dot inside the 65 MOA circle and cross hair reticle provides rapid target acquisition. 20 user-selectable brightness levels to ensure visibility of the reticle under any ambient lighting conditions.

This is the model that was made by EOTech for Bushnell, it is basically an EOTech 512 model that lacks the outer guard and takes Type N batteries instead of AA.

Ruger 10/22 with some custom touches. The barrel has been chopped and threaded 1/2-28. A vented shroud was then added and has been pinned and welded to make it permanent. This allows you to use a suppressor without adding much length to the rifle. Stock was sanded down and painted. All metal has been Duracoated. Rear sight dovetail filled with epoxy. All parts are stock except for the Power Custom trigger with overtravel screw and and mag release. Trigger pull is still stock and could certainly use some attention. I would put a BX trigger in if I was keeping it. Picture is with my 6"" long suppressor. It's a nice lightweight, well balanced rifle. Target shows 2 groups of 10 shots each fired at 50 yards with my can attached using CCI Standard Velocity ammo. The brown pasters are about 7/8"". Not awesome, but not bad either considering the trigger. I have other pics I can email.

The magazine for the shotgun has a few rules as far as Virginia law goes. I added that to the bottom of the post

§ 18.2-287.4. Carrying loaded firearms in public areas prohibited; penalty.

It shall be unlawful for any person to carry a loaded (a) semi-automatic center-fire rifle or pistol that expels single or multiple projectiles by action of an explosion of a combustible material and is equipped at the time of the offense with a magazine that will hold more than 20 rounds of ammunition or designed by the manufacturer to accommodate a silencer or equipped with a folding stock or (b) shotgun with a magazine that will hold more than seven rounds of the longest ammunition for which it is chambered on or about his person on any public street, road, alley, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or in any public park or any other place of whatever nature that is open to the public in the Cities of Alexandria, Chesapeake, Fairfax, Falls Church, Newport News, Norfolk, Richmond, or Virginia Beach or in the Counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Henrico, Loudoun, or Prince William. 

The provisions of this section shall not apply to law-enforcement officers, licensed security guards, military personnel in the performance of their lawful duties, or any person having a valid concealed handgun permit or to any person actually engaged in lawful hunting or lawful recreational shooting activities at an established shooting range or shooting contest. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

Very good condition, looks close to new.  I estimate 900-1000 rounds through it, mostly target ammo.  The guide-rod upgrade significantly reduces the felt recoil so that it feels more like a 9mm (and the gun takes less of a pounding).  Crimson Trace Laser is the LG-626.  3.5lb connector is a Lone Wolf.  All very cost-effective upgrades, IMO.

I acquired it about two years ago. In that time I've only put about 150-200 rounds thru it. When I got it it had an issue with the slide stop not keeping the slide back consistantly. I sent it off to smith in New Jersey who specializes in Grendels and he replaced the slide stop. Other than that I've had no problems with it. The magazine is internal and holds 10 rounds. It can be loaded using a standard M-16 stripper clip and this contraption Grendel made, those contraptions are hard to find and I do not have one. It is just as easy to load the rounds manually one at a time. The pistol is from the 80's and other than normal average signs of use there are no major cosmetic or mechanical issues. Please feel free to ask questions or if you'd like more pics. The price is negotiable. Thanks for looking.  Here is the Wikipedia article on it:

Grendel P10 - introduced in 1988, the P10 is a .380 DAO with no levers with rudimentary sights and had a large trigger guard. It also had no detachable magazine and was loaded locking the slide back and feed ten rounds through the open chamber into the spring-loaded grip itself, usually with a stripper clip.

And here is a link to a video on Gunwebsites youtube channel about the Grendel P-10:

After forging, each barrel is Magnetic Particle tested to ensure that it is free of micro­stresses or flaws, resulting in consistency and quality in every barrel shipped from the factory. The bore and chamber are chrome lined to help resist corrosion and provide resistance to heat erosion which greatly improves barrel life and reliable chambering/extraction. The M4 style feed ramps and barrel extension provide consistent feeding and the matte black Manganese Phosphate finish resists external corrosion and oxidation. Currently available in a chambering of 7.62x51 NATO in 16” Rifle Length Gas and 18” Rifle Length gas systems. These barrels are ""production"" barrels sold by FN to manufacters. As such they do not bear the FN or FN America Logos. The barrels are packaged in a sealed poly bag with cosmoline. Those familiar with these will immediately recognize the bag and distictive type style on the barrels themselves which will aid you in verifying their authenticity. Where did you get them?- We frequently buy production left overs and over runs from manufacturers across the nation that have their barrels manufactured by FN NO LOCAL PICK UP'S, FREE SHIPPING."

After forging, each barrel is Magnetic Particle tested to ensure that it is free of micro­stresses or flaws, resulting in consistency and quality in every barrel shipped from the factory. The bore and chamber are chrome lined to help resist corrosion and provide resistance to heat erosion which greatly improves barrel life and reliable chambering/extraction. The M4 style feed ramps and barrel extension provide consistent feeding and the matte black Manganese Phosphate finish resists external corrosion and oxidation. Currently available in a chambering of 7.62x51 NATO in 16” Rifle Length Gas and 18” Rifle Length gas systems. 

These barrels are ""production"" barrels sold by FN to manufacters. As such they do not bear the FN or FN America Logos. The barrels are packaged in a sealed poly bag with cosmoline. Those familiar with these will immediately recognize the bag and distictive type style on the barrels themselves which will aid you in verifying their authenticity. 

Where did you get them?- We frequently buy production left overs and over runs from manufacturers across the nation that use FN as their barrel provider."

Has not been rearsenaled or molested, came out of a major collectors stash of goodies. I would rate the condition of the rifle as nra-excellent. Was imported by interordinance. I do not believe the rifle ever saw use and came from one of the few unissued batches that made it into the states but cannot confirm that. I've cleaned it up pretty well as it had a good amount of cosmoline in it still. I'd say I've gotten about 95% of it off the rifle, even sweated the cosmo out of the wood stock a couple times. I have fired a couple rounds thru it just to make sure it works and it performed flawlessly. It has the ported flashhider/muzzlebrake, not all of them got the ported version so it is functional. Has the rifle gernade launching system and ladder sight that can be activated if desired or just left alone, or removed if one desired although I don't really see a reason too. The bore of the rifle Is in very nice condition, does not look like corrosive ammo was ever fired thru it. Included is an sks maintenence kit in a trapdoor in the buttstock,  chinese sks sling dated 1968, cleaning rod, 20 circle 31 stripper clips, has the folding bayonet,  has a set of night sights as well as normal ones although they probably are dim by now. Also have about 210 rounds of norinco hollow tips, and tula and wolf fmjs that will come with it. That's all I can think of atm if I remember anything else I will update. These yugo sks are among the most durable and heavily built and accurate of all the sks period. In beautiful shape for a 45 year old rifle and functions just as well. Price includes ammo and all accessories"

I acquired this gun from a neighbor whose husband owned it. She sold it to me in a lot of pistols when he passed and knew nothing about it herself. I've researched quite a bit and found very little. All of the markings are wrong, I edited the photos to try to get the markings to show up a bit better. The top of the barrel is stamped ""Made in USA"". I'm pretty sure it wasn't. Who knows what it's made from. Could be part of Railroad track for all I know. The caliber is unknown to me. Possibly .38 S&W? Just a guess. I'd never fire the thing personally. I'd advise strongly against anyone firing it actually. It has fooled many people who said they knew a thing or two about webleys. It's a good copy, until you start to really look at it. For folks who collect this type of thing, it's a wonderful piece I believe. I have no use for it, and would love to see it go to home that appreciated it. Price is negotiable.

Gun fires and functions fine. I just bought it at the wrong time. Or should I say. Parts for a build came in way earlier than expected and need the cash mostly.
