Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.Easy to ConcealWhether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.Personal Protection Made EasyThe Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Easy to Use and MaintainThe Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.Adjustable 3-dot SightsSights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex-wrench and your fingers, allowing you to always be on target without the assistance of a gunsmith.Advanced CoatingDurable, low-shine coating ensures years of trouble-free use.Serialized ChassisThe modular chassis is the serialized part of the gun, allowing the user to swap frames for new colors and options that can be purchased online or at one of our dealers.Snag-free designWhen instants matter, the smooth, snag-free design of the Nano ensures a quick and efficient draw.Polymer FrameAvailable in different colors and with different options, including laser sights. Simply remove the existing frame from the serialized chassis and replace it with the one of your choice.Striker DeactivatorAdditional safety feature.

Feature nice case colors with lots of swirl, and beautiful wood that shines! The rear sight is that neat carbine ladder sight so many look for. It is in a nice common caliber, and I will include 2 boxes of brass cased reloadable ammo too!

These are so smooth, with special features found on few other guns. Like the sliding dust cover on top of the action, and the clever little latch that keeps the lever closed while stored or traveling.

Cimarron is only the importer, Uberti is the manufacturer. But, in this model, Cimarron patented a unique mag spring and follower that allows 10 cartridges into the magazine, where the regualr Uberti models only hold 8. This according to an online article. This gun has never been loaded with a single cartridge. Current retail of these is around $1200!

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ TechnologyIt allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Size & FeaturesWith an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols.  It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

The bbls. “ring” like bells, & the bores are mirror-bright & reveal several very small “ripples” toward the forward aspect of the right bbl. caused by minor exterior “pin prick” type dings (note: NOT dents affecting safety or performance).  And there is no damage caused by some fool feeding this old girl steel shot.    

The lever sits fully to right of center; there is no looseness & tight lockup.  A function check w/snap caps reveals it has tight springs & operates perfectly with firm hammer releases.  The safety works as its supposed to, & automatically moves back to “Safe” when recocking.

The result is a highly accurate shooter.The barrel length is 18¼”, overall length is 36¼” and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22.

This is meant to fit medium sized ESAPI plates.  Plate carriers are sized to your plates, not body type.  As a general rule, you want to wear plates just big enough to cover your vitals.  Typically that's about 1-2 ""sizes"" down from your shirt size.  If you wear XL, then you want medium plates.  If you wear L, then you want either medium or possibly small plates , ect.   Not always the case, but generally true if you have a ""normal"" body size.


Does not come with any of the patches, plates/armor, pouches, hydration carrier, ect.

This is brand new and never worn in a class or even out to the shooting range.  Bought this as a backup, had it setup and fitted and sat in a closet.   Has Kangaroo pouch that I have outfitted with a 3 mag insert panel.  The side cummerbund has built in radio pouch that could also be used to house additional magazines and pocket for side armor plates.  

Asking $300 for the plate carrier.  Add $25 if you want the 3 mag kangaroo pouch insert.

The M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces.

These bullets are engineered to penetrate between 2"" and 3"" before expansion begins. Then the expansion process fragments the bullets. Shedding 40% to 85% of their weight as shrapnel into surrounding tissue and organs results in a devastating wound cavity. Because the vast majority of the bullet's energy is expended inside the target animal, quick and humane kills are ensured. These rounds are made with Winchester brass, match-grade primers and new powders that are not affected by temperatures and altitude. Premium components result in consistent performance and match-grade accuracy. Per 20."

HK branded ones can go for well over 3k, and even the cheaper clones made on parts kits run around 1k. In the 80's and 90's Springfield wanted to expand their selection without the effort of designing a new gun, so they struck a deal with HK to resale their HK 91 firearms in the US. These were all new parts, made in an HK factory by HK technicians. After the import ban in 89, they had the new parts shipped in, and assembled on a US made receiver in the Springfield Armory shop.
Arguably the best thing about these rifles, other than being as close to an HK as a clone gets, is that they SA lifetime warranty follows them! If you ever manage to kill it they will replace it with their equivalent model, the M1A1!
This one has a low round count, 6 all steel German made 20 round mags and 3 super hard to find steel 30 round mags, that go for around $80 a piece in surplus condition.

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $225 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Arkansas, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Florida and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at REDACTED to inquire about my services."

AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F).  VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market  The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope.  All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual. Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell. Flat rate shipping for $25 for all firearms. For more info call REDACTED.

AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope.  All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual. Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell. Flat rate shipping for $25 for all firearms. For more info call REDACTED.
