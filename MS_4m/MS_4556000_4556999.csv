Due to a job change, with great regret, I have to sell my beloved Windham Weaponry WW-15 SRC 7.62x39.

OK, on to the good stuff. This rifle is only 5 weeks old with approx 400 rounds down the pipe. With the EOTech 512 red dot, I can consistently hit steel at 300 yards easily. It eats cheap, steel Tula ammo. Much, much cheaper to shoot than 5.56 and hits much harder.

The following is a list of everything with retail pricing. I provide this to show you how much of a good deal my offer is and the amount of money you would save as opposed to building it yourself.

The base rifle as stock is approx $850 new.

This rifle has a whole host of upgrades/accessories as follows:

EOTech 512.A65 Halographic Sight - $425
EOTech G33 3x Magnifier - $550
Streamlight TRL4 Laser/Tac Light Combo - $200
VLTOR EMOD MilSpec Buttstock w/Buffer Tube - $189
Drago 2 Rifle Case w/ Backpack Straps - $80
LWRC Single Point QD Sling Mount - $60
Rifle Cleaning Kit - $20
Vertical Fore Grip with Bipod - $50
Magpul MOE Grip - $20
2 Single Point Slings - $100
Streamlight Pressure Switch - $25
Flip-Up Backup Sights - $100
Quad Picatinny Rail - $100

-------------------------------------------
TOTAL Invested - $2,769 retail

Included are the original parts from the rifle left over from upgrades.

I am asking $1,600 cash for complete package or $1,300 without the EOTech G33 Magnifier. Will still include the EOTech halographic red dot though

I may consider partial trades with cash. Make me a reasonable offer and let's discuss.

With this package, you will save over $1,000 in parts and taxes. My loss....your gain!

Will need valid Arizona drivers license and sign a bill of sale.

Call or text me at REDACTED to discuss and arrange a meeting."

92FS Vertec Inox: 
Specialized Combat Pistol
The Beretta 92FS Vertec Inox combines the benefits of the thinner vertical Vertec grip with some premium tactical and combat features found in other members of the 92 (M9) family. The sights are dovetail-mounted and easily replaceable by the user, the barrel is flush with the slide for a compact profile, and the Picatinny rail extending forward of the trigger guard makes this pistol ready for a variety of tactical accessories. In addition, the stainless steel finish makes the 92FS Vertec Inox particularly impervious to sweat, holster-wear, powder residues and corrosion, giving the user a virtual lifetime of trouble-free use.
Thin, Vertical Grip
The Vertec-style vertical grip of the 92FS Vertec Inox offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying this model concealed.
Dovetail-Mounted Sights, Easy Accessorization
Let’s face it: combat professionald and tactical-shooting aficionados often have strong personal preferences. This is why we consider it important to offer them not only several tactical-pistol variants that are ready to go out of the box, but also easy customization and accessorization options within a single model. For instance, the 92FS Vertec Inox features dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights, so that users who may prefer a different sight picture, material or configuration can easily replace the factory sights with after-market accessories. Also, this pistol sports a built-in Picatinny rail that can be outfitted with different combat and tactical accessories, such as lights, lasers and more.
Flush Cold-Hammer Forged Barrel for Superior Reliability
The cold-hammer forged barrel of the 92FS Vertec Inox is flush with the slide, which greatly minimizes the possiblity of it coming into contact with anything that may touch the crown. This, coupled with the inherent durability of every 92 model and the elegant ruggedness of the Inox (stainless steel) finish, makes the 92FS Vertec Inox a partner that will keep delivering accuracy and reliability for decades and tens of thousands of rounds

I can speak for that description with this Beretta. This is a great pistol. Only 100 rounds of 9MM cycled through it. In very nice condition. Comes with factory box and two mags. This model is hard to come by compared to most of the other 92 series pistols."

I'm selling my Sig Sauer P226 MK25 Navy Seal edition 9mm. After being on the fence about selling it, and after a long time of telling myself not too, cause I enjoy it so much, I've gotten move on to new endeavors. I purchased it in September 2014. I have no kept count on rounds but less than 500rds have gone through it, it has been reliable with all type of rounds. For training I put spent cases randomly into my magazine to cause it to malfunction and to practice clearing. The spent cases would feed even without a bullet on the end of it, and the slide would shut. I've only cleaned it with Frog Lube since day one, while heating up the metal as recommended by Frog Lube to clean and lube the gun for the first time, the adhesive on the sticker on the left side of the frame started to come off due to the heat. While in use QR half of the sticker came off but the rest of it is still there. Other than that, its in a great condition. The difference between the MK25 and the standard model is, it has a corrosion resistant coating on it for salt water operations, comes with Sig Night sights, a standard 1913 rail instead of the Sig pattern rail and has Navy Anchor on it. This is a awesome gun and everyone who shoots it loves it. Comes with original case and everything it originally came with excluding the stock magazines.

Extras that are included, will not seperate. I added the price I paid just for reference:
-Wolff Hammer Spring 17lb, 18lb, 19lbs (Currently installed), and OE Sig 21lb spring (Wolffs springs are $4 a piece excluding shipping)
-Sig E2 Enhanced Grip set (Includes, grip removal tool and OE Grip and hardware. $47 +Shipping)
-Sig Short Trigger, the part you put your finger on, ($31 + shipping from Brownells)
-Sig Short Reset trigger kit, ($50 + shipping)
-G-Code SOC RTI Holster & RTI Belt side fits 1.5in belt, Black( $139 exluding shipping and waited 3 months)
-5x Mec-Gar (best mags if you look on line) flush fitting 18rd Anti-Friction Magazines, I sold the 3 factory 15rd ones after I got theses.  ($25 a piece/$125 total)

The price is for meeting up in Vancouver, WA. Please dont offer me $500 and want me to meet you in Seattle and want me to cover the FFL BG check or shipping. The price is OBO but don't get too crazy. I've also included a list for trade, I'm only looking for what is listed, nothing else, please don't offer me Hi-point. If you would like more information or pictures

The HK factory Camouflage soft case alone is now selling for over $300 on Gunbroker. 

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. 

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. 

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. 

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. 

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!"

658,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4556658,For Sale/Trade:  2007 FZ1-s 1000cc Motorcycle,"Auburn, Montgomery, Alabama","$ 6,300","Listed On: Sunday, August 9, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a 2007 Yamaha FZ1-S for sale in Auburn. Text REDACTED for questions/to see the bike. No spam please. Details and Description below:

*Low insurance, Comfortable riding position, R1 engine with upgrades, Low miles
*Over $1,000 in high-end riding gear AND right at $1,500 in accessories/upgrades.

I bought this bike to be able to use motorcycle parking in Auburn for class during the summer semester. It do not drive it now so it is someone else's turn to enjoy it now for $6,300.00. This price includes a ton of extras and some very high quality accessories including Joe Rocket gear and a pair of matching Shoei helmets. I have the clean title and all it needs is a new owner. I just graduated as a teacher and need to sell the bike for family-oriented reasons. Bike was previously owned by a Jet Pilot for the US Air Force (very well taken care of and he is who did/had done all of the aftermarket stuff). I have taken good care of it as well with only Premium gasoline, high quality detailers, and non-aggressive driving. No track time or anything like that. Just a roll on the throttle every once in a while (because you just have to...). This bike has never been laid down or wrecked in any way. It cranks right up and will take you as long as you want to go very comfortably (more comfortable than my V star) and is really fast. It gets good gas mileage and has a digital gas gauge. The tires are in good shape (highest quality of tires you can buy Michelin Pilot)

INSURANCE ON THIS BIKE IS NOT EXPENSIVE. This is because it is considered a ""Sports Touring"" which means it is just as fast as a sports bike (or faster) and you do not have to lean uncomfortably or pay high insurance. You are basically buying a Yamaha R1 with aftermarket parts that is much more comfortable and cheaper to ride. The seating is similar to riding a dirtbike, but you can lean if you wish. Please don't ask silly questions like how fast does it go, I have no idea. I used it for parking about 4 miles from my home. I drove it 200 miles back from where I purchased it and that was the longest trip I have been on it, everything else has been in town. These bikes are meant to have a ton of miles on them and to be ridden for long distance thus accumulating a lot of miles. It is rare to find one of these without very high miles. This is your chance, this one has just under 13,700 (not even broken-in yet).

Kelly Blue Book has this motorcycle for cheaper than I am asking. KBB also does not allow you to adjust price for mileage and assumes by the year and the type of this bike that it has 40,000 miles on it. That should tell you something as far as how low the miles are. KBB also does not let you add on accessories on motorcycles or account for the gear it comes with. This bike is worth way more than what I am asking, especially considering what it comes with. SO please, don't waste my time with silly offers. Make a cash offer if you like, but I will probably keep all of the riding equipment that goes with the bike (over $1000 worth) unless it is very close to what I am asking. You may look online and this bike is priced right in there with those who have 20,000 miles and come with no aftermarket upgrades and no gear. This is a steal.

This bike has all the right accessories:
1. Two Brothers Racing Carbon Fiber Exhaust (great deep sound)
2. Tuned Gears to give it amazing mid-range power (this is not a beginner bike, Very Fast)
3. Zero-Gravity Windshield (you feel no air resistance)
4. Top Sellerie Gel Seat ($700 ordered from France, yes it is amazing)
5. Integrated Turn Signal Brake Lights (so you can remove the tag holder with blinkers)
6. K&N Intake & Filter
7. Ryder Clips Shift Sock (protects your shoes from shifting)
8. Spare Key (never been used)

It will also come with: (If you pay my asking price or we negotiate it in somehow)
1. (1) XL Shoei RF-800 Silver Helmet with new ""light smoked"" visor and a clear visor.
2. (1) L (matching) Shoei RF-800 Silver Helmet with clear visor.
3. Pair of XL Joe Rocket Riding Gloves
4. (1) XL Joe Rocket Atomic Motorcycle Jacket (with armor, like-new, very nice)
5. (1) XL Joe Rocket Riding Pants

Why I am selling:
I bought the bike to be able to park in Auburn easier than I would on my Yamaha V-Star 1100. I wanted a cool bike that was fun and comfortable ride and was light and easy to turn in downtown. My wife prefers to ride on the cruiser with me and I am now finished with college and have no time to ride, thus I do not need 2 motorcycles.

*To see the bike, contact me by my cell at REDACTED (leave a message and I will call you back) or text me. I prefer text due to spam, but if you email I should get it.

*You will need to put cash in my hand before you test drive the bike.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed and its sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hex-wrench and your fingers."

Not a scratch or scuff on it. Just bought it a few months ago,Just got Divorce and going through some Financial Crises and need funds to take care of bills cus am behind them already, The trigger is AMAZING and is even better than my Ed Brown. Absolutely no creep, crisp break at about 3.5 pounds. The Pistol is also super accurate and handles recoil surprisingly well. I fired 8 mags through this for a total of 64 rounds with ZERO failures of any kind. I used both hollow point and ball ammo with great success. The custom ZEBRAWOOD marshall star grips by Sarge you see on the gun will come in addition to the VZ original grips also packed with the box which will also come with all original components including the 2 checkmate magazines. The holster that comes with the gun is probably the most comfortable and concealable holster you can buy. It is made by garret leather and it is a super thin kydex with leather hybrid. It looks nice and performs better.THIS WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW FOR FULL PRICE - IT IS NOT A BLEM. IT IS A PERFECT DAN WESSON 1911.THESE GRIPS ON THE GUN ARE VERY SPECIAL. The star is INLAYD into the grip and does not stand out from the surface and is covered by coating so you can see it but aren't actually touching the star when you hold the gun. It is amazing craftsmanship. You have to see it to understand it and appreciate it.THIS IS NOT A BLEM. IT IS A BRAND NEW GUN ONLY FIRED 80 TIMES. Thanks

Here is a special edition piece from Beretta, that comes close to the 92SB form most of us met 30 some odd years ago. This is the 92FS Trident Variant. The word Trident is nowhere stamped on the pistol itself; that word refers to the grips. It is identical to current production factory number JS92F300M with three exceptions. First, it is US Made. Second, it has walnut grips. Third, we are furnishing it with a total of two new top quality Italian made Act-Mag 17 shot magazines instead of the issue 10 rounders that we have a ready market for with our restrictive state shoppers. Manufacturer and warrantor is Beretta USA of Accokeek, Maryland; soon to be produced in Gallatin, TN. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and working parts fitted into a 7075 lightweight alloy frame. Finish is non glare weather resistant Brunitron. Grip panels are semi gloss finish American Walnut, with lower panel cut checkering and nickel plated Beretta Trident inlay Medallion. Slide is Government length, 1.15 inches thick, with rear lateral serrations, ambidextrous decocking safety levers, and internal firing pin safety. Barrel is 5 inch Government size, six groove rifling with 1:9.84 twist rate. Sights are slide integral dot front with dovetailed center dot rear. Chambering, of course, is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, 9mm NATO, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Each Trident comes with a total of two new Act-Mag 17 round magazines, so 18 round fully loaded capacity. Safety system consists of an internal firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped, together with a slide mounted ambidextrous main safety that functions as a decocker. Trigger is .340 smooth faced combat, 10 pound vicinity with 1 1/8 inch travel on double action, and two stage 4 pound vicinity on single action with negligible felt creep. Extreme overall length is 8 5/8 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut. Grip frame is serrated fore and aft, 1.03 thick and tapering to .73 at the front of the frame. Trigger guard is type two serrated face. Weight empty is 33.8 ounces, about 40 ounces loaded, with center of gravity at the breech face. Each Trident comes in its plastic factory case, outer cardboard sleeve, with cloth pouch cleaning kit, protective papers, trident box reinforcement cup, factory cable lock, Massachusetts flyer, and Instruction manual that contains warranty statement and factory registration section. Replacement pricing on beretta com for its plain black 16 shot mate is $675. For a limited time, however, we’re offering the 92FS Trident in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for $ 519.00. California and Massachusetts shoppers must make sure your transfer dealer is willing to process before offering to buy. This pistol is transferable in all jurisdictions of the United States because it is a 92FS; neither California nor Massachusetts rosters require a manufacturer’s part number. For any civilian buyers in California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Chicago Cook County IL, Hawaii, Maryland, or New York, we will be glad to sub two new Mec-Gar 10 shot 92 magazines for the two 17 rounders.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

The barrel alone sells for $125, the LW compensator sells for $60, and the flash suppressor sells for $20. After shipping, this would run around $200+.  I'll sell the entire set for $70,firm.
 Lone Wolf makes very popular,high-quality after-market Glock barrels, that can safely use plain lead bullets, unlike the factory barrel with the polygonal rifling. This barrel is also often used used to convert the .40 G22 to fire 9mm rounds.

G17 9mm threaded 1/2 x 28 tpi
   Special features include: 
 -Ready to use, pre-fit drop in
 -No gunsmithing required
 -Precision machined from heat treated 416R stainless forgings, black oxide finish
 -Oversized lock-up area produces greater shot-to-shot accuracy 
 -Tighter dimensions than the original
 -Polished feed ramp and bore, diamond turned exterior 
 -Maximum chamber support, improved feed ramp design
 -Match grade broach cut rifling and target crown
 -Ok to use lead, plated or jacketed bullets
 Lifetime warranty

Here's the info on the compensator:
 ""The Lone Wolf compensators offers a unique advantage to the discriminating competitive shooter. This exceptional performance is accomplished in 2 simultaneous steps. First, the redirection of gas to a 30 degree rearward angle actually pulls the barrel forward, reducing felt recoil. Second, the redirection of gas vertically provides a genuine reduction in muzzle rise. The result allows the shooters sights to remain on target or realigned quickly providing faster accurate follow up shots. Lone Wolf Distributors provides a quality engineered light weight system that delivers maximum performance at 1/2 the cost of similar compensators.""

( I didn't have a photo of just the barrel and compensators, so I'm using this one, but this is an actual photo of them. BTW, this has been installed in a pistol, but is either un-fired, or had less than 10 rounds through it.)"
