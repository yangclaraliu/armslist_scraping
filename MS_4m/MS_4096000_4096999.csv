Stainless steel semi-auto handguns are now common, even passe'. But this fact of life in the '90's would never have come to be had it not been for a small, now defunct company which dared to show the rest of the firearms industry the pathway to the future. Randall Firearms Company of Sun Valley, California, U.S.A., made it all happen with a line of high-quality Model 1911 derivatives.
Although Randall pistols were manufactured from only June 7, 1983 to May 15, 1985, they ushered-in an entirely new era for handguns, thus carving for themselves a place in the history of firearms around the world. This historic niche, coupled with the fact that Randall pistols are exemplary specimens of their genre, has made every single one of the 9,968 Randall pistols eminently collectible.
Among Randall's many trend-setting innovations were two of the most significant breakthroughs in the 1911 field since John Moses Browning designed that form of semi-auto in the first place. One of these breakthroughs came when Randall made the very first production pistol of its kind in stainless steel.
It actually all began with a small company called KEN-AIR, Inc., which had been in the aircraft instrument repair business in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County [in the State of California, USA] since the mid-1950's. Then, in 1981 the company entered into a diversification program which ultimately led to the Randall pistol.
Except for some minor changes necessitated in manufacturing, the Randall pistols were much unchanged from the traditional Browning design. However, because every part except for the grips was made of aircraft quality stainless steel, this really was a new gun, and quickly became known as ""The Only Stainless Steel Auto Fit For Duty

The Huldra Mark IV Tactical EVO features the Samson Evolution Series Free Float forearm that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block. Two accessory rails come standard with the rifle and can be reconfigured easily to adapt the hand guard to your needs and can also be mounted at 45 degree offsets. The ergonomics of this rail set a new standard. The anti-rotational tabs make this handguard all the more impressive by virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail losing alignment even under hard use. And the QD sling mount that is included just makes this package that much more outstanding. 

The Adams Arms piston system is one piece and is accessible from the front of the piston block. Iron sight optics (not included) are designed to be affixed to the sturdy piston block which is attached to the barrel, as opposed to attaching front sights to our competitor's inherently flexible rails that have to be frequently removed and reattached. The Adams Arms patented piston system will run cleaner, cooler, and longer. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them incredibly hard. 

The Magpul CTR butt stock is designed for light, fast action. The CTR features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and an ambidextrous QD sling mount. A standard rubber butt pad provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage, even with body armor or modular gear. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. 

The Melonited corrosive resistant Chrome/Molly/Vanadium 41/50 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receiver is machined from high quality mil-spec 70/75-T6 aluminum forgings and hard coat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 70/75-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed Chevrons for improved control. 

What really sets this rifle apart is the size of the barrel. It is 14.5 inches. We have permanently affixed an elongated flash hider to give you the benefits of a shorter barrel, without the expense and hassle of obtaining an ATF tax stamp. Not only that, our flash hider is “reduced radius”, allowing a gunsmith or armorer to remove the piston block for servicing the weapon. The elongated, reduced radius, permanently attached muzzle device gives you the legally required overall barrel length.

It also accepts stripper clips!

Comes with 3 30 round mags, original sling, and cleaning kit 
I also will include the following which I purchased extra : 1. the ""correct"" centered muzzle brake, unlike the regular AK style which is shipped by century and is not right for
The gun which cost me $30, 2. A ""cheek rest"" riser bar for the folding stock which I orderd from apex for $35, 3. A bayonet with scabbard in previously issued condition which I ordered for $25, and 4. 10 stripper clips.

I also took apart the side folder and serviced it, to take care of the characteristic ""gritty folder"" issue common with these models from century.

These are great guns for a great price and hard to find right now. All the usual suspects have been out of stock for quite a while.

This is the only known example of the rare and elusive ASP, made by Paris Theodore of Seven Trees Mfg., that is fully and beautifully engraved. From what little info I could research of these, the actual conversion work was performed by the late, great George Nonte. It is in EX condition, and the custom Lexan grips, are intact and not cracked. I cannot attest to this being, ""unfired"" and as it came from an Estate sale, it's being represented as ""used, like new condition"". It comes with 1 original factory conversion ASP magazine, and I have a few extra full-size S&W 39 mags and an aftermarket one. I've not fired this pistol"

This Super Charged 308 Win. load was designed to be the affordable “do all” 308 Win. load for North American big game. The bullet is not a “premium” type bullet, but is a Sierra 180gr. Spitzer-FB bullet of common cup and core construction. At impact velocities of 2750 fps and under, it mushrooms beautifully and does not break up, even on big shoulder bones. I have used this bullet for over ten years in my 30-06 rifles and have found the bullet to be a perfect terminal performer on big game and after shooting numerous black bears with it, at all angles, I have never recovered one bullet. I referenced this particular bullet in our “technical article” titled “Understanding Bonded Bullets—Dispelling the Myth”. If you are going to shoot AK/Yukon moose with this load, be sure to stick with “double lung” broadside or CNS (central nervous system) shots. If you must shoot very large game at bad angles with the 308 Win., use our Item 39B instead.

Note our real world velocity, shot from a real world rifle. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocity readings.

Known as the ""cadillac of semi auto ak style shotguns""

This thing is a beast. Beefy, user friendly features like magwell and AR style ""straight in"" type magazines. Bolt hold open. Bolt release finger switch. Extended safety lever. Reliable. Adjustable RPK type rear sights. Dead balls accurate. Awesome tubular metal folding buttstock which actually folds. Picatinny railed hinged dust cover.  

$900 will get u the gun and 1 factory 5 round mag. I also dropped in a tapco g2 trigger and the improved trigger spring. Also polished up the bolt carrier real nice. I also drilled in a magpul moe picatinny rail to the lower handgaurd so u can slap ure favorite foregrip on there without having to buy a $150 qaud rail. It doesn't like ""super lite target load"" but shoots most anything with no hiccups.  A lot of places advertise this gun as ""shoots anything right out of the box"" but it's just not true. Read the forums. I had do do some work to get this gun as smooth as it is, so I'm just bieng honest with the community here. I have plenty of ammo for sale if you want to add that on as well.


If you want extras, the 8 round factory mag will go for $90. Look around these things are hard to get and not cheap, there's a reason why people buy them instead of the $40 after markets. 

I also have installed a Carolina Shooter Supply Gk-01 style muzzle brake with the locking nut. $100 extra which is also a good deal.

I have plenty of time and patience to sell this to the right buyer. Don't waste time with ridiculous offers please. If you want the ultimate range toy, then get your hands on this ;)

Go play in traffic
Dive d**k first into a snake-infested hole
Drink gasoline and hold bets with your closest friends to see how many lit matches you can swallow (be sure to stand very close to them so you can clean up society even more with one go-around).

If you are guilty of this, just know that you are a special kind of stupid, who feed off the rest of us gun-toting 2nd Amendment supporters who are simply trying to live our lives and do what we love. Shame on you, I hope one day you pick up the hobby of reloading and skip the instruction booklet. You will get what is coming to you, karma is a b**ch. 

If you are like me and are willing to sell your ammo at the price you paid for it or even cheaper, I applaud you. I don't sell my ammo often, but if I see an older man searching for .22LR for the sake of making memories with his grandkids, I am always happy to help out (I am fortunate enough to have those memories with my grandpa and it's a shame that kids these days can't experience that). DO NOT BUY FROM PEOPLE WHO PRICE GOUGE!!! Do not support them, let them get so tired of an empty inbox that they either pull their post or finally lower their price to a reasonable amount. If you are truly in desparate need of a little ammo, I will help you out. I do not have a lot, but I am willing to provide someone with a little bit at the price I paid and I might even do a little trading with you for other types of ammo or various firearm-related products. Have a blessed day."

It also means that the cartridge base is grabbed by the claw as it leaves the magazine so it enters the chamber straight, in line. And don't forget that the cartridge feed lips are machined as part of the receiver for improved reliability in feeding. The classic Three-Position Safety offers both on safe and fire positions, plus a middle position that locks the firing pin yet still allows the bolt to be operated, providing a greater margin of safety when checking the chamber condition or unloading.

I purchased it new and I have never fired it. The action was cycled a few times so there is a faint ring around the cylinder. This does not have any type of lock. There is one small blemish around a screw hole on the right side, top. 

When I bought this gun the dealer had a laser that screwed onto the side plate. I didn't want the laser so he took it off. Apparently he used a tool too big or slipped or whatever but it jacked up the black around the hole a bit. I would imagine some alumablack would make it less noticeable but it isn't very noticeable as is. Orange paint applied to front sight ramp, can be removed if you prefer.

-Comes in Original Box With 2 13round mags

This is a Brand New Pistol- Built and never fired. I put it together last fall and then never ended up carrying it or shooting it. This is a glock factory 21C (Compensated) upper receiver. Fitted to a Glock factory 21SF OD Green frame. It is not painted, it has not been altered with any aftermarket parts or accessories- other then some custom talon grip tape. If you don't want the grip tape on the gun, I can easily remove it or tell you how. (If you've never shot with the talon grips, you might want to try it before taking it off.)

This gun is the result of my desire for the benefit of the short slim frame for better fit paired with the reduced low recoil of the compensated barrel. This is a one-of-a-kind Glock.

I prefer local sale but I will ship to FFL if you pay shipping. I'm asking what I have invested into the gun, which I believe to be a fair at $650. Contact me at 4O5-Two46-549I

Just sold my last .40 gun this morning unexpectedly and I have 250rds of flat nose fmj 180gr and one new box of ATOMIC +P .40 bonded MATCH hollowpoints. The ballistics and energy from these is that of a standard 10mm!!!! I run ATOMIC in my 9mm and .45 and its great stuff always feeds and doesnt add much more recoil for the more than 20% extra power 

I just need 110$ for all of it plus shipping The atomic ammo is 40$ a box and the rest is 17$ & 18$ so save some money and get some great stuff and help a fellow NRA member out! instead of some rip off online store!
