This is a custom rifle, in addition to the custom stock and custom 550 paracord sling, I have modified the bolt slightly so that the included 10 round Tapco detachable magazine can be removed from the rifle even when the bolt it closed.(Which normally is not possible)
Feel free to e-mail me to see additional pics or if you have any questions and I will do my best to answer them as quickly as possible. Thanks for looking!"

Any firearm you own that you did a 4473 form on can be tracked to you. The liberal Dem's that control Oregon want nothing more than for your guns to be removed from your ownership. Universal Background Check (UBC) has nothing to do with preventing crime! It's all about creating a list. Read your pre-Obama history books!

H&K/Walther did a great job with this .22LR. Awesome for practice shooting outside or for teaching people how to fire a rifle. Perfect first gun to learn to shoot with. Still have adjustable front sights as well. Added an aftermarket foregrip and red dot sight. Bought the H&K compensator (mostly for looks lol) Has a fully adjustable stock. 

Item No. 2245200 (20 rd.)
Item No. 2245210 (10 rd.)

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. 

The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 rifle is $559.

Operation:

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

From Brownells:

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. 

NOTE:  SOME OF THESE HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE ROUND LOADED, SOME OF THEM HAVE.  THEY ARE IN THE SAME CONDITION AS THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE DELIVERED TO ME FROM BROWNELLS EXCEPT FOR BEING NUMBERED.  RETAIL PRICE ON BROWNELLS IS CURRENTLY $9.99/EACH."

Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished.

Original Polish PPS-43C in a semi-auto version.  7.62x25 caliber, considered a pistol due to overall length.  Comes with two 35 round mags.  The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army.  The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG).  The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42.  The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43.  This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946).  The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."

The RO Champion® brings the precision of a competition pistol in a shortened and lighter-recoiling configuration.

The RO Champion® is topped with a fiber optic front sight and a low-profile combat rear sight, so you have maximum visibility in any situation. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. The beaver tail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing, along with a lightweight aluminum frame add to the list of RO Champion™ features. A fully supported ramped hammer forged barrel allows for no worries for premature wear that would be of concern from alloy frames. The barrels feed ramps are bullet to barrel not bullet to alloy. The Range Officer® Champion™ adds up to a versatile pistol that is great for an everyday carry or home defense pistol.

Come with 2 mags, internal locking system (ILS), hard case, holster, double magazine holder, and original paper work.

Used Excellent condition and fired 200 rounds. Package as-new in box. Includes 9mm and .357 SIG conversion barrels. YES! This is a multiple caliber pistol that shoots 9mm, 40 cal and .357 SIG. The standard 14 round 40 cal magazines work with all three calibers. Includes everything in photos: Original box accessories & papers, five 14 round magazines, one 10 round magazine, pistol belt, one belt holster, one paddle holster. two double mag pouches and inert training barrel. This FNP pistol is the rare single action only model which is carried cocked and locked like a 1911.

450 rounds ammo included. Over 400 rounds is 40 cal 180 grain jacketed hollow point and the rest is 357 SIG and 9mm.

This high quality and extremely reliable multiple caliber pistol was designed to be a light weight solution for a for an emergency bag or 72 hour kit. The multiple caliber design keeps weight and bulk to an absolute minimum while substantially increasing the chance of finding compatible ammunition in an emergency. The 40 Cal. magazines work flawlessly for all calibers; therefore, the only additional items you need to carry to have the multiple caliber capability are the two conversion barrels which take negligible space and minimally increase weight by a mere 7 ounces.

Changing calibers is very simple and can be done in less than 30 seconds seconds by anybody without any tools. Just field strip the pistol and change barrel to desired caliber when reassembling.

I realize that the average FNP 40 out there is likely to be around $499. The reason this FNP is more expensive is because of the extra parts needed for the multi-caliber capability as well as the additional accessories & ammo included. The Fire Dragon conversion barrels alone are $159 each. 

I'm only interested in local sales.  Private sale for Arizona residents with CCW.  All others meet at my FFL dealer and they will properly transfer the FNP."

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well.

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous."

This was purchased as a backup for my similarly-equipped competition gun but that project stalled, so it's not doing me any good collecting dust on a shelf.

The advantage these magwells bring to the Saiga-12 is threefold; first off they allow you to insert magazines straight in like an AR-15, removing the rock and lock requirement that can be awkward with something that's so much larger than a standard AK mag. Second and most importantly it allows you to easily reload on a closed bolt, since you're not trying to rock the magazine into place with a shell angled against the bottom of the bolt carrier. Third, with a little more fitting the included magazines can be made to drop free (again just like an AR-15.) Here's a video from the manufacturer showing the installed product in action:

Some of the early SKS's had the the polished bayonet, but most didn't, or had them painted over during refurbishment by the Russians.  

If you are a serious SKS collector, then you know what I am talking about.  This is the real deal.  They won't be making or importing any more Russian SKS's into the USA ever again.  The price will only continue to rise.  Thanks for looking.

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Hard to define but easy to recognize, elegance is a true measure of quality.

Match grade barrels and triggers ensure the level of accuracy that made Kimber the world’s most popular 1911.
