If you're not familiar with this pistol, it is pretty well considered a darn nice high capacity .380 pistol. You will be hard pressed to find many of these that are still new, or are even available. With today's political climate, it is getting harder to find small high capacity pistols. Taurus no longer makes this pistol. Being that I knew they were going to be somewhat hard to get, I bought two of them. Due to my current situation, I really cannot justify keeping duplicates. 

If you're one of the people who have fired a recent manufactured Taurus ""Pro"" series pistol, you know what I'm talking about when I say this is a really sweet shooting pistol; regardless of the price. This pistol has never been used and comes with the factory box, two 15 round magazines, owner's manual and lifetime warranty card. Must have proper Indiana ID and preferably a carry permit."

I’m the original owner but I just haven’t had an opportunity to fire it.   I’m sure it would be fun to shoot.  It's lightweight and an ideal size for survival/emergency use.  It would also make a great truck gun for critter control or just plinking.

It’s very light (6 lbs.), easy to handle, advertised to have almost no felt-recoil and that makes it ideal for introducing an adult to shooting or training a youngster.

Neither barrel of this rifle has ever been fired and its appearance still looks the way it did the day I bought it.  Both bores are pristine, shiny and single-shot.  There are no dings or scratches whatsoever on the gun because it’s never been in the field.  It's lived a sheltered life in my closet in the original shipping box because I just haven’t had an opportunity to use it.  ...my loss, your gain.

This will shoot all .22's (.22 long rifle, .22 long, and .22 short) as well as any .410 shell, including 3-inch shot-shells and slugs.  I'll include 100 rounds of CCI MiniMag .22lr and a 20-round box of Remington .410 shot-shells to get you started (unless I have to ship).

The gun comes in the original shipping box with all paperwork, lock, etc.  I’ve also added a comfortable sling for ease of carry.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee but will ship if you wish, adding shipping cost to price (freight & my FFL). Must be a legal buyer, 18 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit if local.

If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. If I don’t answer your email immediately, it just means I’m at work and I’ll respond as soon as I get home.

I'd prefer cash but would consider trading (cash up or down as needed) for a Ruger SR22, Ruger 10/22 Takedown, or a lightweight shotgun (20 gauge only).

I bought this for my wife as a concealment pistol, that didn't work out as planned.  She is more of a revolver person than an automatic person.

This pistol has had one 50 round box of ammunition fired through it and it worked flawlessly.  It is in like-new condition except for the slightest bit of wear from firing the box of ammunition.  It will make some lucky gal (or guy I guess) a fine carry weapon.  It includes the original box and materials.

I will offer a word of warning though.  Being a small pistol it has a small slide and a fairly stout spring.  I've seen small, petit gals cycle these with no problem, and I've seen larger women who couldn't.  I think that it's more mind-set than anything.  Just be aware that it takes a bit of grip strength to cycle the slide on this pistol.

I will provide any additional photos or information requested.

This is the most professional Combat Tactical 1911-A1 Pistol I have ever shot. Just amazing.

Civilian Version of the Springfield Professional. The Springfield Professional Model has been the choice of the FBI SWAT teams since 1998 and the Operator TRP (which stands for Tactical Response Pistol) is designed around the same specifications. According to Dave Williams, director of the Springfield Custom Shop, the TRP Operator production starts out in a similar manner as the Professional. 

I have posted some links to show you how great this .45 ACP does. I shot 16 rounds through it so I consider this as NIB. At 30 yards it was dead on target. Made in Geneseo IL. USA. Match grade barrel, superior grips, trijicon three dot sites, aggressive tactical back strap and front strap. I have kept this in a humidity dry safe and well oiled.

It comes with a Vital Impact Soft Case, A $98 Black Hawk 2-point leather holster. The holster has never been used and it is brand new. There 180 rounds of high quality .45 ACP rounds new in the box are 100 rounds of HPR Hyper Clean .45 Auto 230 grains. 50 rounds of Winchester .45 Auto 230 grains. 20 rounds of Hornady Custom Deadly 200 grains. 16 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty .45 Auto 220 grains flexlock full expansion.

Pistol comes with a manufacture hard case, a 11 Gear paddle holster for concealment made specifically for this gun and is adjustable. many extras in the case. Two magazines with bump pads on the bottoms. I thought it was great that in the hard Case they put in take out foams slots for extra magazines, please see pictures. 

Here is the Springfield Armory link and test video. Notice even with High power grain shells the TRP is very controllable.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol."

We have fired 100 rounds though it to test the function and to practice with it.  Sadly, my wife is not really proficient with a semi-auto and is more suited to a J-frame revolver.  She loves the look of the pistol but just can't get the hang of it's function.  She can't seem to grasp the concept of not placing the thumb of your support hand behind the slide...she'd be in a tight spot if she ever had to use it in a defensive situation without me there to supervise.

I purchased the pink grips from Bersa; the dark spot visible on the right grip is not a burn, it is a discoloration that was in the wood as they were received when purchased.

The engraving is filled with pink acrylic.  I don't think the photos do the lettering justice, it is clean and sharp looking.  The bases of the magazines are finished with Krylon Fusion which bonds to plastics.  It seems to be very durable and shows no sign of scratching or wear.

I have the original box and materials.  The original black grips and grip screws are included in case someone wants to return it to normal.

One caveat.  The pink grips are somewhat squared and blockie feeling compared to the original plastic grips.  My wife and I both like the feel of them for shooting, but they are not quite as slim as the plastic grips, should someone want to carry it concealed.

I will provide any additional photos or information requested.

Currently has a Vortex 4-12x40 AO scope mounted but not sighted/rings are only snugged. Has the adjustable AccuTrigger and factory synthetic stock with after market sling and four round detachable magazine. Low round count but nonetheless a used gun; it does have some scuff marks on the stock and a few rubbed areas on the barrel but the bore and throat are both excellent. Nothing wrong with it, just trying to simplify the calibers I have and free some room in the safe. 

Included in the sale are: 100 (14 fired brass) rounds of 117 grain Hornay Interlock, 40  rounds of Winchester 90 grain Positive Expanding Point and 20 rounds of Winchester 85 grain Ballistic Silvertip ammo, all factory loaded as well as a Lucas bore guide. Also have a few rounds of fired brass I can include as I don't load for this round. This rifle patterned extremely well with the Hornady ammo; bought it to use for coyotes, but I haven't patterned it with the lighter grain bullet or since I put the new scope on it and used it for deer instead. 

Not interested in shipping and would need to ensure buyer is an Indiana resident with proof of ability to own a firearm (concealed carry permit or transfer through an FFL at my expense). Thanks for looking and please feel free to ask any questions.

Second photo shows the ammo, from L to R: Winchester 90 grain PEP, Winchester 85 grain Ballistic Silvertip and Hornady 117 grain Interlock American Whitetail."

This used LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. The pistol is ruggedly constructed with a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and black, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame. The dovetailed, high-visibility 3-dot sight system is made up of a windage-adjustable rear sight and a fixed front sight. Numerous safety features are in place including an internal lock, a manual safety, a magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator, which provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded. 

This handgun comes with TWO 7-round magazines and the original factory box.  The second magazine is new/unopened in box. I ordered it before deciding to sell.  Its grips, metal, and bore are all excellent condition.

These cartridges are loaded with the Hornady VMax 50 grain bullet, which makes this load insanely accurate for a bulk loaded cartridge. Federal advertises these as varmint rounds, and they would do very well on small game. These are military boxer primed and reloadable.

This would be a great cartridge for a short barreled AR-15 or AR-15 pistol, due to the velocity.

The ballistic gelatin tests of this round show that this bullet literally explodes after an inch of penetration. The fragmentation is amazing. It is very damaging to soft tissue. Plus, it does not over penetrate. This would make a perfect home defense round for your AR-15 or Mini 14. Fast, light bullets are what you want in a home defense round. Advertised velocity from a 20 inch barrel is around 3300 fps. This round has a flat trajectory, and I would recommend it for shooting targets within 300 yards, due to it's weight. This round will work in 1/12, 1/9 and 1/7 barrels.

It's in perfect condition, safe kept when not in use. as the title states it's a 1.5-4x20 scope, with the Illuminated SPR firedot reticle. Great for 3 gun, home defense, or stretching your AR into longer range use over irons sights or a red dot. The ballistic compensation is calibrated for 55 grain loads traveling at 3100 FPS (factory setting), but can be change by Leupold. The windage and elevation adjustments can be zeroed out just like any other high end scope. Another great feature of the scope is the illuminated reticle turns off on it's own after not moving for five minutes, but as soon as you pick the rifle up it tuns itself back on. When on the lowest power setting, and the reticle illumination turned all the way up, it's indistinguishable from a red dot other than the optic has eye relief. Scope includes all appropriate manuals and Allen keys for the turrets etc. 
Also included is a MK II IMS mount from Leupold, runs around $100, great mount, I like the height and eye relief, I've found it to be comfortable and ergonomic for AR shooting.

Barely used, carefully kept. All stock and original as shipped from factory. I really like this pistol but decided I really want the rail like on the P-01. This hard to find pistol has less than 500 rounds of light target hand loads through it, and the trigger works have smoothed out quite a bit from brand new.

The PCR, Police Czech Republic, is built to police standards, with the alloy frame for lighter day long carry. The original rubber grips provide great contact and control of the firearm for great accuracy and repeatability. Many find this to be the most accurate 9mm in their collection. 

I hate to see it go but chose to get a P-01 for the tac light rail. My loss is your gain.

Includes box, manual, factory target, cleaning rod and 2 mags as shipped from the factory.

Not interested in trades or lower offers. eMails of that sort will be ignored. If you see this ad, the PCR is still available, or just sold within the hour."

I am selling or looking to trade for something of similar price range. I have a Remington 1911 r1. it has about 300 rounds through it. not a single problem. reason im selling is because its hard to conceal. much heavier than my glock. recently went shooting up into the mountains on a sunny day and came back. cleaned it, after about a month or so opened up the case and worst night mare....rust...just a little bit tho. I got a towel with rubbing alcohol and started wiping everything down... I got a lot of it off since it wasn't super bad but there are a few areas with some that's hard to get off....I will send pics upon request. anyways, that doesn't effect the performance of the gun whatsoever, so if you tried hard enough you would be able to get the rust off...or you could just cerekote the gun and make it look badass....you can email me and I can send pictures, or just text me... my speaker is broken so you wont be able to hear me therefore texting is the only option...anyways, it will come with original case, and 5 magazines. looking for a glock 17 or 19 or honestly anything that you got. may even add cash on top...thanks"

Every feature was put in place for one purpose: to help you get the maximum advantage from your rifle, whether you’re hunting or in competition.

Front Focal Plane (FFP)
The reticle magnifies along with the image, so you can estimate range at all magnification settings. These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.

Xtended Twilight Lens System
Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2
Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2™, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing
While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Generous Eyebox
The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges
Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.

Dual Use
Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

$740 firm in cash or higher in trade value.

Looking for cash since I really don't need anything, but will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering exactly, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

Top of list of list, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  Clean Ruger GP100 SS 6"" .357 mag and a SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new now.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice FCG etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

1990 F-250 Extended Cab, Long Bed, 4x4, 5spd, XLT Lariat, 5.8l V8

PDL-Drivers side doesn't work
PW-Both work from drivers side, passenger better be nice to you
AC- Blows coldish but vacuum line has a hole in it and sometimes it will blow through the dash, other times through the defrost vents
New windshield
Tires and rims only have 5k miles on them, Hankook Dynapro AT's
Newer clutch and throwout bearing
New timing chain cover and harmonic balancer
New belt
New hoses
New fluids
New rear brakes, cables and axle seals
4.10 Gear ratio
New plugs, wires, cap, and rotor
Passed emissions last year, idle test only. Haven't done one this year
Rear air bags
Heavy duty rear bumper
Receiver hitch
Dual fuel tanks, front works fine, rear is possessed.
I have the tailgate but the bed is dented and the bed will need repair if you plan to use it
Has captains chairs with center console but they're gray and the interior is red. Beggars can't be choosers. The previous owner was a very large fellow and being smashed against the door due to the sagging bench seat for the 45 minute drive home was murder on my back. You'll thank me even though they don't match

Now for the bad.
It leaks oil, duh it's a Ford. You only have to worry when it stops leaking oil. The oil leak is coming from the rear intake manifold gasket.
It will not rev past 3k rpm. The truck will begin to shake and vibrate and dislike you if you try to push it past. My mechanic has looked at it and we found a 302 harmonic balancer on it. That's why it has a new 351 balancer installed but the problem persists. I look at it as a governor to keep you from blowing it up.
Has hail dents on the hood and roof but it blends in nicely with all of the other dents.

1994 Northstar Camper

It has a water heater and toilet. Both leak, but the good news is, they've been bypassed so you don't have to worry about that.
It has a fridge, I don't know if it works, never used it.
It has a heater, it works very well but does squeek when cold. I've oiled the cage and it's gotten better but still squeeks until it warms up
It has a water pump for cold water only
It will come with a deep cycle battery
It has roof damage from hail and the previous owner backed into something denting the rear roof. I ""patched"" it with RV roof repair tape and will provide you with what I have left so you can patch it as much as you want.
The rear door sticks, sometimes. Anti-theft, thieves are lazy and won't want to bother with it, assuming they get over their fear of being axe murdered by you.
The roof leaks a little water in the right rear corner when the roof is stored. Go figure, but hey, it's in the bathroom which you wont use anyways.
Interior lights work
Stove works
Has tons of room for storage
Is equipped with the Dynalift system to load/unload the camper
I'll throw in the 2""x6""s for leveling.
No awning
Stays dry when setup and the canvas is in good condition.
Dinette converts to a bed

I'm asking $3,500 or best offer. Possible trade for a fully enclosed 2 horse trailer valued at $1,500 plus cash on your end. I will separate but have to sell the camper first.

I don't want to waste your time and please don't waste mine. She's not perfect by any means but is a heck of a lot better than when I bought it. It's a basic hunting shack. I drove it to Meeker last year with zero issues. She pulled Eisenhower at 40mph with the camper loaded down with all of my gear and then some. Impressive for a small block that wont rev past 3k. The only reason I'm selling it is because I have a wall tent that I'll be using and I don't need it anymore. Truck is located at a storage yard in Louviers. I have more pics that I can email.
