This is a TRUE collector piece - with lots of paper documents from the Captain that ordered it for his close friend, an avid sportsman and Indy 500 fan. Included is a hand written letter where he outlines the purchase as well as a visit to the Indy tower. This LEO passed away within a year of writing and ordering it for his close friend. That friend passed away in 2004, and the firearm went to a family member. Lots of documented great history on this MINT .357 that was never fired by any of its owners. Still like the brand new gun it was back in 1983. The protective covering is still on the plaque, and it never was stuck to the outer box as the paper was never removed from the sticky backing. Honored to find such a great piece, but this belongs to a collector that will enjoy its history and story more than me. And by someone who will keep it an unfired collector item.

One round is put next to a large dawn bottle for size comparison. Each round is just over 17 inches I believe.The fuzes are the original MK27 aluminum fuzes. Fuzes are completely inert and unscrew from the projectile. The projectile has a weld mark on the band which is shown in the picture. This was done during demil. The projectile is seated firmly in the casing and will not come out. The casing's have around a quarter inch crack at the neck to loosen originally for the demil of the round. I made this visible in the picture on one for the example. The casing's do not contain a primer. These were used during WW2 and later on shot out of AC-130's. These are hard to find complete, especially with the fuze. None of these are reproductions and were never dummy rounds. There is also the original clip that was used.  $80 per round OR while there are all 4 rounds still with the clip, a deal can be negotiated for the whole set.

For those that don't know This was the last weapon designed by firearms genius John Moses Browning, and finished by FN engineer Dieudonne Saive, the Hi-Power was built in response to a French Army requirement for a simple, rugged, 9mm pistol. It has become one of the world's most proliferated handgun, serving on both sides of the Second World War. Eventually finding its way into the arsenals of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Argentina, etc and is still common among the world's military and police forces.

 This is 38 S&W (9x20mmR) a revolver cartridge developed by Smith & Wesson in 1877 for use in the S&W .38 Single Action. Though similar in name, it is not interchangeable with the later .38 Smith and Wesson Special due to a different case shape and slightly larger bullet diameter.
