Springfield ArmoryÂ® was the first 1911 manufacturer to offer a frame that included an accessory rail as part of the forging. The Championâ¢ OperatorÂ® mates this forged OperatorÂ® frame with a shorter slide and a 4 inch barrel. This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed â and it doesnât sacrifice any capacity. Pick up a Championâ¢ OperatorÂ®, and youâll find that itâs a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Deltaâ¢ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3-Dot tritium combat sights mean that the Championâ¢ OperatorÂ® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Championâ¢ OperatorÂ® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Koteâ¢ finish will keep it performing for years to come. You can carry the Championâ¢ OperatorÂ® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity. Then slide your favorite tactical light on the rail, and put it on your nightstand. When you need a feature-packed 1911 for night and day, reach for the Championâ¢ OperatorÂ®."

$200 TAKES THE WHOLE LOT

Don't assure me you want it, make me hold it for you all week, then say you don't have the money the day of the sale please.

I'm like King Midas. Just instead of everything I touch turning into gold, it breaks instead. Mainly looking for that cash money, but I'll consider trades. Okay so basically I'm taking a break and want all of this stuff gone. That means I'm open to offers and negotiations, just please don't lowball. I'm easy to work with and if you have any questions feel free to ask! 
First up is my baby. ECHO 1 Master Series MP5. Selling this is probably the hardest Airsoft related thing I'll ever do since this is the only gun I've ever had not to crap out on me. I'm not gonna lie; cosmetically, this gun is in horrendous shape. It still shoots like a dream though. Has many internal upgrades which I'll list below.
Madbull Black Python V2 TBB (6.03 mm).
Madbull Bucking. 
E1 High Torque Motor. 
CQB Gearbox firing 280 w/ 0.25g.
Comes with 3 mid caps. This gun has been tuned up by Brian from Echo 1 and only him, so my misguided hands have never tainted this gem. Trigger response is awesome, shoots smoothly and accurately. NOW THE BAD THINGS. Rear sight is gone forever. Butt plate has vanished in the wicked woods of New Jersey. I think I have the front sight laying around somewhere. Charging handle's handle snapped off. Red dot sight works like a charm just needs a new battery.
I guess I'll start off asking for $155?

Next is the gun from hell. G&P/Lonex/ mutt. I really don't even know where to start with this thing besides the fact that right now it just won't work.
G&P gearbox
G&P M120 motor
Lonex Metal Hopup Unit
Maple Leaf Bucking
H-Hop nub.
I decided to use my incredibly gifted teaching hands to replace my air nozzle and I ended up FUBARing this thing. I don't know what's wrong with it but it just won't shoot. I'm sure anyone who is a halfway decent tech can get this thing shooting like a dream but I just don't have the patience or the time. This thing will be sold as is and feel free to ask me any questions on it. I'll also include all of these parts and a bag of gearbox parts just to ensure you have what you need to restore this thing to its former glory. Outer barrel threads are stripped like lots of forests. AFG NOT INCLUDED.
I'll start at $75 for this. 

Revision Desert Locust Goggles/Emerson FAST helmet. Awesome goggles, don't fog because I ripped out the foam, and will come with smoked lense as well. Only selling because I got a Dye i4 and I love it. Emerson Fast Bump w/visor. Both for $40

Rothco M81 BDU (small-regular). First piece of kit I ever purchased. Washed. $13.

Box of AK parts. It was a Double Eagle AK. It's Marui Compatible AFAIK, so it's perfect for that old AK we all know you have laying around that's missing a bunch of stuff. $25 I guess. 

So yeah, please just get this stuff away from me and if you have any questions or anything just shoot me a text at REDACTED! I'll be more than happy to talk to you and answer any questions you may have!"

It is one of the earlier ones made, as it has no MIM black trigger or hammer.  It is stainless steel, with an aluminum alloy frame, making it a light weight, single stack 9mm.  It has a 3.5 inch barrel and the magazine holds eight rounds.   It is one of their third generation semi-automatic pistols that S&W refers to as a ""traditional double action"". This refers to a mode of operation wherein the first pull of the trigger is longer and heavier, and causes the hammer to rise from its resting position and then fall to strike the firing pin and fire the cartridge in the chamber. After the pistol fires that first time, the pistol is in what is called ""single action"", wherein the hammer stays cocked and subsequent trigger pulls are much shorter and lighter. The safety/decock lever on the side of the slide can be lowered which will (a) safely drop the cocked hammer, and (b) prevent the pistol from firing by disconnecting the trigger and by rotating a block between the hammer and firing pin. It is the firing pin block that makes dropping the hammer with the decocker safe, albeit somewhat unnerving. The original 3913 has been popular with law enforcement officers that need to carry their primary sidearm concealed. 
Asking $625, and shipping to your FFL is included.  Local sales preferred, with receipt and SC DL or SC CWP.  Let me know if you have any questions or need additional pics.

After 25 years of being accessorized, customized and re-imagined in countless movies, television shows and video games, the Desert EagleÂ® Pistol has emerged as a pop-culture icon. All models feature a full Weaver style accessory rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safeties.

Here is how it works: If you are out od state, You send me a copy of yourâs or your receiving dealerâs FFL [Federal Firearms License] to me at the following address with a certified Bank Check for the total [$2,680.00]. I send the gun and ammo within 3 hours of cashing your check â you get the gun the next day at your dealer. The FFL can be emailed to me, in advance, as a .pdf file or a .jpg picture from you computer email. Very Simple. If you live in SC,. You can pick the gun up from me.

Terrance L. Krueger, 16 Windover Lane, Fountain inn, SC 29644 REDACTED â The gun is NOT at this location.

Price for the gun and 480 rounds of .50AE ammo at below market price. The price includes the ammo and a brand new never used $168.00 leather Shoulder Holster.

NOW HEAR THIS - Many dealers online will advertise this AS A NEW UN FIRED [NIB] gun, but then under the lower price they will print.... ""OUT OF STOCK"" - this is their lost leader to make you think they deal in these guns, which they have never sold or haven't seen in months! Of course they can advertise a lower price if it will take you six months to get one of these lovely limited production masterpieces. BUT - the guns are no longer made by Magnum Research in Pillager, Minnesota.

If you want a Gun NOW that will go up in value and make you the talk at the Gun Range, this one is for you. If you do the math, this is a steal. MSRP on the Guns are $2,264.00 from the manufacturer, Magnum Research, and more form a dealer. This Gun will hold 7 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber for a total of 8 rounds. I have small hands and wrists with arthritis and my personal gun's recoil does not bother me! I am 74 years old. My Price total for all three is $2,680.00

- This model complies with NIJ Standard-0101.06 for Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor.- NIJ Level IIIA 0101-06

ADVANCED COMPOSITE BUOYANT BODY ARMOR SYSTEMS


The Basic Ballistic  Panel is our  10x12"" kids size Threat Level IIIA ballistic Panel and weighs a little more than a lb!! We designed this panel for the smaller pack or bag and a budget that puts this product in more peoples' hands. This is the same level of anti-ballistic protection found in all of our standard size ballistic panel products but made small enough to fit in smaller packs, purses and budgets. Simply insert the panel in your favorite bag for instant Threat Level IIIA Ballistic protection. You can even swap your panel(s) from bag to bag. Threat level IIIA panels are approx. 1/4 inch thick and will fit discretely in most packs, laptop bags, suitcases, courier bags and larger purses.

Ballistic Protection also saves lives in bomb fragmentation and explosive incidents. There are thousands of cases of shrapnel being stopped by body armor. However, shrapnel and fragments can take so many shapes and forms that it is very difficult to ""rate"" the levels of protection. Ammunition based rating systems, like the NIJ Threat Level system, seem to be the best way to measure the strength of a material in a projectile impact test.

Threat Level 3A is the HIGHEST level of protection available in soft body armor (vests). Higher levels of protection are in the form of ""hard"" armoring: Ceramic, Composite or Metal Plates in pockets that protect the most vital, center of mass, organs, other than the head .

Features and Benefits
Make your favorite pack even better easily by adding a Threat Level IIIA ""Bullet Proof"" Panel!

Ballistics
  NIJ Threat Level 3A UHMWPE Thermoplastic blended panel Protection Rated for 9mm FMJ, .357 Magnum, .45 Cal and .44 Magnum!

Instructions
Hold your pack/bag ""not included"" with shield between yourself and the shooter using the shoulder straps as handles. Use as a shield to provide cover for upper torso and head whenever possible. While taking shelter use pack/bag to protect yourself in the direction of the threat. While running away, hold pack/bag high on your back or in the direction of the threat to protect your head and upper torso (vital organs)

 If you are hunting for a lightweight bow, the Mini Max is your answer. The Mini Max is just a little over 3 lbs and equipped with the legendary S-2 Cam. This shorty has been at the gym pumping weights! Not only is he lifting, he is power lifting! The ultra lightweight and short length of the Mini Max makes it ideal when using tree stands or ground blind hunting. This short sweet bow is accurate and consistent. Don't let the lightweight of the Mini Max fool you, it's a true force to be reckoned with.

 S-2 Cam - The High Performance S-2 Cam is a smooth drawing, highly efficient solo cam. The heart of the S-2 Cam is the flexible adjustment of the draw length and let-off. The adjustments are made with a simple turn of an allen wrench, with no bow press needed. Adjustable let-off 65-80%.

 I paid right at $1000.00 for this bow new with all of the accessories.

Cash is best but will take ammo plus cash, a ps4, or nikon dslr lenses/ equipment and or a nice all in one desktop computer. Possibly a laptop but prefer cash. Not really looking for other firearms unless you have an ria 10mm 1911, then I will add cash on my end. This pistol is great for carry or home defense. Slim enough to carry (the long barrel does not effect compfort or concealability) and has a longer barrel/ slide for reduced recoil and muzzle flip for better control and accuracy. Plus holds up to 9 +1 rounds which will take care of any threat and a rail for your favorite accessory. Very safe gun so great for first time buyers. Will handle +p rounds. Again, great gun with no wear. Can take credit card but I am a private seller. All laws apply. These go for $500 used at williams gunsight in davison. Steal of a price for $380!
