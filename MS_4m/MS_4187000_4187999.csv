Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP.) Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 in .40SW, 9 in .45ACP.) Like all XD(M)®’s, the 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.
If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal.

Each of these guns is stunning, and prior to listing them for sale, I completed a field strip and found that the trigger groups/other mechanical parts look brand new (but all of the numbers match).

Even more impressive, as a part of the collection, I will be able to include a full set of original accessories that are extremely rare to find at all, and especially in this condition.  All of the firearms include blade-style bayonets and cleaning rods.  Each one will also include paperwork from the Serbian factory (may not be the matching one for each gun's serial, I don't speak Russian, but you'll definitely get some neat manuals issued from the factory), a sling, oil can, cleaning rope, dual ammo pouches and even the cleaning kit that fits into the buttplate. For example, see the single rifle picture to see what it is included with each purchase.

I am not looking for trades.  I am pricing these aggressively so they will go to collectors/shooters who will enjoy them and get them out of the crate and back into the world.

Single rifles are $450.  If you would like the entire lot, I can sell them for $400 each.  I am glad to send more pictures of specific rifles to interested buyers.  Please feel free to text me at 423 six seven six 1881, or email REDACTED

Thanks for looking, and take this chance to get your hands on some beautiful examples of Yugo SKS collections!

EDIT: One gone! I will continue the offer of $1600 for the lot per until the next one sells, then I will have to move up to $1275 (425/per) for the remaining 3-gun collection."

This upper has thicker walls than traditional AR-15s which extends the life of the bolt carrier group and barrel interface.
The handguard is a Troy hardened aircraft aluminum free-float rail which can easily be customized to the operator's preferences.  
It has front and rear MBUS sights and a Magpul grip and collapsible stock.  
It comes with four 30 round magazines and polymer rail sections to mount your accessories to the handguard.
It has about 500 rounds through it and is in excellent condition.

This one is not just another pretty face in the crowd, but rather an all business gun that comes ready to use with or without an Advanced Armament Suppressor. A steel thread-protector comes standard to protect your barrel when the suppressor is not in use.

Available through Nighthawk Custom, its Preferred Dealers or from Advanced Armament Corporation, this custom handgun is loaded with proprietary features. The first to catch your eye will be the lightening cuts on the top of the slide, mainspring housing and front strap that match the Advanced Armament Ti-Rant suppressor. As you can see from the pictures, it makes for a very attractive firearm.

The slide sports new Heinie Ledge Straight Eight Suppressor Sights which are only available through Nighthawk Custom. These sights are designed to give you a complete sight picture over the top of the suppressor. The distinct ""ledge"" rear sight allows you to cock the weapon off of a hard surface if needed. The gun has about 250 rounds through it  no scratches on the weapon. Comes with bag, test target and all other paper work, 2 mags.  I would like to trade this AAC for a nighthawk predator, nighthawk enforcer, nighthawk falcon, heine signature competition,     Might consider a bob marvel or high end wilson combat.

It comes with two high capacity magazines and all the paperwork S&W sent with the pistol.  Must have valid IN identification and preferably carry permit.  Sorry, I won't drive to Nevada to meet you.  I can't stay awake that long anymore.  Based on quite a few prices I'm seeing where people are asking WAY more than what used pistols cost new, I thought I'd start at $3600.00 and go from there.  If you want to offer me something less, I'll whine and complain like the rest of the guys who have used (whereas mine is really new, but since I'm not a dealer, I can't legally call it NIB) firearms priced far, far above what new ones cost but I'll consider your offer.  However, if you show up with $3600.00 cash for the pistol and have proper ID etc., I'll probably meet you at least across town. ;-)

Oh yeah, I didn't feel like opening the box again to take pictures so I just lifted one off of S&W's page.  The pistol apparently is a blatant knock-off of a Glock and Glock obviously sued S&W, but I don't know nor care what came of that law suit.  Anyway, mine looks the same except it may have my fingerprints on it if you look closely.  Thanks for looking!"

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

The Apex gives the 9c a very smooth, crisp, and light break, with an improved reset.  The pistol has very minimal wear, mostly just a little bit on the slide release.  The under side of the trigger guard was sanded down slightly (don't worry, it looks nice) to remove the grip texture from it.  It makes the gun much more enjoyable to shoot, because it no longer rubs on your middle finger.  The gun comes with three 12 round magazines, two have pinky extensions on them, and one is flush.  Additionally, I have three holsters that I will include.  The first is a Galco King Tuk, which honestly, is in rough condition, but still has life left in it.  The second is a kydex appendix holster, and the third is a kydex appendix holster with built in magazine carrier.  All three are very comfortable ways to conceal the 9c.

This is a great little carry gun in a great caliber.  It has been through the Springfield recall, so that is taken care of.  Included with the sale or trade I have 3, 5 round factory mags, 1, 5 round factory mag with a +1 extension, and 2, 7 round factory mags.  Box and all the XD gear is included also, along with a Blackhawk brand kydex IWB holster, made specifically for this pistol.  The XDS has EXACTLY 90 rounds through it for function testing with factory ammo only, with no malfuntions.   

I have found that with one of the regular 5 round mags in place, you can pocket carry this gun, or if you wish, carry with a 7 round mag, and the gun disapears under just a t-shirt.  If you're looking for great carry option in .45, this is your gun. 

The only reason I'm selling is for somethimg a little larger for carry.  This brings me to a possible trade option.  I am only interested in 2 trade offers, and those are either a Glock 30 or regular 30.  I would also be interested in a trade, with possible cash on my end, for a 1911 in just about any configuration.  The only request I have is NO GI sights on the 1911 please, I would like the option of different sights w/o having to mill the slide.  

Best way to reach me for pics, questions or offers is through text at REDACTED.  

Would be willing to meet a reasonable distance from the Shawnee area.  

I would list the sale price of the XDS at $595 OBO cash, considering the xtra mags are $30-something each,  or a trade value of $625.  Thanks for looking, and I am motivated to sell or trade."

Century International Arms VZ2008 7.62x39 caliber semi-automatic Rifles. Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish."

Most of the ammunition is dated to around 1989 - 1992 but is still brand new in the original boxes or bricks. I am looking to sell all 10 full 500 round bricks in any combination of individual boxes or in bricks at this point for cash sales only. I also am not looking to make any trades at this point for the ammunition. I am looking to sell this in the Twin Cities area & suburbs in Minnesota by face to face sales with no shipping involved unless the buyer pays for all current shipping charges for the ammo to another state. Our pricing structure was setup after searching the internet for current pricing of these type of rounds at $150.00 dollars cash per 500 round brick and is as follows:

1.) $15.00 dollars cash per box of 50 rounds which is at 0.30 cents per round for the ammo. This would be the price for up to 9 boxes of 50 rounds or less being purchased.

2.) $142.50 dollars cash per brick of 500 rounds which is at 0.285 cents per round for the ammo. This is a 5% price reduction for buying 10 - 50 round boxes or more at one time up to 5 - 500 round bricks.

3.) $130.00 dollars cash per brick of 500 rounds which is at 0.26 cents per round for the ammo if you where to purchase 5 or more 500 round bricks all the way up to all 10 - 500 rounds bricks I still have in stock at this point for sale.

I am sure these rounds will sell out very quickly since they are currently hard to find in the Minnesota area since I have been looking at the usual places like Gander Mountain & Cabela's Outfitters in Rogers, MN for these type of rounds. I am very firm on the pricing so please don't try to make lowball offers since I will not reply to that kind of nonsense on this site."

These are also known as ""Side Star"" SKS's due to the Tula star being on the side.

When I bought it it had a craptastic Tapco stock on it, and a tall as heck scope mount receiver cover. I took all that off(NO LONGER HAVE THE STUFF) and fit it into a Norinco Stock, with the standard Receiver Cover, it's why it has the Spike Bayonet, it is a Russian SKS! I just refinished the Stock and Hand guard as well. Has a cleaning kit in the trapdoor in the buttstock, only thing it's missing is the Cleaning Rod, would make a nice addition to a collection or a nice shooter, it does function FLAWLESSLY, and doesn't slam fire! No ammo is included at this price, and look up the Russian SKS's before you start commenting on my price, they are going for more than $550 everywhere else, these are the best quality SKS that was produced, the milling was fantastic, and it's all milled parts, NO STAMPED!

Only trade I'm looking for is a Taurus PT92 or PT917, would like the Stainless model, and will include ammo if I receive ammo, will match round for round, I have 280 rounds of which 100 is ready to go on 10 round stripper clips.

After the original Browning patents for the Browning Hi-Power (BHP) expired, the Hungarian conglomerate of FÉG developed one of the most faithful versions of the Browning design ever made in quantity outside the FN factories in Belgium and Portugal. The BHP and the FP9 are so similar that many parts are interchangeable between them, including the magazines.

This pistol feels great in the hand – exactly like my 1981 BHP.  Note: the non-vented rib version of this pistol was exported as PJK-9HP/P9M models.
