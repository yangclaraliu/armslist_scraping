It sounds really cool when shooting, as a distinct 'bang' some of the airsofters said they would be scared to be shot at by this gun. More info on this gun below.

To review, you get
This gun We tech MSK (300$ gun)
4 magazines (3 for FREE)
Speed loader
alot of .20 bbs. (FREE)

This gun is heavy. I has lots of heavy polymer on the lower and metal on the upper. It has metal top rail with great removable folding sights, and 1 rail on each side of the front of the gun so you can have 3 attachments + a red dot or scope. The gun was chrono tested twice. Once it chrono as 390 FPS and once as 350 FPS so that is about the range it runs. I'll give the speed loader that came with it which works perfectly and a big container of over 1000 bbs.

Price is semi-firm but I'll consider all offers and will respond to all. Thank you for reading and practice safety when you're on the airsoft fields."

The mag is a Magnum Research Baby Eagle Mag, which are the same as the PPQ M1 mag, just a little cheaper. 

I had two of these and sold the other with all the mags. A friend bought this one but needed cash so I offered to take it off his hands so he could get the money faster, hence 1 only one mag and not the factory one. 

Anyway, it has the factory rear sight and a fiber optic front. 

Due to it only having one mag, I priced it lower than others I've seen to be fair. 

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions. Price is $350 local or $400 shipped from my FFL. This is the lowest I'll go and sorry, I'm not interested in trades.

I have about 400 rounds apiece thru each barrel.  The gun has had no problems whatsoever and shoots cheap ammo, Golden sabres, hollow points, etc.  The gun has some upgrades:  a ghost trigger connector that makes the trigger better (the old connector is included in case you want to change it back to stock), an extended mag release, extended slide stop release and extended take down lever.  I am firm on the price. FTF and buyer must have valid NCDL and either a pistol purchase permit or concealed carry permit.  Buyer and I will sign a bill of sale for each other. I will send pics to those who are seriously interested. No trades."

Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean.

The scope that is included with the buy it now price is a Leupold Mark 4 6.5-20x50mm FFP or Front Focal Plane scope. It has 1/4-MOA adjustments. Here are some things Leupold has to say about it:

The Xtended Twilight Lens System™ optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.

Side focus parallax adjustment for fast, easy parallax focusing from 75 yards to infinity, from any shooting position.

Finger-adjustable ¼-MOA windage and elevation adjustments with audible, tactile clicks.

Once sighted in adjustment knobs can be zeroed.

The revolver is in very good condition with a couple of very small marks on the frame that won't show up well on these low-res images. I can email better quality images if you're interested. 
The cylinder has a very light turn-ring indicating that the gun has not seen heavy use or abuse. 

The Dan shoots very well. The single-action pull is light with a crisp break. The double-action pull is smooth, but is unlike Smith and Wesson, or Ruger revolvers. 

I have discovered that the Dan Wesson has a very loyal following and CZ USA resurrected revolver production a few years ago. At any rate, parts are readily available (both new and used) from CZ USA, Gun Broker and eBay. My plans were to kit out the gun with 2.5,
6 and 8-inch barrels, but I decided to pursue another project.

The following items are included in the sale:
*Dan Wesson  model 15-2 357 magnum with a 4-inch barrel
*Original box with matching serial number
*Original box for the barrel and shroud
*Original manual
*Dan Wesson Barrel tool/take-down tool. The plastic for retaining the barrel tool is broken, but the tool itself is still serviceable (I'll be happy to demonstrate). New tools are available from a number of sources.
*Original cylinder gap feeler gauge
*Bianchi Leather holster
*Hogue Grip (the gun handles 357 very well with the original wood grip)

I love my direct gas ARs, but I do prefer a piston system as it does not get the bolt nearly as dirty, and the system is adjustable so if it doesn't function correctly when you need it the most, you can crank the horsepower up and still use it. The rifle itself will come with the Gen 3 Pmag it came with, along with the original box/docs/lock from Sig Sauer, along with a two point sling equipped with quick detach mounts (the rifle has multiple places to put them) and rail covers. It will also come with a 20 round magazine as well, and a Vortex Crossfire II 1-4x25 scope with an American Defense Quick Detach mount can be included for just $400 ($500 setup if mount and scope are bought separately) never fired while mounted. The rifle is equipped with fold down Iron Sights. If you really want to go all out, I could include an extra 5 30 round Pmags and 500 rounds of ammo for an extra $200.

I just got this, and for whatever reason, it doesn't agree with the astigmatism in my right eye.  I get too much of a halo and seem to do better with a single dot, which is a areal shame since I absolutely love this aiming system--three lines and a small dot in the center.  Also has settings in green (I think 5 settings each color) andthe bonus feature of having fixed sights on top of the scope and an integral base that I BELIEVE will allow for cowitnessing on an AR (will work on handguns, ARs, rifles, or shotguns).  I REALLY wish this one worked for me--now it's back to the drawing board for my project.  Bummer.  My loss is your gain.  Comes with all the paperwork--registration, warranty, etc.

Prices you will find on a NIB version: eBay ($107), Amazon ($116), Natchez ($100+ shhipping), WalMart ($159) etc.  Why buy there, when I can save you substantially for the same thing that I can guarantee works.  

Asking only $80 face-to-face (cash only or paypal (no fees) upon you viewing it and agreeing; no Sunday sales).  Happy to ship if buyer picks up the shipping and paypal fees (call it $93).  All sales final.

Additional features:

- Multi-coated optics
- Amber-Bright high contrast lens coating
- 100% waterproof/fogproof/shockproof construction (built like a freaking mini tank!)
- Dry-nitrogen filled
- It conserves battery life by self regulating brightness based on available light and power down when the protective storage hood is attached.

If you think it's over priced, make an offer--worst I can do is say no :D  First unequivocal ""I'll take it"" followed by an email gets it.  Not looking for trades at the moment--need the cash for a project and the med bills from shoulder surgery."

The Trigger has been replaced with a 3.5 lbs Trigger and it has been further fine tuned by the Gunsmith . Most importanly shortened the trigger pull reset.

So do not let one member's ""honorable attempt"" to deflate the spiking price of that ammo deflate your actions & desire to keep this ammo available for law abiding Americans. Write and call your congressman, and everyone elses to boot. Write the ATF, and tell every 2nd Ammendment loving person you know what our oppressor in chief is trying to do! And unlike the author of the article I'm referencing, do not allow our government to confiscate or regulate anymore ammo or weapons that we still have access to, period! If you don't do anything then I guarantee that you'll wish you would have bought M855 ammo at $ 12.00 a box when you had the chance!

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I honed the action because it had no wear on it and it slicked up nicely. $450-trades considered."

From the Armaguerra Cremona arsenal produced from 1942 to 1944. It is numbers matching and complete. There are no markings on the receiver. There are also no import marks anywhere.

It fires the 6.5x52mm Carcano round. It comes with one stripper clip. It prefers the aftermarket ammo compared to the surplus. The bolts on M41 rifles were not new, the Italians used the old bolts from the model 1891 Carcanos to save on production costs and time. While the rifle is over 70 years old, the bolt is over 100 years old.

The stock has been very nicely repaired and restored. The stock was raw and in two pieces when I got it. The Italians imported many in this condition but that is not period correct. To repair the two piece stock I inserted a threaded metal rod into the two pieces and used premium wood glue. However, during the repair the pin on the ""lower band spring"" snapped. I am looking for a replacement. It does stay in just fine even while it is fired. The hand guard has also been repaired before I owned it, I cleaned the repair up as best as possible. I have more pictures available upon request.

Asking $225 or best offer.

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING: This is a FTF only deal, must live in Michigan (in a reasonable driving distance), I will not ship (emails asking to ship will be ignored). Serious inquiries only. If you want to buy this rifle be prepared to give me your number so I can call you. If you have an issue with that, do not even contact me. There will be no texting!"

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

This load is the direct result of customers wanting the deep penetration of the expanding Barnes X style bullet in a 380 auto+P load. See the below real world velocities from my stock real world pistols. We always use over-the-counter firearms to establish our velocities as using extra long laboratory test barrels gives false high velocity readings and is misleading to the customer who will be firing the ammunition in the real world, not a lab.

1231 — fps - Browning Double Action-3.75 inch barrel
1235 — fps - Walther PPK-3.5 inch barrel - (faster than longer barrel above, no typo)
1130 — fps - Kel Tec PA3T-2.75 inch barrel
1136 — fps - Kahr P380-2.75 inch barrel
The all copper, long-for-weight, Barnes bullet is so long that when seated to an OAL of .940 to .950 inch, the base of the bullet will make a slight bulge in the case, but this DOES NOT affect feeding or chambering as the bulge is not pronounced enough to cause any problems, but in order to avoid endless emails, I’m mentioning it here. In fact, that bulge provides enough resistance to the bullet base, to stop the bullet from being battered deeper into the case upon feeding, which is a very good thing. If we load to a longer cartridge OAL, to eliminate the bulge, the cartridge will be too long to fit some magazines. Feeding was 100% in our over-the-counter test guns.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so the shooter will not be blinded if dropping the hammer in low light, which is when almost all civilian shootings occur in America."
