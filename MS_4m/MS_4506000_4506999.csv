EMP™ 1911A1 – Springfield’s Enhanced Micro Pistol (EMP) is the exceptional result of a successful effort to re-engineer the 1911 into a compact, short-action pistol. It’s the smallest, most easily concealed 1911 and is loaded with features you’d expect from a superior firearm. The 3"" stainless steel match-grade barrel delivers outstanding accuracy. Long, aluminum, match-grade trigger breaks cleanly at 5-6 lbs. Fixed, low-profile combat rear sight and dovetail front sight have three tritium dots for easy viewing in low light. A dual-spring, full-length guide-rod recoil system makes the EMP pleasing to shoot and ensures it cycles flawlessly. Forged aluminum-alloy frame with durable black hardcoat finish reduces weight, while the forged stainless steel satin finish contrasts nicely with the handsome thinline cocobolo-hardwood grips."

This model is one that still has the 18-round tube magazine (before they were reduced to 15-round). This was my brother's rifle, he didn't want it so he gave it to me. I've had it for a number of years, but the stock was beat up from being stored in his closet. So, I refinished the stock 2 years ago, and went with a lighter color finish. Overall the rifle is in good condition, some nicks in the finish to be expected, but the gun functions flawlessly. It's had at most a few hundred rounds through it since it was made in 1983. 

This would be a great plinking rifle, training gun for young folks, or even a great varmint rifle. It's got a 3/8"" dovetail mount for a rimfire scope. I'm including a speed loader with ammo (15 rounds x 8 tubes = 120 rounds) to help get you started.

Price is $140

Sale will be FTF in the Portland Metro area. I’ll need to see a current ODL and you must be at least 18 years old to purchase this rifle. CHL holders will be given preference.

These are all classic rifles acquired through the passing of a family member. If you are interested, please reply with your name and contact number and I will pass along to the family.
I'll give descriptions in the picture from top to bottom and please note, these are old firearms and while they are in pretty good shape, there are some cosmetic things that a little TLC from the right hands would clean up very nicely. Some light rust in some spots, no major scratches or dings, and all seemed to function very well.

1st up is a Ruger Carbine in .44 Mag.- also known as the Ruger Deerstalker. - it is loaded in the bottom much like a shotgun. It was produced from 1961-1985 and has a 4 round tubular magazine.I don't know what year it was made but it looks like it may be an older version- my opinion only based on the rest of the collection. $700 obo

2nd in the list is a Remington Fieldmaster 572 that shoots .22s, L & LR. This is an older model and you can tell by the weight and the wood. Heavy steel and real wood stock and fore grip. It may be the Smoothbore version- I forgot to check. $500 obo

3rd up is a nice Marlin 39A Microgroove lever-action rifle. .22s, L & LR. This is a nice piece and would be a great addition to anyone collection. $650 obo

Last but not least is a very well built Belgian FN-49 and based on some markings on both sides of the receiver, I THINK it was built for the Egyptian Military ( 8mm). Not 100% of the caliber as I could not find any caliber markings anywhere. But it is in great shape and by the reviews I've read - are very well built and solid rifles. $850 obo

Again- you contact me, I'll pass along your name/ number to the family and I am in no way saying they are Mint condition, but they are in great shape to be that old. Thx for looking.

1st up is a Ruger Carbine in .44 Mag.- also known as the Ruger Deerstalker. - it is loaded in the bottom much like a shotgun. It was produced from 1961-1985 and has a 4 round tubular magazine.I don't know what year it was made but it looks like it may be an older version- my opinion only based on the rest of the collection. $700 obo

2nd in the list is a Remington Fieldmaster 572 that shoots .22s, L & LR. This is an older model and you can tell by the weight and the wood. Heavy steel and real wood stock and fore grip. It may be the Smoothbore version- I forgot to check. $500 obo

3rd up is a nice Marlin 39A Microgroove lever-action rifle. .22s, L & LR. This is a nice piece and would be a great addition to anyone collection. $650 obo

Last but not least is a very well built Belgian FN-49 and based on some markings on both sides of the receiver, I THINK it was built for the Egyptian Military ( 8mm). Not 100% of the caliber as I could not find any caliber markings anywhere. But it is in great shape and by the reviews I've read - are very well built and solid rifles. $850 obo

Again- you contact me, I'll pass along your name/ number to the family and I am in no way saying they are Mint condition, but they are in great shape to be that old. Thx for looking.

The items in the for trade list are only for the SCAR's, otherwise they aren't available for sale or for trade for any thing else I'd take in trade for the other items that are for sale or for trade.

ITEMS FOR SALE OR FOR TRADE:
Spikes Tactical Dissapater - full magpul furniture in Foliage Green color - rifle length fore arm, fixed rifle length stock, BCM mod 4 charging handle, BCM mod 0 grip, and has a bunch of Magpul accessories - including magpul Foliage Green trigger guard, 3 QD holders installed in the stock, Para Clip front sling mount, rail for light, A2 rear sight, and includes 10 Magpul MOE 30 round magazines in Foliage Green.  Spikes lower with color filled safe selector area, Factory built Spikes upper, Spikes BCG. F marked front sight tower.  $1100 or I'll sell it without the 10 Pmags for $1000


 Spikes Tactical ST-22 22lr AR Upper - this has a 1x16 16"" barrel, Spikes blowback bolt setup - this is not a conversion kit - this is a factory built dedicated 22 upper.   The only change it has had was the installation of a 13"" Troy Alpha rail (Viking Tactical version) - great shooting 22LR, and easy to swap for plinking etc.  Unlike most .22lr AR's this one is built out of real standard AR parts - standard Spikes AR upper, barrel nut and handguard - and it uses a standard lower - all standard AR parts, with the exception of the barrel, bolt, and mags.   Want to make it a .223/5.56 upper, all you have to do is swap out the barrel and BCG for a 5.56 version - again this is not a pot metal set up like most of the AR-22's, it is standard AR parts.   I'm looking for $550 for the upper - I also have 9 black dog AR15-22 mags (4 AR15-22 in black, one in FDE, and 4 Black Dog X-Form with replaceable feed lips) 25 round mags, and a Black Dog 50 round drum that I'll sell for an extra $150 for all.

6.5 Grendel rifle - 18"" 1/7.5 twist heavy fluted barrel, A2 flash hider, YHM Todd Jarrett extended length free float tube (15"") - NiB BCG on a DPMS lower.   It will also include a 10 round mag.  Great setup, shoots really well with the Hornady 123g A-Max - this is for the rifle without the optic/mount for $850 (I'll sell the scope/mount for extra if someone wanted it - Its a Burris Fullfield II 6.5-20x50 with PEPR mount).

Rare Springfield Armory Linkless 1911 in .40 S&W - this is the linkless lug on the barrel (the Peters-Stahl design) - it is not an Omega model - just a regular 1911-A1 in two tone that is a linkless - these were only made for a year or two and most were in 10mm.  In great shape, really good trigger no issues at all.  It has no box, but will come with 3 magazines.   I'm looking for $1250 obo.

CVA bobcat 50 cal muzzle loader. It includes one pound of Pyrodex (unopened), an unopened box of Hornady .50 cal lead balls, 100 CCI percussion caps, and a tube of Bore Butter. Everything you need to get started. Looking for $160 for the package.

Weaver Kaspa 1.5-6x32 in really good shape and it includes a quick detach Burris PEPR mount - include box for scope - $175



ITEMS FOR TRADE FOR SCAR ONLY:

Glock 23 Gen 3 Great shape (also have extra magazines I could bundle with it)

Glock 22 Gen 3 Great shape (also have extra magazines I could bundle with it)

Glock 36 Gen 3 Great shape

CZ Scorpion EVO3S - Like new and have 10 30 round mags in addition to the original pair of 20 rounders it comes with

Beretta PX4/CX4 Storm combo - Full size 9mm PX4, great shape only a few hundred rounds thru it.  CX4 storm in great shape - about the same amount of rounds thru it.  Would come with a few 17 rounder mags, and a bunch of 20 rounders.


Again +/- cash as necessary (or multiple items for one etc.) - anything I don't have pics of I can send (as only 3 can be loaded).   Valid FOID required and all state laws followed (ISP check, waiting period, and signed BOS).  Again feel free to ask any questions you may have, and if you have items to trade a description of them would be greatly appreciated."

This firearm is identical to your typical revolver in that it has a swing out cylinder which makes reloading much quicker than the other NAA revolvers which need to be taken apart to reload. This is a great firearm! I only fired 10 rounds through it so its practically brand new.

It comes with 240 .22 Magnum hollow points, 20 CCI shotshells, a beautiful custom leather holster, made for this EXACT revolver. The holster also holds 5 spare rounds on the pouch. Also includes a set of red grips and the metal locking hard case and paper work that the gun came with. Feel free to text or email me if you have any questions. Thanks a lot!

Have a recently purchased hk416 22AR. Is equipped with a bushbell ar22 scope setting on a weaver 1in tactical mount. Great scope and clear glass.  Also have a total of 4 twenty rd mags with deal. I took to shooters and ran 80 rounds thru it and no hiccups. Gun is as new as can be without paying taxes or transfer fees LOL. Its a great top of the line 22 that i just dont get to use. Dont have much time to get to outdoor ranges. Its on paper from shooting indoors but would need dialed in better for more distance. This is a real AR22, not a lightweight plastic piece like the mossberg or smith. This has a solid quad rail, dust cover, the hk style stock and is a heavy solid rifle.
Optic, mount, and mags are close to 300 alone. Great training rifle to cut cost and save ur 5.56 ammo. Will also throw in remainder of the high velocity brick of winchester 22 with trade."

*Low Numbered* There are lots of tales of these firearms failing catastrophically, and many people are afraid to shoot them, shoot at your own risk.  That said, this rifle was made in 1917, and no Rock Island rifles produced that year suffered catastrophic failures.  

Rebarreled in 44,  Comes with original 1944 Boyt Leather sling, added to the firearm when the army ordinance corps. was trying to create a backup arsenal of rifles stateside.  Sling has some cracks, but has been stored well, and treated with Picard's antique leather care product.

Have a recently purchased hk416 22AR. Is equipped with a bushbell ar22 scope setting on a weaver 1in tactical mount. Great scope and clear glass. Also have a total of 4 twenty rd mags with deal. I took to shooters and ran 80 rounds thru it and no hiccups. Gun is as new as can be without paying taxes or transfer fees LOL. Its a great top of the line 22 that i just dont get to use. Dont have much time to get to outdoor ranges. Its on paper from shooting indoors but would need dialed in better for more distance. This is a real AR22, not a lightweight plastic piece like the mossberg or smith. This has a solid quad rail, dust cover, the hk style stock and is a heavy solid rifle.
Optic, mount, and mags are close to 300 alone. Great training rifle to cut cost and save ur 5.56 ammo. Will also throw in remainder of the high velocity brick of winchester 22 with trade."

The Model 552 is a direct descendant of the Remington 550 Design by Carbine Williams in North Carolina.  The Primary improvement is the addition of a Grooved Receiver that allows a scope mount, and new stock design. The 550's and 550-1's has roll engraving ""Williams Patents"" . The name of David ""Carbine"" Williams held the patent on the 550's ""floating chamber"" and had Remington include his name on the rifle. 
David Marshall Williams (November 13, 1900 – January 8, 1975) was the American firearms designer of the floating chamber and the short-stroke piston. Both designs used the high pressure gas generated in or near the breech of the firearm to operate the action of semi-automatic firearms like the M1 Carbine. Williams was instrumental in the design of the M1 Carbine used in WW2. Quite the genius in action design, he was played by Jimmy Stewart in a movie of the same name. 
This  gun is very good original condition, no rust on the bluing and very few light scratches on  the stock. The barrel is 24"" long. The gun was made before 1968 when the Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed, requiring serial numbers. The gun functions flawlessly. 
I will ship this rifle, at buyers expense and in compliance with all applicable laws. If sold outside the Raleigh NC area, I require advanced payment by postal money order. More Photos available upon Request."
