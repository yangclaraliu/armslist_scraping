Up for grabs is my newly acquired Glock 30s. I got this on a trade and have no real need for it as I like my xds better. This is a small sub-compact, double-stacked, thinned frame 45. The magazine capacity is 10 +1 and the recoil is surprisingly light. https://us.glock.com/products/model/g30s

A great choice for CCW carry in a holster. This particular firearm is in great shape, no real wear on the inside or outside. Will come with all the original goodies including case, 2 mags, lock, cleaning brush and rod, original sights, manual and shell casing. It also comes already fitted with Tru Glo Hi Viz sights, and stainless steel pins to replace the plastic ones in the trigger housing/trigger. I can also include a streamlight TLR 4 light/laser combo (pictured) for the right offer. These are high quality lights that work well in my experience. I'm asking $500 or best offer without the flashlight/laser. Will listen to fair offers or trades.

Winchester Model 12 in 20 gauge. This one is a little more rare then the others as most were 12 or 16 GA. Condition is a little above fair. Gun was reblued at some point in its life and whoever polished it got a little over zealous with the buffer as the writing on the barrel is ""washed"" out some...still legible but not a true professional job. Receiver is freckled on top and right side as pictures show. Left side of receiver is quite nice. Action is tight and bore is in good shape. This would be a great shooter or wall hanger. Furniture is nice with the exception of a small hairline crack under pistolgrip near rear screw of trigger guard. LOP is a bit short at around 12 3/4"" so I'm guessing someone of small stature or maybe a youth used the gun. Stock has a round medallion inletted into toeline with initials engraved in it. I'm asking 400 firm on this one you could also bring a trade. Look online and you'll see there aren't many 20's out there. 
I can send more pics upon request."

This Gen 1 version is built around the DA/SA trigger with the slide-mounted top decocker. This trigger is designed to be a little bit quirky; when you cock the striker by cycling the slide, it becomes a set trigger after cocking to engage single action mode. The double-action pull and single-action reset trigger are exactly as you'd expect.

Everything that I got from the original purchase is included in the sale. This means two 18-round magazines, the Serpa-style kydex holster with paddle and OWB attachments, replaceable backstrap, a magazine loader, an OEM wire cleaning brush, and of course the case which fits all of this together with Swiss Army knife efficiency.

I've taken it to the range 3 times, and put less than 200 rounds down the barrel.

If you want to hear way more about this gun than you need to, check out Nutnfancy's review on YouTube at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-DJbuBUEA). Cliff notes? He loves it (there, I just saved you 41.3 minutes of your life) and raves about its unexpected quality.

Since I appear to be the only human on the internet selling a titanium one, I'm pricing it at $360 cash. If you are a TX CHL holder, I'll drop that down to $340 for my private sale peace-of-mind.

Face-to-face sales only, cash or Venmo as currency, Bill of Sale will be requested for non-CHL sales, and I'm not considering trades.

This one has history!

It’s a Steyr Gewehr 88 from 1890, way before WWI when the German Empire still had a Kaiser (emperor) and looks to be having used in the fight with the Ottoman Empire (Persia, now Iran). It is also often erroneously referred to as “Mauser” or “Mannlicher”.

It has all the hallmarks and markings that make this a rifle to have, from the Emperor’s crown to the Ottoman insignia.

Kaiser Wilhelm II was Germany’s last emperor and this baby could have seen action in Persia, then the 1st World War, on to WWII.

The bore’s rifling is still exceptional an the rifling twist is incredible, especially with this extra long barrel. Rounds chamber tight and the rifle works flawlessly, we shot 2 boxes and the accuracy is incredible! You can actually see those 8mm extra large bullets hit where they impact, even at a distance. Speaking of which, it has a flip up sight for long range shots. Whatever you hit with this baby, it’s going down hard…

With the sight in regular mode, it is sighted to 273 yards, then you can flip it up and it’s range is from 500 yards, with approx. 110 yard increments to a total range of 2187 yards.

5 shot clip, which can be strip loaded for fast reloading…

At 124 years of age this puppy will give most modern rifles a run for the money especially in accuracy, my buddy with his scoped rifle couldn’t believe the distances that this will hit at, without even a scope.

REAL German quality, even after a 124 years, it becomes very apparent when shooting it.

While you can just hang it on your wall as a show-off rife, it will be a real joy to shoot, take it hunting and show your buddies how it’s done Old School…

You WILL NOT run across another one like, it is very rare…

I had the intention of reloading rounds for it, but never got around to it, which is why I’m including everything you need to reload the rounds yourself.

Here is what I’m including:

Black Desert Eagle .50AE with original box

Winchester reloading powder

42 rounds of Samson (IMI) ammo (This ammo was banned from import, and is very scarce to come by. Not to mention the ammo for this gun is notoriously expensive.)

X3 boxes of .50 cal bullets for reloading (New in box)

Reloading DIE set for .50 AE (Never used)

All the brass I have from shooting the gun 
Misc cleaning tools.

Asking $1300 for it."

Asking $875 obro.... email address below and (cell phone to text between 8a-10p only) cash gets best deal or trade toward one or more of guns below.  

Has around $1000 in it when new since special order and was before the surplus of AR's and I know prices have come down some. However, I'm in no hurry to sell.

Must be new or like new. Might consider a 34 plus cash. Other Glocks would really have to be a deal for me to consider but only 9mm, 45 acp or maybe .40. No stippling or frame modification please. Don't need crimson trace grips, extra barrels or holsters. I'll take them but since don't need they are not worth much to me.

Also would consider a 2014 or 2015 Ruger Lcp $250-300 range with multiple mags unless modded.


Don't really need laser Ruger 22/45 lite pistol 22lr Mark 2 (ii) or Mark 3 (iii) or maybe a similar 22 semi auto target pistol plus cash, no revolvers, no walther, no keltec please or any junk

Or as second gun in multi gun trade Remington 870 12ga, mossy 500, 935 or nicer semi auto Prefer pistol grip tactical or competition type with high capacity tube 6 or more rds or more. 


Or an LCR 357 or 38 ($350-400 range)

It has a 5 + 1 capacity, plus storage for 4 additional shells in the SpeedFeed buttstock (for a total of 10). It will come with the factory foregrip installed. The other foregrip is manufactured by SpeedFeed, but please note that you will not be able to install it without a slide tube (I do not have one to sell).

I told him I wanted to see how the gun looked with the parkerizing and he proceeded to lie and tell me he had already began stripping the gun.
I drove out there and paid these incompetent hicks a surprise visit and guess what, not only had he not began stripping the gun as he said he had, when I demanded he bring me the gun he brought it out covered in rust and corrosion, the idiot parkerized the  gun without even taking the forearm nut off, it was seized on the slide and I had to use a pipe wrench to get  the nut off. Of course when I pointed out how bad the gun looked he never apologized, as expected he got arrogant and professed how long he has been working on guns, the idiot acted like it was my fault he ruined my gun.

It's seem maybe 100 rounds while mounted and is still in perfect shape. Comes with the Vortex level and flip caps. The glass is VERY clear and if you're looking at this you probably already know that. Hard to find a better 1-6x or glass on any scope.  It has the Jerry Miculek (JM-1) designed reticle which makes it easy to gauge out to 600yrds. Like the title says, comes with a LaRue Tactical QD mount (SPR 1.5, LT104) which I got second hand, so it shows a little more wear.  Asking $1100 for both, $1000 for no mount, which I think is more than fair given the street price of the scope alone is $1399 and the mount is another $200+.

The Sako 85 Finnlight rifle is for those who foray deep into the wild to reach their goal. Hunters on mountain trails or on long-distance treks prefer high-performance rifles that are full-sized, yet still lightweight. The fluted barrel of the Finnlight is just one of the many features that make it ideal for the hunter seeking a perfectly trimmed light rifle. The Sako 85 Finnlight is also an excellent choice for women and younger shooters."

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Compact Pistol   Comes with the XD(M) Gear Package   3.8"" match-grade barrel Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes:interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case. XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact .45ACP"
