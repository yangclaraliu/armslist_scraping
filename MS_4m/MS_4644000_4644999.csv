This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extra mags we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are high capacity extended magazines to fit Smith & Wesson 6900 and 5900 series pistols, plus a few other pistols and rifles that followed those incomparable pistols’ designs. All factory magazines for the past several years shipped with Browning Pistols, and most of the Sigs, have been Mec-Gar. Smith & Wesson has begun using them with some of their polymer frame pistols. Mec Gar magazines are as good as, or better than, original factory mags. They lock the slides open like they're supposed to on the last shot; they free-fall eject correctly; and most important, they are always reliable, even with months of staying loaded. Manufacturer is Mec-Gar s.r.l. of Gardone, Italy. Importer is Mec-Gar USA of Middletown, CT. Construction is steel spring and lower plate, blued steel magazine bodies, and black high impact polymer followers and polymer buttplates. Each magazine holds 20 rounds of 9mm Luger Ammunition, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. These magazines will fit any metal frame 9mm Smith & Wesson pistol with double stack magazine well, manufactured from 1971 until 2002.

Don't think the bolt is ramped, but the entire thing is a kit and meant to work together. It might be a problem if you were to separate the parts, but together its fine.

No interest in separating anything out, want to sell the complete rifle and 3 mags all together.

I've shot this almost exactly 100 times with brass 115gr 9mm ammo. Works great, accurate, no issues at all. Bought it and thought it would be a great thing to plink with, but I don't have as much free time as I used to, would like to free up some money to get stuff I actually have time to use.

Fun to shoot, great for kids and beginners, no kick at all and pretty quiet compared to my 5.56, outside of a 22LR this is likely as good as it gets to introduce people to the world of firearms. Not deer legal for Indiana.

Price is negotiable, within reason."

VEPR AK in the 7.62x39 caliber. This is the V2 sight version I believe. VEPR's are built on reinforced RPK receivers and have much better barrels than the standard AK.

I've converted it to take surplus mags, added a Krebs angled block so it can take a collapsible M4 style stock,  US Palm pistol grip and also put an M16 style flash hider on it.

Great gun, shoots great, reliable, looks great (in my opinion). Don't have as much free time as I used to and would prefer to free some cash up for things I have time to do.

P30 9 mm (V3) DA/SA, ambidextrous safety lever/rear decocking button, with two 15 round magazines
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

P30 models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode. 

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

This is the 7.62X51/.308 Winchester, one in twelve twist model. This is the one that will reach out and touch someone. I'll let the stock photos tell the story but I'll just go over the features as she sits here on my lap. The upper receiver has an integral 16"" rail. The flip up rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. It allows you to flip between either of two different apertures. It can be moved forward or back on the upper rail. The flip up front sight is mounted on the gas block and is also windage and elevation adjustable. The post is square in cross section and about 1/16"" in width. The elevation adjustment is similar to that of the M16. The 16.25"" barrel is free floating; has a cold hammer forged, hardchromed bore; and its muzzle is threaded 5/8"" X 24tpi having what I expect to be a flash hider, although it suggests it might function as a brake as well. I couldn't find the answer to that on the FN website. The forearm has three accessory rails. There are ambidextrous integral forward and rear of receiver sling attachment points. They were designed for tactical slings, not traditional high power shooting slings. Shame on them. Oh well, ideas change, eh? There is a bolt hold open reminiscent of the M16. The magazine release is ambidextrous as is the safety/selector. Two positions only....sorry. The buttstock collapses and folds to create an overall length between 28.5"" and 38.5"". It has an adjustable cheek piece that elevates to fine tune your spot weld/sight picture. I like that because I tend to ""crane"" forward and take a tight weld which actually puts me low on the iron sights. With the cheek piece up, I get a perfect sight picture when I'm settled in the way I prefer. I'll bet this would be fun to shoot at distance. FN does brag about the long range accuracy, although it doesn't have what one would consider a target trigger. The pull is military heavy. The rifle weighs 8.0 lbs empty. An owner's manual, a lock, and one 20rd magazine are included. I have spare magazines available to the winner of the auction. That's it. What do you think? I will be glad to sell to you Americans in California or other oppressive states."

Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity.

The lower is complete and the slide assembly has everything as well (matching serial numbers between both), the only thing that I'm missing is the safety lever. I had this pistol for about 2 weeks (bought on Gun Broker); when I went to hit the de-cocker, the safety/de-cocker cracked into two pieces (see picture below). It's not really worth my time to try to fix it, so I'm selling the pistol for parts. 

These pistols are going on Gunbroker for $225-$300, and if you add up the parts on this gun, they are worth around the same amount. I will not part out the gun and sell individual parts, because I think it's worth more as is; the two magazines come with the firearm as well.

If you're interested in purchasing this gun for parts, e-mail me your name and phone number, and I will get back to you. Price is firm."

---------------

At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion ­free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat­, ­even on hot summer days. The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed­ carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub­chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip ­frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine ­release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left­handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best­ in­ class concealed­ carry and self­ defense pistol.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be.

For a background, these rifles were made with forged receivers and are regarded to be tougher receivers than modern Springfield Inc. M1A's but had soft bolts which caused issues later down the line. This one has had the bolt swapped for a TRW bold and now it is a fantastic rifle and a great shooter. Comes with one 10 round magazine, a bipod and one 20 round magazine.
