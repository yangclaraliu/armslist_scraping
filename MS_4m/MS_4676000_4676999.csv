Looks like its Canadian marked and british nitro marked. Unsure if it was rebuilt in India or if someone rebuilt it here useing Indian wood. Butt and receiver and barrel seem to match patina wise and barrel date is i believe 1945. Pitting under the wood line is definitely something a bit more the minor but i dont think it will make this unshootable . Looks worse in photos i feel.

41,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4676041,For Sale:  Nighthawk Custom T3 9mm 1911 Factory New,"North Carolina, North Carolina, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, September 8, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This auction is for a Factory New, Factory
Warrantied Nighthawk Custom T3 in 9mm. The
photo on this auction is a stock photo. The
actual pistol has all factory zip ties and tags
intact. We do NOT allow the public to fondle
these pistols. The T3 is the ""Ultimate Concealed
Carry Pistol"": Nighthawk designed this little
pistol to allow users to pack the powerful 45acp
in a small package, but due to its popularity
they now offer it in 9mm. A 4.25"" bushing barrel
allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the
weight down when compared to pistols of
comparable size with tapered cone barrels.
Already loaded with options, most customers
want it just the way it is. When it comes time
to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot
to consider. You need something that is reliable,
accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need
something that you can enjoy shooting a lot,
because there is no substitute for practice.
That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this
pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be
a workhorse that can stand up to thousands
and thousands of rounds. The T3 has the best
features for any gun its size. The frame is
based on the Officer model, but for those with
large hands, it features an extended magazine
well that gives you the length you need to get
all your fingers on the grip. The extension also
serves another function. The hand-cut geometric
angles really add to the looks as well. The slide
is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a
better sight radius. Another consideration is
weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce
lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes
the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry
pistol. Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night
Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as
well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally
serrated to match. This feature also helps
prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats
that checkering often causes. The top of the
slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A
Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum
trigger that has been blacked-out using Perma
Kote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no
creep. When you put all of these features in one
package, you come up with the finest carry gun
you can own. All you add is practice.

If you do research on this rifle, or know your stuff, you know that these were some of the last ditch effort rifles produced by the Germans in WWII, and the factories where they were being made were eventually invaded by the French who took over production.  The French produced svw MB rifles are much more common.  This is a 100% German completed rifle.

Fires a 7.92x57mm round, also known as 8mm Mauser.  I have some FMJ and some soft point ammo I can include if the buyer wants to use this as a deer rifle for the season coming up!

The good:
The action and barrel are in fantastic shape.  The bore is a little dark, but it isn't pitted.  There is a very small amount of surface corrosion on the front sight.  I haven't cleaned any of this off because it is such a collector's piece.  This is an all-numbers matching rifle.  Every number checks out on every piece included.  Action is SMOOTH like the Mauser action is known to be!

The bad:
It was duffle cut by the soldier who brought it back and as such it is missing the top handguard for the stock, the front of the stock where both barrel bands would be, missing both barrel bands, a front sight hood, action screws, and the butt plate.  The stock has also been painted white, but that's because these rifles had to be sealed up before they were allowed to be shipped back.  The gun as is tells a great story.  However, a full kriegsmodell stock in red laminate would make this a nearly complete collectors piece, which has been quoted at and known to sell at auctions for upwards of $3,000.

This would make for a fantastic project for an avid collector.  I just don't fit that role and I know the soldier who brought it back would have liked to see it go to someone who can appreciate it more than I can.  Since it's only worth what someone is willing to pay, I'm only asking $600 cash.  I'm not interested in trades as I'm trying to get out from under this gun, and another gun would just put me in the same boat."

This weapon has had approximately 200 rounds fired through it since I purchased it [new] back in February.

I've never had any issues with it firing, loading, ejecting etc.

The gun has never been carried. I purchased it as a carry weapon for my girlfriend but she prefers a snub-nosed revolver. It has spent maybe a total of 3 hours outside of the safe and had been fully detailed at the 100 and 200 round interval. I have been shooting for the past 15 years so I am very meticulkous with my firearms. 

Comes in factory box with the factory test cartridge, carrying case, lock, takedown key, owners manual, and the original receipt of purchase. I paid $369+tax ($394 total) for this handgun back in February and these little things are getting more hard to find with the Lilac polymer frame.

I am asking either $310 or trade for a S&W revolver. 

Buyer must bring their drivers licence and either CCW or military ID. I reserve the right to make a copy of your ID for my own protection. Shoot me a text anytime or give me a call after 5pm.

All pieces based on ACU pattern platform
Handmade Sniper Ghillie Suit
Low crawl Camouflage Desert Camo
Pictures are of Actual Ghillie Suit that is being sold

Not as light or pretty as the ones that are being mass produced for airsoft but is that what you want to trust.

 Ghillie Suits are camouflaged suits made of burlap, twine and similar materials that provide a high degree of concealment for military snipers, hunters, and paintball/airsoft players. Although some ghillie suits are manufactured for sale, many military snipers and others make their own suits, both for the ritual and also for matching the suits to certain climates and terrain. 
 Every individual has their own traditional preferences. The single most important of these is an apparently strong desire to spend as much time as  possible crawling around. Extremely low profile and as little burlap as possible between them and the ground. The suits tend to be, simple with no particular frills, built on function rather than “gimmicks”

Military Suits have limited jute on the front (to discourage snagging) for low crawling situations

TOP
Top is built on Large/Regular ACU top, Height 67” to 71”, Chest 41” to 45” 
Hand built to assure that no signature (unnatural pattern) is evident

The zipper on the jacket is covered , with the reinforced panel and  added Velcro to protect assembly
Heavy re-enforced front “crawl panel” ,with padding between it and the base, allows some comfort during stalking (heavy canvas material) 
Arm/Sleeves are also re-enforced with padding at the elbow and have removable/replaceable pads, not the thin issue style but heavy formed pads
One pocket on the upper part of each sleeve have been retained from the original top
Velcro tighteners at the wrist to adjust fit

TROUSERS/PANTS 
Trousers are built on Large/Long ACU, Waist 35” to 39”, Inseam 32 ½” to 35 ½” 
Hand built to assure that no signature (unnatural pattern) is evident 
Netting covering the back 
Jute hand tied to the netting covering the base , tied in various locations to attach natural vegetation or additional jute
Heavy re-enforced “crawl panels”, with padding, on each leg are attached to the front of the trousers and crotch area 
Button Fly has been covered by crawl panel for a more uniform fit
Waist adjustment can be done with original “string ties” inside as well as slider adjustment on the outside back of trousers.
Legs can be secured with “string ties” on the inside

Thank God I didnt meet this asshole, i might have been forced to shoot his crazy ass. What a hassle that would have been.

This pistol has around 600 rounds through it and is superbly reliable, as Glocks tend to be. It comes with three compact 10 round magazines with finger rest base plates (original base plates included too), one full size Glock 20 15 round magazine, and one 10 round Glock 20 magazine. Also included are three boxes of defensive ammo--two Hornady Custom 180gr XTP and the other 180gr Federal Hydra-Shok.

As for the reloading gear, which you probably want if you're going to be shooting a lot of 10mm: A set of Lee 40 S&W/10mm carbide dies (four die set), a bunch of once- and twice-fired brass (around 300 pieces), and 600 projectiles (Berry's 165 gr hollow base flat point). I also have one box of Federal AE factory rounds laying around. And I'll throw in some caliber-specific plastic ammo boxes for your reloads.

I probably won't break up the reloading stuff from the pistol as if I end up keeping one I'll want the other. I don't shoot this gun a whole lot and am just looking to see what kind of offers I get in terms of trades. I'd also take $650 cash which is a pretty sweet deal if you're looking to enter the world of 10mm with a pistol, magazines, and reloading components. Just the reloading components and ammo would easily set you back $200."

This particular variant of the 1911 is used by our elite military and law enforcement personnel. The Professional is most famous for it's use by the FBI's elite hostage rescue team…""HRT"" for short. It is the most stringently tested 1911 in history and has been in constant production since approximately 1998. It has earned a reputation as a hard nosed, never let you down and sometimes, larger than life topic of how good it is or is not. ""Ooohs"" and ""aaahs"" are regularly heard from the 1911 crowd if one is out on display at a shop. The Professional models meet or exceed all specifications of the FBI SWAT contract, including the accuracy requirement of 1.5"" or better at 25 yards with Remington Golden Saber ammunition. The civilian pistols and the FBI pistols are built at the same time, with the gunsmiths never knowing whether a civilian or FBI agent will be using the pistol. These pistols are built approx. every 45 days, with the FBI order being filled first and civilian orders getting all of the remaining from the production run. (Two Year waiting list or longer.) These pistols do not have front cocking serrations or full length guide rods because the FBI chose not to have these features on their pistols. (Front cocking serrations catch on clothing and full length guide rods require additional tools for dis assembly. The accuracy requirement, however, was yet another requirement that bordered on the impossible. This stipulated that the pistol fire three consecutive 10-shot groups no larger than 1.5 inches at 25 yards from a Ransom Rest using service ammunition. The pistol then had 20,000 rounds fired through it and was again tested for accuracy. No more than a 15% accuracy reduction was permitted. A single stoppage over 2,500 rounds disqualified a pistol from the competition. Several notable manufacturers of 1911 type pistols submitted bids and test pistols, but when the testing was completed, only Springfield’s candidate met the performance criteria and the rest, as the old saying goes, is history. Springfield originally designated all pistols built to the FBI standard “Bureau Model,” but the FBI protested, so the name was changed to Professional Model. All Professional Model pistols, whether for government issue or commercial sale, are identical and carry the serial number prefix “CRG.” Each pistol has every component fitted to the closest tolerances possible while maintaining reliability and accuracy.Only the best components are used to assemble the pistol, but is how Springfield’s Custom Shop builds each pistol that makes them special. When the shooter disassembles the pistol, he finds that each major component—barrel, barrel bushing, slide stop and slide—is numbered with the last three digits of the pistol’s serial number. None of these components will fit any other pistol.  

Gun includes 6 magazines, VZ Grips (white pictured) and original Springfield grips.

""Fabrique Nationale D'armes De Guerre Herstal-Belgique""
""Browning's Patent Depose""

Slide/Barrel/Frame matching numbers.

Crisp, 4 - 4.5# trigger pull

Here's the story on these guns.  Picked up the BHP couple years back.   Finish was gone, but the mechanics (except the guide rod) and bore were great.  Took the finish down and re-finished with Lauer Duracoat - White and Tactical Black.  

At the time, I was thinking of winter varmint hunting, so I decided on a matching AR15.  Of course, the hunt never came and the AR15 became another unfired safe-queen.  Only defects are a little abrasion on the top of the stock from pulling the charging handle with the stock collapsed and a tiny mark from contact in the safe (gotta look hard to see any flaws).

I did carry the BHP for a little while.  Probably has 150 or so rounds down the pipe since the restore - who knows how many rounds before that.  Shot it a couple times in local practical pistol matches.  Accurate and reliable - it is a Browning.  It does show a touch of wear from carry/cleaning, but still looks great.

The BHP has a couple carry marks and the duracoat is worn a little on the slide rails internally.

Individually, they look a little strange.  Together they are an awesome pair.  Two of the greatest firearms of all time.

I'd like to get $1200 for the pair - a fair price for those guns with the finish and quality parts.  Might consider breaking them up if they don't sell as a pair.  Open to offers as well.

I will need to see NCDL and purchase/CCW permit.  I can't stomach the idea of some thug wandering around Asheville with one of my former weapons.  I don't mind presenting my ID and permit, no reason for a buyer not to do the same.  If you can't legally own one of these, don't ask me to sell it to you.  Cash only, please no BS.  Meetings at reasonable times and in public places only.

Thanks for looking!

A particular gun upgrade is a personal thing like particular trigger pull or upgrade gun sights.

First gun I bought back in 09 used. Started life with a 28"" Barrel. Went through my tactical phase and was painted flat black, then dark earth. Barrel was cut down to 19"" and crowned and polished now a cylinder bore. Has a fiber optic front sight on it and is sporting a rattle can gloss finish with the paint wearing off. Come with an ATI full pistol grip stock and a Magpul Handguard fitted on it.

Not a prize piece as far as the finish goes but the action is glass smooth and she runs like a champ.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

I bought the Gun new in 1998 and it's been a great shooter. The Red dot was put on a couple of years ago but I haven't shot it since to sight it in. The standard sight are OK but this should make it a fun plinker. It does not have the later Ghost Ring Sights. It may have had 200 to 300 rounds through it not sure. I've always shot FMJ through it.

There is one small blemish on top of the barrel a couple of inches back from the front sight. A small scratch through the finish maybe 1/16"" long.

I'm Looking for a best offer here. I know that it is rare for these to come up for sale so I think that if you really want this please be realistic on what you offer. NO low ballers Please. NO I WILL NOT TAKE A TRADE OF ANY KIND PERIOD!!!! SO DON'T ASK.
