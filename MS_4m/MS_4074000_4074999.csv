I literrally just picked this gun up from my FFL dealer a few hours ago. Its brand spanking new I just pulled it out of the box to check it out before excepting from the transfer from the FFL.
I originally decided I wanted to add a .40 cal to my collection and have been lookking at the FNS for a while so ordered this. The following day I started second guessing my decision to buy a .40 instead of going with a 9mm. By the time I decided I would definitely rather have a 9mm instead of a .40, the gun was already shipped, so I figured I would get it and list it for trade and see whats out there. I have a pretty huge ""wish list"" so below is just a small sample and I'm open to offers so feel free to make an offer.

Galco S3H Shoulder Holster Component for .40, .45 Handguns customizes your Galco shoulder harness system of choice with a holster capable of carrying .40 and .45 caliber handguns. Galco's S3H holster component is made for a variety of .40 and .45 handguns, and will work with Galco Miami Classic, SSII, and Galco half harness systems. This Galco holster features a thumb break and will accept a tie down. The Galco S3H .40, .45 Handguns Shoulder Holster Component is constructed of premium saddle leather and is available in tan or black finish for right or left-handed shooters. This is a holster only, not a complete system. The modular interchangeable component shoulder systems (originally known as the ""Jackass Rig"") were invented by Galco International in 1970. Today, Galco continues to offer quality and versatility by developing products that enable you to design the perfect system to suit your needs. For example, you may assemble a two-handgun rig, a half harness system, or add tie downs and cuff case to an existing system. The possibilities are endless, and the Galco S3H Shoulder Holster Component for .40, .45 Handguns is just one possible component for your rig."

Stock and pump have normal light use marks with no cracks or chips, bluing is excellent with only normal wear areas as expected. Barrel stamping is clear and un-marred. Bore is bright and clean rifling shows little to no wear. A Marble’s Flexible Joint Rear Sight (W15) is attached to the tang via the factory tang screw holes. I do not have the actual round count but the Rifle was shot very little and stored for many years. This is an awesome Winchester rifle that would fit great in a collection. Asking $950 you will not find many of these available in this condition.  More pictures available on request.
 I have pictures of the rifle but was unable to load them
I also have a second model 61 in good condition (75%) for $650 contact me for more details."

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and the new profile slide (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

It is in great shape.  Listed below are the modifications and what the gun comes with.

Previous owner stated that it had 1000 rounds or less fired through it.  I have fired approximately 500 rounds through it since owning.  

Many consider this gun to be the best, or one of the best, AK-47's ever imported.  It is similar to the Arsenal SLR-95 and SA-93 with minor differences: original stocks,  the lack of muzzle brake on the SA 93 and 90 degree gas block on the SLR 95 as opposed to the 45 degree on the SLR-96.  All three were originally imported with a thumbhole stock, plastic on the SLR-95.  If you are not familiar you could do research on any of these three as they are all very similar.

-All of the modifications below are the highest quality components, not cheap parts, like you see on many modified AK’s.  Links are included for your convenience.

-Has been professionally cereakoted ($180) after I purchased it, so only approximately 500 rounds fired since cerakoting.

-Has a CAA, AK stock tube and FAB Defense GL shock stock with adjustable cheek riser.
http://store.commandarms.com/products/AKTM.html
https://www.themakogroup.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=1042638&CAT=8666

-Tapco G2 Trigger group installed for 922R compliance.  Comes with the original trigger group.

-Has Magpul rail covers and Grip Pod GPS-02 (not a knock off Grip Pod).
-Has a FAB Defense AK pistol grip.

-Has a FAB Defense VFR-AK rail system.  This rail system is very rigid/solid.  System allows the top cover to be removed and the gun field stripped without removing the rail system.  The groove down the middle allows you to use the iron sights when no optic is mounted.  In combination with the cheek riser on the stock it is very comfortable to use with a higher mounting optic like an EOTech.
https://www.themakogroup.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=1035201&CAT=8673

-Does not come with the pictured EOTech and Magnifier.

I am willing to ship FFL to FFL for the gun.  Buyer would cover the cost of shipping plus insurance for all items if purchasing.  If trading I would cover the cost of shipping this gun and buyer would cover the cost of shipping FFL to FFL for the gun they are trading.

The barrel is a beautiful heavy Stainless Steel with the desired 1 in 7 twist with flash hider. It also has the front sight and a bayo lug. It is railed for the optic as well. It comes with a new $150 Bushnell Hi-rise TRS-32 Multi coated Red Dot optic that was designed for the AR. It co-witnesses with the factory sights and works great together. All furniture, adjustable stock, for-end, pistol grip, magazine and forward grip are aftermarket official MOE Mag-pul. The lower is a new mil-spec Palmetto State Armory, no cheap polymer lower here. The lower has also had the logos color matched to the barrel and BCG for a nice custom look. This rifle can shoot either .223 or 5.56, so no worries about your ammo choice. I am mainly looking to trade for multiple guns, possibly an AR10, etc. Pics coming tomorrow. Just message with your offers."

I literrally just picked this gun up from my FFL dealer a few hours ago. Its brand spanking new I just pulled it out of the box to check it out before excepting from the transfer from the FFL.
I originally decided I wanted to add a .40 cal to my collection and have been looking at the FNS for a while so ordered this. The following day I started second guessing my decision to buy a .40 instead of going with a 9mm. By the time I decided I would definitely rather have a 9mm instead of a .40, the gun was already shipped, so I figured I would get it and list it for trade and see whats out there. I have a pretty huge ""wish list"" so below is just a small sample and I'm open to offers so feel free to make an offer.
