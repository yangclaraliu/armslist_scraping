15,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4457015,For Sale:  Mid-90s Crosman 1389 Backpacker converted to 22cal. $175 obo,"Lakeside area, Fort Wayne, Indiana",$ 175,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 24, 2015",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This was originally a .17cal 1389 backpacker I purchased at Walmart sometime between 1995-1996.
I started the conversion in 2013.  It is .22cal now...assembled and fully functioning...hits hard...as fun
as it gets.  Sorry, no chrony numbers, I don't have one and couldn't quite get phone/tablet software
chrony to work indoors.

From all I've learned while working on this project, I honestly believe this setup can produce
...in the ballpark of...650-700 fps with 14.3g pellets at 15-20 pumps...13-15 fpe.
It currently has a combination of new/original valve internals, ie: check valve, valve stem and spring,
with no threads cut off of the original brass valve in an effort to target a ""low volume-high pressure,
14 inch barrel"" system.  It fully dumps 20 pumps.

In the right home, this multi-pumper could still benefit from some minor work and tweaking.
I'm just going in a different direction to find a solution for a bugout bag protein gitter.

I'm probably wrong, but, it seems that everything I'm including in this sale is merely one purchase away
from two entire pellet guns, would need 2nd grip/frame with trigger internals...last time I checked $25
http://alliancehobby.com/gripframe.htm

Individual dollar amounts, shown below, added up = $262
...not to mention original price of the 1389 Backpacker back in the 90s

As .22cal it now includes:

-Original Backpacker shoulder stock with original ""fat"" forend, green ($25 value?)
-Original rear-cocking system that work ever so nicely...can carry loaded and not pumped/cocked.
   (no longer available anywhere?...$30 value?)
-Original pistol grip frame, including nicely broken-in trigger mechanism and plastic safety
   (sweet, smooth, crisp trigger)
-Original brass valve, flattened and ported by Mellonair, (brass no longer available anywhere? (*)
-New flat-top piston from Mellonair. (*)
-New steel pivot pin, replacing the original rolled steel pin, with brass nuts and spacer
   in middle of pump lever (Mellonair (*).
-New Crosman .22cal, 14"" barrel ($40...my first and only Ebay WIN!)
-New aluminum breech from Alliancehobby, left side bolt, 2 x barrel set screws,
   accommodates plastic rear site, grooved for scope mount, accepts/uses 2-piece bolt ($60)
-New ""model 1322"" main tube and plastic barrel band/front site from Alliancehobby.
 ($30, shipped with all internals including pump arm, etc...all unused parts included in spare parts)
-New ice cube maker poly tubing transfer port.
-New brass screws/nuts on forend. ($2)
-New NCStar 4x20 scope ($10)
(*) I spent roughly $50 to get: Mellonair flat-top piston, flatten and port my original brass valve,
steel pass-through bolt and steel pivot-pin/brass nuts.

Spare parts included in sale and not used in current setup (I'm sure I probably left something out,
but will include every last part/piece I have):

---original ""1389 Backpacker"" main tube, nicely polished inside, stored 15 yrs with one (maybe two)
    pump of air, that it held, bluing is about 97-98%, very minor surface rust in places, could still be used
---original barrel spacer
---original .17cal steel breech including all screws
---original 14 inch .17cal barrel including little steel bushing that fits barrel into breech,
    still nicely rifled and no rust
---original .17cal swing-out pellet bung (in great shape)
---original and new steel transfer ports with original rubber grommet/seal
---original and new plastic pistons/cups
---new .22cal swing-out pellet bung ($15, Alliancehobby, purchased before I found direction of project,
    currently not being used because of the new aluminum breech with bolt)
---new pump arm hardware including new thin-style forend (black)
---.22cal steel pass-through bolt from Mellonair (needs some work to function with left-side bolt *)
---various proprietary screws, couple allen wrenches, roll pins for pivot and forend, etc.

This is an unbelievable rifle that shoots incredibly well.  It's ultra lite design makes it perfect for smaller women or first-time shooters  - offering better stability with the lighter weight combined with the add-on Pic rail and Fore Grip - and easier to shoot with a decreased recoil.

This is the most comfortable AR I've ever fired!

PERFECT for women or for instructing younger shooters to shoot their first AR.

The $750 price included everything listed above and seen in pics - will consider selling for less for just the basic gun (w/o bottom rail, fore grip & red dot optics).

We are selling this gun simply because I bought it as a weapon to use in teaching our teenage daughter to shoot - and as a much smaller girl than most her age, this gun was just too much for her.  IT IS A PERFECT GUN IN PERFECT CONDITION OFFERED HERE AT A SUPER DEAL!

Therefore, I have one COMPLETE Strong Mount for the 650 (raises your machine 6.5 inches off your bench) including the $6 hardware packet to mount machine to any workbench. The hardware to mount the Dillon to the strong mount is sealed in the strong mount box, so you are good to go as far as using this kit to mount your machine.

I've already paid for shipping one-way on this thing, but am looking to sell it BELOW COST, as I'd rather not return-ship it to Arizona...but I will if necessary. Price is FIRM, as this is over $60 shipped from Dillon. Face-to-face, Tampa/St Pete only.

Bought new in December 2014. I have put approximately 200-250 (only quality) rounds through it, and it was cleaned after every shoot. I'm only selling it because I bought a Sig P938 that I like more.

The flush fitting mag now has a Pearce grip extension which makes shooting it feel very comfortable. I have the rubberized Talon Grips on the pistol and mag extensions. It is very grippy, but still very comfortable against the skin when CCW. The gun will include an Uncle Mike's IWB holster, Safariland 6378 ALS belt holster with the auto lock system, a DeSantis Mini-Scabbard holster, and a black kydex mag holder for the additional magazine.

FYI: Any sale will have a bill of sale/signed transfer for our liability purposes.

452,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4457452,For Sale:  Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic (red dot),"Downtown, Portland, Oregon",$ 320,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 30, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Like-new with original box. I'm the original owner. I purchased this optic about a month or two ago, and I used it three times on one of my AR-15 rifles. I'm going to stick with my Aimpoint M4s, so this PRO Patrol Optic is up for sale. It's never been abused, subjected to rain, smoke, or anything else. It works great, has variable settings, can be left ""on"" for two years, and has a 2-minute-of-angle dot (meaning it covers two inches at 100 yards). I've even used it for shots out to 300 yards.

Cash only, no trades, and no offers (price is absolutely firm). I keep a *very* busy schedule, so here's the deal: I won't respond to offers less than $320 cash at all, I won't drive anywhere outside of Portland to meet you, I won't answer any questions that you can't answer using Google, and I won't hold the optic for you for days or a week while you get funds (or your sh_t) together. Sorry, don't mean to be rude, but you'd be AMAZED as to the emails I've received trying to sell this optic. It's like a soap opera. This is a GREAT deal for someone who wants a rugged, accurate, and fast site. It's priced $100 lower than a new one (being only a month or two old).

The pictures are stock photos, but I can send you a photo of mine too if that's critical for your decision. Thanks!

From Aimpoint:

""Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841: Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."""

The shotgun is approximately 1 year old, has had 21 rounds fired through it then it has set under a bed for home defense. When racking a round in the chamber you have to push the forearm hard forward for the shell to seat and then hard back to eject it. Someone with gunsmithing experience shoudl be familiar with how to fix it. I have been told aftermarket parts can cause these issues. 
There are many accessories included (listed below):
Heat Sheild (installed)
18.5 inch breacher barrel (installed)
20 inch barrel (original)
5 round mag tube (installed)
7 round mag tube (original)

This gun is awesome, and hate to see it go. Purchase price for this gun new is over 3000, and is a special order item, build time 12-18 months. I am selling for 1300. thanks for looking.
