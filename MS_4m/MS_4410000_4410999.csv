Training Responsibly Armed Citizens

Interested in getting your Utah Concealed Carry permit?
Now is your chance!!!

I live in Wisconsin, why would I want a Utah permit?
If you wish to carry a concealed weapon in another state while on vacation for example, you must either possess that state’s concealed carry permit, or one that the state you are visiting recognizes (or one that has a reciprocity agreement).  Utah is widely recognized as having a large number of states that either offer reciprocal rights, or recognize the Utah permit.

In how many states can I carry with the Utah permit?
As of May 10, 2015 17 states have written reciprocal agreements with Utah and another 18 recognize the Utah permit for a whopping 35 states!

Can I just get a Utah permit and use it in Wisconsin?
No.  Utah insists that if a state that recognizes the Utah permit (Wisconsin is one of these), an applicant must first obtain a Concealed Weapons/Firearms Permit/License from their own state and include a copy of it with their Utah application.  The good news, if you need to obtain your Wisconsin CCW License, I have a course just for you!  Call or email me for further details REDACTED or REDACTED). Please note that Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification specifically notes that you must take their course content and it cannot be taught in conjunction with other states classes.

I’d love to get the Utah permit, what do I do now?
Let me know by email (REDACTED) and I will arrange a registration packet for you.  In that package you will receive a copy of the Utah Concealed Firearm Permit application.
You will also need to get:
•	one set of fingerprints on the fingerprint card that I give you (more on that in the registration packet)
•	a copy of your Wisconsin (or your home state) CCW or CFP with the expiration date clearly visible,
•	a recent color passport photo (2”x2”, no hats or sunglasses) with your name on the back.
After the successful completion of the course you should get a certification letter that will accompany your application and you will get your application stamped with my Certified Instructor’s stamp – this is mandatory for your application.

Truly it is not that difficult, and think of the freedom to carry in so many areas!
The next class will be held the afternoon of Saturday June 13, 2015 at the Holiday Inn Express located in Fort Atkinson at the junction of Highway 12 and Highway 26 REDACTED), details for the time will be mailed out shortly.

Cost for the Utah Class is $85.00
There is a loyalty discount for anyone that has taken the Wisconsin CCW class within the past 12 months.  Call me for details! REDACTED)"

Glock ambidextrous holster


This is a near NEW pistol with only 25 rounds through it!! This is what the gun gurus have to say about this weapon,,,, 
 ""It has the extra strike power of a .40 caliber, but has a very controlled feel with little recoil.  Accurate.  Always shoots, insanely reliable even in horrendous conditions.  Can remove the slide and change out the barrel to a 9mm in about 15 seconds (cheaper ammo = bonus).  The Glock 23 is the gun of choice for law enforcement & the FBI too."" 
Great shooting gun that just needs a new home!

Inside the flap is printed LX17ED.....probable Mfg date code/lot number? Looks like 1961 but the trays are styrofoam, so I'm guessing early 1970's?

Ammunition is 93 grain full metal jacket (round nose) in the little bottleneck cartridge....just what your Luger likes!

You don't find this collectible ammo very often and only a couple companies are still making it so those who like to shoot their old relics need to grab it when they find it, and this caliber disappears QUICKLY!! If you can find the brass you can reload, but this will give you 300 rounds to shoot in your .30 caliber Luger and then you will have 300 new casings to reload!

OR if you collect odd ammunition like this caliber, you don't come across clean stuff like this too often. These boxes are clean, nice colors and in great shape except a few have traces of old price tags that have been removed long ago.....some dirt on the tag residue...otherwise nice (VG-Exc.).

Buy this stuff now as it will be gone fast.....but I'd like to sell it together in one lot......and it's cheaper that way. I have seen this ammo going for over 50 bucks a box as it is an oddball caliber by today's standards....get it while you can!

My price is a really good deal at $35 a box, or all six boxes for $200.00 cash.
Thanks for looking!"

ATTRIBUTES:
-Extremely simple to use
-Light and short ( easy to maneuver )
-Compact and can be disassembled into 2 main parts that fit in a backpack.
-Powerful
-Versatile ( Can chose and control what ammunition to fire )


** Problems with any NEW Stoeger SxS or O/U shotgun OUT OF THE BOX
-The gun is very stiff.. to the point where it is inconvenient/discouraging to use.
-You need two hands to press on the level to release the gun open. 
-And when released to open, the gun has to be taken over the knee to open for reloading
-The gun has a lot of recoil force because it is so light.  You need a recoil pad, but the extra length of the pad makes the gun too long to shoot comfortably.

IMPROVMENTS
-All points of metal friction has been polished and the barrel drops open smoothly.
-The tension on the release lever to break open the shotgun has been reduced to a light push of thumb.
-chamber has been polished so shells will fall out with a modest jerking of the gun.
-Gun stock has been custom fit (shortened ) to allow for the additional thickness of a recoil pad.  The length after the recoil pad will be approx. the same as the gun out of the box."

The hospital has a helipad in case of an emergency.  The nearest neighbor is just one street down on torrey rd.  Nearby, you have Aztec Falls where people go hike and enjoy the water. There are also the hotsprings that you can enjoy. The lot is just like pretty much all mountain lots and is not completely level. The utilities are nearby where the neighbor lives. It has great views with a park just above the lot that has even better views. The lot is valued at $3,824 by the county of San Bernardino.

The previous owner cut it down to 19 7/8"" (above MI's legal length requirement) with a pipe cutter and did a solid job, so there's nothing to worry about there. I've taken her out a couple times and she's been pretty reliable at about 20 yards. Sometimes the ejector is a little stiff through the first couple shells but it warms up quickly.
