Up for sale is a very nice franken-glock. Started its life as a Gen 4 glock 22. The slide was taken off a MPD gun, and does not match the frame. The .40 barrel and frame are NIB unfired, as is the KKM .40-9mm conversion barrel. Slide has minor holster wear and generic Supressor sights. RMR is a trijicon RM07 w/adjustable brightness (no box) and has minor lens scratches from use. Frame has been completely stippled and has a trigger undercut. Package includes gun, both barrels, 2x10 round .40 mags, 1x15 round .40 mag, 1x17 round 9mm mag, Serpa, glock factory case, backstraps, etc. and a box of .40 golden saber. Please note while this is a non matching set, both barrels are NIB unfired. Great way to get into the RMR game decently cheap!...selling because another firearm opportunity has surfaced that this could fund!"

This load is designed to cause disabling terminal effect, combined with the penetration required to cause fast incapacitation on human sized targets from any angle. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue as it passes through, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living material. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and thus deep. The hard cast construction will not deform on flesh and bone at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant along with bullet path and terminal damage. Full wad cutter profiles in large calibers (like .45 and .44) hit like a truck and do massive permanent damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer and gun fighter Jim Cirillo used full wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his targets with certainty. See our Item #20D (38 SPL).

Expect about 24 inches of straight-line penetration in living mammalian material with this load.

We test our ammunition in real world over-the-counter firearms to establish our published velocities so that our customers can know what this ammunition is doing in the real world, not a laboratory where long test barrels are used and give false high velocity readings. See our below velocities fired from my personal firearms.

1057 fps - Ruger Vaquero 2006 large frame 5.5 inch barrel
1062 fps - Freedom Arms mod. 97 5.25 inch barrel
  951 fps - S&W MT. Gun 4 inch barrel
  850 fps - Taurus Titanium 2 inch barrel
This load is “standard pressure” and is therefore safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 Colt and 454 Casull firearms. The bullet construction is hard cast (not lead) and properly lubed and will not substantially lead your barrel, even if you fire hundreds of rounds.

This gun was imported by Excam from H. Weihrauch in Germany and branded as a Warrior.

The SKS looks rough but has an excellent barrel with plenty of rifling left. still has its bayonet and is up to Russian specs

Pricing the Romanian sks for 525 and the Mosin with the 300 rounds of ammo for 280 .

FFL Terms and Conditions
• Any items placed on the same order as a lower receiver will also be shipped to the FFL. If you would like additional items shipped to you directly, please place them on a separate order.
• Please enter your information or the receiving party's (the person that will be picking it up) information under ""Recipient Name"" while checking out. There will be a seperate field for FFL name, phone and zip code and we will obtain the shipping address directly from them.
• To expedite your order, please have your dealer email their FFL to us. If the dealer you are using to transfer a firearm has not sent us a currently updated FFL to put on file, there will be an extended period of time needed to process your order.
Email: REDACTED

There will be a 30% restocking fee on all lower receivers returned because of failed background checks. 
Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms. See Section 921(a)(3)(b). 18 U.S.C. Section 922(b)(1) makes it unlawful for a licensee to sell any firearm other than a shotgun or rifle to any person under the age of 21."

Its ergonomic grip has an easily reversible backstrap that allows shooters the choice of a curved or straight backstrap.

Manufacture Description:
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

I bought it new a few weeks ago and have only put 120rds through it. I've realized is rather have another Glock or build another AR since then.

Anyway, the ak will come in its original box with 2 30rd mags (1tapco and 1 magpul) with a sling and cleaning kit. I've also added a magpul moe + ak grip to the ak for a better feel over the stock girly-man commie grip. I'll include the original too. This WASR is a 2014 production gun, meaning that the wood and attention to detail on it are much better than previous models. It is unfired and has only been racked and disassembled a few times.

I prefer a cash sale and I would be looking for $525 for this one. You'll need a valid NCDL and I want to see a ccw or original pistol permit for my peace of mind. Seeing a permit is a for a long gun is not an NC requirement, but it is one of mine, no exceptions.

We both get a bill of sale. FTF meetings in the matthews/southeast clt area only.

In trade, I'd be open to the following, but cash talks much louder:

-a gen 4 g19 with night sights and all factory goodies

Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are factory Walther Magazines to fit the popular SW99 Pistols that are a joint effort of Smith & Wesson and Walther. They are also identical to magazines issued in Walther models 990 and 990-L; and more recently in the Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action pistols chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson Caliber. Each magazine is actually manufactured by Mec-Gar of Italy and so marked; and that puts these factory Walther and S&W Magazines in the class with all the best magazines in the world. Importer on these was Walther Arms, a recently divested arm of Smith & Wesson. The reason we got these at a good price is, that the Smith & Wesson wing in Springfield MA and Houlton ME is giving way to Walther USA in Fort Smith AR. Manufacturer Mec Gar is the principal magazine supplier for Beretta, Browning, Kel-Tec, and Sig Arms, and wisely so. Their magazines are solid steel construction, superior springs, followers and floorplates. They free-fall eject like they’re supposed to; they lock the slide open when they’re dry like they’re supposed to, and most important, they work reliably. Construction is smooth finished blue steel bodies with steel springs. Cartridge followers are high impact black, red, or blue polymer, with slightly extended black polymer floorplates so that each magazine holds only 10 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson or .357 Sig caliber ammunition, down only two rounds from standard issue magazines for the SW99 and its counterparts and competitors. Smith & Wesson Factory number is 19279; Walther number is 2796503; and Magnum Research number is FA4010. Some magazines may have the Smith & Wesson name on them, but they are the exact same magazine, whether they bear a Walther Banner or S&W logo. Buyers in areas where they are permitted may take four excellent condition Smith & Wesson number 19358 standard twelve rounder magazines for the same price as three of these tens. We have the regulations for that posted on our me page. Single mag onesy twosy price on the ten rounders is $35 per. We’re offering them, however, in lots of 3 at only $29 each. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. . Not for sale to residents of New York City.

I ordered a sling from a major online retailer after asking their chat people which one to order.  They told me and I took their word for it.  Wrong choice.  It was backordered and when I got it, over a month later, the packaging was open (plastic had torn from the staple).  Worse yet, it turned out to be the wrong sling, since I needed the QD version for my AR's.  This item is a new, but open box thanks to the retailer, and unused because I do not have the right attachment points on any of my my AR's (see picture).  

I am willing to trade with cash for the QD version if you don't want yours, even if used, or if someone wants to just buy this I will sell this to them for a the discounted price"

This listing is for THREE Magazines; winning buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Most of the SW-99’s we’ve had in the past year served briefly in the States of Nevada or North Carolina. In the past few years, Smith & Wesson cranked up production and vigorous marketing of its new M&P Series of Autos, so several of the 99s have been traded in along with their magazines. The Ones we had stayed in service for fewer than four years, and we assume these are some of their magazines, manufactured shortly before the Brady Ban expired on the Federal Level; and since they are 12 round capacity, they had to be marked Restricted Law Enforcement during their year of manufacture, 2004. Another marking is even more important. Each magazine reads Mec Gar USA Meriden CT, and that puts these factory S&W Magazines in the class with all the best magazines in the world. Mec Gar is the principal magazine supplier for Beretta, Browning, Kel-Tec, and Sig Arms, and wisely so. Their magazines are solid steel construction, superior springs, followers and floorplates. They free-fall eject like they’re supposed to; they lock the slide open when they’re dry like they’re supposed to, and most important, they work reliably. Wear indications are negligible on these magazines, all of them are in excellent condition, and the photo specimens come from the same batch. Some of them have minimal amounts of carbon blacking on their red followers. These will fit standard size Smith & Wesson models 99, 990, 990L, and the Walthers in the same caliber with full grip frame. They will also fit the identical descendant currently being marketed by Magnum Research, the Desert Eagle Fast Action 40. S&W Product Code is 193580000, and they are no longer listed on the factory store page at S&W dot com. These are well maintained, clean, strong magazines. Replacement pricing on new Ones, if a person can even find One, usually runs $50 apiece. Our Single Mag onesy twosy price is $33. We’re offering these fine magazines, however, the Ones in the photos or their identical mates from the same batch, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00.

This is a superior product to the only thing we could get 20 years ago, the old USA brand conversions, despite the fact that the USA’s were steel and these are high impact polymer. By definition, this is a conversion, not just a magazine. A 59/66 or SKS owner will need to remove the rifle’s 10 shot magazine completely, then reassemble it with no magazine in order to install this conversion. Manufacturer is Tapco, in the distinguished city of Kennesaw, Georgia. Construction is High Impact Polymer, made by Tapco’s unique Intrafuse ® process. Cartridge follower is of identical material, very thickly made with no-tilt rooftop contour. Forward strut section is 8 port vented for lightness and durability. Spring and floorplate are steel, with military parkerized floorplate. Note that the magazine body has serrated construction for strength, and it is curved for trouble free cartridge feeding.

Photos show a specimen of Tapco’s graphite based polymer stock for SKS, type 56, or 59/66 rifles. Manufacturer is Tapco Industries of Kennesaw, Georgia. Construction is black graphite based polymer, with steel bolts and pins. Buttstock is 6 position collapsible or retractable, that brings the length of pull anywhere from 11 1/2 inches all the way to a fully extended 15 inches, measured from the trigger face to the end of the buttplate. Pistol grip is serrated type, with spring loaded steel floor plate that allows quite a bit of storage inside it. Forend area is serrated side on the lower, and serrated ported upper or gas tube cover that includes a 9 slot Picatinny optics or light rail. Replacement pricing on these stocks in many areas is upwards of $200. We’re offering the Tapco type 56 SKS stock and forend assembly in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 59.00. >>> Collapsible or folding stocks: these are not an issue in most jurisdictions.

It is against the law, for instance, to install a collapsible or folding stock onto a rifle or shotgun that has a detachable magazine in California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Say, for instance, Mr. Dwight Owens of Bakersfield owns a federal status C&R Chinese SKS Rifle manufactured in 1956. Dwight decides to convert it to accept a detachable magazine, harmless enough.

I'm saying that low ballers need not waste their time. My Glocks are for business but the Sig...well...let's not get off to a bad start-Don't try to low ball me. $1100 cash buys you the sig  and all 12 magazines.

The M11-A1 is about two months old. I've got 500 rounds through it and I keep her so clean you could be convinced it's just out of the box. I have the first three 15 round phosphate coated mags. I also have nine (9) 17 round mecgar magazines. That's the same company that makes Sig's phosphate ""friction"" magazines. I also will throw in one ""UpLULA"" magazine loader. they usually go for 30-40 dollars plus shipping

I also have a Miami Classic II shoulder holster for the sig. Depending on where you order it from they cost between $165.00 and $205.00 (not counting shipping) this holster is barely broken in. I also have a fobus paddle holster for this gun which is great for the range (most gun ranges won't allow a horizontal draw SH rig) Conceals OK under a coat or jacket. The Fobus retails for about 30 dollars. If you buy these holsters with the M11-A1 I will let you have them for an additional $125.00. Trust me, if I sell them seperately it's going to be forty or fifty bucks more.

Check your prices online for all these and  decide for yourself if unopened boxes are worth more for very lightly used. If I really need to ad photos of what will be identical to the stock photos that you will see when you look up the prices, then I'll put up some pics...but really?"

Buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. From a few years’ storage in an old Southern Warehouse come these serviceable and unfired blue steel magazines to fit Sig P228 pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Manufacturer is Pro-Mag Industries, 10645 Garfield Ave., Southgate, CA 90290, and this company advertises a lifetime Factory warranty on each item. Please understand that warranty service is between the consumer and the factory. Construction is blue steel body, steel spring, black polymer cartridge follower and matching floorplate. Each Magazine holds 13 rounds of 9mm ammunition. These will only fit Sig model 228 and 229 pistols chambered in 9mm that accept a double staggered magazine. They will not fit a 226, will not fit a 239, Will not fit a Smith & Wesson 469; will not fit the valve handle of a 19th century Italian Bidet. All these magazines are new and unfired in their original factory packages, only old stock. One of our veteran local customers gives the Pro-Mag an A, from cycling 117 rounds through it with no failures to feed, just one failure in 9 cycles to lock the slide open on the last shot, not really a consideration in our view.

I am looking to trade my SP101 Wiley Clapp with lots of extras. This is not your standard SP101; it has rear dovetail sights, a beveled cylinder, and then there'sthe beautiful wood panels. I really like it, and I am considering whether I should even get rid of it because it may come back to bite me, but I just don't see myself putting it to practical use for quite a while.  

I put in over $900 into the gun and accessories, but I am not asking what I paid. I put 25 rounds through it and cleaned it thoroughly, so It is in excellent condition. I am including everything in the pictures: Badger Custom rosewood grips, factory Ruger rubber grips with stippled and Ruger logo engraved wooden panels, Hogue rubber grips, 2 HKS speed loaders, 25 rounds of .38 Winchester White Box, a leather IWB holster, a suede IWB holster,an uncle Mike's Soft IWB holster, a Fobus OWB holster, box, and paperwork. I only want a fair deal, so make a fair offer. Don't ask how much I want for it  because of course I want as much as I paid, which will not happen. I encourage you to do some research, so we can have a close understanding in value. What do you think it's worth? What is your trade worth? I don't want to break the items up, but if you make a reasonable offer for one or more, I just might be willingto separate them. I put together a very specific list of what I am looking for in trade, so any offers other than what I am looking for will get a ""no thanks."""

The buyer will be required to sign a Bill of Sale as well. I am the legal owner and want to ensure the buyer is legally able to own a firearm.

This AR Pistol was built by me from individual parts. The asking price only allows me to get my investment amount back. 

The upper receiver is from SAA and is MIL-SPEC 7075-T6 Forged Aluminum, M4 feed ramps and is Mil-A-8625 Type 3 Class 2 Black Hard coat Anodized Finish. The Bolt Carrier Group (carrier and bolt) is Nickel Boron. The charging handle is standard make from SAA. The Barrel is 10.5"", is stainless steel and has a chrome bore. The barrel has a WYLDE chamber which is specially made for both .223 and 5.56NATO rounds. The twist rate is 1:8. The compensator is from Kineti-Tech and reduces the recoil and barrel climb which enables the firer to stay on target with each shot. The Hand guard is a Full Float Yankee Hill Lightweight series 9.675"" in length. The gas block is Aluminum and the gas tube is carbine length at 9.75"".

The lower receiver is an Aero Precision ""PEW"" lower which is forged MIL-SPEC 7075 T-6 Aluminum and is Mil-A-8625F Type 3 Class 2 with a black hard coat anodized finish. The lower parts kit is Aero Precision as well. The grip is a soft rubber MagPul with a storage compartment for batteries and hex wrenches, or ????. The Mag Well Grip (MWG) is a FAB Defense. The safety selector lever is ambidextrious. The pivot and take down pins have large gripping ends and is laser engraved with the ""Gadsden Snake"" and say ""Don't tread on Me"". The trigger guard is made for gloved finger and is laser engraved with the ""Gadsden Snake"" and says ""Give me Liberty or give me Death"" The buffer tube is made specially for the Sig Brace and the Sig Brace is a Gen I. The buffer is a special 4.5 oz make and the buffer spring is stainless steel.

The Holographic Sight is a Sightmark SM 14003 Ultra Dual Shot Pro Spec NV compatible sight with a quick attach/detach mount. This holographic sight also has a red laser attached.

The overall length of this pistol is 26 3/4 inches and is measured from the end of the lower receiver extension to the last thread of the barrel. It is measured in a straight line, along the barrel, from one end to the other. Some of you will now why this is a important measurement.

Who ever purchases this firearm will, upon payment, receive a special personalized gift commitment from me.

The laser engraved ejection port cover has a waving American flag and the word VETERAN on both sides. This can be changed if you, the buyer, are not a Veteran. The alternative cover will be laser engraved as well. You'll have a few to choose from.

This pistol fires as good as it looks!!!!! I have about 200 rounds through it so it really isn't broken in yet......

The Sig Brace is a forearm brace and is not intended to act as a shoulder brace in any way, shape or form.........

Please, no low ball offers, no trades and no out of State sales. I will not ship it either. The sale will be made in person. My conditions for this sale are in the first paragraph, and are final, and I will not change my mind. Please be respectful. 

Thank you for looking at this very quality built AR15 pistol........."

Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, Not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Novak brand magazines got our attention for fit, finish, and function a decade ago. Here are the Novaks’ production mates. Manufacturer is ACT-Mag S.r.l. of Villa Carcina Italy. Exclusive importer and servicer is PSI of Seymour CT. Construction is polished steel body with perforations for round count, steel spring, center support injector type polymer cartridge follower; steel spring catch; and high impact polymer floorplate. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber Ammunition. They will fit any Sig Sauer 220 series pistol chambered in .45 ACP that has an American type magazine release beside the trigger guard. It will not fit European release Sig 220s or Browning BDA45s because their magazine release levers are on the butt of the pistol, and this magazine’s floor plate will not allow those old 1970s and early 1980s pistols’ magazine release to engage. It will fit compact variants of the P220; but protrude from the grip frame. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the .45 open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time.

This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, Not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Novak brand magazines got our attention for fit, finish, and function a decade ago. Here are the Novaks’ production mates. Manufacturer is ACT-Mag S.r.l. of Villa Carcina Italy. Exclusive importer and servicer is PSI of Seymour CT. Construction is superbly finished nickel plated steel body with perforations for round count, steel spring, center support injector type polymer cartridge follower; steel spring catch; and high impact polymer floorplate. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber Ammunition. They will fit any Sig Sauer 220 series pistol chambered in .45 ACP that has an American type magazine release beside the trigger guard. It will not fit European release Sig 220s or Browning BDA45s because their magazine release levers are on the butt of the pistol, and this magazine’s floor plate will not allow those old 1970s and early 1980s pistols’ magazine release to engage. It will fit compact variants of the P220; but protrude from the grip frame. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the .45 open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time.

So this 2014 Generation 3 Glock 26 is looking for a new home. Very few rounds down range. Comes with 4 10 round magazines, 3 of which have Pearce extensions (2XL), a Blackhawk Serpa holster, original Glock box & manual. The Glock 19 in the pic is not for sale. I'm an hour on the South Lake Tahoe side of Sacramento so a halfway point to FFL would be desirable."
