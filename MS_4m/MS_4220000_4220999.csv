Details-
Purchased new late last year, not a scratch on this rifle. Barrel break in was done correctly with meticulous cleaning between rounds. This was shot during 2 events last year, and in a Precision Rifle course in Las Vegas. Only selling to fund another project, there is nothing wrong with this turnkey setup. I was able to consistently shoot  3/8 MOA groups, it's probably capable of more. This listing is for the rifle only.

Features-
HS Precision Stock, factory reinforced aluminum bedding block, 5r 11.25 heavy varmint contour barrel. Round count is exactly 142, so lots of life left. Threaded barrel is ready for your suppressor, and adjustable X Mark Pro trigger which has already been warrantied by Remington.

Extras- 
Will come with 142 pieces of Hornady fire-formed brass from this exact rifle.

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $525.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

I have cleaned the gun every time I have gone shooting with it and never had any problems with anything.

I have a pressure holster and an IWBH made by alien gear. If you know the brand their decently priced fantastic quality and a dream to wear. But they take 4 weeks to get and I've got the cloak tuck 2.0 so the better holster and wait time has already been done!

I also have 200 target rounds 10 hollow points that are leftover and 20 R.I.P rounds.

Rip round cost me 50$+ shipping for the 20rounds. So if you low ball me on price I'll end up keeping them. If your not familiar with the round look them up their pretty gnarly in my opinion. 

Comes with everything you see at a steal of 400$ obo or trade. Cash sale preferred but I won't shy away from something sweet as hell.

497,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4220497,For Sale:  Mosin Nagant Stock 91/30 M44 Refinish,"Johns Creek, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 80,"Listed On: Friday, July 10, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This auction is for SERVICE and NOT for any physical goods

I offer the service of completely stripping the old finish from your Mosin rifle stock and returning it to you in bare wood condition ready for you to apply new finish.


Here is how it works:
1.	You give me your old Mosin stock (metal end caps can stay)
2.	I strip old finish (aka varnish)
3.	I sand wooden stock until it’s smooth to touch and ready to accept new finish (stain, oil, etc.). It will appear just the way Mother Nature (with comrade’s Stalin approval) meant it to be.
4.	You will apply the final finish – oil, stain, varnish, burn with torch, engrave, carve – wherever your fantasy takes you.

The pictures below will give you an idea of what you will get back. This is my current project. I added a picture at the end of what your stock would look like with (5) coats of oil or some type of clear coat. The easiest way to “predict” new look is to get the wood wet with a damp cloth. I can only upload 3 pictures so if you need to see more I can email. 

COST: You pay $50 for my work.

I think anyone who ever refinished wood knows how long it takes to strip and sand/polish it. And then sand it again, and again, and again… Not to mention cost of chemicals and other materials. 

ADDITIONAL SERVICE: For extra $30 I will apply oil or stain of your choice. One condition – you will have to tell me a specific name of the stain you want me to use and I will buy it from Home Depot or Lowe’s. Stores have a decent verity of Minwax stains like mahogany, oak, red oak, gunstock, etc. The reason here is I’ve seen it too many times when people envision one thing and then it looks a bit different after stain dries. This way I am not responsible for color because I did want you told me to do. 

BE AWARE: Attached pictures represent a typical Mosin stock. However, Russians used various types of wood in their production and therefore your stock may be lighter or darker. Occasionally I find repairs/patches after I strip darker tone varnish on old stocks that were not very visible before. You can hide them again with darker stain but not with clear coat or oil.

Dings, dents, deep scratches, cracks will still be there after I strip your stock. You can try to fill them prior to staining but that’s something for you to do. 

LEAD TIME: 1-3 weeks. Depends on services you order, number of ongoing orders, weather, and my availability. 

                         --- Turn that old and flaky stock into a beauty ---

I dont have a 45/90 to check it but it shoots 45/70's great. Very accurate for a rifle made in 1895 (S/N 908xx). Stock has been refinished and is a little low in spots. The barrel is 21"" and has been shortened as far as I can tell. The rifle did have a full size mag at one time as there is a grove on the bottom of the barrel. I have shot this rifle plenty and it out shoots every 1886 I have seen. Bore is an 8+ with some shine and sharp groves. Beautiful red color in the stock.

I bought it, shot it once, cleaned it, and then left it in the safe, (thought I'd get to hunt this year, but I didn't), so it hasn't got a scratch on it.  I also haven't had it too long.

It comes with Bushnell scope, which I sighted in with a laser at about 50 yards. So it's true right and left, but may need a little tweaking if you want to zero it in at 100 or 200. Comes with the remaining 10 rounds I haven't shot (I'm also including old spent brass as well). Also comes with a black soft gun case.

This gun bolt has the three lugs like the TC venture, which I really like.  It has a smooth action, and the bolt doesn't have to rise up a lot in reloading, which is nice with a scope on it.

Also has a very thick rubber butt pad, which helps a lot. I felt very little kick when I fired it.

In spite of the not so nice reviews about this model, this is a really good shooting rifle.  Below I'll leave a link to a guy shooting one of these, and you can see for yourself if they are not awesome rifles...

The rifle is in very good condition with some bluing wear and a few dings here and there on the stock. The bore is bright and shiny and in excellent condition with sharp rifling, its a great shooter. The bolt serial number matches the receiver and the markings on the top of the barrel are visible but somewhat wore off. The date of the rifle is almost impossible to see but a 193 can be made out if looking very hard, the last digit cannot be seen. The story I was told about this rifle when I bought it from a co worker was it was brought back from over seas after WWII.

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

Hand Inspected - Every Varmint Express cartridge is hand inspected before leaving our factory, ensuring there are no cosmetic flaws and imperfections. Powder - The powder in a Varmint Express cartridge is selected for its consistency from lot to lot. That means consistent accuracy and optimum pressure and velocity on every shot.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56/.223 and features a threaded 20"" fluted barrel, a helical fluted bolt, a sporter-style gray laminate wood stock, rubber recoil pad, two swivel studs, scope bases, and Mossberg's LBA trigger. The most interesting feature of this rifle is that it operates on NATO magazines such as the Magpul Pmag. This is a great looking rifle, lightweight and compact. I was surprised how well this rifle shoots, I had my Burris Eliminator 3.5-10 scope with a 100yd zero shooting 55gr Federal American Eagle and was able to shoot tight 3 round groups @ 100yds. I was also able to consistently hit a 12""x12"" steel plate @ 300yds from a rest. I have the original box, manual, and lock. It came with a metal 10rd mag which I cannot find, if I am unable to find it I will order you a new mag from Mossberg or a different mag, your choice(no extra charge) I'm NOT looking for trades, I'm selling for cash to fund my 308 project. Please text/call/email me if you're interested and I would be happy to answer any questions. PS- the aforementioned Burris scope is also for sale for $600.(they are $800 new!!!)

Please check my other listings and make an offer for all of it if you're interested. I don't really know what these grips are worth so you tell me what they're worth to you. There is one pair of black plastic grips with the Rampant Colt, one pair of wooden grips which appear never used, a pair of black hard plastic grips with Rampant Colt and a pair of hard plastic marbleized brownish grips with Rampant Colt and Colt markings on the inside. All of the plastic grips appear to be in used condition with signs of wear. I can meet locally but not traveling far for smalls like this. I would rather ship unless you make it worth my while to meet. I will ship these grips flat rate for $6.00.
