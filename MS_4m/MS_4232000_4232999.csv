2)if you offer a trade: a) if it has been cut up, stipled, or spray painted (i.e. coated) i have no interest. b) your firearm cannot be valued at more than what it goes for new (i don't really need a 300 dollar hi-point 9mm pistol.) 

3) your chl does not entitle you to a discount: it's great you got it, and we are all very proud of you-but i am not going to knock off 200 dollars just because you passed a course.

4) be 21 or over, no exceptions. 

5) i have absolutely no need of overpriced ammo, in bulk or otherwise.

6) i will not meet you 4 states away: i'm coming to my front door and opening it.....that's far enough. YOU MUST COME TO ME IN LEANDER. no exceptions. I WILL NOT SHIP.

It is a light alloy frame de-cocker model featuring an extended magazine release, low profile snag-free sights, and a loaded chamber indicator. This gun is amazingly balanced, and shoots like a dream. This gun is barely used, I have put less than 500 rounds through it. I am relucantly selling this gun because I need money for school  This gun comes with a holster, 2-14 round magazines, and 200+ rounds of 9mm ammo (so you can go out and start enjoying this gun). This gun is NATO certified, meaning that it can take the most intense punishment and keep firing without worry.  This is a great deal, and I am open to offers. Texting or messaging works best for me, so contact me soon. Hope to hear from you soon.
 
 
NATO Certification means: 
Must be able to complete the following without failure: 4000 dry firings 3000 De-cockings Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components. Complete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc. 100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.   Safety requirements: Drop test 1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing. 3meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing. After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service. The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests. These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure. The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud. The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F). The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F) The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.   Service life: The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo! The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.   Reliability: The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement. The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition."

in excellent condition at 97%. Gun has a low round count and has been meticulously maintained, as the pix will show. Decorative scroll work on the receiver and gold trigger that shows no wear. Always stored in a dehumidified safe. This gun draws up fast, points straight and I'd dead on accurate! I did little upland hunting with it but mostly trap. Incredibly smooth cycling gun and gun to shoot. Included are all three original chokes and wrench. Asking $680, which is well below book value.

Beating its giant wings only a few times to reach a moderate elevation, the Condor is able to soar miles over its typical 160 mile territory to find food to eat.
Condor Outdoor Products is a mirror to Mother Nature’s great avian. Working each and every day to make our warfighters the most efficient they can be in whatever task they take on at theater or home.
Condor Outdoor founds its beginnings early on as a camping goods manufacturer. The earlier days of the company were more focused on getting people out into nature and experiencing the wonder of the outdoors.  As our product line expanded, the demand for function focused gear instead of general storage became more prevalent and as the War on Terror started we could not keep up with the demand for our products.
Our quality and price of the 3-day Assault Pack drew so much attention that it became the heart of our tactical product line. From here we've expanded from camping vests to tactical vests, and expanding the product offering to equip warfighters, law enforcement, and hunters with quality and affordable gear."

A true story of the American dream, Maxpedition® is the brainchild of founder and CEO Tim Tang, who in 2003 dropped out of medical school to start his own company in his parents’ garage. Ten years (and several progressively larger warehouses) later, Maxpedition is now thriving in its own Los Angeles-based corporate and distribution compound.
 
Innovative from the start, Maxpedition gained a competitive edge in its early years by creating bags and packs with superior durability and ergonomics, such as the Versipack® and Gearslinger® series. The first customers were military operators and law enforcement officers, but the civilian and concealed carry markets quickly caught on, selecting Maxpedition® as their preferred EDC (Every Day Carry).
 
Maxpedition is now embarking on an exciting second phase of our mission: Expansion. We are breaking new ground with innovations in bags, packs, and pouches for an evolving customer base. We are diversifying with a new range of purposeful, rugged knives and tools, as well as a line of morale patches.
 
While already the leader in our market space, Maxpedition is committed to improvement, optimizing ergonomics, creating user-friendly designs, and using only the highest quality materials and world-class craftsmanship. We strive to make our products more accessible to customers around the world through an expanding international network, while finding even better ways to service our customers and fulfill their after-sales needs. We are here because of our customers; we are always seeking customer feedback, and incorporating their knowledge and experience into our products."

The Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is the Tactical Operators answer to demanding situations. The advantage is unmatched. Built to mil-spec standards, no other company combines the quality and craftsmanship that Colt Defense LLC does. The LE6940 demonstrates fresh ingenuity with mil-spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, mil-spec backup iron sight and folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, straight gas tube, and removable lower rail providing modularity for under-mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous mil-spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature provides unmatched repeatability for mounting of optical systems, not found with separate hand-guard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, it provides a true free-floating barrel, giving enhanced accuracy for longer-range acquisition capability.

I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
Therefore, I am looking to make a trade for a Sig Sauer P938 in new or like new condition. I have a quantity of .380 ACP ammo, additional magazines, and/or cash that I can add to make up any price difference. Finish is not a huge deal, but I would prefer a model with wood grips, and would be particularly interested in a SAS model.
I am primarily looking to make a trade, but might also consider a reasonable cash offer.

The Zeus Pro epitomizes Armasight’s 20/50 design gold standard, which is defined from product inception as being capable of withstanding 20 meters immersion for 2 hours and engineered for routine use with 0.50 BMG weapon shock and recoil. Based around common core electronics, signal processing, and eyepiece optics with generous eye-relief, the Zeus Pro Series Thermal Weapon Sight is available in a variety of options and price points that cater to every application – military and commercial.Utilizing the latest FLIR TAU-2 Technology, the Zeus Pro is offered in 336x256, or 640x512 pixel formats. These options are further enhanced by professional militarygrade 30mm, 50mm, 100mm Germanium (Ge) objective lenses creating a wide varietyof optical magnifications and range performance capabilities that the customer can select from. Armasight has introduced a unique dual battery option for the Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight consisting either of four 3.0VDC 123A batteries all oriented in the same direction to prevent confusion in replacement, or four 1.5VDC AA batteries pre-loaded in a cartridge. In a pinch, a single 123A 3.0VDC battery can power the Zeus Pro for just over one hour.The Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight is characterized by its simple and intuitive controls, functions, and features that are layered among direct button adjustments, direct combination button functions, and electronic menu selections. In an effort tobetter support the art of shooting, Armasight has included ballistic drop reticules, electronic compass and inclinometer in the Zeus Pro package for finer range estimation and target orientation. The Zeus Pro uses a 9-pin multi-pin connector to provide videoin imagery, where there may be a need for map or rangefinder display overlays, and external power access. In support of these capabilities, Armasight offers an optional laser range finder, external battery pack, multispectral laser and other accessories designed to attach on the MIL-STD-1913 rail of the Zeus Pro. Solid state technology reticule adjustments and software algorithms, combined with a complementary color reticle platform, ensures maximum reticle contrast, high level target accuracy, and boresight retention. This level of accuracy is translated into the tracking electronic zoom (e-zoom) function of the Zeus Pro thermal imaging weapon sights, which can be progressively increased from 1x to 2x to 4x and 8x without changing the point-ofaim to point of-impact relationship of the targeting reticle.A five-button wireless remote switch is included to operate and modify the settings on the Zeus Pro to optimize the imagery for the viewed scene without having to remove your hands from the weapon. The Zeus Pro has Bluetooth© wireless capability and can directly interface with most smart phones with the potential for engaging a series of current and future applications.The Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight represents the most versatile and sophisticated Armasight product available in today’s market for hunters, SWAT teams, and military personnel, based on its superior price-to-performance value. All Armasight thermal imagers are based on FLIR Tau 2.7.2 or later cameras that allow to improve overall image quality in a wide range of dynamic thermal environments, the imagers has employed special user-adjustable imaging tools that include:  Active Contrast Enhancement (ACE) – a digital “Contrast” correction that allows for a smart scene optimization based on dynamic adjustments where a variety of contrast levels occur depending on relative scene temperature. Second Generation Digital Detail Enhancement (DDE) –  a “Sharpness” correction that is digitally enhances the picture to present clearer imagery, significantly improves edge sharpening and further reduces image noise. Smart Scene Optimization (SSO) –  a fine-tuning computational correction that significantly improves an overall visual acuity for targets that have thermal signatures similar to a surrounding background. Information Based Histogram Equalization (IBHEQ) – a “Sky/Sea” enhancement – information based environment dependent algorithm that automatically adjusts camera gain and excludes pixels determined to not contain critical information, specifically helpful in scenes with lots of sky or water. User Controlled Manual Non Uniformity Correction/Flat-Field Correction (UCMNUC/FFC). There is a mechanical shutter between the camera sensor and the lens. This shutter is used to perform a non-uniformity correction (NUC) also known as flat-field correction (FFC. During FFC, the shutter presents a uniform temperature source to each detector element in the array. While imaging the flat-field source, the camera updates the offset correction coefficients, resulting in a more uniform image after the process is complete. All Armasight thermal imagers allow for user to manually trigger or interrupt scheduled UCMNUC/FFC function. Silent Shutterless NUC ™ (SSN) – In addition to user controlled manual NUC/FFC all Zeus models employ a digital supplemental non-mechanical flat-field correction that allows to extend the periods between mechanical shutter events and to further reduce image noise. SSN is always ON enhancement.      FEATURES  24/7 Operation in presence of environmental obscurants (smoke, dust, haze, fog) Superior engineering and design from inception to Armasight’s 20/50 standard Rugged MIL-STD-810 compliant performance Operates on 123A or AA batteries Reliable quick-release locking weapon mount Objective Germanium Lens Options TAU-2 17μm Pitch Thermal Sensor SVGA 800x600 OLED Display Long eye-relief eyepiece lens Digital Compass Digital Inclinometer Battery Status Indicator Multiple User Selectable Ballistic and Quick Acquisition Reticules Selectable Reticule Color Selectable Palettes: White Hot/ Black Hot/ Sepia/ OEM Custom/ Other Color Variants Imaging Filter Algorithms: – Active Contrast Enhancement™ (ACE) – Smart Scene Optimization™ (SSO) – Information Based Histogram Equalization™ (IBHEQ) – Second Generation Digital Detail Enhancement™ (DDE) – Silent Shutterless Non-uniformity Correction™ (SSN) Wireless 5-button Remote Tracking Digital e-Zoom: 2x / 4x / 8x (640x512 only) Still Picture and Video Recording Capability (Mounted DVR Option) Made In the USA"

This beautiful Colt USMC 1911 is part of a 'Complete Package' including the desirable Pelican Case w/ outer cardboard shipping box, (2) Magazines, Cleaning Kit, Owners Manuals, Test Target, Colt Lock & Hang Tag! As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!"

This is a great hardwood or any other type of wood organizer for someone with a big enough woodshop, but it could also fit inside a typical garage. It has three treated 4x4 posts as the main support system, with 2x4 connectors in back for mounting to any wall. The shelving is the best part, they are galvanized steel pipes with the ends dipped in rubberized coating, and you can interchange this throughout several holes in the 4x4's. In other words, you can have one shelf with 2 pipes for shorter pieces of wood, and then have a 3 pipe shelf below that for longer pieces. Also, as you can see from the pictures, this helps with placing other items into the system like a tool box or peg board for hanging tools. I installed mine with an ambient light above it just for looks.

It was only fired by the gunsmith who installed the new sights and provided the trigger polish and springs job. He's had the gun until last week, so it's literally been in the box since it was purchaed (I have receipts). 

(All photos are of actual equipment, taken on 4/10. Please contact me for more)

I'm only selling this handgun (along with a few others) because I need to liquidate some assetts. I own over 30 handguns, and there are five I've never fired. This is a nice one I'd like to keep, but it falls into that category. 

The COM-TAC Holster is a top of the line and well known custom leather and kydex holster company. I own one for all of my carry guns, and side trying them, I haven't purchased anything else. They sell for $100.00. This model is the Gladiator, and it's great for every day on/off OWB Carry applications. No wear, brand new, and in the bag (with receipt), I like that the Gun Brand and make is forged on the Kydex, and the durable kydex holder with leather back and loops makes you forget you're wearing a gun at all. It stays tight to your body, and its highly concealable. 

The TFX Sights are Tru-Glo's top performance line, with tritium and fiber optic technology, the best in the business (in my opinion). I have them installed on five of my guns, including my EDC. They're great for night/day shooting, and they allow for rapid and accurate target acquisition. Cost was $149.99 (receipt).  

If interested, please call or text me at two six two. 2seven1, sicks one 99. 

See my other listings for the HK VP9 (also New)  CZ Scorpion, and Springfield TRP. 

The top of the line G19 is what most consider the ultimate multi-purpose handgun. Great for carry, targets, and home defense, Glock's are also the weapon of choice for over 65% of LOEs across the globe.

I would love to keep this gun but after shooting it for the last few months I decided that the grip doesn't feel natural to me. I am open to trading for m&p 9mm compact or maybe full size.

I have this very nice Glock 30 .45 ACP full frame compact. It's in excellent condition with a very low rnd count.  Comes with 3 ten rnd. mags, speed loader, original spring and aftermarket spring, generic hard case and Uncle Mikes holster.  Shoots perfect with very low recoil, never carried.   This is an import model, which I was told it was assembled in Austria and shipped to the Smyrna, GA plant for distribution.  I was told a lot of the government use firearms were handled this way.  Who knows just thought I would explain the US on the serial # plate.

The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.

Citori. A perfect blend of beauty and performance.
 The Citori is more than a shotgun, it is the quintessential representative of the quality of the Browning brand. Wood-to-metal fit is paramount on the Citori and with tight, consistent junctions it doesn’t disappoint. Action components are machined to exacting tolerances, heat-treated for greater strength and fitted using the traditional lampblack-and-file method to ensure the precise fit of critical components prior to being assembled to the action. It is this extreme level of craftsmanship that leads to the dependable function, impeccable looks, championship performance and respect from both Citori owners and the competition alike.
