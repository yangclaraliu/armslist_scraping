Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility. In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

Our new Model 870™ Express® ShurShot™ Synthetic Turkey is optimized for big birds with the revolutionary ShurShot synthetic pistol-grip stock. It’s contoured to accommodate both right- and left-handed shooters, while offering an incredibly steady-aiming platform that handles like lightning and lessens felt recoil. The 21"" barrel adds to its superb maneuverability, and the Turkey Extra Full Rem™ Choke channels maximum payload to the sweet spot. Mossy Oak® Obsession™ coverage on the stock and fore-end keeps you concealed.

It's a new $500 gun, with easily over $500 more invested in this ccw package, details below. Selling it for $650 firm, and if you know what you are looking at then you will know that this is a bargain for what it is. Please no offers of any less, no need to waste our time, the price is $650 FIRM. There is much more than this just in the gun and parts alone, not even including any of the work done. I have never shot it once. There are a few trades I'd take that I will list below but I am mainly interested in just selling it outright for cash. So for me to trade it would need to be one of the specific items I have listed, or something worth at least what the total value represented here is (easily over $1k, not $650 - that is the ALL CASH price). The few photos shown are not even close to enough to do this gun justice. If you are interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on. If you don't and I do not respond to you that is probably why.

NDZ Billet Punisher flat mag base plate $20

New Tagua Sport IWB Holster $25
Complete professional polishing job on barrel and internals $200 (I had this gun inspected at TAC just this week and was quoted that they would charge $200 easily for them to do this same amount of polishing work)
Slide - I believe it has been Duracoated or Cerakoted, the finish on it looks WAY better than a factory Glock finish - $100?
Trigger - Not sure exactly what trigger package it is but definitely much nicer than a standard Glock trigger - $$??

I'm sure I am forgetting something. And the original stock Glock rear slide plate, mag release, and magazine base plate are all included in case you didn't want the 3 Punisher items. I will be happy to switch those 3 factory parts back on for you and keep the Punisher ones, if you don't like them and prefer the stock appearance.

It wears a 23"" free floating heavy barrel without sights. The receiver top is grooved for scope mounting and this rifle comes with a set of 1"" scope rings. The trigger is adjustable with a 2 to 4 pound let off. Condition is very nice with nearly 100% original blue finish remaining except for a couple of small marks on the sides of the barrel near the muzzle. There is no rust or any pitting. The stock is in excellent shape and shows nice tiger stripe figure and only a couple of very light handling/storage marks...it looks very nearly new. Pictured without magazine but a brand new 10-shot magazine has been received and is included. The Sako Finnfire has gained a reputation as being an exceptionally accurate rifle but unfortunately was discontinued in 2005."

(Scope not Included).  

 I bought this new from AIM High gun store in New Albany, OH.  I have fired only 5 (5shell boxes: Remington AccuTip 3"") thru it.  Finish and condition are 100%, no marks, rubs, or rust at all.  Cleaned, oiled and stored in temperature/humidity controlled gun safe after use. Due to the extra long fully rifled and pinned barrel it is extremely accurate with the AccuTip shells over 150 yards.   Very flat shooting gun.  At the range, I only had to hold a inch up shooting from 100yrds to 150yrds.

Specs:
Overview:

The most dependable slide action of all time in three advanced designs that will go the distance with deadly precision, whether your target is the crease behind a buck’s shoulder or a big red head. We’ve built the industry’s finest rifled slug guns for years, but our new 12-gauge Model 870™ SPS™ ShurShot™ Synthetic Super Slug advances deer-leveling technology to farther reaches and smaller group sizes than ever before possible. Even more so when paired with high-performance ammunition like our Premier AccuTip sabot slugs. 

Because barrel stability is key to extended-range accuracy, this shotgun’s barrel is of extra-heavy, 1"" diameter configuration and measures a full 25 1/2"". It’s also pinned to the receiver to control vibration for rifle-like, shot-to-shot consistency. Five longitudinal flutes keep weight and heat buildup to a minimum while bolstering barrel rigidity. Six Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling grooves with a 1-in-35"" twist optimize slug flight. But much more than just the ultimate accuracy-enhancing barrel design, this shotgun provides the rock-steady aim and outstanding pointability of our ambidextrous ShurShot pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubberized overmolding at the pistol grip and extended fore-end offer a sure hold in adverse conditions. For unmatched shooting comfort, we added the SuperCell™ recoil pad. The receiver is drilled and tapped, and the included Weaver rail makes adding optics a cinch. Sling swivel studs are built in.

Text REDACTED if interested. At the time, I am not really keen on trades, as I need to actually buy a swingset, but if you feel like tossing an offer my way, go for it."

Overview:

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

Key Features:
26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel 
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver 
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

 This might be boring to some but please read it: The Colt Official Police was a big seller, and in 1933 colt revolvers were adopted by the police departments of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Portland, and Los Angeles, in addition to the state police of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Connecticut. Sales of the Official Police on the police and civilian markets boomed, and a few years later the FBI adopted it as the agency’s standard-issue sidearm.
 Just a little history I had to add....

Bore is great. This is a 7.62x25mm Tokarev calibre handgun - this ammunition is now fairly readily available since its being made new by the likes of privi partizan. Finish is pristine - probably the best CZ-52 I've seen. It has been kept fairly wet in a gun safe, through fairly regular inspections and oilings. I have only taken it to the range a couple of times. The handgun is accurate and the sights are zeroed in. I think overall this has been lightly used and would make a great addition to a collector of CZ handguns. I would be happy to send more photos, if you request them. This handgun has a cool factor - the cartridge is very hot and fireballs from the muzzle are common. It's loud as hell too. I can meet in West Cary or RTP during the week. Weekends are tough. Price is firm. Buyer needs to show me North Carolina driver's license + Pistol Permit or CCW please."

Very crisp trigger - one of the best bullpup designs on the market.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in.  It has an 18” barrel - chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.

Great Reviews - extra toy that I really don't need (but is still really cool). Included is a Vortex red (or green) dot scope. 

 $1500

Open to possible partial trade for a nicer 1911 (Kimber, Colt, etc...), Glock 34, Springfield 5.25 in 9mm, AR15, or what do you have???

This is called a “New Model Army” made by Armi San Paolo out of Brescia, Italy. The AB stamp indicates it was probably made in around 1976. Armi San Paolo became Euro Arms around 2002 and now own a major portion of the BP manufacturing and sales outlets. I used this gun only as a noisemaker on the Fourth of July and New Year's Eve, it looks better than the picture, has an excellent bore, and no rust. Well made and good quality with an 8” barrel.

Includes a spike bayonet w/sheath.
This is a Century import I purchased about 10 years ago.I confess to REALLY wanting to shoot it so I cleaned up the minimum of the cosmo before firing 40 rounds of new commercial ammo through it.I then cleaned the bore,oiled it,and put it away.Hasn't been touched in almost a decade.Still has cosmo goop in the nooks and crannies.Little bumps and bruises-not pristine.Nice bore.I noticed a couple of pinhead sized dark spots but that may have just been my cleaning left overs.

A very smooth rifle."
