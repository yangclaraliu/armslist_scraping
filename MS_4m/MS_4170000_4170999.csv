The Regulator is the next evolution in the Liberty Suppressors forward thinking line of rimfire suppressors.  We have attained new levels of sound suppression and first round pop reduction, setting the standard by which all others will be measured.  The weight, as well as the awesome levels of suppression, make this the natural choice in a rimfire suppressor. The time has come for the rimfire shooter to have a really quiet silencer and not one filled with compromises called “features”. Why do you buy a silencer in the first place? So you can weigh it? Maybe it is to clean it? Is it to have a quiet range experience? We figure it is for the suppression of the gunshot, hence we decided to focus on making the suppressor as quiet as possible and the rest of the features are secondary to that. The Regulator has the primary focus of suppression, then weight was considered next. We followed this requirement with several other features such as an encapsulated blast chamber, user serviceable and a Wavelok™ tube.Specifications: •Length : 6.5” •Diameter : 1” •Weight : 5.5 oz. •Core – Stainless steel •Tube – Titanium •Cap – Aluminum •Finish: Type C High Temp Cerakote™ In Graphite Black •Mount: 1/2x28 Direct •Aprox.

Sling is in excellent condition and was never used at the range (backup sling). I put it on my carbine once to check fitment, and it sat in my safe as a spare sling. Similar to the one Larue sells but you can remove the QD swivels on this one.
The advantage of the bungee on a two-point adjustable sling is huge. This adjustable sling has a full 6 inches of built-in bungee. When you have the rifle mounted and the sling tightened for stability, you don't have to readjust the sling to remount the rifle like other slings without a bungee simply slip it into place. The stretch also allows a better range in movement without having to adjust sling when performing various tasks or manipulations with the rifle.

Integral shoulder pad design provides body hugging profile for all day carrying comfort.

This gun is in excellent shape with some very slight wear marks on the polymer from carrying IWB style for the past few months and has had around 500 rounds put through it since I purchased it new. It comes with everything it originally comes with if purchased new (two 15 round mags, factory case, 3 sets of grip swells/backstraps, factory case, and paperwork) and this is the version with the luminescent three dot factory sights (collects ambient light to glow in the dark versus tritium type night sights). 

The price for the handgun is $550 firm but im honestly more interested in trade. Im specifically looking for a Glock 19 gen 3 in similar shape that has the original tenifer type of finish (frying pan black teflon look) versus the newer melonite finish (grey matte finish). If you are familiar with glocks, you will know the difference. I will consider a even trade if it has like new night sights and/or extra mags but will definitely need some cash if it is just a stock glock 19. IF you have a Glock 19 like the one I mentioned, Im definitely interested in trading. I will update this ad with actual pics soon but honestly if you have seen a vp9 on the shelf at a gunshop, that is what you should expect to get.

 Email me or call/text (I prefer text initially) at 417-719-0three9four. I am only interested in the Glock 19 for trade, please do not contact me about trading my HK for overpriced 22 ammo, lawn furniture, s&w sigmas, or anything else other than paying cash or trading for a glock 19.

P.S. I also have a hybrid holster for this gun as well made by MDJ Holsters. It sells for $37 new, and I would sell it with the gun for only $25 (barely broken in and in excellent shape as well). The pic of the holster is listed as well."

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.
Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

I'm selling this wonderful gun because all of my other guns are 9mm, so the ammo isn't interchangeable between my other pistols.

If so...........have you looked at Just Right Carbines? 
Please read the entire AD before responding, as many of your questions will be answered within the AD.

Unlike Kel-Tec's Sub-2000 which is mostly made of plastic and has those cheap sites, Just Right Carbines are made of aluminum plus the pistol grip, stock, buffer tube, and trigger components are all interchangeable with the AR-15 plus you can install any site and/or optics that will install on a picatinny rail! 
Included in this offer is three additional magazines (2- high capacity) and (1 – Standard) and the take down tool that normally you would have to buy separate.

This is for SERIOUS offers only.  If you’re a serious buyer I am a serious seller.  I will not drive more than 20 miles from my home town.  

This carbine is an ambidextrous, straight blowback-operated, semi-automatic, pistol-caliber carbine with telescoping 6-position collapsible buttstock and free-floating quadrail forend.   Its features: semi-automatic pistol-caliber carbine, simple and reliable, straight blowback operation, Ambidextrous bolt - configurable for left or right-hand ejection, Bolt handle switchable to left or right side, Converts to other pistol-calibers with simple conversion kit (available from JRC’s website), Lightweight 17"" barrel, Free-floating quadrail, Picatinny rail machined into top of receiver, Telescoping 6-position collapsible M-4 style buttstock, Receiver, trigger housing and magazine well machined from aerospace grade 6061T-6 aluminum with black hardcoat anodizing for extra protection and durability, Standard M-4 buffer tube, buttstock, and pistol grip, Utilizes standard M-4/AR-15 furniture and trigger components, Lightweight - approximately 6.5 lbs., and Overall length: buttstock extended 33-1/2"", collapsed 30-1/4"" 

Made in the USA, in New York State 
This weapon is USED, but in very good to excellent condition.  Approximately 250 rounds, maybe less – doubtfully more.  I am not the original owner."

This is a really nice 3.5” 9mm carry pistol.  It is a 2009 that I bought new in 2010 and have approximately 750-to-1,000 rounds through it, but I kept it clean and well-maintained.  It is not one of the common $400 models.  It has ambidextrous thumb safeties and no magazine safety, much like the current model 206304 (MSRP $569).  It also has one additional 12-round factory mag (current models come with only two mags).  Includes original case, owner’s manual, fired casing, and registration card.  

I believe $450 is a fair price, considering the additional factory mag.

 This outstanding set up started out using a Colt Light Rifle, rare in themselves with as few as 4000 produced. These rifles were designed by Mel Forbes, owner of New Ultra Light Arms. Virtually every upgrade has been completed on this rifle. 
 It has just returned from Beyond Ballistics LLC, where all work was done. Starting with the synthetic stock, the barrel has been free floated and a Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad added to minimize the notorious recoil of the .270. It has a Harris Ultralight bipod and a Rifle Basix adjustable trigger set at 3lbs. This trigger is excellent with a crisp, clean break without over or under travel, it can be adjusted from 1.5 to 4.0 lbs. The bolt has been polished and the handle radiused to clear the new Nikon 4x12x40 BDC scope using low rings. A Forbes stainless magazine follower and Stryker 23 lb. firing pin spring have been added. This has been set up as an ultralight long range gun but will function equally well as a tactical rifle. These super accurate rifles commonly shoot sub MOA groups prior to all the upgrades done to this gun. 
This rifle can be compared to other custom ultra light rifles costing 2 to 3 times more, my price is far less than half of other similar quality rifles. Here is your chance to own an outstanding tack driver, light to carry for long hunts yet stable and spot on for a tactical rifle.

Torsion bar suspension with huge amounts of ground clearance.  This would be great for camping and it does come with the four foot tall cargo cover and arches not shown in pics.  It's the Ultimate off and on road performance trailer .   Dementions are 7'×7'   completely legal and ready to take anywhere!

This is a very unique and capable substitute for an AR and an absolute blast to shoot.  I have not seen many of these offered and even less with a stainless donor Mini-14.  It features the full Archangel stock upgrade with a full metal rail on top, 5-way adjustable stock w/adjustable 5-way cheek riser.  This is not a cheap stock that is not thought out, it is a state of the art, substantially superior housing for the Mini-14 platform and is not cheap in price, appearance or function.  I have installed an inexpensive Site-Mark holographic red-dot, Pop-up MagPul Rear site and removable AR style front site for this sale.

This one is kind of hard for me to part with; but another build forces the sale.  It is an absolute blast to shoot, is quite accurate and has run flawlessly for me every time I have shot it.  I have quite a bit more invested and I am including all the original equipment (Wood stock , perfect condition, 2 barrel shrouds, 1 ground for scope, 2 stainless scope rings/mounts, 3 magazines) which should make this an easy choice.  If you want a solid AR substitute and something that will be unique wherever you shoot this is your gun."

Up for sale is a very nice franken-glock. Started its life as a Gen 4 glock 22. The slide was taken off a MPD gun, and does not match the frame. The .40 barrel and frame are NIB unfired, as is the KKM .40-9mm conversion barrel. Slide has minor holster wear and generic Supressor sights. RMR is a trijicon RM07 w/adjustable brightness (no box) and has minor lens scratches from use. Frame has been completely stippled and has a trigger undercut. Package includes gun, both barrels, 2x10 round .40 mags, 1x15 round .40 mag, 1x17 round 9mm mag, Serpa, glock factory case, backstraps, etc. and a box of .40 golden saber. Please note while this is a non matching set, both barrels are NIB unfired. Great way to get into the RMR game decently cheap!...selling because another firearm opportunity has surfaced that this could fund!"

They are brand new and they are the real Glock mags, not built in China.  No sales tax, $40.00 cash only.  If the posting is still up, I have them available to buy.  Email me with how many you want and where on 275 from Beechmont to Montgomery Road you can meet Monday thru Friday.  Recent changes to the laws in Ohio makes owning and shooting this magazine legal.  The law did say that magazines that held 31 plus rounds was considered a fully automatic weapon, but earlier this month that law was changed and magazine capacity has nothing to do with if a gun is considered a fully automatic weapon.  So these magazines allow you to shoot longer and it looks cool to.  I use them in my Glock 17, 19, and 34 plus my Kel-Tec Sub200.  Awesome mags.  These mags sell for $49.99 at locate gun shops and for more at Bill Goodman Gun and Knife Show.  Thanks."

The sleek VTAC design even offers a position in the insert to accommodate the clip on the light. Depending on your mounting preferences, the VTAC can be mounted in such a way that the light can be activated using a tape switch or it can be mounted in such a manner allowing you activate your light using the push button on the back of the light.

This holster can go with you anywhere! This all kydex Trigger guard is minimalistic by design. These are ideal for pocket carry; however you could also use it to carry in a backpack or purse. The kydex is molded around the trigger guard of your specific gun and includes a para cord that can be tied to your desired length. To protect your trigger, simply slide the kydex shell over the trigger guard, and then tie the cord to your belt loop or another secure location. When the pistol is drawn, the para cord will reach its full length and pull the kydex holster off the pistol as you draw."
