This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame.

Way better than nothing and revolvers don’t jam. Every time you pull the trigger, it goes bang, double action or single action. You can spend 3 to 5 times as much, with the same results if you have to defend yourself or loved ones.

Small enough for conceal carry, 5 shot cylinder. It’s actually light, about 20 some oz. I’ve shot about 100 rounds through it with no problems.

It’s not a show off 3 inch target shooter at 25 ft, but each shot will hit a 10 inch target. So, defending yourself and loved one is not a problem.

Ever been in a situation where you wished you had some protection?  I kept this in my garage; my dogs started going crazy barking and growing one night. I grabbed it and turned with it behind my back. The guys walked off.  Like I said, it’s better than nothing. What if one of my loved ones was with me and I had no protection? It could have been the dogs that scared them away, or could have been my confidence (that I had a gun).

You have to pull out the pin to release the 5 shot cylinder (only take a few seconds), but it’s still better than no gun at all."

(21-Day Clockwork Delay Fuse, J. Feder 504)


Data: Length: 7 5/8 inches. 
Diameter: 3 3/8 inches O.D. 
Colour: Black/ Brown. 
Pull or Pressure Required: ¼ hour to 21 days. Material: Aluminum or Bakelite.

The 21-day clockwork delay fuse J. Feder 504 is a mechanical type. It has an aluminum case containing a spring-loaded striker actuated by a clockwork mechanism through a trip lever. There are two (2) dials for setting the delay period. The dial marked in red (rot) is for the number of days (tage). It can be set for any number of days up to 21. 

The dial marked in black (schwarz) is for hours (Stunden). 
The dial marked in red (rot) is for days (Tage)

It is graduated in ¼-hour increments up to 24 hours. Two (2) screws are provided for a hole in the side of the base of the fuse. The screw marked BLIND merely closes the hole, allowing the safety spring to push the safety block under the shoulder of the striker shaft. This is a positive safety. The screw marked SCHARF (armed) is the arming screw. It pushes the spring-loaded safety block away from the striker shaft just far enough so the shoulder of the striker shaft will go through the hole in the safety block. 


Employment: 

This device is used for the delayed detonation of large charges in areas abandoned to an opposing force. 

Functioning: 

At the end of the delay period, determined by the setting, a lever arm on the rotating control disk on the clockwork bears against the trip lever, disengaging the head of the striker shaft. The released striker fires the percussion cap, the detonator and the main charge. 

Installing & Arming: 

(1) Test the fuse by setting it for 15 minutes to see that it is functioning correctly. Re-cock the fuse with the re-cocking device. 

(2) Unscrew the cover and wind the clock by turning the knurled winging knob clockwise. 

(3) Turn the knurled time-setting knob in the top of the fuse to the desired delay. 

(4) Attach the detonator to the percussion-cap holder, and insert the fuse in the charge. 

(5) Remove the screw marked BLIND in the base of the fuse, and screw in the arming screw marked SCHARF (armed). 

(6) Turn the release ring above the setting indicator window so the red mark is opposite GEHT (go)."

Based on the original Yugoslavian version by the same name, the M70 AB2 by Century pays homage to its roots by keeping the same qualities and performance. Utilizing the same long-stroke gas piston system as the venerated AK-47 platform, the M70 AB2 is known for its reliable operation and has proven itself time and again. Despite the similarities, the M70 AB2 has special features that set it apart from its Kalashnikov predecessor. Most notably the M70's receiver is 1.5mm thicker, making it more durable with a longer service life. Unlike the AK-47, the M70 does not have a chrome-lined barrel, providing an increase in accuracy. Three cooling slots on the handguard dissipate the heat, allowing the user to comfortably operate the firearm even for prolonged periods of fire. An under-folding stock allows for compact and easy handling in close-quarter operations. Issued by various armies worldwide, and used by friend and foe alike, the M70 AB2 is a robust and reliable rifle that doesn't quit."

The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.  


The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.  


The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

RCBS Case Trimmers are designed to be user friendly and provide very accurate results, the Trim Pro-2 is no different. With a few turns of the handle cases are trimmed accurately and squarely. The Trim Pro-2's spring-loaded universal lever shellholder eliminates muscle fatigue associated with long hours of tightening a T-bar and having to purchase separate trimmer plates for different size cases. Trimmer works with standard pilots and features a .001"" accuracy, coarse and fine trim length adjustments and fine adjustment busing with .001"" micrometer marking. One of the other great features of the Trim Pro-2 is that RCBS has eliminated the need for the reloader to purchase different shellplates, the trimmer will hold cases with rim diameters of .250"" to .625"" and in length from the 5.7x28mm FN to the 338 Lapua Magnum"

These are nearly impossible to find in unfired condition. This gun is exactly as it was when it left the factory complete with factory grease still in the gun! Comes with 2 10rd magazines. The Mark II is the most desired of all the Ruger .22 pistols. There is no goofy loaded chamber indicator or magazine cutoff(makes trigger heavier) to worry about like with the Mark III. These are also the smoother operating big button magazines that were made much nicer than the current ones. Comes complete with matching box, paperwork and lock. According to the Ruger website, the serial number denotes these guns were made in 1999. I acquired two of these from a gentleman that bought guns as an investment but never shot them. I prefer to sell local but will ship from my FFL to your FFL for an additional 50.00. Please email me if you have any questions. Thank you."

D .380 with a serial of CPA003481 and engraed number 52 on the frame, slide and barrel. If you're a colt collector this is the father to the colt pony. Information is unfortunately hard to come by on these little guys and from my understanding they started at serial CPA001000 and ended CPA serials at CPA035000. Though only a handful ever made it into circulation as the agreement never came to fruition with FI(Garcia) and Colt. Contact me with questions and below is some info on the history.

In the middle 1970s, Colt decided to offer a .380 auto, and chose to partner with Star instead of making their very own gun. The gun (to be called the Pony) was to be assembled in the US, presumably by Colt, from a Star DK slide & associated internals, with a U.S. made frame.

However, the fixed lanyard loop (to increase height of the gun) and the adjustable sights are typical of features added to get points for the 1968 Gun Control Act, which placed restrictions on importation of small handguns. This may indicate that the guns would be entirely made in Spain after all, and just imported with different markings.

Iver Johnson
For some reason, after this product was announced, the Colt/Star partnership was dissolved and very few Colt-branded guns seem to have been sold. Iver Johnson bought the U.S. manufacturing rights to the gun, and sold a number of them. Apparently quite a few frames were made in anticipation of the Colt deal, as all the early Johnson serial numbers start with ""CPA"" (Colt Pony Automatic). It is also possible that some slides were made in the U.S. by Iver Johnson (some manufacturing marks and methods vary), but all the small parts were Spanish imports by Star. Iver Johnson also made at least one commemorative edition based on the Model D Pony, for a US Border Patrol anniversary in 1994; these all have ""USBP"" serial number prefixes.

This gun was also sold under the Starfire name, though I am unclear if this was a pure Star pistol with the requisite modifications to be allowed under CGA '68 or was simply another brand under the Iver Johnson banner.

The Iver Johnson pistols have a slightly different frame shape, with a longer ""beavertail"" to keep the hammer from biting the shooter. The hammer is of the spur type, as a result of the guarding. The sights are smaller and the rear is micrometer adjustable, in contrast to the high visibility combat sights of the Star DK.

Colt model Pony with original box and warranty card
Firearms Interational (FI)
At some point, FI (Firearms International, not to be confused with FIE) acquired the rights and also sold the model D as an FI-made gun, with the model D designation. No Star branding or importation marks appear, so this may also be a related endeavour where an essentially Star pistol is sold under another name entirely. There are some reports of FI selling the import-marked version as the ""Garcia Model 30"" as well. This appears to be the same as the Iver Johnson guns, as far as manufacturing methods go, just marketed differently.

The barrel has been cut down to 18 1/2"" and re-threaded to use choke tubes.
The gun is a couple years old and has only seen a little less than 300 rounds. The shot gun shoots wonderful. The rifle doesn't cycle the reduced recoil rounds very well, so unless you plan on shooting one round at a time with the reduced recoil then stick with the regular non- reduced recoil.
I'm willing to trade for a Remington 870 or Winchester 97. I could do cash as well for $450

Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation.

I hate people that throw rare all over their posts just to jack up the price, so I'm only going to say that they aren't around often because Sig doesn't make them any more. This pistol is not a safe queen, it is certainly a shooter and a damn good one at that. The pistol has had about 700 rounds put through it, but as you can see from the pictures it has been well taken care of. There is a very small amount of holster wear, and the barrel shows the standard wear from being shot. This pistol has had the E2 grips installed by a certified gun smith, and the Sig Short Reset Trigger installed as well. It will come with it's case and two 13 round magazines. If you wish, this pistol will also take P226 magazines as well with a bit of it handing below the grip. I have used my P226 mags in it without any feeding issues and it locks up nice and tight. Thanks to the SRT trigger in it as well, the DA pull feels about 7lbs and the SA pull feels around 3.5-4lbs. Those are just estimates as I don't have a trigger gauge. I can be reached by email or by text at REDACTED."

This handgun is in good to very good condition. I have owned it for 3-4 years and have rarely used it over that time.  It has bluing wear on the cylinder and some wear around the muzzle. The bottom of the trigger guard is a little dinged. Based on the serial number (found below) this revolver was made in 1970-71. You can see that it is unconverted by the flat faced hammer.

I am willing to ship the revolver (via your FFL), but don't have a estimate on the price to ship. I figure it will be at least $40, which the buyer will cover.

Serial number: 30-60283

Description:
The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.

The Ultratech is Microtech’s original dual action out-the-front knife, and has been the foundation of the entire OTF line. Over the years, it has gone through several modifications, each time becoming more efficient and reliable. The Ultratech’s spring remains in an “at rest” position at all times except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively. The Ultratech's light weight, one handed open and close action, slim shape, and scalpel sharp blade make it a one of a kind knife, only available through Microtech. This knife has proven time and again that it can withstand any obstacle. Only time will tell what the next step will be for the ultratech series.
