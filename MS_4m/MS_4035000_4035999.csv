The Type-C is hammer fired and has its own version of half-cock. When you rack the slide, the hammer is suspended half way through its travel, so it is under tension. A squeeze of the trigger finishes cocking the hammer and releases it.

This is a great gun. The recoil is moderate and it runs flawlessly.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I'm consolidating to the 9 mm caliber.

No trades.  Face to face only. Willing to travel a reasonable distance from Raleigh. Must have a pistol purchase permit/ concealed carry permit, official photo ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

I will respond to ALL inquiries.

Marked on the top of the barrel rib is very rare: IVER JOHNSON'S ARMS & CYCLE WORKS FITCHBURG. MASS.U.S.A. ""Only"". It does not include the following PAT'D.APR.6.86.FEB.15.87.MAY 10.87.DEC.26.93 PAT'S PENDING, as with others you will find. I have never seen another First Model missing the Pat's Pending on the barrel. The caliber is also missing on the barrel. The bluing is surprisingly good considering the age of the pistol, although part of the cylinder has lost its bluing. The action (cylinder) is tight and works perfectly. The latch is tight and locks barrel to the frame, and the bore is Excellent. 
Additional info:
Iver Johnson nomenclature refers to its top-break revolvers as Safety Automatics. These are revolvers, not semi-automatic pistols. The term “Safety Automatic” refers to Iver Johnson’s transfer bar safety system (“safety”) and the automatic ejection of cartridges upon breaking open the revolvers (“automatic”).

Hello

I am the second owner. Original owner fired 150 rounds, I fired 50. So about 200 rounds fired. I am selling because I need a smaller gun for CCW purposes and self protection. I am licensed and am in law school, I am real legit person. This comes with 2 clips, and I will include 100 rounds of ammo to get you started. The gun itself is in great shape, it is not blued so there are some areas near the mouth where the paint has chipped, but it was not from being dropped or damaged, it went in and out of my pocket when i would carry. it. I am asking 400.00 or best offer.

Compact, robust, lightweight, low-recoil zombie killer.  A conversation starter at the range.

100% functionality, 85-90% cosmetics.

Not a single FTFire, FTFeed, or FTEject in the 200 rounds I've put through it.

I called Ruger's customer service department to confirm the vintage - it's a first-year 181 series from 1977.  This is the lowest serial# 181-series I've ever encountered.  Highly desirable!!  It was produced before Ruger added the safety warning script on the left-side of the receiver, which, on 1978 and later models reads ""BEFORE USING GUN -READ WARNINGS IN INSTRUCTION MANUAL AVAILABLE FREE FROM"" ... above the Sturm, Ruger & Co. marks.

Apparently, Ruger's lawyers watched ""A Christmas Story"" and became worried about other Ralphie's 'shooting their eye out'.  ;)

It appears to have under 1,000 rounds through it...  The gas pipe showed a little erosion, so I went ahead and replaced it with a new factory Ruger SS gas pipe.  [My dad's 1978 Mini clocked about 3200-3300 rounds through it before it began ejecting the brass too softly] ... A fresh Mini kicks brass a good 15 feet out; my dad's began ejecting them about 2-3 feet, and another magazine later, was essentially a single-shot rifle.  NOT a great zombie gun.  I replaced his gas pipe [a whopping $8 part] and now his Mini functions flawlessly.

FYI: if you own a Mini, do yourself a favor and pick up a spare gas pipe or two before SHTF.  It's basically the only consumable part on these fine weapons.

I replaced the wood handguard with a RamLine plastic one...  nobody likes getting bit by the slide.  I installed a new factory Ruger slide stop cover plate also, the previous owner had one of those stupid scope mounts on it - total garbage.  If you plan on equipping a non-Ranch Rifle Mini-14/30 with optics, go with a rail from Omega, etc.

The best thing about my Mini-14 is the underfolding stock, a terrific piece made by Federal Ordnance back in the 1980's for LE use.  I have seen these stocks sell for $300+ in mint shape.

Certainly my underfolder saw some wear & tear before I purchased it...  It was the previous owner's ""Truck Gun""... and I bought it for the same reason - it's no safe queen!  Just a dead-simple proven design that goes 'bang' every single time you pull the trigger.  It likes 55-grain ammo fine, but it prints even tighter groups with 40-grain polymer tip varmint bullets.

Otherwise, it's bone-stock.  Iron sights.

I will include two Tapco Gen2 polymer 30-round magazines in FDE.  They run sweet and have an anti-tilt follower.  Also, a metal 20-rounder, which the stock CAN fold/unfold around.

$700 cash only, no trades, no low-ballers.  Price is rock-bottom and a killer deal.

Face-to-face only, buyer must present valid Oregon DL or CHL so I don't have any liability."

This setup comes with a custom kydex holster in Kryptek Nomad, along with a magazine pouch in this kydex. This also comes with the four original 8rd factory magazines plus an additional 2 McCormick's 10rd magazines. This also comes with 447 rounds of 230gr. FMJ ammo, 17 of which are Hollow points. I also have an Uncle Mike's inside the waistband holster that fits this gun without the light. This is a great gun that very fun to shoot and very accurate (depending on the shooter lol) but seriously, its a fantastic gun that is very reliable and will always treat you right if you treat it right. I have unfortunately put about +/-200 rounds down range with it. I wish I could've put some more rounds down range but with me being at school and rarely going home, it is very hard to find time to shoot! This gun is not only great to shoot but great to carry with the kydex holster. It makes it very easy to unholster with the guarantee that it will not fall out of the holster no matter how crazy you think you can get to try to make it budge. Given that it is a 1911, it is heavy and big to carry, but with the proper clothing and a belt, anything is concealable. the mag pouch is also a nice way to carry extra ammo. It has a clip that can fit on a belt or just in your waistline to make quick reloads easy and successful. I wish I could keep the gun but as many people know, Colleges just love to suck you dry and with myself not being able to shoot it at all during the semesters, I have decided that the money would give me a little cushion to pay rent. This is a package deal with all of the items I have previously listed because I do not own another handgun so I would like to get rid of it all! Only serious inquiries. Email me if you would like to see more photos, I could not load them all due to space on this website. The price is $1300 but will negotiate fairly."

Spyderco Para Military 2

Why change something if it works?  Because, at Spyderco, we practice the principle of C.Q.I. - Constant Quality Improvement.  If we can refine and improve the ergonomics or cutting performance of an established model, we do it. 

Our 2010 Para Military 2 has several changes over the classic version.  The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profile thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position.  It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket.  We kept the same high-performance CPM S30V full flat-ground blade but we've also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil.  Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances.  Larger lanyard gives more options for carry. 

Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the G-10 textured handle to the CPM S30V steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

AK SAIGA 7n6,"Garland, Dallas, Texas","$ 1,350","Listed On: Monday, March 2, 2015",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is my last and by far nicest 5.45 rifle, it is a JBI Armory AKM74 5.45x39mm custom build with only quality parts used, comes in a tactical carry case with 4 - 30rd. Bulgarian black and chocolate circle 10 and 21 mags.  I also have 2 crates/4 tins(4,320rds.) of  the banned 7n6(steel core) 5.45x39mm ammo I will sell with the rifle for $900 more or $1,000 trade value.  This is an extremely solid and well built rifle ready for any scenario.  This build was pricey before the import ban on Saiga and VEPR rifles and would cost even more now to duplicate, so no lowballers please.  I am in no hurry to move this rifle or ammo and only selling because I want to slim down the calibers and finish some other projects.  For those not familiar, the .223/5.56 and 5.45x39mm calibers are ballistically very similar when fired from the same length barrel.  Many say the 5.45 round is flatter shooting and offers better terminal performance over the .223/5.56 because of the longer projectile.

Breakdown of upgrades and work performered with price, since some have asked:

$500 for JBI conversion work, conversion parts, going through rifle to make sure gas tube, gas block, sight block etc. are all correct, modifying receiver and installation of the ACE stock components and the re-finish job on the rifle.

$125  Midwest Industries U.S. Palm rail.

$230  Ace Receiver Block Adapter, ACE Push Button Folding Stock Mechanism and Ace Skeleton Stock.

$30  Internal bolt hold open retained.

$40  Ergo grip and sling attachment plate.

All of the above on top of the base rifle, which goes for $700-$800 when you can find them.

$1,350 in cash on just the rifle, NO ammo, or around $1,500 in trade or trade plus cash offers.  The rifle was over $1,600 once completed and really closer to $1,700 after shipping and tax on parts.

Add the banned 7n6 ammo for $900 more for a $2,250 cash price or around $2,500 in trade for everything.  Because it is steel core, this ammo will likely go up in price again now that the M855 and SS109 5.56 rounds may be banned this month.  Prefer not to sell or trade off ammo until rifle is gone, but might consider it, depending on what the offer is, just let me know the deal.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, but will consider trading as long as the value is there, otherwise, I'll pass on trades and wait for cash.  

If wanting to do some type of trade, let me know if the offer is for just the rifle or rifle and ammo(and how much ammo as there are 4 tins) please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  My interests:

5.56 ammo, prefer Federal or comparable 5.56 55gr or 62g., .223 rounds, brass and/or steel cased, 7.62x39 and .308/7.62x51 or 7.62x54 tins, just be specific on what rounds you are offering and the amount.  

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP, but may consider others, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.  

Beretta CX4 9mm, maybe the .45ACP model too, 92FS pistol models.  

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), depending on the deal and values.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex 4-16x or greater.  Ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.
