This receiver was cracked at the pivot pin (i assume yours is as well)  and has a homemade hinge plate installed. Let me be clear about this, This is not a professionally done fix/repair. The repair was made over 3 years ago before STORMWERKZ starting manufacturing pivot pin repair sections. ALL that said, it does function and shoot properly with said repair. Another option is to remove the existing hinge plate and purchase the repair section from STORMWERKZ, swap out your parts and it will be good to go. 

This is a cheaper option than buying the new metal 180B receivers from NODAKSPUD."

This is an early 1st model built in 1876. The features consistent with an early 1st model are the script style serial number (256XX), a flush fit screw in magazine plug, the proper roll stamp on the barrel, the lack of a trigger block button, the early style lever lock, and the early tang marking. The dust cover is the 4th version of the early style. The hammer looks to me like the second variation but it is hard to tell from the photo's that I have to compare it with. It is equipped with a special order 30 inch barrel and a set trigger. The bluing on the barrel and magazine tube rates about 75% or better. It shows some edge and muzzle wear and has a few small dings on the top corners. The receiver has some old pitting in areas and my have had some finish applied. There are no serious flaws in the wood just a few light handling marks. The bore on a scale of 1 to 10 rates about an 8. It is reasonably bright with strong rifling but has a just little crud in a couple of the groves. It is far better than most of the 73 barrels you see out there ..

Its seen less then 100rds thru her altogether. 16"" barrel, 1-7 twist, have a regular a2 flash hider.  Has a Magpul rear flip up sight. The lower is made from LRB arms, a company with a great reputation.
In the build i was offered an upgrade to get it done faster so i ended up doing it, they upgraded the BCG to a full auto RCA BCG with Bravo company upgrades & charging handle.
This is an awesome gun, hate to see her go but I have some other things I want to do...
Please take a look at Hour 13 Defense Solutions before making me a ridiculously low offer... They take a lot of pride in their work, they make amazing guns!
Email with any questions you might have, or send a phone number and I'll text you back. I will send more pictures on request. ive put over $2200 into it the way it sits, I'm a realist, I know I won't get it all back, I believe $1800 is fair...or best reasonable offer.
I'd also be interested in trades plus cash, I am looking to get a Glock 19 or a m&p 9c next, if you have something you would like to trade let me know... I am also looking for a 4x4 quad or maybe a dirt bike...

Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Southpaws, don’t despair! At press time we had Left Hand versions for $10 apiece less. If you can’t find the Left Hand ad, just give us a shout. Next to the company's pioneering work with Kevlar Body Armor in the 1970s, the SSII Security Duty Holster is Safariland's chief contribution to the safety of our Peace Officers. The SSII, of course, is their most popular, high level security duty holster. This Mid-Ride Level II Retention Holster guards against anyone grabbing an officer’s sidearm during an emergency or altercation. This holster is relatively simple to operate, but we recommend studying the instruction manual. This is a standard Jacket Slot SSII to fit Glock Models 17, 22, and 31 that are equipped with Glock GTL series tactical lights, including the GTL10, GTL21/22, and GTL51/52 lights. Manufacturer is Safariland / BAE Systems of Ontario, CA. Construction is Kevlar reinforced Safari-Laminate with double set screws for the Sam Browne Duty Rig with up to 3 inch wide belts. Interior is suede lined to guard against wear to the sidearm. The key to this system and to the holster is the spring loaded thumb releasing top strap retention that enables a trained operator to depress the thumb tab and move the strap forward rapidly, and clear leather quickly. Safariland Model Number is 6280-837-81. For owners of Glock models 17, 22, or 31; and for that matter, models 19, 23, and 32, we have inserted a measured piece of 1 inch PVC that is for Glock owners who do not have a factory light with their pistol. The PVC will easily remove with a pair of pliers. Since only the slide and lower grip frame dimensions are different on models 19 and 23, it will work correctly with either of those pistols. Since a Glock 17 or 22 has a frame thickness of 1.15 inches, and a slide thickness of 1.08; and an overall slide length of 7 3/8 inches from the back of the slide to the barrel muzzle, this holster will certainly accommodate other pistols with those dimensions. Glock 20 and 21 series pistols will NOT work, they’re too thick. Since the kicker is usually the trigger guard on holster interchangeability, a person with, say, an SW99 can alter or replace the PVC piece. We inserted, for instance, a Walther / Smith & Wesson SW99 .40 caliber; an SD9; a standard Glock 17; and a Smith & Wesson MP40 and they all fit well enough. Replacement price on this fine holster is upwards of $150.00. The holsters in the photos are all new and unissued in their factory packaging, and these came to us as surplus from a police trade in Smith & Wesson’s home town. We're offering the Level II Safarilands in the photos each for only $ 29.00 Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Next to the company's pioneering work with Kevlar Body Armor in the 1970s, the SSII Security Duty Holster is Safariland's chief contribution to the safety of our Peace Officers. The SSII, of course, is their most popular, high level security duty holster. This Mid-Ride Level II Retention Holster guards against anyone grabbing an officer’s sidearm during an emergency or altercation. This holster is relatively simple to operate, but we recommend studying the instruction manual. This is a standard Jacket Slot SSII to fit Glock Models 17 and 22 that are equipped with Glock GTL series tactical lights, including the GTL10, GTL21/22, and GTL51/52 lights. Construction is Kevlar reinforced Safari-Laminate with double set screws for the Sam Browne Duty Rig with up to 3 inch wide belts. Interior is suede lined to guard against wear to the sidearm. The key to this system and to the holster is the spring loaded thumb releasing top strap retention that enables a trained operator to depress the thumb tab and move the strap forward rapidly, and clear leather quickly. Safariland Model Number is 6280-837-82. For Southpaw owners of Glock models 17 and 22; and for that matter, models 19 and 23, we have inserted a measured piece of 1 inch PVC that is for Glock totin’ Southpaws who do not have a factory light with their pistol. The PVC will easily remove with a pair of pliers. Since only the slide and lower grip frame dimensions are different on models 19 and 23, it will work correctly with either of those pistols. Since a Glock 17 or 22 has a frame thickness of 1.15 inches, and a slide thickness of 1.08; and an overall slide length of 7 3/8 inches from the back of the slide to the barrel muzzle, this holster will certainly accommodate other pistols with those dimensions. Since the kicker is usually the trigger guard on holster interchangeability, a person with, say, an SW99 can alter or replace the PVC piece. We inserted, for instance, a Walther / Smith & Wesson SW99 .40 caliber; an SD9; a standard Glock 17; and a Smith & Wesson MP40 and they all fit well enough. Replacement price on this fine holster is upwards of $150.00. The holsters in the photos are all new and unissued in their factory packaging, and these came to us as surplus from a police trade in Smith & Wesson’s home town. We're offering the Level II Safarilands in the photos each for only $ 29.00Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

396,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4203396,For Sale:  Safariland Duty Holster SSII Smith & Wesson 99 Walther 99QA 990 also Glock 17 22 Left Hand Shooter 62808492 Safari-Laminate Black Basketweave 2 1/4 inch Slot,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 29,"Listed On: Sunday, April 17, 2016",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: GL62808492LH This listing is for One holster. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Next to the company's pioneering work with Kevlar Body Armor in the 1970s, the SSII Security Duty Holster is Safariland's chief contribution to the safety of our Peace Officers. The SSII, of course, is their most popular, high level security duty holster. This Mid-Ride Level II Retention Holster guards against anyone grabbing an officer’s sidearm during an emergency or altercation. This holster is relatively simple to operate, but we recommend studying the instruction manual. This is a standard Jacket Slot SSII to fit Smith & Wesson / Walther 99 and 990 series pistols. It is also a decent fit for Glocks chambered in 9mm, .357 Sig, and .40 S&W caliber, including models 17, 19, 22, and 23. Construction is Kevlar reinforced Safari-Laminate with double set screws for the Sam Browne Duty Rig with up to 3 inch wide belts. Interior is suede lined to guard against wear to the sidearm. The key to this system and to the holster is the spring loaded thumb releasing top strap retention that enables a trained operator to depress the thumb tab and move the strap forward rapidly, and clear leather quickly. Safariland Model Number is 6280-84-92, left hand variant. Since an SW99 or Walther 99 has a frame thickness of 1.15 inches, and a slide thickness of 1.10; and an overall slide length of 7 1/4 inches from the back of the slide to the barrel muzzle, this holster will certainly accommodate other pistols with those dimensions. We inserted, for instance, a Walther / Smith & Wesson SW99 .40 caliber; an SD9; a standard Glock 17; and a Smith & Wesson MP40 and they all fit well enough. It will NOT accept a wider slide pistol like an H&K USP or a Glock 20 or 21; and will not accept a 4 1/4 inch barreled pistol. It will not accept a revolver. Replacement price on this fine holster is upwards of $150.00. The holsters in the photos are all new and unissued in their factory packaging, and these came to us as surplus from a police trade in Smith & Wesson’s home town. We're offering the Level II Safarilands in the photos each for only $ 29.00Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Barrel accepts interchangable Remington chokes and comes with an Improved Cylinder installed. Wood is very clean as well with little to no marring. More Information From Remington:The Remington® Model 870™ Pump-Action Shotgun is one of the most proven firearm's designs in history. The 870 Express® Compact is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it an extremely useful firearm for young people looking for their first gun, or experienced shooters of smaller stature. The versatile, no-nonsense 870 Express Compact can be used for hunting upland game, turkey, and deer, as well as a home defense shotgun, and informal clay pigeon shooting. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and handle well in the field. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a durable, checkered hardwood stock and fore-end with a non-reflective finish, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The butt-stock and barrel on the Compact model are slightly shorter than standard length to accommodate shooters of smaller stature. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. All 870 Express shotguns function with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes.

This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZs corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. We buy guns and layaway is available!

I just had it appraised at Gander Mtn in Lakeville and they said they would put it on the shelf for 700$ and that it is in the 90-95% condition. This was used mainly for duck and goose hunting but i have also used it for turkey hunting. It is a special purpose super magnum so it can shoot 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 shells. It has a double bead on it with a white bead on the end, which is actually better for early morning shooting or cloudy days when there is no sun. This is better than a tru glo sight because if there is not a lot of sun, a  tru glo will not light up. But this has a high contrast with it being white so it is awesome, especially for early hunts. I was always sure to clean it after every hunt, even if i didn't fire a shot. This gun is very well cared for and in awesome shape. When i bought it, I had the shell ejector replaced and had them put a new firing pin in because they did it all for free. If you would like i can throw in all three chokes for an extra 50$ or I will just send you one with the gun. This is one of the older Remington guns, so it was made with a much higher quality then they are today. This is a great gun and I know anyone would be very satisfied with it but I need a little extra money for college! Thanks for looking!"

The Hornady® Hot Tub™ takes sonic cleaning to a whole new level. Featuring a 9 liter capacity, the Hot Tub™ is long enough to accommodate and clean a 16 inch AR-15 upper. In addition to having 4 transducers, there is also a heating element that enhances cleaning action, which is especially useful when cleaning gun parts. Combined with One Shot® Sonic Clean™ solution, the microjet action of the Hornady® Hot Tub™ removes carbon residue and other debris from cartridge cases, gun parts and other metal equipment. 

Unlike traditional tumblers, sonic cleaners can clean internal and external surfaces of cartridge cases and primer pockets. One 1.7 quart inner tank comes with the unit and can be used in the main tank for cleaning multiple smaller batches or to use separate solutions at the same time. Additional inner tanks can be purchased separately. Hanging cords have been integrated into the design to allow large objects to take full advantage of the ultrasonic energy. Additionally, the Hot Tub® features integrated drain pans in the lids, a small parts basket, a degas function and 5 temperature settings from 100-140°F.
