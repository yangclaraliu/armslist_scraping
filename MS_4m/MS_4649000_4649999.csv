I am not a trap shooter so I have very little use for it. It is a 12 gauge SKB 85TSS with a trap combo that includes two barrel kits (one 34"" unsingle barrel with adjustable rib, and the other being a 32"" over and under ventilated rib barrel ). In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!
This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!

The Spike's Tactical LW BAR2 - 13.2” Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). 

Inside dimensions 1.80"" Outside dimensions Picatinny to picatinny 2.42"" 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!"

I am not interested in trades, with the exception of AK’s featuring combloc receivers and CHF, chrome lined barrels (cash to be added on either end depending on value of items being traded).

I am most interested in a face to face sale, which would take place in the southwestern suburbs. Cash is the best form of payment. Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary. In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it). Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer. It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."

I’d rate the finish as 65-70%+, as it has it's fair share of small scratches/dings, but nothing that would make me question the life remaining in it.

Round count is unknown as this shotgun was purchased used.  I've personally fired about 40 shells through it, and it functioned flawlessly.  It has an 18"" barrel and a pistol grip that mimics the standard ""Tommy Gun"" style.

Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures readily available, but it looks like any other 5-shell Maverick 88, featuring a standard pump-grip and a ""Tommy Gun"" pistol grip in lieu of a full stock.

Cash is the best form of payment. Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary. In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it). Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer. It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."

If steadied on a bag it can hit targets out 50 to 70 yards repeatedly.  These guns have been a mainstay of police departments throughout the US and Canada for the last 30 years.  To date several forces still use them.  The gun is designed to be safer than most with redundant safety features like a long and heavy double action first shot, de-cocker and magazine disconnect.  The pistol also comes with a set of Houge aftermarket rubber grips and a spare factory recoil spring.  Because it is currently an in-service issue pistol I was able to send it back to the factory for a free operational evaluation.  The technician changed out the extractor and spring and issued it back to me with official paperwork.

Click Here To Visit Our Website  Click Here To Register For Free Firearm With a ""Novak"" style rear sight and threaded muzzle, the finish of the Tactical version is mat blue. The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

700,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4649700,For Sale/Trade:  80% Arms EZ Jig,"Burnsville, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 145,"Listed On: Sunday, November 15, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Easy Jig™ is a patented device that makes machining your 80% lower easier, faster, and safer. Lowers finished with the Easy Jig™ have a better finish and hold tolerances that could not be achieved using any other jig on the market today. You do not need to own a drill press or mill to use the Easy Jig™. It truly makes finishing your lower a monkey simple process. On top of all this, it’s extremely durable and can be reused for dozens of lowers.

This version of the AR-15 Universal Easy Jig™ is ONLY compatible with AR-15 80% Lowers.

Easy Jig™ highlights:

Easier
Built in drill/end-mill depth gauge for the trigger and rear-shelf pockets (patent pending)
Eliminates the need for expensive measurement tools
Quick verification of depth setting – eliminates slippage issues that can ruin parts
Eliminates constant measuring to determine depth while milling
Safer
End-mill downward force can’t separate the drill press taper chuck
It is safer to move router by hand than to move the jig around on a drill press

Uses Common Hand Tools
The Easy Jig™ is designed to hold tolerances using a common hand-drill
No drill press is required, milling is done with a router
Routers are much more portable than a drill press, easily borrowed from a friend
Routers are made for cutting pockets using a template
Routers are cheaper than a drill press.
Faster
Pocket drilling requires 10 holes drilled once – Traditional jigs require 42 holes to be drilled once, precisely aligned and clamped, then re-drilled to a larger diameter
Trigger pocket can be cut in 6 to 11 passes vs 25 passes required with a drill press
Router cuts pockets 5-6x faster
Hand-drilling the trigger group/safety selector holes is faster to setup
Lower can be completed in 1 hour (instead of 3 hours for the old drill press method)
Durable
The Easy Jig™ can be used to make dozens of lowers
Components are Type III hard anodized for extra wear resistance. Lost 5/32 bit, but its a $4 drill bit at home depot. Asking $145, paid 150 for the jig and $45 for the bits. Used once, like new. Would cost you $200+ new with shipping. Need $$ for parts and price is firm at $140. Open to ammo trades too, 5.56 or 9mm Luger/parabellum (no +p, +p+ 9mm ammo) will trade for 200 rounds 5.56 and 100 rounds Luger blazer brass; or cheap revolver or pocket pistol, doesn't hurt to ask."

The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.Department Handguns › Semi-AutomaticType PistolAction Double ActionCaliber 9mmBarrel Length 4.5""Capacity 19+1Safety GripGrips SyntheticSights 3-Dot FixedWeight 32 oz"

May consider splitting the gun and the Xchange Kit. The latter can be shipped. The former is only available via FFL locally.

This is a sweet model 60 I took in trade. Basically its a semi auto 22lr with a nice scope. This is a collectable early model with the micro rifling and the 17 round tube. Shoots great, super accurate. I posted more detailed info from wiki below. Check it out. ;) 

The Marlin Model 60 was developed in 1960 from the Model 99 design. The primary difference was that the stock was made of birch instead of walnut to reduce the recurring production costs for the more expensive wood. Marlin also moved away from their practice of using steel inner tubes with their tubular magazine. They moved back to brass inner tubes as other companies had done. This, instead of the steel tubes often seen on earlier Marlin .22 rifles, completely eliminated the rust problems that the all-steel tubular magazines had experienced which helped make the inexpensive Marlin rifle as durable as more expensive .22 caliber rifles. The Model 60 additionally featured a 16-groove rifled barrel, utilizing Marlin's trademarked Micro-Groove rifling technology, which had been developed in 1953. This rifling, with its precision-crowned muzzle, gave the Model 60 an inherent, enhanced accuracy over competing rifles, which used traditional deep grooved rifling, because the bullet was not as severely deformed while traveling down the barrel, and downrange.

The Model 60 has a manual ""fully open"" bolt hold position, activated by pushing the charging handle inwards towards the gun when it is in the fully retracted, open breech position. To close the bolt with the manual bolt hold-open engaged, the charging handle must be pulled out, away from the gun, before the bolt will go forward."

It is geared up one tooth in the front to help keep the front end on the ground. I replaced the chain and sprockets last year. The bike doesn't idle but as I understand, most modded blasters don't. The rear tires are about 30% and I have another set of rear tires that are about 50% as well as the stock steel wheels and a set of nerf bars to go with it. There is a tear in the seat. I do not have a title but the title status is clean and a title could be easily obtained. 

This quad is really a lot of fun. I hate to let it go but my kid has been misbehaving and it has to go. Please respond with a cell number or email for pictures. I'm located in Denver PA. Northern Lancaster county."

Ruger #1 in 22-250. $900

Took this in trade and has been sitting in my safe ever since. Never fired by me but I'm the second owner so not sure on round count. I'd guess about 450.

Comes with everything it came to me with:
Sling
Harris bipod
Scope (Simmons i think. I can't recall the model but I remember looking it up at the time and the reviews saying they're trash...not factored into price.)

Also, for another $250 I'm selling a 50cal ammo can of about 390 rounds of reloaded ammo and 65 pieces of brass. These were reloaded by the guy I got the rifle from and I'm pricing them as primed brass and bullets. I strongly advise against shooting someone elses reloads and would suggest that you pull the bullets, dump the powder, and reload these yourself. (The amount of ammo here is why I'm putting the round count at around 450...none of the brass looks more than once fired)

All the brass I looked at is from winchester, the primers look like CCI, and the bullets all look like 40gr VMAXs. About 70 of the bullets appear to have had some kind of molly coating put on them."

I'm very sad to part with this gun as it is as gorgeous as it is reliable.  The Belgium made/assembled high powers are rare to find anymore, cheap knock offs are out there but nothing like the quality of this firearm.
