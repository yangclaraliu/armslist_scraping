Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Easy to Conceal

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

Personal Protection Made Easy

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.

I have had these grips for almost 2 years and shot at most 4 mags through the gun with them in place. They look perfect, function perfect, and the batteries have just recently been changed out. They are a great addition to my M&P, however I simply don't use anything outside my Glocks recently and therefore this part is not getting the use it deserves. I really like these grips, low ball offers will be ignored.

The stippling really adds a new dimension to the grip characteristics of the pistol. The stippling pattern is perfect, not too aggressive but the grip loses any sense of being slippery.

This gun has only had about 75 rounds put through it, and I would like to find a new home for this beautiful piece.  The workmanship on this gun is flawless, the action is glass smooth, and it is extremely accurate (5 shot groups of 3"" or less can be expected).  Frame material is aluminum with a satin stainless steel slide, so the gun does kick a bit.  Barrel length is 2.67"" with an overall length of 5.5"".  Ambidextrous thumb safety and fixed front/rear sights. Kimber does recommend using only premium factory ammo of 124-147 grains (e.g. Federal Hydra-Shok, Rem Golden Saber, etc) to be used, so don't expect it to feed everything.  But for a premium carry pistol, this shouldn't be an issue for most folks.  All documentation included, as well as soft and hard shell cases, cleaning & adjustment tools, and the factory supplied 6 round mag (8 round mag available, not included).
I realize gun transfer laws are pretty lax in Ohio, but I will require a very short form to be completed stating that you have no known conditions preventing your purchase, and I will also need to see a Ohio state issued ID to verify you are who you say you are, and that you are at least 21 yrs old.  If you are unwilling (or unable) fulfill this requirement, please do not contact me.  Cash or PayPal accepted on delivery during daylight hours in a public place.  Please email with any questions.

The SureFire X400U-A-RD Ultra WeaponLight integrates powerful, high intensity 500 lumen white light illumination and high visibility laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close to longer range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a beam with a bright central area, providing greatly extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical level light�enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark adapted vision�for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra's laser is located below the primary light, and its aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The X400U-A-RD Ultra features our original high visibility 5-milliwatt / 635 nm red laser.

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment/detachment to either universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X400 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The high strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

I have shot a mag or 2 each month in order to ensure I can use it properly, if necessary.  I estimate it has 400-500 rounds. I wipe it down weekly and clean it with every use.  I use it in ""polite carry"" situations and as a backup to a 1911 45 which is my EDC.  It has an AMBI safety and I carry it in condition one in the pocket holster.  It is a good shooter, but, like most pocket rockets, it's effective range is 25 feet or less, for me.  It is not ""fun"" for me to shoot. It is used as a defense weapon and works well for that.  It shows some wear, as you would expect, but, it is in excellent condition.  I understand you may not have an interest in the 2 extra holsters, but, I am not keeping them and I am placing less than half their value into the cost.  I need cash and will not trade.

CCI is known in the shooting sports industry for having reliable ammunition that delivers exceptional performance every time the trigger is pulled. It is this reliability that makes this the ammunition of choice for the Swamp People, Troy and Jacob Landry, when they are taking huge gators in the Louisiana Bayou. CCI 36 Grain Mini-Mag ammunition is one of the most popular 22 Long Rifle rounds ever produced. It is the perfect load for shooters and hunters looking for a great round for a day at the range or an afternoon chasing small game and varmints. One of the great features of this ammunition is the clean-burning powder. This powder provides optimum velocity while maintaining consistent chamber pressures while keeping the firearm clean from powder residue helping to ensure the rifle will function in even the harshest conditions. The copper plated hollow point bullet offers reliable feeding and great penetration. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.Manufacturer Number 91350Chambering 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity 20+12 mags Magazine Type Double stack polymerFrame Fiber-reinforced polymerGrips Polymer, adjustable for reach to triggerTrigger Mech SASights Low-profile fully adjustable aperture and post, 4 rear aperture sizesBarrel Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 18x1 right-handBarrel Length 7.72 inWeight 5.0 lbsOverall Length 16.0 inHeight 9.4 inWidth 2.4 inSafety Ambidextrous thumb safety"

Includes a mounted Tasco red dot sight which is an excellent addition for deer and turkey hunting. This browning takes the Invector Plus chokes and comes with a Improved Cylinder installed in the barrel. This is the shortened model with a 13"" length of pull. Another key feature of the BPS is bottom ejection which makes it an excellent choice for left and right handed shooters alike. MSRP on this shotgun is $699 and the sight sells for around $40-60 so get it here and save big bucks! More info from Browning:TEACH THEM YOUNG, TEACH THEM RIGHTBrowning Micro Midas firearms are designed specifically for smaller framed shooters. If you give a new shooter a long gun that is too large for them, they will develop bad habits in their form as they are doing everything they can just to hold the barrel up and get some kind of sight picture. The Micro Midas BPS shaves off weight and length (which can be adjusted with included stock spacers), creating a more compact and easy to handle package.As the name Micro Midas implies, this BPS is not another cheap ""junior model"" shotgun. The satin finish Walnut wood stock is as beautiful as it is functional, with detailed checkering on the pistol grip and fore arm. The vented rib barrel and the forged, machined steel receiver are gloss blued. The barrel is every bit the same quality as a full size Browning BPS, made with theTotal Barrel Dynamics system, including Invector Plus chokes for the 12 and 20 gauge models and Standard Invector chokes for the other gauges. RECEIVER Forged and machined steelBARREL Ventilated ribACTION Bottom ejection • Dual steel action bars • Top-tang safetySTOCK Satin finish Walnut • Compact 13"" length of pull • Scaled down to comfortably fit smaller shootersFEATURES Three Invector-Plus choke tubes with 12 and 20The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.comNote: We DO NOT accept checks or money orders.

I am selling a Barrett M107A1 sniper rifle to help fund my next firearms project.
I have a couple of them so I'm not desperate to sell so please don't think I will take some lowball offer so let's not waste each others time.

I have successfully shot steel targets at 1800+ yards with both 660gr & 760gr bullets and have found this setup to be consistently accurate.

I purchased the gun new and added the Nightforce scope and the Barrett BORS system.

The gun has been properly broke in according to manufacturers specifications.

My wife is 5'3"" 110lbs and she enjoys shooting this gun. There is minimal recoil.

I am willing to sell the rifle for $10,000.00 without the scope and BORS system or for $13,500.00 as shown.

The rifle itself retails for $14,000.00 the scope was over $2,000.00 including rings and the BORS and mount was around $2,000.00 as well so the price is a good one for this setup.

I have over 1300 rounds of ammo that I am willing to make a deal on as well. It will be much less than it costs in the store. All ballistics for the ammo I have is programmed into the BORS system and it is extremely accurate!

Barretts BORS Information


LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE.
The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.

BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.

After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.

BORS
The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.

Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles.

Folks, if you love the iconic Maxim gun as much as I do, this is your chance to own one! It’s semiautomatic, so no worries about NFA. This collection is the results of years of loving searching and sourcing oddball parts and accessories from all over the ‘net, surplus dealers, gun shows, etc. This is not something you pop into the store for Tuesday cuz' you're bored-This is something special that only comes around once in a blue moon. I would love to keep it, but I got kids, no time, and no space for it.

History

This Maxim started life in the Tula arsenal in 1929. From there, I assume she was captured during the Red Army’s disastrous Winter War invasion of Finland, during which the Red Army was routed by the much smaller, much weaker, poorly-supplied Finnish Army. The Red Army lost mountains of supplies and weapons, apparently including this machine gun, which was then used by the Finns. The top cover has a nice SA Suomen Armelinen stamp above the Soviet one, indicating Finnish army use. This gun was most likely used in WWII, as well, against her original manufacturers. Later, after decades in Finnish armories, this machine gun was sold to US importers, who removed the side plate and sold it as parts. From there, Dennis Ricke of Midwest Metal creations assembled the parts with a new semiauto side plate in 2009, which is when I got her. Since then, she’s been taken to a variety of air shows and reenactments and been treated like a queen.

Equipment

I’ve taken a great deal of time to dig up accessories for this gun, which wasn’t easy. There are very few dealers out there who specialize in Maxim guns and related militaria, so I’ve spent untold hours searching for parts and tools and spares. A list of the accessories for this gun follows below:

1x M1910 Maxim
1x Sokolov Wheeled Mount
 --This is the wheeled cart you see the Maxims mounted on. 
1x Sokolov Mount Gun Shield
 --This is an angled steel plate that mounts to the gun mount. 
1x Tow Strap
 --This is a hemp rope with wooden tow handle. I’m not sure who issued them.
1x Soviet tool bag
 --Soviet-issue tool kit bag with strap. I put the Finnish case contents in here.
1x Finnish tool case
 --Finnish leather case for tool kit, includes tin box of spare parts, cartridge case tongs, wrench, oiler, etc Stamped SA.
1x oiler 
--Antique oiler can. Not military, but period-correct, functional, and looks cool.
1x Finnish belt loader
 --This is a simple tool that folds up in its own wooden case. Allows you to feed rounds through the top and crank one into a loop at a
 time via a back and forth lever action. Ammo is fed from the top via 2 semi-circular trays resembling wings. Stamped SA.
1x Finnish blank booster
--This is the Maxim version of a blank adapter. Fits over the muzzle for blank fire. Painted yellow to prevent mix-ups. Comes in its own special can for soaking in oil.
1x Finnish condenser can
--Green-painted steel can with brass cap for water. Water Jacket hose leads into can to allow steam to condense back into water. You can fire without the can-the gun takes a while to heat up, but it adds authenticity.
1x Finnish water jacket hose
--Old rubber hose with brass fitting. Connects to port at front of barrel jacket and feeds steam to condenser can.
5x steel ammo belts
--Steel Maxim belts. 3 still in protective storage paper. 1 belt appears to be a Finnish-made belt and looks a bit different. One belt
 comes with about 170 blank rounds on it partly as a bonus and partly cuz’ I’m too lazy to pop them out. I’m sure you can find a way to 
enjoy them.
1x canvas ammo belt
--Original Soviet-issue canvas belt with brass feed tabs. THESE are not that common, especially in good condition. I never used it,
 aside from display purposes.
1x Soviet ammo can with star
--Soviet steel ammo can with raised star imprint in the center. 
2x antique Maxim ammo cans (poss. Pre-Soviet)
--These are antique Maxim gun ammo cans. They are riveted, not stamped, and have thick green paint on them with painted canvas carry handles. One is stamped 1915! The other has no stamps. Both are Finnish SA marked and may be pre-WWII Finnish army or Winter War captures.
1x Finnish spare barrel carrier
--This is a leather case made for carrying a spare Maxim barrel. It’s rough. I’ve never used it, just kept it with the other accessories. I’ll be happy to scrub it with some Saddle Soap for you.
1x Data CD-ROM
--This is the information supplied by the gunsmith, Dennis Ricke, of Midwest Metal Creations. This CD contains his step-by-step instructions on how he built the gun and some tips on troubleshooting. 
1x DVD-ROM 
--These are a few files I threw on DVD as a bonus. There are a couple Soviet Maxim manuals, a few pics, and a couple Russian movies, including Brestskaya Krepost (sp?), an epic Russian movie about the defense of Brest Fortress in WWII. If you haven’t seen it, it’s action-packed and about as depressing as any Russian movie is.

PRICE: $6,000 

CONDITION: I’m selling you a gun that was originally manufactured over 80 years ago by a nation that no longer exists and which fought in at least the Winter War and probably fought again in WWII. It was used in Karelia, Finnland, arguably some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world, during some of the heaviest fighting in human history. You can see some kind of battle damage to the water jacket, which is dented in several places towards the rear. The accessories are also used. You can see dings and gouges and wear from actual use. This gun is used, reconditioned, and rebuilt. Everything is functional, but there are no guarantees.

Best Offer Over $ 750

Bought NEW in 1999, It was machined in Belgium in 1986 (if my memory serves), featuring the machined frame and hot P+ load capability.  

Never abused, dropped or holster carried. Only shot on two occasions, 3 boxes/50 of (119gr FMJ) per outing, then cleaned and returned to it's case, inside a Pelican case.  Besides that, it is never handled.  It never misfired or misfed. It always hit the target with natural aim.  

Finish is 99% with no scratches or wear marks EXCEPT at the base of the mag-well where the mag-release spring assist rubs on the baseplate finish, in the machined grooves of the slide mating surface and barrel guide on the slide (mostly ""racking"" wear from it's life in the dealer's display case).  

It comes with Pachmayr rubber wrap around grips ( my ""ex"" tossed the original grips, sorry), pistol case and (3) Browning OEM 10 round ""ban"" mags.  The mags have never been stored in the weapon, or stored with ammo in the mag.  Very fresh!

this is a nice ole' Winchester .22 rifle.  Model 190 Semi-Auto.  Shoots straight as any I've owned.  It's been around a few years, but taken care of and is tight and straight shooter. A guy last night hit a digger squirrel at 40 yds, first time he pulled the trigger.  His only reason for not buying the rifle was he ONLY had $150.     I'm asking $200.   and I'm throwing in 100 rounds of premium ammo also.... As I told him, the first offer over $170. Cash buys the rifle and 100 rds. of ammo!! 
call my cell,  REDACTED   or email /text me at the address above.   I'm leaving town tomorrow around noon... If it's not gone by then, it's off the market here.    Thank you!"

This is an outstanding AR Rifle made by Ambush Arms, the hunting division of Daniel Defense. I'll paste the specs of the rifle below. It's a very accurate rifle, I find it shoots best with Federal MSR, Wilson Combat ammo, and Silver State. Though it shoots everything well. I have on it a Weaver Grand Slam, *which I am not including with the rifle*. I hunt with it using a suppressor/silencer. It's a great deer rifle; small and maneuverable and relatively light weight. Much more so than the full size .308 ARs. The 6.8 is an outstanding caliber, if you're not familiar with it. It's an excellent deer cartridge, outperforming the 5.56 and .300 BO. It shoots flat and is accurate, and has plenty of terminal performance. It's plenty for big body Northern woods deer. 

With this rifle I've also dropped a Texas wild boar, and with a different 6.8 rifle I dropped 2 more Wild boars, one of them was charging me. This rifle and the 6.8 also make an excellent coyote tandem.

FROM THE WEBSITE:

No longer do you have to compromise weight for takedown power, now you can have both.   Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, the Ambush 6.8 SPCII is not only lightweight, it’s modular, utilizing a Picatinny Rail system, and adjustable buttstock.

DETAILS
The Ambush Firearms 6.8 SPCII hunting rifle features an 18” S2W® profile, Cold Hammer Forged barrel.  The chamber and rifling are created at the same time for the most precise alignment of the chamber to bore possible.  Cold Hammer Forging alters the steel at a molecular level creating the most accurate, longest lasting barrels available.  The barrels are Salt Bath Nitride treated, giving the steel the corrosion and abrasion resistance to stand up season after season.  The Ambush Firearms 6.8 SPCII features a threaded muzzle allowing the installation of a sound suppressor or other muzzle device.

Protecting the barrel is the free-floating MFR 12.0 (Modular Float Rail) with adjustable shotgun-inspired hand grip which is exclusive to Ambush Firearms.  The top of the handgaurd features a continuous picatinny rail for attaching optics and sights.  Included are three 3-Inch modular rail sections for mounting accessories.  These modular rail sections can be easily moved anywhere on the hanguard or removed completely.

Every sportsman has a duty to make clean shots on their game and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger, gives the shooter an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  (Geissele SSA® has a total pull weight of 4.5 lb, 2.5 lb on the first stage and 2 lb on the second stage).
