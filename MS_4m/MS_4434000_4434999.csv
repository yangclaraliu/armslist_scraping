If you don't like the price. The great thing about America is you don't have to buy it. 

I've put 100 rounds down range flawlessly. The gun shoots much like my glock 19 for accuracy and conceals very nicely. I am only selling it because I have acquired a couple sig 938s and I prefer them over this.

This design fits almost every AR-15 lower brand and makes machining your 80% lower easier, faster and safer. The Easy Jig has a built-in drill/end-mill depth gauge for the trigger and rear-shelf pockets. A quick verification of depth setting eliminates slippage issues that can ruin parts. It also eliminates constant measuring to determine depth while milling. The Easy Jig is designed to hold tolerances using a common hand-drill. A drill press is not required, the milling is done with a router. Pocket drilling requires 10 holes drilled once. A traditional jig requires 42 holes to be drilled once, precisely aligned and clamped, then re-drilled to a larger diameter. The trigger pocket can be cut in 6 to 11 passes versus 25 passes required with a drill press. Hand-drilling the trigger group/safety selector holes is faster to setup. The whole process can be completed in 1 hour instead of 3 hours with the old drill press method. The Easy Jig can be used to make dozens of lowers. All components are type III hard anodized for extra wear resistance. MADE IN THE U.S.A.NOTE: A router is NOT included."

This one also has what is known as a “low shelf” receiver. Most civilian AR-15 models will have a “high shelf” meaning that the metal has not been carved out, like it normally would be on an M-16. A low shelf is desirable because it allows for addition of a “DIAS” or “drop in auto sear”, which allows the gun to operate in full auto mode. Civilians can legally buy DIAS units, but only those that were manufactured prior to 1986, and only those that are registered with the ATF, with the approval of your local sheriff."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.Item #: 91086UPC_Code: REDACTED6Description: CZU CZP07 9MM BLK 15RDManufacturer: CZ-USAModel #: CZ P-07Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: NitratedStock: Polymer FrameSights: Fixed 3 Dot SightsBarrel: 3.8""Overall Length: 7.2""Weight: 27.2 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 15+1Action: Double Action# of Mags: 3 Packaging: Plastic Case with Cable LockReceiver: Polymer Frame Features: Rail, Dual Slide Serrations, Omega Trigger SystemSquared Trigger Guard, Manual Safety Parts IncludedThis CZ P-07 is used and in Excellent condition (Looks brand new) with only 250 rounds put down range.

In addition to the ambidextrous safety selector/de-cocker, it also includes a fully ambidextrous magazine release and the far-less-common slide lock/slide release, providing left- and right-handed shooters all of the same controls. The take-down lever, however, remains exclusively on the left side of the pistol.The safety lever allows for cocked-and-locked carry with the Commander-style hammer back on a chambered round and the safety engaged. The safety disconnects the trigger bar when in the up position so the trigger moves freely but does not engage the hammer or fire the pistol. Pushing the safety selector down de-cocks the pistol, returning it from single-action mode to double-action. The de-cocker includes a mechanical block that prevents the hammer from making contact with the firing pin.Internally the FNP-45 also has a hammer-drop safety designed to prevent the pistol from firing if dropped, and the hammer has a half-cock notch. The gun will only fire if the trigger is fully depressed. Another valuable internal feature is the steel slide rails that are installed into the polymer frame. These can be factory replaced to extend the pistol’s service life.Further review can be found here: http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2012/1/27/fnh-usa-fnp-45-pistol/This FNP-45 is used and in Excellent condition.

The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage.

I can make any set of grips for any gun out of any material so you name your dream look and I can make it happen for you.  Usually I can get them to you in about a week or two depending on the complexity of them and what all you want done.  I've made everything from simple walnut grips to the clear acrylic grips to even 24kt gold grips.  I also make custom 1911 slot mags to use with the clear acrylic grips so you can see how many rounds you have left.  Last but not least I do a lot of gunsmith work from building AR's, AK's, and 1911's to Duracoating to just plain old gun cleaning if you don't feel like doing it.  I can fix guns,  fit and install parts and best of all my rates are lower than most and my work is better than most as well.  I have very high standards and a very low tolerance for imperfections, the deal won't be over until your 100% satisfied.  I can ship the grips to anywhere in the U.S. and the shipping price will depend on where you are.  I accept Paypal and I do require a 10% non-refundable down payment for exotic grip orders or if you'd like you could pay up front.  You can contact me at 3.1.6-5.1.6-0.6.4.2 for a quote and ask for pictures and below is a guideline for prices. Thank you very much.

The Super Match is the culmination of unsurpassed workmanship and all the best competition-legal features you can pack into a match rifle.  The rear-lugged action of the Super Match is masterfully glass bedded into an oversized stock. At the core of the Super Match’s unparalleled performance is the heavy match Douglas barrel. These oversized match barrels are the heaviest possible match-legal barrels that can fit in the M1A, and they feature a 1 in 10 twist that gives optimal performance for the .308 match bullets we recommend. The Super Match also features a National Match recoil spring guide and a match-tuned gas cylinder. Add the match tuned 4.5 – 5lb two-stage trigger, .0595” hooded rear aperture (½ MOA adjustable) and .062” front sight, and the resultant rifle will blow away the competition with its precision and accuracy.

 The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.
 When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

The black rain PG14 is literally top of the line as far as AR platforms go. You will be hard pressed to find a better production AR than the PG14. This rifle is pretty much brand new but in the short time I've had it, I have babied it and it's pretty much been a safe queen.
I paid $2,700 for the rifle, $45.00 for the extra magazine and 100.00 for the carry case. I am asking $2,100 for everything. Let me know if you have further questions, thanks."
