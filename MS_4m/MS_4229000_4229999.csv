This is a very nice old rifle with skip-line cut checkering, 24"" heavy barrel. It is built on the short-action 700 Remington. These make a really nice long-range varmint rifle. The .243 Winchester works well for coyotes, and even deer if the ranges are kept within reason. This rifle is probably about 95%, with a few light handling marks and a chip or two. This is not a ""perfect"" rifle, but it is very nice. I have checked the throat with a bore scope, it is probably an 8.5 or 9.0 out of 10 (10 being new). It has been fired, and you can see some wear, but it is in very good condition. These have been getting more and more difficult to locate over the last few years.

This  current production S&W Airweight .38 is rated for +P ammunition, and to me is an ideal concealed carry revolver. They always go bang when you need them to. They can be carried in a pocket without fear of snagging. You know the rest. This revolver has been shot maybe ten times and looks like new. It comes in the S&W box, with papers, etc. The DA trigger is smooth and light. I have not shot it, since I knew I wasn't going to keep it, and it looks so nice. Since this one can handle =P self defense ammunition, it's a more effective round for self defense. You don't have to worry about a hollow point jamming in a revolver!

For about the same price as a .380 that might jam on you when you REALLY need it to work - this Smith a& Wesson is a serious and high quality gun that is reliable and will never fail you. that's why they still make them, and why they are still a great and serious self defense option.

Email through Armslist or call/text me at REDACTED so we can make arrangements to meet in Santa Fe. You will like this one a lot. 

I might also trade for an interesting milsurp. Just let me know what you have. 

Thanks for reading my ad. If you need more pictures just let me know. Nothing much to see though. There are no scratches on it.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Selling my Daniel Defense Omega 7.0 carbine length free float rail. This is a great rail and, as far as I know, is the only free float rail system that uses the original barrel nut and retains the delta ring. No rifle disassembly,  easy installation.  Very sturdy. I have just decided to change my setup to a round tube style handguard. Rail is in great shape, other than the Daniel defense logo being a little faded. Rails aren't chewed up at all. Has quick disconnect holes on both sides for sling attatchment.  This rail sells for almost $220 new at midway. Selling mine for $120. Firm

We shot the gun the day he bought it with 6 rounds of 38 special and it went back into the safe until a few years later. He sent the pistol to Ford Guns in Florida where they dehorned all the sharp edges rounded all the corners and polished the matte stainless to a mirror finish. There is not a machine mark on the pistol and the finish looks better than any bright stainless gun or nickel gun I have ever seen. They did an amazing job. He then sent the pistol to Grant Cunningham. If you know anything about revolvers you know who this is. He gave it one of his super trigger jobs and replaced all the springs in the trigger pack and polished everything. The single action pull is SCARY and breaks at less than a pound. The double action feels like you are pulling your finger on ICE. Its as smooth as any Colt Python out there or smoother. The pistol comes with the original Ruger Grips and High Viz sights. The green is in the gun now the red and white pipe have never been taken out of the pack. The pistol also has Hogue Rosewood grips that look fantastic. Has had less than 400 rounds thru it most 38s. The lockup is super tight and the timing is perfect and the cylinder ring is very faint. The pistol will cut the same ragged hole at 15 yards freehanded. Would rather trade than sell but feel free to make offers just know that there is over 1300 invested in the pistol. Don't expect to get that out of it by any means but will also not give it away. WILL NOT RESPOND TO STUPID OFFERS! WILL ONLY TRADE FOR ITEMS LISTED BELOW! Thanks for looking.

The CX4 is a semi-auto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.
The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.
This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.
The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.

From the manufacturer:
IC-A2

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

This gun has 100 rounds through it without any issues, I've only shot light loads through it so far, but I do include a wolf spring kit with it, which includes an 18, a 20, and a 22lb recoil spring, which should help if you intend to shoot hotter rounds.  The gun is basically brand new, the only thing I've done to it after removing it from its packaging is clean and oil it.  It includes its original packaging, manuals, locks, and cleaning brushes.

Besides the superior steels of which it is constructed, it also features a unique sand-resistant magazine that was developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan and comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of grit accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 even in the most extreme conditions.Soft-Shooting, Accurate and Easy to MaintainAt the range, the M9A1 will impress you for its low recoil, as well as its accuracy. As one of the ultimate evolutions of a best-in-class military and law-enforcement pistol, it will reliably feed commercial ammo, even with more open hollow-point designs. Maintenance is easy: this pistol requires no tools for disassembly, while the reverse is even faster and easier, with the disassembly lever returning into the locked position automatically. Thanks to all these features, the M9A1 is an ideal tactical pistol that will meet the requirements of the most demanding users."

This revolver is designed to be a snub nose, 7 shot, low recoil and lightweight gun. The frame is an alloy, making it a very good choice for concealment.

Single barrel break open 12 gauge shotgun, 30"" heavy and thick barrel, not sure what choke or chamber length. Marked ""ETOWAH"" on one side, but that's probably a trade name or store brand. Gun appears to be made by DAVENPORT between 1902 and 1910. Metal is in excellent condition-probably reblued. It's too pretty to be original. Stock is in very good condition, although the black plastic butt plate is a modern replacement. Gun is missing the hammer ($15, available at gunparts corp), the hammer screw, one trigger guard screw, the spring that pushes the firing pin back away from the chamber, and the brass bead at the muzzle.  This gun has the patented hinged key take-down pivot screw. The barrel steel does not look like Damascus or twist construction to me, but I'm not a gunsmith. The Davenport 1903 catalog (available on eBay) says it was offered in both Damascus steel versions and ""fine decarbonized rolled steel"" models.
 Bore is pitted from prior use with black powder shells or corrosive primed ammo in early 1900s.

For your consideration is a scarcely seen Ruger Black Hawk, commemorating the Black Hawk War Sesquicentennial 1832-1982. This is NIB. This gun might have extra meaning, considering many of you reading this are from Black Hawk County and might be familiar with Black Hawk. According to the documentation this run was limited to 150 guns, and all were enhanced with features from Mag-Na-Port. I believe the actual production numbers are unknown. Gun comes with very nice case with specially commissioned medallion on the lid, arrowhead in Lucite block,certificate of authenticity, and the Black Hawk War Autobiography. Somewhere I read that the arrowhead was taken from related Indian grounds, but I dont recall the details, and it is nothing I can verify.  The book, the medallion, the certificate, the Arrowhead block are all numbered 74, which is the number this gun is in the run. ""GWR 82"" has been engraved/carved into the back right corner of the wooden case.

12 gauge, 3"" magnum chamber, 24"" cylinder bore non-rifled barrel.
Comes with iron sights for use with foster style slugs.
Metal is in good condition, wood is in very good condition. Has factory original rubber recoil pad with white spacer, and has sling hardware ready for your sling or carry strap.
This is a light weight gun with a skinny fore-end wood. Good for beginners except for the serious recoil with slug or buckshot loads.  00 buckshot patterns pretty tight for an unchoked barrel. I get 8"" spread at 12 yards or about 20"" spread at 25 yds.

ANOTHER POSSIBLE USE for this gun would be to cut down the barrel to 18"" and mount a tactical flashlight with an around-the-barrel clamp just forward of the wood, and then you have a cheap but amazingly powerful home defense weapon. Short and handy. Only good for one shot, of course, but that one shot could bring down anything on two or four legs.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

The P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

One of the smallest 9mm on the market.

After one of Israels conflicts, the Israelis found that the FAL was jamming due to the dust in the desert environment, but their enemies AKMs would continue to function.  After the conflict the Israelis decided to merger AKM technology with M16 technology and created the Galil.  She fires 223 ammo, has the action of an AKM, with the caliber of a M16 with peep sights.

Superior versatility is available with this high-performance, 10mm AUTO pistol. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20SF, the subcompact GLOCK 29SF is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29SF 10 mm with a 10 round magazine capacity standard. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control?especially to shooters with smaller hands"

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.
