When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

It was bought ""blemished"" but I honestly couldn't find the blemish they mentioned: over polishing of rails. It has an inverted Y by the serial number to denote blemished. DW offers lifetime warranty except for any cosmetic issues. But they'll fix anything that's functional. Forever. 

I've put about 400-500 rounds thru it and followed all the break-in instructions. Being a stainless gun, proper lubrication is necessary to prevent galling.

I would consider it shooters condition, not a wall hanger. Wood has nice color but has handling marks, dings, and a very small crack behind the receiver. 
Metal is good but does have rust freckles and imperfections. Chamber and bore are in great condition still, has been taken care of but it is 63 years old after all.  Overall solid gun, plenty of miles left.

I have pictures with a sure fire and agency arms mag well that aren't for sale....well I could sell the mag well with it for an extra 75.

This gun is in very good condition.  Only trades I'm interested in are factory Glock 17,19 gen 4 or vickers tactical/rtf2 framed guns.  Any 1911s in 9mm as well.

Contact me at six31eight709sixsix5 or email me.

Not setting a price taking offers I bought the gun brand new in May for 500 stippling was 150, mag well was 100, sure fire 250, and the agency arms trigger which is on my 19 now was 150.00. So I put a lot of money into it, but also understand I won't get back as much as I put in but will not take lowball offers.

Scope: Trijicon ACOG 3x30 Dual Illumination Tritium green Winchester Crosshair Reticle with TA60 mount.  This Trijicon rifle scope features the Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC), with a bright daytime reticle using fiber optics which collect ambient light. With its dual-illuminated reticle, the Trijicon 3x30mm ACOG Winchester .308 Crosshair Gun Sight provides shooters with a distinct aiming point in all light conditions, without batteries. The reticle of the scope is powered by a tritium-phosphor lamp that glows in low-light conditions, while advanced fiber optics automatically adjust the brightness level and contrast of the reticle in brighter light conditions. Trijicon has made the ACOG sight internally-adjustable and compact, with tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.  Every feature of the Trijicon Advanced Combat Optical 3x30mm Gun Sight and its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions without failure-prone batteries.  Includes padded hard case, original packaging and instructions, dust coat, and cleaning tools."

The Holographic Hybrid Sight I (HHS I) features an EXPS3-4 with a G33.STS magnifier. It has great utility for any shooter, whose target ranges vary from close to mid-range. The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.
The durable, night-vision-compatible system offers wide-field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low-light conditions.

The Gold Hunter is very easy on the shoulder. The gas system and recoil pad do a great job of softening the punch. A great little feature that is exclusive to the Browning Gold is the speed-load. With the bolt locked rearward, as it does when empty, inserting a shell into the magazine tube sends it immediately to the chamber, making the Gold ready to fire instantly, without pressing any buttons. This is a worthwhile feature when the shooting is fast, as over an active dove field."

With its dual-illuminated reticle, the Trijicon 3x30mm ACOG Winchester .308 Crosshair Gun Sight provides shooters with a distinct aiming point in all light conditions, without batteries. The reticle of the scope is powered by a tritium-phosphor lamp that glows in low-light conditions, while advanced fiber optics automatically adjust the brightness level and contrast of the reticle in brighter light conditions. Trijicon has made the ACOG sight internally-adjustable and compact, with tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.  Every feature of the Trijicon Advanced Combat Optical 3x30mm Gun Sight and its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions without failure-prone batteries.  Includes padded hard case, original packaging and instructions, dust coat, and cleaning tools."

The finish on all metal looks great as well as the wood, very nicely done.  This is the upgraded version or gen 2/version 2(hence V2) over the first milled C39 rifles.  Some of the upgrades include, the trigger group(my favorite), nice, light and smooth and you know when it will break, bolt hold open safety lever, muzzle brake, larger magazine release, now accepts all aftermarket AK-47 stock in case you want to change it out later, nitrade treated barrel for better corrosion resistance, looks great too, there are a few other things I am missing, but you get the point, a very nice and well done AK for the money.  Only selling because I have many other rifles in this caliber that I don't shoot much, but no hurry to sell.

When you hunt big and dangerous game, you want a rifle you can depend on. The Savage 16/116 is that rifle. Its strong synthetic stock sports a camo finish that blends into a wide range of hunting environments. An effective black recoil pad helps mitigate the recoil of hard-hitting calibers. The 23"" fluted stainless steel barrel has a satin nonglare finish and is outfitted with an adjustable muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Drilled and tapped for scope mounts, the rifle is ready to receive your optics. The three-round internal magazine has a hinged floorplate for quick unloading. Savage’s renowned adjustable AccuTrigger™ and AccuStock™ work together to give this powerful firearm the superior accuracy you need in potentially dangerous hunting situations."

The action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

A brand new Shilen, match grade, chrome barrel was used for this custom build. The contour is a sendero contour (sometimes called the Rem varmint), 8 twist and finished at 26"". The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown.  I have the barreled action in a HS precision sendero stock with the BDL bottom metal.  The barrel has only 5 rounds through her... to test the chamber and put the rifle on paper.  I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was caustic blued but can always be customized to your needs... Maybe add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; Jewell trigger; custom paint the stock; ect.

The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 3/4 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/2 MOA or better using hand loaded ammo. I have a few other HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build if the HS stock is not to your liking.  Willing to sell just the barreled action for 1200 if you already have a stock and bottom metal.

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s available as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probably have it or can build it.

Will ship to your FFL if needed."

Fantastic 1911, especially for the $. I am selling it b/c I just don't find the time to shoot it. I will only sell to an Illinois resident who has a valid FOID card.

I had some upgrades done to it: Apex (Machined Aluminum) Forward set sear and trigger kit (parts plus labor was $250) turns spoungy stock trigger into a match grade trigger with very little take up, about a 4lb pull weight and almost no overtravel also trigger is one piece instead of the factory hinged trigger which makes it much nicer to pull/shoot accurately, Stipple Job on front strap and backstrap of grip also the safety, mag release button and index points on both sides ($80), and Tru Dot ""Night Sights"" ($120), also barrel feed ramp was polished along with all internals, trigger guard was undercut and magwell flared. It comes with 2 factory mags a bottle of froglube and two boxes of Black Ops ammo 185gr. Also both mags are loaded with premium hollow points: Barnes tac-xp solid copper hp, and Winchester PDX 1's.
The only complaint with the Smith & Wesson line of pistols is the trigger. The factory trigger is spoungy and has ALOT of take up and reset and approx a 5lb pull weight. That has all been upgraded. I could sit here and Try to explain it but you really have to feel it for yourself.
I also still have all the parts for the factory trigger plus when the APEX trigger job was done I had to upgrade the sear housing block to the newest version so that's another new part. So if you have any questions please just let me know. I have roughly have $900 into it, and regrettably  I'll DROP THE PRICE and sell for $650. 

I also will throw in a complete set of:
 ""David Tubbs"" - AR15 - Chrome Silicone Steel Spring Kit. This is by far the best of the best spring kit for the AR15 rifle, actually it will fit any AR from a Cabine to a Rifle in terms of gas system lengths. All (Even the most expensive and high end brands and/or model) AR's (factory, Mil-Spec, Etc.) Use ""MUSIC INSTRUMENT"" wire spring steel in their guns. It is not the best that can be used, as a matter of fact the ""music"" quality spring steel Springs last approx 2000-5000 rounds until they fail. Obviously some before others depending on the specific spring in the gun. Usually the buffer spring or the extractor Springs are the first to fail due to the forces being applied to them more so than others. But this is where ""Chrome Silicone Steel"" Springs prevail. Personally I don't know why all high end guns don't use them. David Tubb designed a set of the most important springs that run an AR-15 rifle and did a lot of research before putting them to market. But a short explanation is: they are heat treated several times, shot peened, magnafluxed & inspected with ultraviolet light to detect any microscopic stress fractures that could lead to failure. So needless to say they did their homework and the proof is in the stats. Their springs last over 25,000 rounds and keep going. 
So if you have strictly a range toy then you can just rely on the factory music spring steel springs but if you're ever thinking you may need to use your AR to save a life or take one then I would want the best, because it's basically springs that run a gun. If even one breaks usually the gun is out of action until it's replaced. And who wants to try to try to fumble around in a hostile environment possibly low light, being shot at, Etc. while you're trying to change out a spring, and some of them cannot be changed out in the field at all. Like your ejector spring! If you don't believe me search around the web and see how often AR-15 ""Extractor"" springs fail. Do your own research, if I had a loved one who relied on an AR15 LE, Mil, Etc. I would buy them a set and send it to them. It's only about $80 shipped and all of the springs are easy enough to replace in minutes without any special tools, except maybe the ejector spring that one you need a roll punch but it's not too hard and not the most important spring in the kit. 
It consists of:  1 Extractor Spring, 1 Ejector Spring, 1 Buffer Spring (Flat Wound), 1 Hammer Spring, 1 Trigger Spring and 2 (Flat wound) 30rd. Magazine Springs.  So I'll throw in this set of NEW Springs that are still in the plastic sealed packaging, never used. I kept them for spares but had to sell my AR and realized I still have them but no use for them anymore. So I'll throw them in for a deal sweetener. I hope they can save a life!

I would possibly consider a Gen 4 Glock 21 and a Streamlight TLR-HL or Sportsmans Warehouse gift card plus cash difference.  Will sell the entire package for $1250.    Trade value is higher.  No splitting the package unless someone calls dibs on the grips for $225 first.  More pics available."
