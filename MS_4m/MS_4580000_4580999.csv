This gun is ideal for indoor use with low velocity ammunition, outdoor use out to over 100 yards with ammunition of any velocity with match rifle accuracy, or the original intent, Free Pistol competition.  Used (in Europe and Asia) for police and intelligence service operations due to the small size and extreme accuracy, it is considered an assault weapon in some states and towns, but does have ""Olympic competition use or intent"" exemption in many of those areas.

 http://www.armslist.com/classifieds/search?relatedto=4574568 

Note that some chips are present at the inside of the fore-end.  The price has been reduced for this.  The gun probably is an early second version of the gun, based on the SN.  The tool kit red wrapper is not the correct one for the gun, and is not the one included with it.  The OEM green envelope is provided.

The one illustrated is complete except that the case key is missing, as is a 4mm wrench that often was included in the original tool kit.

The 150 is extremely accurate, far better than the Morini and somewhat better than the TOZ35.  It also is much more durable than the TOZ.

The 150 fore-end accepts a variety of weights, which can be set up as a recoil buffer if desired.  That feature renders it superior to the later 160 model.

These guns are ""designed"" for 50 meter Olympic and international competition, but are IDEAL for training in ""standard pistol"" use due to the light trigger, and for use in indoor ranges due to the long barrel and low noise.  It can be used with any velocity ammunition, from CB or ""quiet"" to high power rifle ammunition.  The accuracy is so good, that they also can be used as if they were a .22lr rifle out to 100 yards and more, with appropriate ammunition.  Accuracy is about as good as the best USA made .22lr target rifles.

I'm well aware the Hi Points are cheaper guns - they are big, bulky, don't shoot a ragged hole, and ugly ... but they are pretty reliable and perfectly accurate at defense range. Hi-points always go bang when you pull the trigger, and are very accurate. Please note that most Hi-Points don't include the factory hard case. So it won't win any beauty contests, but that's not a priority when the bad guys come a knockin.

It comes with lots of extras too - Mossy oak grips (installed) and the standard black grips, 3 magazines, ghost ring sights (if you don’t like the factory 3 dot sights), hard case, and all associated manuals/papers/locks/etc

This would make a great gun to leave in your car, or maybe a nightstand gun for a wife/girlfriend who doesn't need the latest high speed / high dollar toy. Especially being a 380, these heavier guns really have no recoil and have nice thick grips to make them actually pretty comfortable to shoot... 

Bad for carry, great to leave sitting on a night stand for the recoil sensitive shooter.

""Battle Rifles""
by Larry Vickers (retired U.S. Army, Delta Force)
vickerstactical.com/tactical-tips/battle-rifles/

I frequently get asked which battle rifle is my choice for a preferred 7.62mm weapon. I have one of about every type ever made in my personal reference collection, and some are better than others in a given area, but the one I have always liked the best is the FAL. The M14 can be tuned to a higher degree of accuracy and the G3 I would consider the most rugged, but all things considered the FAL as a 7.62mm battle rifle or carbine is, in my opinion, the all around best choice.

I currently own 14 FAL style rifles of different flavors, mostly original Belgian made guns, but I would recommend a buyer look hard at DS Arms offerings if you find yourself shopping for a 7.62mm rifle or carbine vs paying the high price for a pre ban Belgian FAL. In addition DS Arms deserves the lions share of credit of keeping the FAL viable in this day and age and offering more options and varieties than Fabrique Nationale ever dreamed of. I own 3 DS Arms FAL style rifles and I find them well made, more than adequately accurate, and reliable if you know how to treat an FAL. Make no mistake the FAL is not an AK; you cannot abuse it like an AK and expect it to work. If you treat it with the respect it deserves however it will serve you quite well. Jeff Cooper said it well; “The AK is the rifle for the masses and the FAL is the rifle for the classes”. As he so often did Jeff summed up the situation perfectly; and make no mistake the FAL is the rifle for the classes.

Featuring excellent engineering the FAL has always been a weapon that holds a special place in my heart. In addition it features attention to detail and quality construction throughout. I find serious firearms enthusiasts almost always love the FAL for the sake of the remarkable design characteristics. For a serious use FAL my favorite is the tactical carbine offered by DS Arms. With an aluminum alloy lower receiver and 16.25 inch barrel it makes for a very handy 7.62mm carbine. For my particular version I used an Israeli mag release, a Norwegian AK4 style modified FAL bolt carrier with forward assist scallop, and DSA scope mount. I also mounted a Surefire flashlight with a Vltor clamp to a short piece of picatinny rail to the handguard. I topped it off with an excellent Schmidt & Bender Short Dot II scope with a 7.62 mm M118LR BDC. The S&B scope is heavy duty so to keep the weight down I opted against a DSA modular rail system. After I did a radiusing of all sharp edges DSA black Duracoated all the metal and I installed one of my VCAS slings. The end result is a superb general purpose battle carbine. It would be my first choice in a .30 caliber carbine to take into harms way.

There are countless spare parts and accessories available for the FAL on the market. Many of the parts interchange with other FAL variants so customizing your 7.62mm rifle is easier than with any other long gun save the AR family. DS Arms not surprisingly is an excellent source for FAL parts and a simple Google search will reveal several others also.

A few end user tips on the FAL: keep it reasonably clean and well lubed, learn how the gas regulator functions and how to adjust it, and only load 18 rds in the magazine. In my experience if you abide by these rules the FAL will serve you well.

I can recommend the FAL as a weapon and DS Arms as a vendor of guns, parts, and accessories for the FAL. If you are in the market for a serious 7.62mm rifle or carbine, give them a call.

I bought this shotgun from a local farmer who bought it new in the 70's who says he put about 2 boxes of shells through it. I put only one box through it myself.

Here's a quote I found about this shotgun on shotgunworld dot com:

""If I were you I would run very fast & get that gun before someone else gets that minty 28ga Flite King. I will tell you what my 12ga Flite King Deluxe will do, I can stand the gun on it's recoil pad press the action release & the action will fall open by it's self. Smooth as butter.""

I just tried this (never tried it before) and it does indeed fall open by itself...smooth as butter. :)

I would also consider a trade for a Chinese/Norinco SKS with wooden stock and no modifications.

Up for auction is a set of two MG15 parts kits and one 80% receiver. One is the water cooled model and the other is the air cooled. Both kits are German however they are both mismatched as is common with the imported MG15 kits. You can see from the pictures that both are missing stocks, doppel trommel drums, and a bipod and carrying handle on the air cooled. What you may not be able to see in the pictures is that there is one missing a firing pin, one of the ejectors is broken, and the brass pressure release valve on the water jacket is broken. These are all unfortunate however the fixes could be made with a little effort. The 80% receiver is included in the lot. It is seen with one of the sleeves already on it. If you have any questions about these kits please feel free to ask though admittedly I don't know a hell of a lot about them other that what I've listed here. PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU BID!! I accept payment in the form of a POSTAL MONEY ORDER only!! Please don't ask if I accept any other kind of payment. I only ship CONUS and payment is expected within 7 days of the end of the listing. If you can not own these kits where you live DO NOT BID!! You will not receive your purchase and you will have negative feedback left for you. Thanks for looking and God Bless!!

276,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4580276,"For Sale:  Benjamin Discovery .22 with pump, scope with mounts and pellets , used","Temecula, Inland Empire, California",$ 350,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 5, 2015",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've had this rifle for about a year, it has been used only by adults and works well. Includes several different pellets, a 4-16 Centerpoint AO scope and the benjamin branded pump. All are in working order. It was dropped once on dirt and has a few scuffs on the stock, all are cosmetic and have no effect on operation.
shipping to most places in the continental US will be about 40-50 dollars
 More pictures available upon request


Manufacturers specs below:
Get into precharged guns at an unheard-of price and also get the accuracy of an expensive European rifle!

Benjamin has bridged the gap and taken the pain out of PCP guns. Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo‚ but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!

If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump‚ you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.  

The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures‚ Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank‚ you can do that‚ too‚ and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc.

The gun comes with a hardwood stock (14 length of pull)‚ Williams fiber optic front and rear sights‚ and a built-in air pressure gauge. Included in the package is a hand pump that's easy to use and very clear on showing you when you've reached maximum operating pressure.

When you open your box‚ you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user‚ you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs‚ you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.

If you want to switch to CO2‚ that's easy to do. A degasser tool lets you quickly and safely exhaust all the high-pressure air (or you can just shoot the air out). Attach the optional CO2 adapter‚ connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now‚ commence to shootin'!

With high-pressure air‚ you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2‚ you'll get a lot more shots per fill.

Stevens guns from this era had no serial numbers. Based on some internet research this one is probably mid 1940's. The gun overall is in excellent shape. There are several small scratches in the Tinite stock here and there...but this is usual wear. Nothing chipped or broken. The barrel is clean as is the rest of the gun. Stamped into the barrel on the side is ""Stevens Model 94-Savage Arms, Chicopee Mass. USA"" On the other side is ""Proof Tested 20 gauge 2 3/4""
Not so much a highly collectable gun as much as it is just a really interesting gun because of it's age and the Tinite stock. I believe these were the first guns to have plastic stocks, Would make a nice gun for a junior learning to shoot, or just a nice interesting gun to add to your collection. All Illinois laws apply. $200.00and I will include a soft case. For a 60+ year old shotgun, this one is in excellent shape. Small and light and easy to shoot."

At retail, I've got $2,165 in this rifle.  However, it's not new.  While it shoots like a true custom made bolt action, it has suffered some light chipping of the paint and other normal wear during it's exciting life.  Rifle has been shot to 1,000 yards and holds minute of angle with 175 grain Sierra Match Kings. 

Target shown was shot with surplus M118 (Vietnam era 173 grain sniper ammo) at 100 yards off of bipod, prone.  Group Measures 0.566"" outside to outside.  Subtracting out the diameter of the bullet, this group is 0.258"" center to center.  That's .24 moa with 35 year old ammo.  

The golden standard for sniper-grade accuracy is 1 moa or less.  This rifle consistently shoots less than 3/4 moa with match grade ammo.  And, as you can see, will sometimes print groups as small as 1/4 moa.  The 26"" barrel also allows enough velocity for the rifle to hold sub-moa all the way to 1,000 yards.

Rifle has the old style Remington trigger, tuned to break like a glass rod at 2.5 pounds.  To my knowledge, the old style triggers are no longer sold, making them increasingly desirable for custom rifle builds.  Every sniper and/or gunsmith that I've talked to highly prefers the old style triggers over the new X-Mark Pro triggers for their custom guns.  The action is also EXTREMELY smooth and easy to operate quickly for those rapid follow up shots.

Asking $1400 for everything pictured / described.  Will also throw in an unopened box of Remington Premier Match ammo (168 grain Sierra Match Kings) for the listed price.

Send me an email with your cell # in it for the quickest responses via text.  Otherwise, I'll reply to e-mails after work.

Click here to read more about Magpul's M-LOK Technologoy.The Super Modular Rail MK8 with M-LOK Technology was designed to be a lightweight, ergonomic and modular option for the M4 Carbine and all mil-spec AR-15 variants. The MK8 with M-LOK Technology was also designed to do a good job in meeting the ten design specifications for a good M4 weapon rail.1. ERGONOMICInstead of four sharp and jagged M1913 rails spaced at 90 degree intervals, the MK8 is fully ergonomic, maintaining its comfortable rounded shape throughout the length of the rail. The rounded top allows the shooter to easily wrap his or her thumb over the top of the MK8 as many shooters like to do with a forward grip.2. SET-UP IS MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE Accessory rails can be attached anywhere along the length of the rail in 45° intervals, including the standard  3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. The MK8 also includes 2 standard non-rotating QD slots on either side of the rail.3. FREE FLOATING The weapon barrel is completely free floating when an MK8 is mounted. No force is put into the barrel from slings or bipods that could affect point of aim.4. STRONGThe MK8 is machined from a semi-billet extrusion made from aircraft grade aluminum. A semi billet extrusion is designed with extensive machining stock for 3D features that are machined directly into the rail so that the rail is one integral piece.5. RIGID Current infantry doctrine makes extensive use of accessories that require attachment to a weapon rail. Flashlights, visible and infrared lasers, night vision and thermal sights all require a rigid weapon rail so that zero is not changed when a bipod or sling is used to support the weapon from the rail. The MK8 is a rigid interface for weapon accessories due to its precisely machined proprietary barrel nut and secure rail interface and clamping arrangement.6. LIGHTWEIGHT Use of aircraft grade aluminum and high strength steels in the MK8 give the entire assembly a good strength and performance to weight ratio.7. ACCESSORY RAILS EASY TO INSTALL Utilizing the Magpul M-LOK Technology, accessory rails are easily attached in seconds. The technology also allows the shooter to place accessory rails across slots, allowing even further customized placement of both accessory rails or direct attach accessories. 8. ACCESSORY RAILS ARE SECURELY ATTACHEDWith the Magpul M-LOK Technology the special steel rotating nuts are precision machined from 17-4 stainless. The slots on the rail are also precision machined so that the accessory rail, nut and rail all mate together perfectly. Using a short armed hex key, the accessory rail is then locked in place creating a rock solid platform for any attaching of accessories.9. RAIL ASSEMBLY IS EASY TO INSTALL Each MK8 comes with a precision machined, 2-1/4” long barrel nut that is machined from aircraft grade aluminum and hardcoat anodized for a durable surface. The barrel nut requires no indexing, creating an easy and seamless installation. The rail is then slid onto the barrel nut and the precise barrel nut to rail fit precisely aligns the rail to the barrel and is attached via two cross bolts.10. RAIL IS EASY TO REMOVE Just by loosening six screws the MK8 can be slid off the barrel nut for cleaning or gas system maintenance. As quick as it is removed the MK8 is can be re-installed with the precise barrel nut to rail fit maintaining sight and accessory zero.Abailable in Black and Desert Dirt.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GEISSELE 13"" SUPER MODULAR RAIL MK8, M-LOK"

Much like the Sidelok™ for Picatinny attachment, Kinect™ insures proper and easy installation, eliminating common variables that would cause issues.(ie: over tightening) Although revolutionary, Kinect™ is quite simple in its operation. There are two spring-loaded wedges in the base of the Kinect™ mounting point. When you press the accessory or rail section down in the MLOK™ slot, two tiny deployment triggers get pressed against the rail firing the wedges into place. There is nothing more frustrating that fiddling with an allen wrench (if you can find it) to get your accessories on an off your weapon with traditional modular rail sections. This changes the whole dynamic of the MLOK™ system and really makes every accessory truly removable with the ability to mount it in a second when needed.SPECS:  Length: 1.68″ (42.8mm) Use with one MLOK section Width: .82″ (20.9mm) Height (Over MLOK): .41″ (10.5mm) Finish: Black Anodized Compatibility: Compatible with any MLOK rail system. Weight: 0.8oz   ***Please allow your new Kinect piece a break in period, due to the new anodizing finish.***The Kinect Pieces are made fully assembled from the factory and not intended to be disassembled by the end user. Because these are mechanical items, all kinect pieces are tested multiple times at the factory to insure they work properly and are securely mounted onto MLOK rails. So if you see marks of use on your new Kinect piece, do not worry, that is the factory test marks. Since the MLOK system has varying tolerances, each Kinect piece may attached differently to each different manufacturers rail.

I originally purchased this shotgun as a cruiser with the pistol grip but i currently have a speedfeed stock on it. I have put around 20 rounds of buckshot and slugs through it to function test and everything functioned perfectly. This shotgun features a 20 inch barrel and the ability to hold 7 rounds(plus 4 if using the stock). This package included the shotgun with the stock on, the pistol grip with mounting hardware, the original box and 3 ammo cans with an assortment of ammo listed below. Im only selling all of this as a package because i have no other shotguns in my collection. 

The ammo is as listed:

Winchester super x – 3 (25 round boxes)

Winchester super x – 35 rounds of buckshot (1 box of 15) (4 boxes of 5)

Remington slugger rifled slugs – 1 (5 round box)

Fiocchi buckshot – 70 rounds (7 10 round boxes)

Federal buckshot – 140 rounds (28 5 round boxes)

I purchased this shotgun new for $320, the speedfeed was $80 and the ammo and cans are worth at least a few hundred dollars since its all premium stuff. This would make a great home defense purchase for someone looking to get everything in one bundle. The buyer must be at least 18, not a felon, an Indiana resident, and legally be able to own a gun in Indiana. Buyer must be willing to sign a simple bill of sale for my personal records (ill bring a copy for you as well). I am only looking for a local sale (i will not drive out of fort wayne). Feel free to ask any other questions."

Like our top-selling Fury flashlights, the M600P provides a wider reflector-shaped beam with increased surround light, as opposed to the higher-intensity, farther-reaching beam created by the TIR lenses found on most Scout Lights. The compact size of the M600P-just 5.7 inches long-minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights. It attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. The M600P comes with two switches: a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; and a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec Type III hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600P is O-ring sealed to keep out the elements. Like all SureFire WeaponLights, the M600P is built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Tan. Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend.Features  High-performance, recoil-proof LED generates 600 lumens of blinding white light and continues producing tactical-level light for 1.5 hours Precision reflector provides a wider beam pattern, increasing situational awareness for close quarter operations Construction: Mil-Spec hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, optically coated tempered window, O-ring and gasket seals Ergonomic tactical switching: click-on/off tailcap and pressure-activated tape switch (both included) Thumbscrew clamp securely attaches to any MIL-STD-1913 (""Picatinny"") rail Powered by two 123A lithium batteries (included) with 10-year shelf life  Specifications  Max Output -- White Light: 600.0 Lumens Tactical Runtime**: 1.5 Hours Bezel Diameter: 1.37 Inches Weight w/Batteries: 7.8 Ounces (approx.)

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

A casual day of plinking or more serious varmint hunting is offered to you in this nine-shot wonder gun!Extended Ejector Rod: For positive extraction of fired cases.Ribber Grip: Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Features: Model: 990SS4 Finish: Matte Stainless Steel Caliber: .22 LR Grips: Ribber Capacity: 9 Weight: 38 oz Rate of Twist: 1:16.5"" Barrel Length: 4"" Frame: Large Action: DA/SA Front Sight: Fixed Length: 8-3/4"" Grooves: 6 Safety: Taurus Security System,Transfer Bar Trigger Type: Smooth Rear Sight: Adjustable Grooves Turn: Right"
