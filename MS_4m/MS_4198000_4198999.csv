Rifle is a Finnish M39, 1942 SAKO barrel, on a 1911 Izzy receiver. Stock is a wartime (rounded finger joint) unit, with some nicks and rough spots, has SAKO cartouche. Other parts are typical Finn, a mix of almost everything. Has arsenal tag with two dates (1959 &1973). I thoroughly disassembled, cleaned and inspected all parts. I have fired about 100 rounds since then, with careful cleaning after. Fires and operates nicely (for a Mosin).
Overall condition is good to very good. Most parts are still blued, barrel is bright. No corrosion or pitting. Judging by the dirt and cosmoline removed during cleaning, I think it is safe to say this rifle was never re-blued. No pits under the bluing. 
I also have 440 rounds of silver tip, steel core Soviet surplus ammo (out of the tin) and 40 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 180grain boat tail. 
No trades please, and FTF would be best as the ammo is heavy and shipping costly. I would consider shipping to an FFL if you are ok with the cost ($25 transfer fee plus actual shipping costs). and understand payment must clear prior to shipping."

Was made about 1880 and is in very good condition for its age. Lock up and timing are perfect, I would say it is completely safe to fire, although I never have, and it does have a weird little quirk to get the trigger to work. The foot can't rotate the cylinder from full lock up so you have to open the action and rotate it ever so slightly, then reclose it, so the foot can get under the claw and rotate the cylinder. I'm sure a light bit of filing would reamady the problem but I've never cared enough to risk messing it up with my mediocre gun smithing skills. Perfect gun for a S&W collector. 

$150 and she's yours. This is the best condition one I have ever seen and also the cheapest. The ones that look like Swiss cheese from all the pitting usually fetch about $200-$250.

This pistol is a black powder revolver and also is EXEMPT from 594 because of that at its age. If you don't believe me go ahead and read the bill, it's definitley in there.

After calling and visiting a few local gun shops I am listing a few things from the safe, that I might consider selling post UBC. I don't have the time to deal with scheduling a visit to a FFL or the want to deal with the hassle. After they pass the UBC everything goes back in the safe, until this bad law is fixed, if ever. 

I bought this one from Keiths last spring and it is a youth/womens model. Grey laminate sock and blued barrel, has extended mag release, bolt release mod, and factory short stock for small framed individuals. Previous owner moded the forend a little and mounted on rail section for a bipod or laser.

It’s received a stock upgrade since I have had her. She’s very accurate and once I dialed her in, she keeps 3 MOA at 500 for a full magazine when I do my part. THe USGI rear ap with a NM front post gives a very clear sight picture.

TRW trigger group with mixed USGI internals, spline shows some wear but VGC
HRA Op Rod Tab is in VGC
USGI Rear sight ASSY, BME stamped knob
.062 NM Front sight.
Bolt, and I assume internals are SAI. Researched and verified not from any recall lots
Solid Op rod guide manufacturer unknown but pic included
USGI gas system and FH
Here is the interesting part…
Barrel is a Med Weight National Match manufactured by Nomura Machine Industries circa 1992. P (Proof Round tested) stamped into the barrel. Very rare article, I believe only 2000 were made.

I upgraded this rifle to a USGI Leopard-spotted stock. This stock is baby smooth and has no nicks or dings. She turns heads at the range every time she comes out. Pics really don’t do the finish justice. Proof P-no serif and DAS on the stock. Rifle locks up tight in this stock.
THe pics in the camo stock are older pics from when she wore a synthetic stock with a rattlecan paint job.

Comes with 3 CMI 20rd mags NIW. Bayonet and TUrner NM sling do not come with rifle.

Terms:  Rifle may only be purchased by individuals 18 or older and otherwise legal to own a firearm."

As you can tell I have done many things to this Jeep to upgrade it. It was stock when I obtained it 3 years ago and began modifying it. I have put high end parts on the Jeep and it is in very good shape for the age. It does not smoke or burn any oil. I am selling it because it very rarely gets driven and it's too nice to just sit. I would consider partial trade on Colts.  I also have a clean and clear TN title in hand.   I was previously considering trades, but I just bought a Lexus LX and there's no more room in the inn for this one and it needs to go. Price reduced $1,000 to $7,500.

411,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4198411,"For Sale:  M&P Shield .40 with Truglo TFO day/night sights, trigger kit and more...","Orlando/central Florida area, Orlando, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 7, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"This pistol has had roughly 100 rounds through it. It's been cleaned and oiled after use. It's the perfect balance between highly concealable (the more you worry about concealment, the less likely to carry it) and still having firepower you can have confidence in. It has an Apex trigger enhancement kit that makes a very noticeable difference in the trigger weight, smooths out the trigger break, and gives it a quicker reset. My accuracy with it jumped up to a whole 'nother level the most recent time I used it, which was the first time with the Apex kit. I have two 7 round magazines (or 7+1 if chambered) and one flush with the grip 6 round magazine (or 6+1). The sights are tritium (glows at night) and fiber optic, which you can see clearly at times that the bright sun in your eye might make usual white sights hard to see. The sights are green. I've got a kydex and leather hybrid holster w/ sweat shield to go with it (right handed) that fastens in two places about 8 or 9 inches apart, distributing the weight better. The holster hasn't been used other than trying it on when I got it. The fastening hooks can be moved up or down to change the cant (angle) of the pistol to make it more concealable or more accessible and it was molded specifically for the M&P Shield. I had planned on getting my concealed weapons permit at the time I got it all, but unfortunately things came up and the 170-some odd dollars wasn't available at the time. I now am getting ready to get it, but plan on getting a compact that is modular and can be turned into a subcompact (or full size even, though I don't need that one) as well. My full size Glock 17 I've put WAY too much work and money into to sell, so that leaves the Shield. The Shield itself shoots great. In fact, I second guessed my choice of getting it in .40 at first before I tried it out, but when I compared it at the range to my mom's 9 mm Shield and couldn't really tell a difference recoil wise. I was surprised, it's very manageable to shoot for a light .40 subcompact (even with some pretty hot ammo). The dual recoil (or guide rod) system really truly makes a difference. Even my full size gen 3 Glock 17 didn't seem a whole lot different in recoil than the Shield. Lastly, I have about 2 boxes (I think there's 38/40 rounds total) of Gold Dot SB (short barrel) 180 grain ammo to go along with it. It was designed specifically for subcompact use, so the hollowpoint expands fully at the velocity gained from a shorter barrel. The gun also has a lifetime warranty from Smith and Wesson for the original owner (the first person to register it with them), which you can still use because I have the paperwork for it still and never registered it with S&W. I also have the box, casing from the factory, lock, and booklet for it. Altogether with the Shield, extra magazine, the sights, trigger kit, holster, and ammo there's about $700 into it all and other than the pistol itself, that's not including tax or S&H. Now I'm not expecting to sell it for $700, but at the same time, it's not something I absolutely have to sell. If I get any good, fair offers then I'm sure we can work something out. $550 would be ideal, but throw me an offer. Everything will be sold together, not looking to sell bits and pieces. If you have a concealed weapons permit that's a plus, but a DL and bill of sale is a must.

You have to hold one of these guns to true appreciate how balanced and nice they are in the hand. I have multiple high-end pistols but always carry my Walther PPS because it conceals so well and with the 3 different size Italian high quality magazines it really feels like 3 distinctly different pistols and tailors to must any carry situation or clothing style.
I purchased 2 of these at the same time 1 for me the other for my lady. I love mine and carry it daily she chooses not to carry so we are selling hers as she loves mine little .380 for rare occasions that she sill carry, so currently the is just a safe queen. I would rather just price it fair with the extra magazine, Limbsaver Grip and new leather holster I will just hang on to it rather then accept any less.

A true Series 70 Colt MKIV Government Model 1911. Born in 1972, this gun is the real deal when it comes to Colt's Series 70 pistols. Adorning a beautiful nickel finish, this gun features a smooth and light single action trigger and the ability to carry 7 rounds of 45 ACP in the Colt factory magazine, plus 1 round in the chamber. This gun comes in a proper Colt box with manual and wax paper. This gun also wears beautiful exotic bone grips with gold Colt medallions that really compliment the nickel finish. u will find a few minor dings and faint scratches, as well as some wear on the rear top of the slide (all flaws are displayed in the photos below). The condition of this gun leaves it in a perfect spot to be attractive enough to show off, but used enough so as not to be concerned if you choose to shoot it."

this service does NOT remove material from the grip. I have a method of using localized heat to redistribute the finger groove material. Unlike other services, or DIY methods this will not leave your grip thinner and weaker. The problem with the dremel method is the amount of material you have to remove to get a finnishable surface will greatly effect the structural integrity of the grip

Once the grip has been reshaped it can be left with a smooth finish, or stippled. The picture shown is the standard stipple option. Plenty of grip while looking clean and not over done.

Classic Feel, Modern Design. No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol. In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949. 

Plus a comfortable, precision-molded Zytel® polymer grip frame with a serrated frontstrap and checkered backstrap. Internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent sight to barrel alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs.  Contoured ejection port and easy-to-grasp bolt ears allow for durable and reliable operation round after round. 

Manual safety positively locks the sear when applied.  Features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the ""SAFE"" position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.  Patented loaded chamber indicator that allows for visual confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber.  Features a conveniently located push button magazine release on the left side of the frame.  Magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.

Tactical look 

18 1/2  inch barrel, 12 gauge chamber, modified choke, Walnut wood (ceramic coated) is very good on forend and solid with no cracks or chips. Bore is very clean and shiny. Lock up is very tight. Action is very smooth and operates with that great sound that made the Model 37 famous and wanted by all. Metal is in great shape. This has been recently duracoated and refinished and completely stripped and cleaned . Shoots 2 3/4 shells and is capable of slamfiring (google it), not possible on any new shotgun. 4+1 in chamber. Pistol synthetic stock. Top heat shield. This is a pre 855,000 model which is All milled and made in Ithaca, NY. All in all this Ithaca is very good and is ready for a lot of shooting and hunting along with a great home defense weapon with quality behind it. This blows away any Mossberg 500 and is ambidextrous bottom load bottom eject so no worries for lefty shooters. 

Buyer must abide by all laws. Show iD and I will have a bill of sale written up.  No felons, nobody under 18.

Stoeger is Beretta's Turkish manufacturer. The 92FS/M9 was chosen over the Cougar for the US military because of the weight difference in the slide. I've maybe had 1-3 FTE's with some crusty steel ammo over the several years and shooting countless rounds through this gun. The barrel rotates with the slide, keeping it on the same plane when firing. This greatly reduces muzzle-rise and improves accuracy. A VERY smooth shooter!

The Arsenal SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock. The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. Stock Pictures Shown."

as much as it pains me to have to put this ad up as I am really not wanting to part ways with this beautiful firearm, I really do need the money. I have taken pristine care of her and never even fired more than 100 rounds through this thing. this is around $700 less than the list price so I do feel it is fair considering it is in perfect condition. It is immaculate. I am not eager to sell this so my price is firm. If you know anything about the ACR you may know that it was featured on future weapons and is seen by many as a revolutionary advancement in the assault rifle. if you're a scar loyalist you May be hesitant to admit that the ACR actually does perform better in most tests than the scar. There are the of course many who will disagree but I suggest if you want to do your own research and watch reviews from people who are experienced in owning both you will see the ACR your wins time and time again. you can fill this thing with mud shoot it underwater whatever. This rifle was set to replace the m4 in the last military trials but proved to be too expensive to mass produce. If you know your guns then you know the reliability, durability and flexibility of this platform. Designed to work under extreme conditions, and designed to adapt to any situation. The enhanced model sells new at 2700$ Last but not least please do not send me emails asking if it is ""still available"" if it is still listed here it is for sale. I am not interested in trades, nor taking less value than I am asking for this. If you really would like to own this gun please get a hold of me and thank you.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

I am the first owner of this gun. This revolver is needless to say... rugged. It is a beautiful stainless steel firearm that has a bulldogish weight and appearance. It was made to defend yourself from Yoggie the Bear but I guarantee here in the Northwoods of Minnesota, or even at the range you can find use for this. This is the Dirty Harry .44 caliber, except unlike the big and bulky longer barrel revolvers, this thing comes in a mean little package.

It comes standard with adjustable sights and a nice Hogue Recoil Tamer handgrip. This thing is designed for power and when you pick it up and feel the weight, you'll know how high quality of a firearm this is. Don't worry about the recoil, my little 100 pound fiance fired this revolver just fine and you will too. This revolver is just plain fun to shoot and it makes heads turn at the range.

If you are looking for something to walk the woods with, if you are looking for a range toy, or if you are looking to show a burglar you really mean business, do it with this .44.

MSRP is very high on this thing, we all know MSRP is total bullshit. I'm going to list this at $800 but send me any offers. I love this thing, but obviously I need the money for other projects and I have accumulated too many guns. 

Send inquiries to me via contact seller, or you can reach me faster via text message at phone number: seven six three five one six three two four seven. I'm at work from 7am-5pm just like every other lucky guy working so I can pay taxes, so if you call and I don't pickup I will get back to you right away.
