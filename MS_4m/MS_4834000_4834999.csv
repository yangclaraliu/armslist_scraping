This is NOT a century or any other mass produced rifle. The fit and finish is excellent quality on this rifle. It is of course 922r complient. 

-Built from a Maadi (egyptian AKM) parts kit 
 -Barrel assembly was assembled/headspaced by Childers guns. I sent it down to them because of their reputation for quality work. Headspace was double checked and it was perfect.
 -Built on a new Nodak Spud reciever, the best quality reciever you can build on. These magazines fit very snugly in the reciever, no mag wobble
 -I didn't like the factory sheperds hook retainer for the trigger assembly parts so I replaced with a plate. Makes those parts much easier to replace/install
 -Romanian hammer forged chrome lined barrel, very good quality barrels that will last forever (I'm not sure that you can even get them anymore now that the Cuger factory in Romania is no longer exporting to the US) The chrome lining is also much more resistand to corrosive ammo than non-lined barrels
 -Very nice quality wood that was worked over, has a nice color/grain to it
 -Bolt carrier assembly/trigger parts polished to a chrome like finish, looks very nice and is functional. The polished surfaces make the bolt assembly much smoother operating and makes it very easy to clean.
 -Bakelite handgrip is in new conditon and also has very nice color
 -Krebs custom rear sight (very functional, very nice upgrade to the standard rear leaf)
 -Sling
 -slant brake for that classic cold war look
 -Retracting front bipod (has that rough functional ak look to it)
 -bayonette included
 -cleaning rod there
 -I only have the one magazine pictured but will include a second as well (couldn't find it this morning)
 -The rifle was Cerakoted by Dakota Custom Rifle
 -Has russian akm cleaning kit hidden in the buttstock 
 -I will also include a slide fire stock, its kind of a novelty but cool way to simulate FA fire. 

Some history, the Egyptian AK's were copys of the Russian AKM. During the cold war the Russians packed up an entire factory in russia and sent it to Egypt. they also send factory workers down there to train them how to build the ak's. So this AKM parts kit was built off the exact same machines that the russian ones were. 

In building the rifle and the slide fire stock I have arpox $1700.00 into the setup. I am VERY firm on my $1100.00 price. The only way I will negotiate is if you don't want the slide fire stock i can keep that and sell that seperately. Quality products cost money. 

I'm sure there is stuff I'm forgetting, as I find reciepts/remember stuff I will update."

Forward-ejecting allows theRFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup. The patented,dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment itleaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamberand lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, wherethey exit. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automaticrifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; thereciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safetydisconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpupconfiguration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than itscompetitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanismcross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast toexisting Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup developedbecause the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansionis directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shootershead and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threadedmuzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with Keltec's A2-style Flash Hider.A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It acceptsstandard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not needto be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the RFB comes witha two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user'spreference. 30.00 shipping most States.Cash price add 3% credit or debit Call or email. Jack's Pawn & Gun106 Cleveland AvenueKings Mtn.

This weapon has never been fired and is in new condition. I would be happy to meet at a range (or similar) and you(/we) could shoot it .... however shots fired seals the deal. This weapon is in new condition and there is no B/S about that!



This is below retail with all of these extras as I am moving and cannot bring this weapon with me. This has been my dream to own an M4.



It has a carriercomp full length titanium magazine tube. This magazine holds 7 shells, instead of the stock 4, and it reduces the overall weapon weight as it is made of stronger and lighter titanium. It came with a US made carriercomp spring and follower. ($200 and 6+ month shipping wait)

http://shop.carriercomp.com/product.sc?productI d=5&categoryId=4

(it looks like carrier comp no longer makes these ?? which would make this even more valuable as this is known as the BEST full length magazine for the M4)



In order to be compliant with weapon laws one more component needed to be US made so it has a Mesa Tactical Urbino stock with a ""limbsaver"" pad and a cheek riser to adjust where your cheek naturally falls.

http://mesatactical.com/products/urbino-pistol-grip-stock-for-rem-versa-max-riser-limbsaver-12-ga-black/

This buttstock is slightly shorter than the original and I do have the stock buttstock to include with the purchase as well.

I also have about 50 shells, mostly 00 but some slugs. The original bottle of Benelli oil, Benelli choke tool, and manual. A cheap sling.



Retail on a new Benelli will be around $1,800 (sales tax would add to this), the magazine tube was $200 and the buttstock was $165.

The complex but reliable receiver mechanism was designed to permit the cycling of longer cartridges than previous Winchester rifles could permit. When the lever is pulled down, it brings the bottom of the receiver with it, opening up more space and allowing a longer cartridge to feed without making the receiver longer. The Legendary Lawmen edition of the Model 94 was produced in 1977 and features a round barrel, an engraved antique silver plated receiver, and a medallion embedded in the stock. This rifle has an elevation adjustable rear sight. Its wood, metal, and bore are all in very good condition.

It looks just like the MP5k and was tons of fun to shoot. So that is 2 $300+ guns for a pretty good price It also comes with a red dot scope and a 110 drum mag from ATI. This is a package bundle. It comes with everything here. Open to trade for an AR or AK but no .22's please

I am interested in all sorts of firearms, but not looking for any hunting rifles or shotguns at this time.

I have a Colt New Frontier in 22LR with the very handy 4 5/8"" barrel. Frame is case-hardened steel with a blued barrel and cylinder. 

This is NOT an aluminum or zinc frame.

It is not a collector's piece but more of a very well-kept shooter.  I think of it like this:  It's not pretty enough to be a safe queen, there is some blueing wear at the muzzle.  But, the rest of the blueing and case hardening is gorgeous so it is almost too pretty to shoot.   So I am making room for something I don't feel bad about shooting.

Serial number marks it born in 1974 according to Colt web site.

The one picture I have here is for my inventory and does not do the blue and case hardening justice.  I have added a picture of the muzzle blue wear.

You must be able to legally own a handgun in TX.

I live in Austin but will be in the DFW area with it from 11/1 - 11/7.

The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.

Awesome pistol. I have been looking for one these for ages. Fit and finish are great and it is a tight little pistol. Friends remarked on how light it was. Put 240 rounds through it in about 20 minutes before the range closed. Accuracy was very good. The pm30 definitely prefers hi power heavy bullets. I just scored 500 rounds of the CCI 40 grain copper plated rounds and cant wait to get back to the range. If you ever see one of these for sale, BUY it."

Cash accepted locally or USPS money order if payment is mailed for shipping. Not interested in trades.

Thanks for looking.

Stock photo used, here is the detailed description from CZ:

“The CZ 75 Kadet conversion kit is a separate accessory for the CZ 75/85 pistol series allowing the firing of .22 LR caliber cartridges. The CZ 75 fitted with the Kadet .22LR conversion is the perfect training or plinking pistol with the slide weighted and balanced just like the CZ 75. The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.

Included are 2 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models.  The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06,  and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models.

When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a PCR slide stop should be used for proper last-round hold-open. On 85 models, the 85 slide stop must be used but will not enable last-round hold-open. When used in competition-oriented or modified 75 series pistols like the Shadow, a factory-weight 75 mainspring may be required to provide proper primer ignition.”"

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition.

In 1912, the British started purchasing some 1911 pistols from Colt. With the outbreak of hostilities, it was decided to purchase additional pistols and by 1919 in excess of 17,000 had been delivered. Pistols in both .45 ACP and .455 Auto Mark I were obtained. The former were marked with a ""C"" serial number prefix while the latter had a ""W"" prefix. This 1911 serial # C-4649 caliber 45 acp was made is 1913 and a letter from the Colt archives states it was one of 20 pistols shipped to the London Armory Company on May 4, 1914. This was prior to the opening shots of the War which occurred on July 28, 1914. This pistol undoubtedly saw service in the hands of a British Officer during the Great War! The frame and slide have the British proofs. The over all finish is about 30% with the trigger, hammer, slide release and safety showing about 50% of the nitre blue finish. Barrel is marked HS on the lug and the letter P. Rifling is excellent! Grips are in good shape for a 101 year old War veteran. The magazine is a two tone correct punch and saw cut with lanyard loop. With the approaching anniversary of the start of the Great War July 28,1914 - November 11, 1918 this is your opportunity to own a piece of history. While it has not been researched yet it may be possible to discover which British Officer carried this pistol adding to the collectible and increasing the value! The Colt letter verifying the shipment information is included    C&R License accepted"
