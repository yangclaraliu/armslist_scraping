ALG Defense Trigger (QMS Trigger) 
The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) trigger is an enhanced Mil-Spec type AR-15 trigger. The QMS is very similar to Mil-Spec units in pull weight, but the honed sear surfaces and polishing result in a smoother than standard pull. The honing of the sear surfaces does not change the geometry of the stock trigger, so the high reliability of the Mil-Spec trigger is maintained. The pull weight is 6.5 pounds, which falls within the Military specifications of 5.5 to 9.0 pounds. The Mil-Spec pull weight makes this trigger perfect for users who want all of the rugged reliability of a standard trigger, with an improved smooth pull. The trigger and hammer are 8620 steel alloy and the disconnector is 1070 high-carbon steel all tempered and hardened to Military Specifications. The included pins are 4140 tempered chrome moly steel that is centerless ground to 0.001"" larger than stock, resulting in an improved fit within the lower receiver, while still remaining slip-fit and field serviceable. The tempering of the pins keeps debris from imbedding into them and wearing on the lower pin holes which can occur with softer pins. The springs used with the QMS are full power to maintain positive ignition with all types of ammunition.

The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition. PRODUCT SPECSItem Number: DB9FSCaliber: 9x19MMLength: 7.8”Height: 5.6”Width: 1”Barrel Length: 4.75”Distance Between Sights: 6.25”Weight (unloaded): 21.5 ozTrigger Pull: ≈5.5#Magazine Capacity: 15+1 RdsUPC: REDACTED86"

For sale is a new in the original box Bushmaster Carbon-15 SuperLight Optics Ready Carbine.  I purchased this rifle from CTD a few months ago, and it's been sitting in my safe ever since.  I bought it for an SBR project, but I never got around to it.  The rifle is .223 / 5.56.  It has a composite / plastic lower and does not have a flash-hider.    Everything else is ""standard"" AR-15.  Rifle includes 1 30 round PMAG and a Bushmaster red dot sight.  I paid around $650 for it out the door of my FFL.  This is a great starter AR-15, and it's still in the box.  For an extra $100, I'll throw in 10 additional PMAGs. I'm not interested in any trades.  I'm not really in the market for new stuff, and I'm not really in a rush to sell, so please hold all low-ball offers.  I have my CCWFL.  I am willing to sign a bill of sale at your request."

(NYSE: RGR) is excited to announce the introduction of an all-new Ruger® Redhawk® revolver chambered to shoot both .45 Auto and .45 Colt cartridges. This new Redhawk features a very distinctive look and is built with the rugged reliability customers have come to expect from Ruger. ""The Redhawk has been one of the flagship revolvers in the Ruger line for 35 years, and this is the first time we have produced a Redhawk capable of shooting both a revolver caliber and pistol caliber from the same cylinder,"" said Chris Killoy, Ruger President and COO. ""Customers will not only find this revolver to be attractive, but also very utilitarian for a number of shooting applications,"" he concluded. The Ruger Redhawk revolver was Ruger's first double-action revolver specifically designed for the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. It embodies many advanced features such as a triple-locking cylinder, a unique single spring mechanism for a smooth, light trigger pull and all stainless steel construction. This new model features a round butt frame for a more compact feel and hardwood grips that are checkered and textured, resulting in a solid grip and great control. The 4.2 inch, half-lug barrel offers reduced weight and excellent balance. A fully adjustable black blade rear sight and red ramp front sight provide quick target acquisition. Additionally, the revolver ships with three (3) full moon clips that act as both a speed loader for the .45 Auto rounds and aid in the ejection of the spent cartridges. Additional full moon clips can be purchased at ShopRuger.com. For more information on the Ruger Redhawk chambered in .45 Auto / .45 Colt or to learn more about the extensive line of award-winning Ruger firearms, visit Ruger.com or Facebook.com/Ruger.

I have a brand-new (never stuck in anyone elses dirty ears!) set of a Boost Series 4 Channel hearing protection.  These are the black color model. These are the ""Platinum"" or the top-of-the-line set that are made from Do All Outdoors.  These are IN-EAR electronic plugs, that do NOT require ear molding.  They are the most comfortable, in-ear & non-molded, on the market.  These are the upgraded, digital, 4 channel set.  Even some of the more expensive molded sets are only come in 2 channels (analog), the difference being AM radio vs FM Radio!

Noise reduction rating of 26 (without provided inserts) / 29 (with provided inserts); most likely better than you ear muffs!

Price: $475 SHIPPED!  If you were to buy these from a vendor, they would cost you $860!  I will ship if you are interested in buying remotely!

I picked these up after already having purchased the 2 channel version.  Unfortunately, I need to sell these to pay for medicine (I am terminally ill, and my Insurance {BCBS of KC} will NOT pay for required medicine to keep me alive!).  Else, I would use these myself over the 2 channel version.

Why would you want an IN-EAR Electronic set of Hearing protection?  Here is why:
- You won't be interrupted by a cheek wield.  Over-the-ear muffs often hit the stock of a rifle or get in the way; These won't!
- Electronically amplifies sound; increased volume like a hearing aid for noises/sound around you.  Electronically tuned to amplify HUNTING sounds (stick rustling, animal walking in leaves, etc.)
- Automatically shuts off all incoming sound with incoming noises over 85 DB (i.e. a gunshot) 
- Extremely comfortable!  They won't heat you up in hot weather.  They wont break a seal when wearing eye protection and a hat.  Better than muffs for fatigue purposes.
- Movement drills (tactical) or outdoor Hunting provides a huge advantage over electronic over-ear muffs.  These wont fall off or get bumped, catching on brush or ground foliage, etc.
- Doesn't require a visit to an audiologist for a custom ear mold!  These fit your ear concha and outer-ear section, vs. molding to your inner-ear cannal.  Therefore, when using the silicone inserts for additional noise protection (NRR of 29!), they fit almost everyone.  This saves you an additional $100 visit for a custom mold and a month worth of waiting. 
- When shooting in a really noisy environment, you can double-up and put muffs over them if needed.

What is included new in the box:
- Case
- Cleaning brush
- Silicone ear inserts (6)
- Battery
- Left/Right 4 Channel C-Shell electronic ear plugs

Warranty: THE CORE WARRANTY SEE. SHOOT. BELIEVE.
A warranty. What else about a product says as much about how highly a maker values their own work? It’s a mark of integrity, an assurance that the person who built it believes in it enough to stand behind it. Lawyers, legalese and fine print have no place in it. And we feel ours both stands on its own and speaks for itself.


“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE Rifle Systems firearm has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one
of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”
That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

These Glock are very, very difficult to come by and they are no longer made or ever will make anymore. Gun broker has them going for $679.99+ tax stock with two mags

I also have about 500 more rounds of reloads but due to them being reloads, i dont think i can legally sell them with the pistol so id have to trade those off separate if you wanted them. Its been my nightstand gun for a couple years. I put a good 2000 rounds through it, then got a buddy of mine who works for sig to get me a free factory rebuild ( didnt need it, but it was free so why not) which is why it comes with the red case. The barrel and all springs were replaced. The new barrel has 400 rounds through it. The light comes with a spare battery and is extremely bright. It shoots great and other than a small scuff or two from being in the nght stand its in great shape. If you want to test fire it before buying, i can meet at a local range and you can fire off a couple rounds to test function if you feel the need to. I am asking 775 with the light, 700 without. This des not include the reloaded ammo. I dnt own another 40 so i would be willing to trade the reloads off if you want them, or ill end up holding on to them if you dont want them.

Krugerrands are the most popular gold bullion coin in the world and offer a great value way to invest in gold. Krugerrands are 22 carat gold, but weigh more than a troy ounce and therefore contain exactly 1 troy ounce of fine (24 carat) gold.

This 1 oz. Gold Krugerrand is an investment and good as Gold if the dollar goes flatter, use it to trade or barter.  Gold hold its value better than the dollar.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

There is a 40 s&w (tan) and a 9mm (yellow). What can I say about these gems, the 40 is actually an excellent piece once you look past its ugly appearance and those brick like ergonomics. It shoots extremely accurate and functions perfectly, aside from being bulky and nose heavy this one truthfully is a shooter, I don't have very many rounds through the 40 guessing less than 200. On to the 9mm, this one isnt as bulky since its considered a compact by hi points standards, this one isn't near as accurate and doesn't function near as well, it was terrible when I got it but with some polishing I've got most of the kinks worked out but it'll still give you a stove pipe for every box of ammo, this one I've put some ammo through, which is ironic considering its the least accurate and least reliable but I'm guessing there's around 1000 rounds through it. All and all they are cheap fun, both have been powder coated, neither has been sighted in since then, the 9mm has some chips.
I want $200 for the pair and that's firm, I'm including 4 boxes of 40 ammo that's worth $80 right there so basically at $60 each for the guns, and no I wont separate and sell one for 60, its all or nothing, I'm not including any 9mm ammo since I have 2 other 9mm's. Any questions just shoot me an email."

Buyer must have NC DL and purchase permit/CHP and sign a bill of sale.  Only selling because I've come to find large revolvers that have no lights on them for target ID open me up to liability if used defensively, so I'm reorienting toward more modern pistols that can bear a light."
