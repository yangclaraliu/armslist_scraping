Used AR Easy Jig - One of the horizontal screws got drilled a bit but is still perfectly usable.  Top screws are also a bit tight for some reason.  I had to cut one of the heads so it could be used with a flathead screwdriver.  The jig is perfectly usable as is or you can spend a few dollars for replacement screws from the manufacturer.  Price includes the bits needed to complete the project, which cost me over $40.  I'm selling because my router broke and I don't have the $ to replace it right now.  Also in the process of moving and need extra $ for that purpose.

Fits all pistols chambered for 9mm rounds. 
The caliber-specific Laser Trainer Cartridge that offers a revolutionary way to train almost anywhere. The Laser Trainer Cartridge is the most realistic training option in LaserLyte's popular line of Laser Trainers with the choice to practice tap, rack, bang or malfunction drills. Designed to match the popular caliber in 9mm, the new Laser Trainer Cartridge fits inside the pistol chamber and features a firing-pin activated switch that indicates bullet impact with a bright red laser dot. For the cost of one or two visits to a local range, shooting enthusiasts can enjoy a lifetime of free training with the Laser Trainer Cartridge at the location that works best for them. 
Each Laser Trainer Cartridge easily installs into the firing chamber in seconds, works regardless of barrel length and does not stick out of the barrel. The Laser Trainer Cartridge activates for 100 milliseconds each time the firing pin strikes the cartridge. This modified cartridge is rimless, so the Laser Trainer Cartridge is not expelled during dry fire, which allows for tap, rack, bang or malfunction training drills. A hardened rubber plunger on the laser also acts as a built-in snap cap to protect the firing pin and two rubber rings on the laser help ensure a proper fit in order to best replicate bullet impact for accurate training. The Laser Trainer Cartridge requires three 377 batteries, good for approximately 3,000 shots.

Fits all pistols chambered for 40mm rounds. 
The caliber-specific Laser Trainer Cartridge that offers a revolutionary way to train almost anywhere. The Laser Trainer Cartridge is the most realistic training option in LaserLyte's popular line of Laser Trainers with the choice to practice tap, rack, bang or malfunction drills. Designed to match the popular caliber in 40 S&W, the new Laser Trainer Cartridge fits inside the pistol chamber and features a firing-pin activated switch that indicates bullet impact with a bright red laser dot. For the cost of one or two visits to a local range, shooting enthusiasts can enjoy a lifetime of free training with the Laser Trainer Cartridge at the location that works best for them. 
Each Laser Trainer Cartridge easily installs into the firing chamber in seconds, works regardless of barrel length and does not stick out of the barrel. The Laser Trainer Cartridge activates for 100 milliseconds each time the firing pin strikes the cartridge. This modified cartridge is rimless, so the Laser Trainer Cartridge is not expelled during dry fire, which allows for tap, rack, bang or malfunction training drills. A hardened rubber plunger on the laser also acts as a built-in snap cap to protect the firing pin and two rubber rings on the laser help ensure a proper fit in order to best replicate bullet impact for accurate training. The Laser Trainer Cartridge requires three 377 batteries, good for approximately 3,000 shots.

These are import banned. This AK has been fully converted to the true AK form as designed by Kalashnikov who works at the same factory where these Izhmash Saiga's are made. 

Includes: Tapco G2 trigger conversion (moved forward with pistol grip where it should be behind the magazine). Conversion also now accepts all AK magazines. Trigger is great. Grip is a hogue. Sporter stock was replaced with a Tapco folding stock that has an added padded chin guard.

 Handguard is an Intrafusion Combat with all the rails for light, etc. Added is the foregrip with ejection bipod.

 Scope mount is one-piece detachable which detaches in seconds and firmly re-attaches holding the scope right where it was adjusted. Scope is a brand new UTG Accushot 1-4.5x30mm with 36 color option push-button adjustable display. It is zero'd in at 100 yards.

 7 magazines included: 30 rnd tapco, 4 30rnd steel and a 10 round plastic.

 Barrel and receiver are Russian mil-spec. Barrel is 16.3"" hammer forged, chrome-lined with 1:9 twist.

 Gun isn't even broken in yet with low round count as the internals and barrel are perfect and show so with a bore light. Ammo is cheap for these as it can be bought for $6 per 20 everywhere and buy it in bulk for way less. I can round up ammo for a buyer if wanted.

 Everything in the pictures included and I stil have the original stock and handguard.

 I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Any questions or for more pics/details, just ask.

$1050 gets it all and no headaches over finding ammo or dealing with the 556/223 goughers that are coming out of the woodwork.

The continuous top rail allows you to mount optics anywhere along the top of the rifle and allows same-plane iron sights to be mounted. The top rail has also been relieved to accept most aftermarket piston conversion systems. Each Evo handguard includes two 2"", and one 4"" customizable rail sections that can be mounted anywhere along the handguard tube.

The LEM As a Street Trigger
by Darryl “nyeti” Bolke 
“It is a consistent trigger. It has all of the take up of the DA, without the weight and effort. The trigger goes back to the same long take up location when the finger comes off the trigger. Essentially, it is like de-cocking without having to use a de-cocker, just a simple removal of the finger from the trigger to its register location. Lots of take up and both tactile feel that the trigger finger is on the trigger, and a visual input from the hammer.”


Read the whole thing.  Bolke makes the case, and I agree, that the LEM is as simple to use as a Glock or SW M&P or Walther PPQ or HK VP9, since there is no safety or de-cocker, but much safer (“safe-er” not “safe”, nothing is 100% safe) than the striker-fired pistols.  This is a benefit for both new and experienced shooters.


I bought this P2000 about a year ago on a whim, looking for a hammer-fired gun to replace my Glocks.  With a hammer, 1) I can put my thumb over the hammer when re-holstering, to prevent the gun from accidentally firing if the trigger gets caught on something, and 2) the hammer provides a visual cue as to the state of the gun.   I like my friend’s HK P30, but I’m one of those people who’s trigger finger is painfully irritated by the groove in the trigger guard, so I went with the P2000 instead.  I recently acquired a CZ P-07 in a trade, and the CZ just fits _my_ hand (which is pretty big) so well, that I’ve decided to carry the CZ and sell this.  I just don’t have the time to shoot both guns.

I can meet you at an FFL dealer of your choice to conduct the transfer in accordance with stupid state laws.  Buyer is responsible for CBI and FFL transfer fees.

PS -- This is the ""full size"" P2000, which is about the size of a Glock 19; not to be confused with the sub-compact P2000SK.

I bought it a few years back, but really haven't used it much (ended up having the driveway plowed). Every fall it's made ready for winter, and then 'pickled' for the summer. The last two years it hasn't been used, though (started/gas drained/stored). Seems it's time to make room, and find someone who would rather save their back then shovel. It's a good size for a small driveway or side walks. It has 6 forward speeds, and two reverse. I don't know if the electric starter works (always starts on 1-2 pulls), but it's on there.

I might be interested in trades (can add $$ if something I want), but please no projects/junk... I have plenty of that ;-) .
