X300U
The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight for handguns and long guns features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light—more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

Activating the X300 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and a pressure activated XT07 tape switch (for long guns) permit the X300 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon.

The X300 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. 

Available in Black (and Desert Tan in October 2014).

FITS: Handguns and long guns with Picatinny or Universal rails. Adapter mounts available for several non-railed handguns

Virtually indestructible LED regulated to maximize output and runtime

The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun. Click here to view them. [NSN: 6230-01-579-1382]

This is a Beautiful Colt 1911, series 80 with a 5"" barrel and blued finish. The series 80s come with better sights and the same firing pin block mechanism as Glocks, Sigs, HKs, etc. This is not one of the cheap models stamped ""1991""across the slide; This is Colt Mfkg. at its finest. The gun is in perfect, LNIB condition with only 50rds fired! 

The power of 230g hardball is ridiculous and as much as I love this gun, I just shoot my 9s a lot more. 

It comes with a box, original paperwork, and 6 magazines. A couple of the mags are 8rd Chip Mccormicks.

Cash price is firm at $825. This handgun is cross posted on several other groups and sites. Please have your NC DL and CCP/PPP. I will need to see these, no excuses. I don't care how far you drove or if you ""accidentally forgot them.""

Electronic lock includes a drill resistant, hardened steel plate behind the lock for greater security. A backup key is included. Batteries are accessible from the front of the safe and are easy to replace. 2-Way locking with 3 - 1"" steel live action locking bolts and 2 dead bolts for 5 locking points. Safe holds 14 firearms up to 52"" tall, or 7 firearms and storage, or all storage. 4 Adjustable shelves and fully carpeted interior.

I have included pictures, however the model number is FS-14-MB-E in case you need any additional info from the stack-on website. Please no trades as I need cash for doctor bills, not tools or guns. 

Full disclosure: shelves are held in with pegs on an inner track on the walls. 1 Screw is missing from track on inner right side of safe. Track and shelves are still completely usable, even when mounted in that spot. One could install a slightly large diameter screw to make it tight. You can see which peg I am talking about in photo 2, it is the front bottom one, but as you can see was still being used which is proof it is usable. Lip of ""peg"" is just slightly wiggly when mounted in that spot, which is why I am asking $450 instead of full market value which is between $600-700. One thing I have noticed is that you have to wait a second after keying in code to open, not a big deal. I would imagine it is still much faster than a combination lock. I am just adding these things for honesty's sake so there are no surprises. I am in no hurry to sell this, I just have no use for it. Photos were taken of safe in my father's house."

Made from 1946 to the end of classic-model production in 1983, model Bs with Super upgrades were produced. The major change is the replacement of the swinging link with a Sig 210 (or modern Star) style closed cam path integral to the barrel. Related to this, a full-length guide rod with captive spring, and a quick takedown lever were added as well. All of these models have a magazine safety, but one slightly different from the later S variants, and the extractor is modified to double as a loaded-chamber indicator. Additionally, the sights are improved in shape to make them easier to see, and minor changes were made to the trigger system.

This rifle has never been fired, which has been really tough for me, considering it’s the most bad ass sniper rifle I have ever put together. You need balls the size of church bells to carry this gun to the field. This rifle may not be for everyone, side effects may include higher testosterone levels, more chest hair, grilling raw meat on a wood fire, patriotism, lots of woman trying to crawl into your bedroom window, being promoted at work, freedom, pouring whiskey on your cereal, and witty James Bond one liners. You will, for the first time, begin to understand the Constitution of the United States and feel the hand of the founding fathers rest on your battle scarred shoulder in approval as the recoil from a .308 caliber hunk of lead greatness beats the wimp out of you, and blows through the engine block of that sissy Prius being driven by Michael Moore and his ISIS friends armed with their pathetic stamped steel abortion of a firearm. If you want precision, firepower, and pure testosterone wrapped a glorious blanket of aluminum perfection then look no further. If you would rather show up at the range sporting your pretty pink .380 that your wife taught you to shoot then just keep scrolling buddy because this masterpiece of modern engineering is too much for your tiny liberal brain to comprehend. You might as well go join your other vegan hippy friends at the democratic national convention. This rifle understands you, and as you take command of the custom aluminum forged Remington 700 bolt knob, you become more and more aligned as one with the patriots of old, the Marines of Tunn tavern, and Chesty Puller himself smiles down on you from heaven’s gates of pearl and concertina wire. You will piss napalm. You won't need to take protein shakes anymore because your muscles are already exploding from your new all-bacon diet cooked from the 800 lb wild boar that you just killed with your bare hands. The Magpul PRS stock is a sturdy adjustable polymer construction and the rubber Hogue grip on this black beauty ensures you get a firm grasp with your blood soaked fingers. Is it made of light weight recycled plastic? No, it’s heavy barrel, because you need to weed out the weak pansies on your hunting trips that whine about the “cold” weather or complain about the “land mines”. This marvel of American innovation eats terrorists for breakfast. If you'd rather a foreign made firearm then call me, and I will send you a bottle of pepper spray instead that you can carry inside your flower print panties. And forget conceal carrying. This gun was not meant to be pampered or concealed but rather to expose those lesser men at the range that have already succumbed to allowing their wives to make the purchasing decisions in their house. How sad. But you won't be one of those ""men"". You'll be the reincarnated Carlos Hathcock, back from the dead, honing his skills on wild bison of the Great Plains and amber waves of grain. Are you really going to let your wife stand in the way of your 2nd amendment rights that so many men died defending in World War II? Of course not. You and I understand that the smell of gunpowder in the morning gives you more of a kick than her mocha latte frappachino ever could. Buried deep with the primal instincts of every man's gut, lives a fire than cannot be quenched with a thousand video games and as you unleash your inner Rambo and bond your itchy trigger finger with her gorgeous display of USA craftsmanship forged from the Hammer of Thor himself, your man points increase 10 fold. The Harris engineering bipod will hold your death machine securely on atop your red white and blue zodiac vessel during nighttime amphibious assaults. The scope is not included because, well, you wouldn't want me telling your mistress what dress to wear now would you? However, if a 6-24x50 illuminated Rangefinder reticule satisfies your lust to reach out and touch that target at 1000 yards well then message me and I'm sure I can accommodate you. If you feel like you’re are interested in it, but aren't a serious buyer because you want to ""sleep on it"", then do me a favor and wait until your balls drop before you send me your pre-pubescent pleas to lower the price. The price is as firm as my... well its really firm, let’s just say that. You won't pay any extra taxes or fees on this rifle because I am not a communist. Shipping is free for my fellow marines. If you don't think that's fair then go write your liberal senator. If you require shipping then I will insure that this metal merchant of destruction is mailed to an FFL near to your house. If you do not have a gun store near your house, then you are likely a socialist PETA member from California and I cannot help you. I reside in Kennesaw, GA where the law requires that every male head of the household own a firearm. *bald eagle screeches in background*. Oorah. Yut. Echo 5 Romeo over and out.

""The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."""

I am selling to offset its cost . This is a fantastic scope but too high end for me. Its set up for .300 Wm but it can be set for others just call them. the one shot zero really works and saves on ammo why spend a $1 a round trying to find zero which can take a half a box or more when you can zero it and use the rest of the ammo target practicing the glass in on par with my Elite 4200 its only been hunted with 2x and has about 60 rds on it comes with some unique rings i thought they were 30mm with inserts but actually the inserts are rounded to fit specifically to the ring like in a pocket for a sure grip and cushion on the scope .

Go their website for more info but the sighting is the easiest thing ever just shoot from a steady rest move the main cross hairs to the point of where it hit on the target while leaving the secondary (small knobs ) at the original point of aim then move the secondary to the primary so simple but make sure to read the directions first to not get it backwards.

I can see how this would be a fantastic scope for longer range hunting . this comes with the rings and all the paper work that came with it and its original box it is 5 years old and they currently are listed at $799 its a very solid scope Made in the USA $600 +$15 shipping Will consider trades for .300wm browning BAR or Left handed .300wm

this is in excellent condition not even a ring mark

It's easier on the hands than checkering, Not to mention it just looks cool! Except for the snakeskin metal treatment, this pistol is identical to the Executive Elite in all respects. This no-nonsense design has an elegant simplicity that has yet to be matched. The Kobra is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different.

Got it new in December 2013, I thought I'd love it, but I was wrong. It has sat in my my closet and been worn about 3 times in a year. These things are hard too get a hold of , especially in large.

(http://store.tripleaughtdesign.com/Shag-Master-Hoodie)
Inspired by the earliest generations of synthetic pile jackets that revolutionized the mountaineering industry, our Shag Master is a unique insulation piece that continues to elude the masses. With its distinctive shaggy appearance and appropriately mischievous name, our jacket redefines your definition of creature comfort. It'll be your go-to jacket when decompressing after a long day above eleven thousand feet, exploring the dark woods or belaying your climbing partner. Give in to the fuzziness and unleash your beast.

Features:
Winter Warrior: Designed as an insulation jacket, the Shag Master is made from Polartec® Thermal Pro® High Loft. This super soft fabric minimizes heat loss when you’re at a stand-still or lets air pass through to keep you cool when you’re in action. The optimal warmth-to-weight ratio provides unrivaled compressibility for those times you have big plans but little space. Integrated thumb holes provide partial hand coverage, while reinforced elbows strengthen the Shag's ability to withstand the elements.
Creature Comfort: Tailored to layer comfortably under our Stealth Hoodie LT, our Shag Master features an active fit to reduce the naturally high lofted material, but the cut ensures there is enough room to move. The natural softness of the Shag is enhanced by top stitches along all seems to keep them flattened and not a nuisance when layering up. Updated media port pass-throughs utilize breaks in the material, instead of plastic guides, to reduce bulk and weight while still navigation headphones to your ear.
Clean Fit & Finish: As always, we continually spent time improving the construction of all finishing elements, including the inclusive of our traditional grosgrain ribbon zipper pulls and a full brush mesh panel sewn in from seam to seam behind the front pockets. The result is a clean and comfortable interior finish. We also upgraded the Shag with our new three-piece hood. The shape encompasses your head to keep you protected from the elements with a full visual range and a reinforced, durable nylon brim to shed water away from your face. The nylon chin flap lays comfortably underneath your neck with a clean aesthetic that won’t snag during zipper movement."

Includes rail mount for bipod, scope, and detachable sites. These can be quickly attached and detached by a simple hand bolt.

See here for demo on full auto mode. This is not my link but representative to what it does in full auto mode. Made by Lakeside Machine which still supports parts for this but no longer making firearms. Last run on these sold for what I am selling this for.

 I called S&W for the date of manufacture so 1966 is the actual date. This M49 Bodyguard was presented to me as unfired via the original owner and after extremely careful examination, I cannot dispute it. The weapon has not a single mark in it or on it that would indicate holstering, cleaning or firing. The cylinder has been rotated and has a slight mark from rotation common to all revolvers. It is otherwise absolutely flawless inside and out in my opinion. Comes with what you see in the pics, including the original box (sans paperwork), the period cleaning kit, extra wood grips and bullet pouch.

 Terms: Cash option for this rare J-frame package is $600. This gun's too pretty for me to carry and should be with a collector.
