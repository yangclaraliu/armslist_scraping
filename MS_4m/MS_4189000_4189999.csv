vz.58 Pistol 556


OUT OF STOCK

$1,065.00 / 1 pc.

The vz.58 Pistol 556 is manufactured by Czech Small Arms (formerly known as D-Technik) in Jablunka, Czech Republic and includes the following:  two 30 round clear polycarbonate magazines, CD which contains manual and historical information, cleaning kit, and sling. As found with the Czech Small Arms (CSA) line of vz.58 rifles, all vz.58 pistols possess the patented 'push-down' plate on the bolt carrier. The patented ‘push-down’ plate ensures the user will not experience possible misfire problems that can be found with other manufacturer vz.58 type firearms.

Important Notes:  The bayonet lug is not attached to front sight.  Reason:  it is not possible to fix a bayonet to the vz.58 pistol as the proximity of the bayonet lug to the gas adapter/block does not permit attachment.  In addition, CzechPoint is unable to fill requests for the type of front sling swivel, front sight base, and/or trigger guard (rear sling swivel is the same for all vz.58 pistols - as shown in the photo).

The vz.58 Pistol 556 possesses all Czech manufactured original parts (USA made parts to comply with section 922(r) is not a requirement on pistols).  The color of the finish is a matte black coating (cured at 300°F).   The new production pistol barrels are manufactured by Lothar Walther and made from a high alloy Chrome Molybdenum steel (4340) and is chrome-lined.  The bore and chamber are 5.56 NATO spec. The muzzle nut has been threaded onto the barrel threads and has been spot welded at the 6 o'clock position.   The threaded muzzle is 14x1 right hand (standard vz.58 thread pattern). 

The rear sling swivel screw has been spot welded from inside the receiver (weld on sling swivel screw can be removed with rotary tool).   For those that receive an approved BATFE Form 1 SBR (short barreled rifle) for their vz.58, the sling swivel screw can be removed (receiver sling plate is held to the receiver by sling swivel screw).  Once the sling swivel screw and receiver sling plate is removed, any vz.58 stock can be readily attached to the vz.58 receiver.  This is a great 'do-it-yourself' Form 1 SBR.   SBR Warning: a stock can only be legally attached to this pistol after a Form 1 has been approved by BATFE.   Attaching a stock to the vz.58 pistol, without an approved Form 1, is a federal felony and conviction could result in 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

Drilled and tapped holes for the receiver side rail ARE included in the purchase price of the pistol. In other words, you can easily install our optional side rail by removing the two screws in the receiver and screw on the side rail with a hex/Allen wrench. GUNSMITHING IS NOT REQUIRED TO ATTACH THE SIDE RAIL TO OUR VZ.58 PISTOL. Do not forget to use high strength thread-locker on the screws while attaching the side rail. To purchase the side rail, please see the vz.58 spare parts section (part no: VZ58-59R) or type VZ58-59R into the 'search' window and click on 'receiver side rail.'

The magwell adapter, to use USGI M16/AR-15 magazines, is sold separately as an accessory and is not included with the purchase price of the pistol.  For information and purchase of the magwell adapter, please visit the vz.58 spare parts section (part number VZ58-6G) or type VZ58-6G  in the 'search' window.

Sig Sauer 1911 C3. Originally a Crimson Trace model. I have since sold the grips and have a set of VZ grips installed. There have been roughly 300 rounds fired through the gun and they have been flawless. It has always been properly lubed and stored clean. There is a light crescent shape mark on the slide. I'm not sure how the heck that happened as I've always been careful during cleaning. Overall it's very clean however it's been fired and lightly carried. Do not expect showroom quality but it's great shape besides the idiot mark. It does have the factory Sig night sights. The gun is dated Jul 2012. Internal parts have not been modified.

The PCR name stands for ‘Police Czech Republic,’ the group for whom the model was originally designed. Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator. Feel free to call or text. Kyle REDACTED"

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

These are also known as ""Side Star"" SKS's due to the Tula star being on the side.

When I bought it it had a craptastic Tapco stock on it, and a tall as heck scope mount receiver cover. I took all that off(NO LONGER HAVE THE STUFF) and fit it into a Norinco Stock, with the standard Receiver Cover, it's why it has the Spike Bayonet, it is a Russian SKS! I just refinished the Stock and Hand guard as well. Has a cleaning kit in the trapdoor in the buttstock, only thing it's missing is the Cleaning Rod, would make a nice addition to a collection or a nice shooter, it does function FLAWLESSLY, and doesn't slam fire! No ammo is included at this price, and look up the Russian SKS's before you start commenting on my price, they are going for more than $550 everywhere else, these are the best quality SKS that was produced, the milling was fantastic, and it's all milled parts, NO STAMPED!

Only trade I'm looking for is a Taurus PT92 or PT917, and will include ammo if I receive ammo, will match round for round, I have 280 rounds of which 100 is ready to go on 10 round stripper clips.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

The P220 SAS comes with the new SIG SAUER® Custom Shop Grips and is covered by a Limited Lifetime Warranty

Playstation 3 bundle. I had a 40gb fat ps3 in storage that had a bad blu ray drive. I decided to send this system in and get it repaired, instead of Sony repairing it they sent me a new factory certified console. It is still wrapped in the plastic. I unboxed this console, installed a 250gb hard drive upgrade, updated the system, and repackaged it. Comes with a Dualshock 3 sixaxis controller, dual controller charging stand, Bluetooth headset, Phillips HDMI cable, power cable, a/v cable, and 14 games. All of these items are in mint condition. Most of the games look like new, some of them do have minor scratches or fingerprint smudges but all are fully functional. All of the game cases are in great condition except for the GOD OF WAR COLLECTION, the case is busted up pretty bad but the game disc is in great condition.

Hey all, 
	I have available for trade/sale a cool old pistol. This is a Hopkins and Allen 32 S&W short top break pistol. This also is the model with the more rare ""folding hammer"" for ""pocket carry"". This also comes with a newer leather holster for it that fits pretty well. I just shot this at the range the other day and it shot pretty well for being so old. The cosmetic condition leaves much to be desired, but the wear gives it more character. Haha. 
	I would also consider trades for other guns or possibly certain ammo, just shoot me an offer. Worst I can say is no! This is for pickup in Norman.

This is a new (never fired) Colt M4A1 SOCOM upper.  This is THE exact same upper, produced to the exact same specifications that our troops are using as current issue.  It has the heavier SOCOM profile barrel underneath the handguards to hold up to sustained use of full auto fire as compared to the old M4 barrel profile which was light weight under the handguards.  The only difference between this upper and the ones the troops have, is that the barrel on this one is 1.5"" longer to meet the legal 16"" civilan length requirements (which I consider a plus anyway as you gain 100 fps on M855 and M193 with that 1.5"" extra barrel!).

This optic can sit on any type of rail with an adapter but this one is specific to the Ruger Mark 2 or 3. The adapter included is for the dovetail on the Ruger Mark 2 or 3. I purchased the sight and had to purchase the mount separately. You can get a different adapter if you want but I don’t have one and will not sell it without the Ruger mount included. There is no gunsmithing involved and anyone with a hex key can do this. This thing is in new, mint condition. I put it on the pistol and shot it. I could easily put this thing as NIB and no one could tell the difference but it has been used. It has sat on the pistol, with the protective cover on and is pristine.

One cool option this has is auto brightness. If you are in low light the dot will automatically lower in intensity and the reverse in bright light. I have not shot anywhere where I could not perfectly see the dot or have to worry about the brightness settings like other red dots. I am only selling the sight and not the pistol but took pictures of it mounted so you could get an idea of what it looks like.

The price is fair (check what they are selling for without the Ruger Mount) but if you do not believe me check it out online.

If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking."

This is like new---just barely broken in. It is pictured with a security six 2.75"" with target grips. I also tried it with a 4"" and 6"" and both fit because they just stick out the back/end of the holster. Probably not real practicle, but wanted to let you know it will take a longer barrel. I imagine this will also take S&W K frames as well as service and speed sixes. The size says X-large but it fits my son (5'10"" 200lbs) and me (5'10"" 225) just fine. This is actually one of the more comfortable shoulder rigs I have tried, but guess I am just not a shoulder holster guy. The dump pouches are still pretty stiff, but will each take 6 rounds of 357. I have several more photos showing the other side and the back. I am happy to send to your e-mail if you PM your address. The best price I could find on these is $124+ shipping.

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.
Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.
Key Features:

Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
