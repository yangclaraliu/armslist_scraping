The wood on both is fantastic. I have about 3 too many shotguns, so these are the 2 I am choosing to part with. I believe both are 26"" barrels, but I will check and make sure. I'm looking to trade for handguns, mostly S&W revolvers in 357 or larger calibers, but will consider all reasonable handgun offers. Or I will just sell out right. I would like to move the 2 as a pair, but will consider breakin them up on a case by case basis. This is a perfect combo for a husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. All low ball offers will be ignored. I feel $950.00 cash for the 2 or $1100.00 trade value for the 2 1100's is a very fair price and I am pretty firm. I will include 2 soft cases as well.

I have a used Colt pre-ban upper, Alcoa Forge with a 20"" chrome lined 1/7 twist HBAR. Upper only, no BCG or charging handle. Do some research before blasting me about the price (which is negotiable).

 2. It's touted as being highly accurate. 
 3. I'm not overly concerned about selling it, but if I am going to sell it, this is what it's worth to me.

I'll entertain certain partial (with the difference coming my way) trades along the lines of 1911s and clones (no rails), Taurus 92, 96, 99, 100 and 101s (no rails) and possibly the Beretta 96FS (again, no rails). A Ruger New Model Blackhawk in 45LC (New Model only, no Vaqueros) might tempt me as well. Other than that, let me know what you have, I'll consider it.

The Taurus was recently repaired at their factory and had a new spring installed along with a complete breakdown and inspection. There's two magazines (6 rounds each) and two lock keys for the gun. A great conceal and carry gun as you can put it in the pocket of your favorite jeans and nobody can tell you have it   You will also receive 12 hollow point rounds along with all new boxes of Remington ammunition that I have. Local sales will be handled by my FFL dealer. For out of state sales state and city laws will be honored and the buyer is responsible for the FFL dealer to contact me for shipping instructions. Buyer will pay for all additional fees incurred to have it shipped. Local sales in cash and out of state must obtain a Postal Money Order. Once I received the money order and it cleared i will ship the gun.  Laws permitting ammunition will be shipped to your address. 
Thanks for viewing and if you have any questions drop me a note anytime day or night and I'll get back to you ASAP.

I'm selling a rare P-series Finnish Mosin. This is an older CAI import. The history behind these rifles were either captured or bought from the Russians and other Eastern European countries in the early 1920s. The bores on these were considered worn out and a sleeve was placed in the barrel. While the barrels were manufactured on those dates, they were known to be placed on rifles until supply was exhausted during WWII and the Continuation War.

This was an early attempt to rework these rifles before they began to manufacture new barrels. Known variants are the P-26, P-27, and P-28 with a production of approx. 10,000 rifles. These rifles are known to be as accurate as their descendants and great rugged rifles. Range test tended to prove it!

Condition is fair with light to  moderate pitting on the receiver. Bore appears to be frosted but with good lands/grooves. The receiver dates to 1919, so possibly a purchased rifle in the '20s or captured in the Winter War/Continuation War. Stock is a one piece. Unfortunately the stock was stripped of it's finish but the cartouches were untouched. Shot 1-2 inch groups at 100 yards (offhand). Please email or give me a call at REDACTED for any further questions! Lev

The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.Vepr Pioneer in.223 Rem caliber boasts a front sight / gas block combination and a single piece of walnut as the furniture. The buttstock is built in the “Monte-Carlo” style. The tip of the RPK style barrel is vented to create functionality as if there was a muzzle break attached. A unique feature of this firearm is the removable trigger housing. Also, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover.

Everything is gently used. Never had to even buy bbs because I used so few. I haven't a clue where the magazine for the M870 is though, truly sorry about that. I bought everything listed here for around $550.00. See something you don't want? Let me know and we can re-talk the price.  If you want I may be able to find my receipt and show it to you (I think they emailed it). If you have questions let me know.
