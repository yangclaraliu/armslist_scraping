The SKS carbine was rather quickly phased out of first-line service, replaced by the AK-47, but remained in second-line service for decades afterwards. It is today popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries. The SKS was the first weapon chambered for the 7.62x39mm.

All military SKSs have a bayonet attached to the underside of the barrel, which is extended and retracted via a spring-loaded hinge. The SKS is easily field stripped and reassembled with no tools. The rifle has a trapdoor in the butt-stock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel. The SKS trades accuracy for ruggedness, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost. The SKS is a simple design that is highly effective and rugged.

This 1952 SKS TULA rifle is in exceptional condition. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best, I would have to rate is as an 8.85-9. Since I purchased this rifle many years ago, I have fired it a total of 10-20 times. All of the numbers on this rifle match, matching numbered parts.

Differences from the ""baseline"" late Russian Tula Armory/Izhevsk Armory SKS:
Variations (1949–1956): Early Spike-style bayonet (1949) instead of blade-style. Spring-return firing pin was present on early models, and they did not have chrome bores (1949 – early 1951). The gas block had three changes: The first production stage gas block, used from 1949 through early 1950, was squared-off at a 90-degree angle. The second gas block production stage was instead cut at a 45-degree angle, seen on late 1950 to 1951 rifles. The third and final gas block stage, from 1952 through to 1956, was curved inward slightly toward the action.

Remingtons Description!!

OVERVIEW:

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.


KEY FEATURES:

Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
Non-glare matte finish
Adjustable big game iron sights
Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable, 10-shot metal box magazine
Last-shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety
Unique attachment system rigidly joins barrel to receiver for perfect alignment and enhanced accuracy"

VMAC9-101 Nickle Plated 9mm pistol.  The VMAC is a descendant of the famous Military Armament Corporation machine pistol manufactured in the early 1980’s. Like the MAC 10 they are made of a formed sheet metal lower receiver containing the trigger mechanism and square tube upper receiver, housing the barrel and bolt assembly. The barrel has a thread size of ¾ x 10 for any accessories you may want. The magazine well is incorporated in the pistol grip. It uses the blow-back unlocked bolt design. All internal parts have a manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. governments recommended protective finish for steel.  The frame has an Electroless Nickel finish which is an autocatalytic chemical reduction process that deposits a nickel-phosphorus alloy in a uniformly hard, highly protective finish. By increasing surface hardness, electroless nickel improves resistance to friction, wear and corrosion. This process prolongs the service life of parts by 2 to 10 times."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Issued in 1964. Gun is flawless and I doubt the cylinder has ever made a full turn. The display box is in very good condition, the worst scratch is visible in the pic. The bottom of the box is in great shape as well. Also included in the sale is the original cardboard shipping box, including anti rust paper, sales invoice (dated 19 Nov, 1963), blank warranty card, and information pamphlet. The only detraction from the whole package is there is a blue line on the underside of the display box lid - appears to be from a pen. I have not and will not attempt to clean it - with my luck it would cause more problems. All serial numbers match, including box and paperwork. Last digit of serial has been blurred for privacy, but I assure you it all matches. Also - Bluing is impeccable - any discoloration is from my inability to wipe a Colt polished finish and not get a smeared look. it's me, not the gun. Please see photos for a visual description, and if you need the pics in a larger format, or additional pics, let me know. Purchaser must provide valid Va driver's license and some form of non-felonship (I know - I made that word up) such as voter registration card, CCW, etc."

Savage FCP-K in .308 It has a 24"" fluted barrel with factory installed muzzle break. Savage Accu trigger, and Accu Stock. The stock isn't the cheap plastic synthetic stock on a lot of the rifles Savage sells this one has an aluminum bedding block installed inside. This negates the need for any glass bedding as the block supports the rifle fully and provides a solid base. Will also include a Blackhawk steel scope mount. Has a 4 round box magazine and an over size bolt handle. This rifle can shoot 3/4"" groups at 100 yards with good ammo and even better with high grade match ammo. Asking $750 for the rifle alone. I can add a Bushnell 3200 10X fixed power scope for another $175. These scopes are excellent units, so good in fact that Barrett supplies them with their .50 caliber rifles they sell. They're that tough they can survive the force of the .50 rifles and the clarity on them is fantastic! This setup would make a perfect rifle to learn how to shoot long range targets out to 1000 yards!"

FNX9 with Ameriglo nite sites.  This sale includes 3 OEM magazines (17 rounders), the original factory hard case, 4 backstraps, a safety padlock, literature, and the original fired shell case.  

It's now successfully fired just under 200 rounds; everything I've put into the three magazines - both HP and FMJ - have been rock solid reliable.  There is no need for any further expensive time consuming breaking in, just go ahead and load test it with your prefered carry ammo; this beauty of a handgun is really that ready for defensive carry use.  

While many shooters prefer guns based on SA/DA - with a dedicated decocker/safety, it just doesn't concern me. I do better shooting my butt ugly plain jane, striker fired Glock 19.  So this quality/comfortable handgun (which I love fondling) is up for sale; someone who wants/needs the extra safety margins this style provides will be very pleased.

VMAC9-101 Nickle Plated 9mm pistol. The VMAC is a descendant of the famous Military Armament Corporation machine pistol manufactured in the early 1980’s. Like the MAC 10 they are made of a formed sheet metal lower receiver containing the trigger mechanism and square tube upper receiver, housing the barrel and bolt assembly. The barrel has a thread size of ¾ x 10 for any accessories you may want. The magazine well is incorporated in the pistol grip. It uses the blow-back unlocked bolt design. All internal parts have a manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. governments recommended protective finish for steel. The frame has an Electroless Nickel finish which is an autocatalytic chemical reduction process that deposits a nickel-phosphorus alloy in a uniformly hard, highly protective finish. By increasing surface hardness, electroless nickel improves resistance to friction, wear and corrosion. This process prolongs the service life of parts by 2 to 10 times."

Everything that you get 
1.) M44 Mosin-Nagant- around $200 these days. Ivan would be disappointed
2.) Brown ATI stock- around $70 on Amazon, with 4 and a half stars at 550 reviews, it's lighter than stock, a similar shade of brown, and it has a butt pad for recoil. I had to do some ghetto rigging in order to help the interruptor lips but now it's fine. It works fine but it isn't pretty. Not visible from the outside.
3.) UTG Tri-Rail- around $30 on Amazon with 4 stars and 264 reviews, mounted on a welded scope mount to mount the scope and to hold zero better and longer.
4.) Aim Sports 2-7x42 30mm Scout Scope- around $70 on Amazon with 4 and a half stars. Variable color and eye relief for Scouting scouts doing scout things.
5.) 20 Stripper Clips-$10 on Amazon  that hold 5 rounds each for all your Stalingrad needs. 
6.) 540 rounds. -$100 1 unopened delicious spam cam of 440 rounds of corrosive Ammo from the (former) red world. 100 loose rounds of corrosive.
7.) Mossy Oak Buttstock Cartridge holder- around $7 for all your rapid reload needs in the forests of the PNW, the deer won't know what hit em
8.) Wal-Mart padded sling, camo, holds 4 rounds for rapid reloads when you're playing with your gun in the bathroom. 

$500 takes it all, all of the glorious Amazon Accessories and durable mosin attributes that you think would be nice. It's an old surplus rifle, brought up to modern standard through the power of impulse Amazon purchases and loads of custom gun smithing work that I haven't accounted for in the price. 
Of course this would be useless on a shot out barrel, which this does not have. This rifle is very accurate once it's zeroed in(it isn't, that's part of the fun in a new/old rifle) and the rifling is easily seen.  CLOSE TO 1 MOA

The tip of the barrel has a great brake that helps out a lot with recoil. 
This is a wonderful rifle that will reward you time after time with shot after shot at pumpkins, deer, paper and more. I've spent a good portion of my time with this beauty and it's time that I let her go into a new home.

P.S. She does not like Ragu Pasta sauce.

 Upper description from PSA
           Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"".  This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability.  The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition.   Advances in AR technology  have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks.  This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation.   We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version.  Our Premium Mid-length mock dissipator uses a  Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel that is chrome-lined for durability.

Barrel:  16"" mil-spec steel barrel, chrome lined and chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system with a low-profile gas block.   Medium profile barrel is proof tested, magnetic particle inspected, phosphate coated, and  finished off with a pinned F-marked front sight post in the Rifle position with sling swivel, rifle length handguards, and A2 flash hider.  Barrel is made for us by FN Manufacturing here in Columbia SC.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.


 Bolt carrier group description from PSA
  Made in USA.  Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, High pressure tested and Mag Particle Inspected.
