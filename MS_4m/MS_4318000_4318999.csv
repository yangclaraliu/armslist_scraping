Had less than 100 rounds down the barrel. Mostly carried in my pocket over a year- it is very slim. Still shoots like just bought yesterday. 

Originally only came with 1 mag. I added one more OEM mag ($39 - could not get it any cheaper) and both mags now have additional grip extensions. 

Buyer must have active CPL - Buyer can select your own FFL in Auburn because you pay for transfer. If you don't have one, I can hook you up with mine; I have one in Covington and one in Auburn. They both charge $20 min for private transfer. 

I live in Auburn and I will not drive outside of Auburn/Federal Way/Covington areas.

The MAS Mle 1936 and its variants served as the standard French rifle from 1936 until 1956, and was withdrawn from service, except for those designed for sniping, in the 1970s. The MAS Mle 1936 was the last bolt-action rife adopted as a standard infantry arm of any world power, and it was arguably the easiest to maintain weapon of its type. Like the British Enfield it was a good enough design to survive into the beginning of the automatic rifle era and was popular with its users both as a rifle, and as a platform for launching grenades.

I'll apologize upfront for the lengthy description, but trust me its worth the read if you like these old guns. This single shot is about as good as it gets, not only in terms of it's condition, but also its caliber and configuration. To start, it is chambered in one of the most desirable large calibers Winchester manufactured, and has a 30"" number '2' octagon barrel, which is uncommon as the 45-90 was standard with a number '3' barrel. It also has a Model 1885 type single set trigger, which functions perfectly. And to top it off, it has a smooth steel shotgun style buttplate. Based on these specs, the original owner most likely did not order this rifle for target shooting...it was likely bought to hunt big game. It came from an estate in California in the last few years, and the owner had acquired it decades ago from the original west coast owner."

Gold trigger and gold blank plate on front of grip for presentation engraving are both from the factory. (Very rare!)

As the importation of these desirable pistols was discontinued back in 2004, they have become very collectible and much sought-after. THIS one is from 1991, according to the date code. It is pre-lawyer production and as such, does not have a billboard of warnings on the slide. Very Nice!

With the tip-up barrel feature, the chamber can be loaded directly, negating the necessity for manually cycling the slide. Great if you have arthritis or limited hand strength, for whatever reason.

This one is in great condition. There are a few handling marks, but please look at the photos for yourself. The 86 Cheetah features both single and double-action, with ambidextrous safety/decocker and beautifully checkered walnut grips.

Comes as shown with cardboard sleeve with correct end label, Beretta factory blue plastic box, 2 manuals plus a blank warranty card, 2 cleaning brushes, and 3 factory 8-round magazines. A few spare spring pins are supplied with the pistol, together with a drift, and a pin assembly tool (These are VERY hard to find items!) Cardboard sleeve is worn from 24 years of shelf wear. Paperwork smells a little bit like moth balls too! This beauty would be a great addition to your collection."

Backstory – I have an existing Ruger Scout rifle and had been looking for a composite stock for it.  Ruger now makes a composite stock version (although may or may not ever sell the stock separately).  My original intent was to sell my existing rifle and then buy a new composite stock version.  As things would have it, I came across this rifle (a composite stock version) in a local store and went ahead and purchased it, still with the intent to sell my existing one.  Once I got home, I occurred to me that most people would rather have a new rifle that they can break-in themselves vs a used one.  So this is the new rifle (action & barrel) with the laminate stock from my existing action and barrel.  The stock is in perfect, as new condition.  The advantage to me is I keep the action and barrel that I have just gotten broken in, the advantage to you is that you get a brand new, unfired rifle at a significant discount (the discount amounts to the cost of a new stock to me)."

850,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4318850,Want To Buy:  Sale of converted post ban guns,"Bethany/NW OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, May 9, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To the seller admitting he modified a post ban gun,the fact that you advertize that you removed the thumb hole stock is public admission to a felony. It is a felony to convert a post ban gun to a configuration that caused it to be banned. You need to remove that gun from this forum before you get it shut down. Whether you can be urged to stop illegally modifying guns is up to you. Stop putting the potential ignorant buyer, and all of us at risk.
If you don't have a threaded barrel you need to replace 5 parts. FCG counts as three and the butt stock and upper/lower forearm count as two.  U.S. made conversion parts all say Made in the U.S.A. on them. You can use U.S. magazines, but they are not as good and if you put a foreign mag in the gun it is illegal.
“Title 18 U.S.C., Chapter 44, Section 922 (r) No person shall assemble a semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun using more than 10 of the imported parts listed in paragraph (c) of this section if the assembled firearm is prohibited from importation under section 925(d)(3) as not being particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.”

This law—still in effect today—lists 20 parts applicalbe to all imported semiautomatic rifles, not just the AK-47, that must comply. For the AK-47, the law applies to these 16 parts :

    Barrel
    Receiver
    Front and rear trunions (on stamped receivers only)
    Bolt carrier
    Bolt
    Gas piston
    Buttstock
    Pistol grip
    Upper and lower handguards (count as one part)
    Muzzle device
    Hammer
    Trigger
    Disconnector
    Magazine body
    Magazine follower
    Magazine floor plate

To convert your post-ban AK-47 into one that looks pre-ban, you may choose only a maximum of 10 imported parts. Meaning, you must have at least six parts made in the United States for your AK-47 to be legal and 922 (r) exempt. For a milled receiver, you may replace only five parts. To find out whether your AK is milled or stamped, read “AK-47 Receiver Identification: Milled vs. Stamped.”"

From LWRC: LWRCI REPR . The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with. Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester. Barrel Length: 16.1"". Weight (unloaded): 9.5lbs (16.1"").
