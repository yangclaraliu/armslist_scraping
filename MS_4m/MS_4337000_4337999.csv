A clone of a Vietnam-era Hydramatic (General Motors) M16A1, 5.56mm NATO. The U.S. Government contracted for M16A1 production with both Hydramatic and Harrington & Richardson when wartime demand exceeded Colt's production capacity. This rifle was built on a Nodak Spud NDS-16A1 semi auto receiver. The receiver was originally in the white, and was engraved with the hydramatic markings from a picture of a real hydramatic receiver, all aluminum was anodized to match the color of an original hydramatic M16A1. All steel on the rifle was reparkerized, so its appearance is 'as new', just out of production. The push pins, selector switch, and magazine catch are reproductions of Vietnam-era originals( although technically not correct to a as built new Hydramatic gun) and have the period-correct features and dimples. The top half of the rifle was purchased as a USGI M16A1 complete barreled upper with a SAK 1/12 USGI chrome lined barrel. The bolt and carrier are early Colt USGI, reparkerized. The rifle has a reproduction 3-prong flash hider. The stock, pistol grip, and handgaurds are USGI M16A1 furniture, hand selected for condition. Overall, the rifle appears new and is true to an original hyadramatic. It has been fired to ensure functionality and zero after it was built, not more than 40 rounds. It is accurate and reliable. The chrome lined bore is bright and shiny. The rifle will comes with two 20-round USGI or Colt magazines, and a complete buttstock cleaning kit. The rifle is all USGI except for the lower receiver, reproduction parts, and a few of the internals, and was assembled and refinished by a certified gunsmith.

I charge $200 which includes everything but bags (decals, paint, different schemes, etc.). A lot of places charge less but there charge extra for everything but the wood, cant do custom paint schemes, and they use cheap materials that just does not look the same or last as long as the good wood. I do this as a hobby and have been making boards for over 3 years now take a lot of pride in the work I do. I am not mass producing these for the money, each set is made to order. This is a set that will last you a long time. I can make almost anything you need as long as there is a decal. I can even make custom decals (as long as its not a Trade Marked image). They are made with Oak or maple and top of the line 2X4s and painted then covered with three coats of urethane so they will last a long time. The legs fold under the boards for easy storage. I enjoy making them so you wont find the quality of these boards for the price anywhere else. All my boards are custom so I have about a 7 day turn around. If you are looking for a quality set that will last for many years give me a call. The proof is in the pictures. Just compare the pictures people post on Criagslist and you can see the difference. Thanks for looking. I am looking to trade for guns.  NO 22 cal please.  Below is the link to my Craigslist add with 24 pictures of different sets.  I can add cash to make a deal or deliver multiple sets.  Thanks

We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

If you are not familiar with S&W's short time spent producing all-metal firearms, the M645 is a handgun that is the dad to the M4506. The rarity is justified by all firearms manufacturers producing guns that have polymer (plastic) parts. You will not find any polymer on this gun. It is a double action modern take on the classic 1911. Grips and extended magazines are widely available for this firearm. If there was a step up from 1911s this is it. I am selling to pay for eye surgery. Gun is a workhorse that is always on point at the range

If you purchase the firearm, you will also get a duty holster, 2 8 round steel factory magazines, a nylon double mag holster, a trigger lock, and a nylon case. This firearm was detail stripped and cleaned by an armorer a week ago. My asking price is 550$OBO.

Quality gun trades plus cash, as well as multiple gun trades, will be considered on a value GREATER than $1200.  This rifle, for several reasons, will only appreciate in value.

Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal.

Slides on the Stainless and CDP models as well as all Micro barrels are machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.

Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Comes with a custom fit 1940's faux alligator skin violin case and Magpul MBUS sights. Subtract $50 if you do not want the sights. Gear sector hand stops not included. I can through in a Magpul vertical grip for $15 extra."

the AAC 5.56mm 16” Multi Purpose Weapon (MPW). The AAC mid-length gas 5.56mm MPW has been designed for the highest levels of reliability. The full-auto bolt carrier is custom machined to be the correct final dimensions to allow for a thicker-than-typical for the industry nickel-boron coating for both added corrosion resistance and a hard surface finish to facilitate ease of cleaning. 

The carrier-key is heat-treated for durability and is properly staked. The black phosphated bolt is machined from mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel and is shot-peened for durability, and then high-pressure tested.

The extractor spring is made from upgraded 383,000 psi steel for the longest life, and the green o-ring has been tested to -40C degrees. AAC 5.56mm MPW barrels use 1/7 twist rifling, and the entire barrel, bore, and chamber are finished in corrosion resistant SCARmorTM to provide a high surface hardness for longevity without impeding accuracy. 

The barrel is protected by a KAC URX-3 handguard with MIL-STD-1913 accessory attachment points. The pictogram-marked lower receiver features a Geissele two-stage trigger. The rifle also features a six-position mil-spec receiver extension with a propely-staked castle nut and Magpul stock, pistol grip, and trigger guard.

I'm looking to get $250 for this as it's in near perfect condition with probably 150-200 rounds down the pipe. I can meet up at a local dealer, most preferably City Arms in Pleasant Hill or Canyon Sports in Martinez. Buyer pays transfer fees but I'll throw in 300 rounds of .22 ammo which is hard to come by.

Converted and rebuilt by the Chileans to 7.62 NATO in the 1960s. Made in 1895 by Ludwig Loewe who was considered to be the finest maker of Mausers.  This one is solid, attractive, and is a good shooter. I have shot only ZQ-1 ammo from Walmart in it, and it likes it. Bore is mint of course. It is nice to be able to go to Walmart to buy cheap ammo for a vintage  Mauser. I have had zero issues with it, and do not expect any issues in the future either. It's actually quite accurate and a nice rifle. Neat stamping on the butt that appears done by the Chileans and says “CAPITAN PRAI”. There is some nice tiger stripe in this stock. No FFL required since this is an antique. So, I can also ship or mail it to anyone.

Contact me through Armslist by email or you can text/call me at REDACTED if you want to see Capitan Prai's rifle here in Santa Fe.

In 1959, the US military adopted the resultant M14. The rugged reliability of the M14 coupled with its formidable 7.62×51 NATO cartridge left an enduring impression on America’s fighting forces despite its relatively short tenure. When it was replaced in 1970, the stage was set for the next step in its history. In 1974, the Reese family ensured that the legacy of the M14 would live on. Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois began offering a civilian legal semi-automatic version known as the M1A™. Powerful, accurate and reliable, M1A™’s were soon found dominating the National Matches at Camp Perry. Shooters across the country discovered the versatility and enjoyable satisfaction of owning an M1A™. Today, the M1A™ is firmly established as a platform that can handle any mission, any condition, any foe at any range. M1A™’s are found in national competitions, in the hands of operators on elite tactical teams, and in the back country hunting big game. And although the M14 is no longer the service rifle of the US military, it still sees action as a designated marksman rifle and as a sniper rifle.

 In the 0200, Zero Tolerance created a professional-grade, premium-quality folding knife built to stand up to heavy-duty use and harsh, real-world conditions. Field-tested by officers on-the-job, the 0200 was judged the best patrol knife overall by Tactical Responsemagazine (Jan-Feb issue, 2008).

 The 0200 features an innovative recurve blade shape designed for multi-tasking capability with minimal mass and maximum performance. Precisely balanced, the recurve blade provides ideal cutting leverage and precision piercing. Choose the plain-edge version, or for the additional cutting versatility of serration, choose the partially serrated 0200ST. In either blade style, the 0200’s blade is made of 154CM steel, a sturdy grade originally developed for tough industrial applications. The blade stock is .156 in. (.4 cm) thick for additional strength. For extra durability and corrosion resistance, ZT coats the blade with black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating.

 The 0200’s matte black scales are 3-D machined G-10 to provide a secure grip. G-10 is a high performance insulator and exhibits extremely high mechanical strength and dimensional stability in a wide variety of extreme conditions. The 0200 has a pivot-shaft adjustment feature that you can tighten or loosen to suit your personal preferences for blade deployment. The 0200 is a fully manual folding knife and offers an ambidextrous thumbstud or flipper for one-handed opening. Quad-mount pocketclip enables tip-up or tip-down carry, left or right-handed."
