If you wanted to put a buttstock on it you would have to register it as a Short Barrel Shotgun, if you wanted to put just a pistol grip on it you would have to register it as an AOW Any Other Weapon.  As it sits it has a generic classification of just a ""firearm"", if you modify it in any way that shortens its current overall length or replace the Sig Brace with a stock you will have to take the appropriate steps to keep it legal. Please google ""Black Aces Tactical DT model"" for more info and a professional review.

(NYSE: RGR) is proud to announce the reintroduction of the Ruger® LC380® pistol to California. The LC380 was originally introduced nationwide in 2013 as a low-recoiling and easy-to-rack variant of the Ruger LC9® pistol. In 2014, Ruger made some minor changes to the LC380 production processes that would have required the pistol to meet California's controversial microstamping law. The LC380CA™ California compliant model reflects the unmodified pistol as originally approved by California in 2013.The Ruger LC380CA is a lightweight, compact pistol perfect for personal protection. The LC380CA holds 7+1 rounds of modern, effective .380 Auto ammunition in a slim, lightweight pistol. The pistol uses the same holsters and accessories as the rugged and reliable LC9 and LC9s®. The LC380CA also features a blued, through-hardened, alloy steel slide; a high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame with aggressive texturing; a finger grip extension magazine floorplate to improve handling; and a rapid acquisition, windage adjustable, 3-Dot sight system.The compact, 17.2 oz. Ruger LC380CA has a 3.1"" barrel, an overall length of 6"", a height of 4.5"" and a slim 0.9"" width. The compact frame and short trigger reach are designed to accommodate a wide range of hand sizes. The LC380CA offers modern safety features such as a tactile loaded chamber indicator, magazine disconnect, and a manual external safety. The LC380CA ships with one, 7-round magazine, a soft case and a cable locking device.As a special ""bonus"" with this reintroduction, the LC380CA will ship for a limited time with a LaserMax® CenterFire® frame mounted red laser.Later this year, Ruger plans to expand its offerings of Genuine Ruger Factory Parts & Accessories to include a 9mm caliber conversion kit for the LC380. The kit will allow owners of a Ruger LC380 or LC380CA to convert their pistol to safely and reliably fire 9mm Luger ammunition, providing added flexibility to shoot either lighter recoiling .380 Auto or more powerful 9mm Luger in the same handgun.For more information on the Ruger LC380CA or to learn more about the extensive line of award-winning Ruger firearms, visit Ruger.com or Facebook.com/Ruger.

You don't see these too often so I'll put in a bit more detail. 

This pistol caliber carbine is very tough and rugged compared to other out right now like the Sub2k and the Beretta. The polymer is a bit thicker and it uses more metal on the rifle itself than the other which adds to how robust it is. The rifle has a full length pic rail on top, which I've tossed on a red dot optic (which will come with it). The charging handle is located on the left and forward like the Bushmaster ACR, and does NOT reciprocate while firing. The trigger is aluminum and breaks at what feels like 3 - 3.5 lbs as well, very crisp and nice reset. It can be moved to the right side if you wish with a simple hex wrench. The safety is in the same position as an AR15, but it is a bit shorter. The rifle also breaks down very easily and quite similar to an AR15 as well, making this thing a breeze to clean. The rifle will also come with two steel magazines as well. No problem firing multiple types of ammo and it is rated for +P. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED"

The muzzle brake has also been replaced with a PWS FSC556 which is the exact same brake as used on the SCAR so the gun practically doesn't move when shooting. There have been some rail covers and a red dot added which I'll throw in for free. Comes with 1 30 round PMag, but if you want more or some ammo we can always talk about adding things. For those that don't know much about this rifle you can break it down, even removing the barrel, in less than 1 minute. It is the easiest to clean rifle I've ever owned, and it is NOT ammo picky at all. Using a piston means that it will stay clean and cool near the bolt, and hell with it I'll toss in the Magpul VFG that is on it for free as well. The folding stock is very robust, much more so than the SCAR stock, and it has multiple sling attachment points including quick detach mounts.

The XD-S® model features a slimmer, single stack frame though it still has the firepower of a .45 caliber. This slim design makes it perfect for those looking for a concealed carry pistol. Like the whole XD® line of pistols, the XD-S® offers an ergonomic design that makes it easier to point and shoot. The design offers a single-position Picatinny rail, making this one of the only pistols of its size that can be accessorized with lights and lasers. The low profile sight also makes this firearm more holster-friendly.

In addition to the slim contour frame, the XD-S® pistol has many features that make it more comfortable and easy to shoot. Two interchangeable backstraps allow you to customize your grip. The modified contour of the grip also makes it possible for nearly any size hand to release the magazine without twisting or moving from your firing grasp.

The XD-S® has many of the safety features found in other XD® models, such as Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, and grip safety. The XD-S® also has an enhanced secure grip texture.

Combined, all of these features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S® provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and ergonomic point and shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package. The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full-Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision."

Transaction Information:
If you are interested in purchasing the firearm face-to-face, we must meet at a mutually agreed upon FFL gun dealer, in order to meet the recent changes in the Oregon Revised Statutes regarding private firearm sales. I am more than willing to drive to meet you at our agreed upon dealer, as long as it is within a reasonable distance.

Or, if you live further away than a reasonable driving distance or out-of-state, I can ship the firearm via UPS from my FFL gun dealer to your FFL gun dealer, but that will be an additional cost of $100. If you choose to have me ship the firearm to your gun dealer, then you will need to mail me a cashiers check from your bank for the cost of the firearm plus the $100, and a copy of your FFL dealer's license. Once the check clears, I will ship the firearm to your dealer, I will call you to let you when it has shipped, then email you the UPS tracking number."

I believe this one was manufactured in 1970, and was imported by Interarms. The Nds mark indicates it was a State Police (Landespolizei) of Niedersachsen issued firearm, formerly located in Lower Saxonia, West Germany. The antler mark on the barrel stands for the proof house in Ulm, Germany, where guns were sent for safety checks and must pass a pressure test according to German law. The eagle over N mark simply indicates it was Nitro proofed for smokeless powder.

Asking $450 face-to-face transaction. Includes 2 magazines and an Uncle Mikes soft case. For my asking price I will include 100 rounds of Magtech lead round nose .32ACP ammo.

I'm only selling this because I need to fund something else.  The PPQ has the best factory trigger in any striker fired pistol on the market.  The M1 versions are getting harder and harder to find in the US and anyone that has tried this style of handgun knows how great the mag release in the trigger guard can be.  They make excellent target, carry, and home defense pistols because no trigger mods are required.  This pistol has never had a malfunction.

This pistol comes with:

- All the original packaging, back straps, accessories, and paperwork, except the original sights.  

- Raven Concealment OWB (right side) holster and mag carrier (left side).  These are around $170 for the pair new and it takes a while to get them.

- Total of four mags.  In addition to the two factory standard capacity magazines, it comes with two factory high capacity magazines that have never been used.  The high capacity mags retail for $40 each.  

- New Trijicon HD night sights.  These are some of the best night sights ever made.  They retail for $135.

This pistol only has 510 rounds on it and is in very good condition.  The only flaw is some minor scuffs around the grip area that are hard to see unless you look very closely.  Every used PPQ I have seen has these same scuffs.

Buyer must pickup, pay cash, and show VA drivers license and CCW.  We will execute a Bill of Sale.

No trades.  At this price I am giving this setup away.  It's a really good deal.

Thanks for your interest.  Email with questions."

This package includes a new/mint Cabela Dakota rifle case, a super-soft neoprene-padded Allen Cascade gun sling, a UTG bipod, an Allen buttstock cartridge holder (ammo not included in sale), and a Shooterpads gel filled recoil pad. All items are new/mint. Feel free to email me for additional images. I have several closeups to help you make your decision.

I am top-heavy on firearms and have no need for this beautiful rifle. I took it to the range only once and fired no more than 50 rounds through it. It was thoroughly cleaned and lubed prior to shooting, and thoroughly cleaned and lubed after shooting it. It’s safe to say that it’s in better condition than when I first bought it.

Altogether, this package new costs $1,050.00. I’m willing to part with it all for only $625.00. This is a firm price, so please don’t ask me to negotiate. I will not ship this rifle, so you will need to make arrangements with me to pick it up in person in Hitchcock, TX. Cash only of course.

While this is a private sale and I’m not required to go through an FFL, I WILL need to make a copy of your DL for my records.

This package includes a new/mint Cabela Dakota rifle case, a super-soft neoprene-padded Allen Cascade gun sling, a UTG bipod, an Allen buttstock cartridge holder (ammo not included in sale), and a Shooterpads gel filled recoil pad. All items are new/mint. Feel free to email me to see several close-up images to help with your purchasing decision.

I am top-heavy on firearms and have no need for this beautiful rifle. I took it to the range only once and fired no more than 50 rounds through it. It was thoroughly cleaned and lubed prior to shooting, and thoroughly cleaned and lubed after shooting it. It’s safe to say that it’s in better condition than when I first bought it.

Altogether, this package new costs $1,050.00. I’m willing to part with it all for only $750.00. This is a firm price, so please don’t ask me to negotiate. I will not ship this rifle, so you will need to make arrangements with me to pick it up in person in Hitchcock, TX. Cash only of course.

While this is a private sale and I’m not required to go through an FFL, I WILL need to make a copy of your DL for my records. I will not sell the rifle to anyone who in my opinion comes across as someone who has no business owning it. Finally, do not offer to send me payment by mail. Won’t happen.
