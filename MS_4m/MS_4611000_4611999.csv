I've owned this pistol for several years, using it as an on-duty back-up that I carried on my soft body armor.  It matched the caliber and took the magazines from my Glock 22 duty pistol, so was a perfect addition to my gear.

Since retiring, I never shoot it or carry it, so would like to trade someone for a Glock 19 or Glock 17. 

This Glock 27 is in excellent mechanical condition, but does have a small amount of holster wear from being carried daily for the last few years of my career.  I estimate that it's been fired less than 250 rounds.

If you have a model 19 or Model 17 that you'd like to trade, let me know, and we can meet up for an inspection and possible trade.

With the pistol, I have two model 27 magazines, one of which has the magazine extension floor plate for the extra finger, a new recoil spring as a stand-by extra, if ever needed, a nice leather paddle holster, and also the original box.

For sale is my new in box 1986 Type 56 AK-47.  This gun is unfired and is new in packaging with all original accessories/manual/ and original receipt from 1986.  I am selling this to purchase a new house and need to liquidate $.   I purchased this 3 years ago and Have not fired it. AK's have risen 20-30% in value and all will continue to do so as time goes on.  This will continue to rise more due to no further ones coming into this country. 

NO trades and I am looking for a cash sale that will be done locally at an FFL of my choosing. (buyer pays transfer fee). I am willing to ship this at the buyer's expense.

This is a Highly regarded collectible firearm and Chinese AK's are further banned for importation and this one is grandfathered in.  It will only continue to go up in value."

For those unfamiliar with the rifle, it was manufactured for a limited time and quantity from 2003 to 2004. The gun itself was purchased in 2005 at the annual Missoula Gun Show at the Adams Center. 

Initially, the intention was to use the rifle for varmints as well as enjoy its novelty, but somehow the rifle made its way to the back of the gun safe due to the acquisition of a couple of .22 magnum level action rifles. Still, the rifle is very fun to shoot, and within rim-fire distances out and beyond 100 yards, one could liken the experience to shooting a laser beam. 

Approximately 150 rounds or less made were fired through the gun. There are several marks on the frame and barrel, as well as a couple of dings and cosmetic issues I am more than happy to point out and demonstrate to potential buyers. However, the gun remains in greater than 90% condition. I am setting the value of the gun, under advisement from the 34th edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values, at $625. 

The gun comes with approximately 100 rounds of .17HMR.

Cash is the preferred payment, and the price is generally firm (though I might entertain reasonable offers). Absolutely no low-balling - doing so will merit an instant deletion of your email. 

I am pretty flexible with meeting up with people in the Missoula area and just outside of it after 7:00 PM during the week and anytime during the weekend."

This particular revolver does not have the ""M"" stamp, indicating that is was never sent back to Smith & Wesson for a recall that was issued in 1985. The recall was to address issues with the hammer nose sticking into the bushing during dry fire. This pistol does not stick and functions without issue. Not all 686's and 686-1's were affected by this problem, but S&W will still honor the recall now almost 30 years later to include free shipping.

Beneath the left wooden grip panel is ""F"" and ""A"" etched into the frame, suggesting this is a ""Francisco Arizmendi"" manufacture revolver. The caliber is one popular for the time, but now since relegated to antiques or niche shooters. I am not totally sure of the proof marks, but they seem commensurate with manufacturer, location and time period. 

The gun itself is in good working condition and was in the possession of a friend before being passed to me as payment of a debt. I had the gun inspected by Chris Barnard of Accu-Arms for mechanical issues and to determine if it was safe to shoot, as well as the internals cleaned and worked over. 

Cylinder lockup is solid, and the release mechanism near the forcing cone works perfectly fine. The trigger pull is smooth in both double and single actions, though a strong finger is needed I might think. The barrel has some pitting, but the rifling looks to be in good shape overall. The finish is as is in the photos. 

With this gun comes a box of 50 .32-20 as pictured. 

I am asking $180 for the gun. No low-balling, and the price is generally firm. I am pretty flexible in meeting up with potential buyers in terms of location. However, work pushes meet up times to after 7PM during the week. Weekends are fair game during the day."

Absolutely no purchase is required.. there's no tricks or email mailing lists. I'm simply trying to thank past customers and catch the eye of new customers.

Now you may be asking what is The Mosin Crate?
I'm a small online military surplus firearm store. I specialize in world war firearms. I have a constantly changing inventory. Some weeks I have collections of German Nazi k98 rifles, other times Arisaka rifles or Mosins or Enfields. I've even had 50+ swiss k31 rifles in at once. Later this month of August I will have PU Mosin Sniper rifles from ww2. I'm a fellow collector, I'm in this because I love doing it, not because I want to make a quick buck in the currently booming gun industry. Customer service is my top priority and I never intend to become so big that I lose sight of that as many companies do. Feel free to do a google search on my company and find out why everyone gets so excited when I list new firearms on the site!

251,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4611251,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson .38 Special,"Missoula, Missoula, Montana",$ 275,"Listed On: Sunday, August 16, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"For sale is a Smith and Wesson 3rd Model, 4th Change in .38 SPL, manufactured in 1923.

The gun has a nickel finish and mother of pearl grips. Cylinder lockup is good, and trigger pull is very good, and very smooth and pleasant in both double and single action. There are blemishes to the nickel finish of course, and especially on the cylinder. Slight imperfections to the rifling is present, but the barrel itself is in good condition. Having shot the gun numerous times, it performs very well, if shooting a bit low depending on what load you are using. 

One defect of importance is a slight bulge in the barrel just behind the front sight blade. The bulge is not noticeable unless one feels along the barrel, and does not hinder performance nor represents a danger in shooting the gun. Of some concern when I acquired the gun through some horse trading, I was informed by several collectors that all this does is lower value, and by a gunsmith that there might be a slight loss of accuracy (not that I noticed anyhow). The gunsmith also checked the rest of the internals and cleaned them. 

The 34th Edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values lists the gun at 50% condition as $400, but due to the barrel bulge, I am listing the gun at $275 or best offer. No low-balling or obviously unreasonable prices; any such attempted will simply be deleted. 

Due to the gun's age, character of the standard load at the time, and material used in manufacturing, I must note that it is highly inadvisable to shoot anything more than basic .38 SPL loads through the gun -- no +p or +p+. The gun is an interesting piece in any case, and for being over 90 years old, still functions very well.

I picked it up to see if I liked a bull pup but it turns out I like the idea more than the application. It's an egyptian maddi with the bull pup conversion. I bought it used so I'm not sure of it's history but through some research I found that these were available as a factory conversion as well as a kit you could install yourself. I'm not sure which this is for certain. maybe if I get a few extra minutes during normal business hours I'll put a call in to CAI and see if I can find out. The exterior has some normal minor wear but the bore and internals are in excellent condition and I don't think it's seen a lot of use. I'm no newbie to the AK world so I have a pretty good idea of what to look for. The rifle comes as pictured and I do have one other option for optics if you don't care for red dots. In my research into these rifles I've had a very difficult time finding others to get a feel for fair pricing. I was only able to find one identical rifle on an auction site and it sold for $1400. Now I'm a fair guy and I know this shows some handling wear, and to be totally honest I don't personally think even a perfect specimen is really worth that, so I'm setting my price at $900 cash or trade. This is a great opportunity for all you guys that have told me you only buy when it's a great deal. If your offering a trade, I'm going to look at my three favorite gun stores and take the best price listed for the make and model of your trade offer, then subtract 20 percent from new cost to arrive at fair used value.(by the way if I used the same equation for my gun value it would be $1120 and mine is no longer available as a factory build and hard to find too so save that line for the next guy too)  Condition will also factor in as well as any extras that you might offer. If you think I'm being unfair please just move on along to the next ad. I've been doing this for a while now and to be honest it's wearing me out, so if you'd want to make a deal please make your best offer up front. I don't have the time or energy to haggle for hours or days and not reach a deal. If you want to play barter king, try it on the next guy. I'll send a polite no thank you then simply stop responding. I am also burnt out on all the traveling to make a deal. I will only meet in or very close to Danville. If your honest and use those manners your mama taught you we'll get along just fine. Lastly as seen in the picture I do have cash to boot if your trade is worth more than my asking price. What's pictured is what I have to work with so asking for more than $500 is just a waste of time, it's all I can spare at the moment. If your still interested after reading all that please feel free to contact me. I'm a pretty easy guy to deal with but the crowd that hangs around armslist has shown me I need to be very clear in my expectations or I get offers that make the pawn stores look generous."

It has only been fired once (and only about a dozen rounds) to function test it. It ran flawlessly, and I had plans to put some high $$$ glass and a nice muzzle break to round out it's long range capabilities, but that is no longer an option for me financially at this point.

It has an under-folder stock for greater portability as these types of models were usually issued to paratroopers. The receiver is 1 1/2 times the thickness of any other AK under-folder design from any other former Warsaw Pact nation, leading to an incredibly sturdy received design.

The furniture (Pistol grip, upper and lower hand-guards) has been upgraded to Hogue M70 furniture, which is far and away an improvement over the original furniture it came with. The left strut of the under-folding stock is wound in para cord as it makes for a more comfortable cheek-weld.
The sights are straight and the rifle shoots well and true. In the approximately 200 rounds that went through it I experienced no FTEs or FTFs.  
Included are the rifle, carry strap, oil bottle and two magazines, one of which is pictured.

I'm selling this rifle to put toward another project, hence the insistence upon cash payment. As you can see from the price offered, I'm already taking a loss.

The newest LCR® maintains all the features of the critically acclaimed original LCR®. Its double-action-only trigger pull is uniquely engineered with a patented Ruger® friction reducing cam fire control system. The trigger pull force on the LCR® builds gradually and peaks later in the trigger stroke, resulting in a trigger pull that feels much lighter than it actually is. This results in more controllable double-action shooting, even among those who find traditional double-action-only triggers difficult to operate.
