This rifle is identical to the Remington 798 and Parker-Hale 1200, zastava actually manufactured the receivers for both of those rifles. Typical mauser awesomeness- claw extractor, recoil lug machined into receiver body, controlled feed, hinged floorplate on machined steel trigger guard/bottom metal. Hammer-forged barrel.

This one is very nice, and has had exactly 4 rounds shot through i since purchased new.
The walnut stock has been free-floated and glass bedded to the action. A complete trigger job was performed, trigger breaks around 2.5 lb, perfect for hunting and very safe.

The bluing is phenomenal on this rifle. The stock has a couple small dings from falling over in the safe but looks very good. The scope pictured is not included, but I will include a 4-16x50mm scope. Leupold one piece base and rings included.

Sorry for the one bad picture, arms list won't let me put more for some reason. 

Info from the larue website:

The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.

The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.

Barrels:
Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). 

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire. 

Internals:
The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. 

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: 
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results. 

Furniture:
Base Model comes complete with A2 Rifle Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, A2 Flash Hider, plus two LaRue-made 20-round magazines."

It has a flared bottom designed for fast and easy clip change and heavy sustained shooting.  80 rounds in magazines makes this a really effective weapon.  It's a special issue and will probably increase in value over the years.

Below is taken from Sig's web site:

The SIG SAUER® E26R-9-TACOPS Tactical Operations is a full-sized 9mm featuring a stainless steel slide with rugged, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, front cocking serrations and SIGLITE® rear night sight, a TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and features the Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The beavertail frame is black hard anodized light weight alloy with integral Picatinny rail and polymer Magwell grips. The pistol comes with four (4) 20 round super capacity magazines so it’s ready to see action.

I wanted to keep it for the collectivity and it's quality as well as the probable increase in value.  However, due to retirement and needed reduction of my ""toys"" it has to go.

Call me to buy or with any questions at REDACTED in Lexington.  We can set up a meeting within the local area.  This is an in-person cash transaction with a receipt for each of us and personal identities will be exchanged.  NO ID, NO SALE.  Low-ball offers will be ignored and I absolutely will not ship."

Never had any issues with it, it sits in my garage and with a new baby I never get to ride anymore.
The only time it's been down was when i set it outside to warm up while i finished putting my gear on and apparently my driveway is just steep enough that it tipped the bike over so there is a little damage on the fairings. You can see in the orange easily enough, but the damage to the black i sprayed plasti dip over it and you can barely tell the difference.

 Everything bundled cost me about $500 so this is a deal. It's a great CCW firearm and easy to take out for some close range practice and target shooting. Im asking $360 for the firearm, magazines, and case. For $400 I will include the hoslters

It shoots at up to 3,000 psi of pressure and 1300 feet per second. Much more powerful than a traditional .22 rifle, and pellets are plentiful and about 4 cents each! I have shot Condors for a long time, and they just work…no issues…just function. The tank on this is also twice the volume (490cc) of typical air gun tanks… so far less fill ups. It also comes with a new hand pump for the tank for when you're out in the field.

In case you’ve never heard of the Condor…It is THE gold standard in serious high powered PCP air gunning. There is a lot of hype around this gun, and it lives up to all of it in my experience. This particular gun performs flawlessly and still has 9 months left on the warranty. The pump is also still under warranty. I bought the barrel shroud (silencer) for it which makes the already quiet gun EXTREMELY quiet. I also put a nice Accushot 4-16x56 scope on it.

I could go on and on about the quality of this gun. If you want to see specs, reviews, and other details of the gun, scope, shroud, etc… I organized the links below for you to check out.

No trades. I’m only selling because I have two identical set ups of this gun, and want this one to be in someone’s hands who will put it to use. Paid 1300 for this entire set up in July (gun, pump, scope, shroud). I’ll even throw in about 1100 pellets to get you started. 

They only let me post one small picture on this listing. Everything is in brand new condition. Text me for more pics if you'd like.

 I special ordered this back in 2010 through Sporting Arms and after a four month wait I received a beautiful 5"" stainless steel 1911 with no front cocking serrations and a left side extended safety (rather than the ambi safety that comes with the Custom Carry). 

I have shot it twice and put 125-150 rounds through it. I have the correct cardboard box and everything that was included with it including the manual and other literature, bushing wrench, and the two Baer mags which are still new/unused. 

Current list price on the Custom Carry is $2,290. I am asking $1,895 FTF in Tucson, AZ. If you are out of the area I will split shipping cost (about $25 each from my FFL to yours). 

USPS money order for payment please. Kindly post an ""I will take it"" and follow up with a message through the system. 


NOTE: This pistol has never been disassembled/cleaned as Baer recommends cleaning only after a 200-300 round break-in period. It has not been shot enough to reach that threshold."
