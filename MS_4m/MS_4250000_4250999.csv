Rifle is all numbers matching. Mum is ground, and stock is is good shape. 

The rifle is a Type 99 Kokura Arsenal Series 25. During the last months of WWII, the Japanese made some changes to the Type 99 and were known as ""Last Ditch"" or Substitute Standard Type 99. This rifle is in approximatly the last ~10k rifles produced at Kokura before the final days of the war. ""Kokura was the backup target for the ""Little Boy"" bomb on August 6, 1945, so if Hiroshima had been clouded over, the first atomic bomb would have been dropped on Kokura. Kokura was the primary target for the ""Fat Man"" bomb on August 9, 1945, but on the morning of the raid, the city was obscured by clouds and smoke from the firebombing of the neighboring city of Yahata the day before. Since the mission commander Major Charles Sweeney had orders to drop the bomb visually and not by radar, he diverted to the secondary target, Nagasaki""...

Back to the rifle, it has a chrome lined barrel, solid stock, functions well, and is a fine example of Japanese crafstmanship even at the end of WWII. All numbered parts are matching, and in good condition. The Mum is ground, which was ordered by General MacArthur at the end of the war. NO IMPORT MARKS.

Bayonet is Kokura Arsenal, but missing the release button. Otherwise in good to Very Good condition. Finish is 80% and scabbard not dented.

This is a C&R

This is not a SF gun. It's sorta a rare bird. It has yellow/green Ameriglo C.A.P. night sights on it that are a couple of months old. It has a SS 21# RSA that has about 700 rounds on it. It shoots like a dream but I'm entertaining other Glock trades. I have 2 ten round magazines that go with the gun but no case. If we trade Glock 21 to Glock 21 we can both keep our magazines if that's agreeable. I have had this pistol for a few years. The finish needs more work to be perfectly polished. I'm just seeing what's out there. Sometimes there are folks looking for certain guns for their collection. Was hoping to find that person that had something to trade me. I can send more pictures if you are interested.

I have fired this pistol on 3 occasions (200 rds each time) and kept a log of every shot fired which I can provide if interested. Never a malfunction, stovepipe, failure to feed or jam. Installed stainless steel guide rod and upgraded spring. This pistol is basically new, not even broken in yet, as you can see in the pics the barrel doesnt show ANY wear as well as the exterior of the pistol. This gun is in pristine condition which the pictures cannot show. If interested I can text/email better pics. Not looking for trades unless offering high end collectible folding knives and cash. This pistol is a steal at $575 and won't last long at this price. Retail on all items listed is over $950! By the way, Magpul Industries announced this week that they now have Glock 17 mags for $15.99, amazing!

Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Mainly looking for a similarly equipped Glock 19, Walther PPQ M1 or H&K VP9. Might also consider  an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm, Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs, or other quality 9mm's.  Willing to add $ for a higher value trade

As I said, the rear end is converted. Currently installed is the G2 trigger system (pretty good for an AK trigger), US Palm pistol grip, and a US made clubfoot style stock. On the front end there is a Midwest Industries Extended rail system (runs about $150) that originally came from another rifle. I haven't checked under the front sight hood to see if the barrel us threaded or not, they say theres about a 50-50 chance. I'll also include a Tapco US gas piston if you want to try to install it on the bolt carrier. Includes the 10 round Russian mag and a metal military 30 rounder.

For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system.

This is Chilean Military Surplus, circa 1976.  Comes packaged 15 rounds to a box in original cardboard boxes.  7 boxes of 15 along with some loose rounds for 126 total.  Reloadable brass case fmj ammo, but I am unsure of the bullet weight.  Some of the cases have some corrosion on them but they should all still be firable. However as this is old surplus I can't guarantee that there won't be some bad primers in the bunch.  Fired several hundred rounds of this through my mauser and only had a few duds but this has been close to a decade ago.
In any case this is great ammo if you have a Spanish mauser, particularly if you reload for it.
I also have 10 rounds of Federal soft point hunting ammo

909,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4250909,For Sale:  NFA Trust (Complete package including free assistance with ATF Forms),"Ohio, Ohio, United States",$ 199,"Listed On: Friday, April 17, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking at NFA Trust? The only person legally allowed to draft and advise you on is a licensed attorney. There are fake websites out there that will sell you an improper trust that fails to obey Ohio law. Only deal with a licensed attorney. I practice NFA gun law here in Ohio and am duly licensed.

100% Success rate. Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

The handgun is in great shape and is very accurate. The barrel shows the usual smiles and shiny spots for a used gun but everything else is in ""like new"" condition. The parts that actually show a bit of wear are the frame rails and a small portion in the mag well. Some time ago I purchased another set of factory grips ( the ones in the photos) for this gun because the texture of the originals was a bit aggressive for my liking. Both sets will be included in the sale.

2. Plano storage case
3. Bipod
4. weaver scope mount
5. I have a spare .30 bore snake i can throw in

The aluminum bedding in the B&C stock keep the action and barrel stable, so i don't see a need for any more bedding, but that's up to you.  I do have a weaver scope mount, though I would recommend a larue.  The sale does not include any optics.

This rifle has been sent back to Remington for the X-Mark Pro® (“XMP®”) trigger recall, repair is completed and documented.

I am not selling this due to any problems.  I re-evaluated my needs and decided i don't have time to practice dialing in firing solutions and ringing steel at 1K meters.  I had planned to get some training early this year, but got the recall notice and was without rifle for a while.  

If you are serious about purchase, we will need to set up a meeting place for inspection, and i require either:
1. a valid concealed carry permit
2. a valid pistol purchase permit
I prefer NC purchases, but if you're out of state we will need to go through a FFL.

I do have some recommendations for optics and mounts.
Hunters, please note this rifle is heavy.  You may not want to lug this around, but that's up to you.

I'm looking for a good offer, but more importantly looking for a good person to pass ownership.  A good person is better than a high offer.
