Condition is mint and all original packaging and paperwork is included. The watch uses an ETA 2892-2 movement which has proven the test of time and will be reliable for many years to come. Case and bracelet are ceramic so they are very scratch resistant and it has a sapphire crystal. With proper care this watch will last a lifetime and will never stop due to a dead battery!

Kimber's Solo Crimson Carry, with the power of the 9 mm cartridge along with Crimson Trace Lasergrips … unequaled ergonomics accuracy and comfortable shootability. The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

I will only meet in Evansville. I will ask to see your drivers license. I will need to make sure you are over 21 years old and also to confirm you are a Indiana resident. I would prefer for you to show me a LTCH permit as well. 

I have the box and papers and everything that came with it.  If you should have any questions please let me know.

Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.
