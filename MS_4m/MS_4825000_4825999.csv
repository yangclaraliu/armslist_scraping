from web:
SIG SAUER introduces the SBX Pistol Stabilizing Brace, an update to the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing brace, a shooter""s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. The SBX features a more slim design with a thicker strap for extra stability. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator""s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

The innovative design of the Shell Sorter Brass Sorter helps save tedious hours of separating the most common pistol brass. Instead of spending hours hand separating 45 ACP, 40 S&W, 10mm Auto, 9mm and 380 ACP just put unsorted brass in the top yellow ABS plastic pan and shake. Everything smaller than 45 ACP will fall into the next pan (blue). The blue pan is designed to keep brass the size of 40 S&W and 10mm letting everything smaller fall into the next pan (yellow). The yellow pan will keep everything the size of 9mm and 380 ACP sending everything smaller out of the bottom. 

Technical Information

Fits: Over a plastic bucket 
Function: Separate 45 ACP brass from 40 S&W and 10mm Auto Brass from 9mm and 380 ACP brass 
Material: ABS Plastic 
How it Works: 
The pans are designed to sit on top of a standard 5 gallon bucket
By stacking the yellow on top, then the blue, then the black, multiple calibers can be sorted apart
Pans can also be used in place of a media separate

Color Coding: 
Yellow sorts 45 ACP and larger
Blue sorts 40 S&W and 10mm
Black sorts 9mm, 380 and smaller

Rumors circulated for years about a possible Benchmade OTF knife. Good news Benchmade lovers- the knife has finally arrived. The Infidel OTF is, to put it mildly, awesome. We had some Benchmade reps in our store awhile back and I got to play with a Prototype. It was outstanding in terms of quality, action, and lock-up. D2 tool steel double edged blade, double ground. Anodized T6 aluminum handle. And a pocket clip for easy carry. This model features a BK1 black coated blade!

This ammo is Ranger Winchesters best law enforcement grade ammunition. It is loaded 10% higher pressure than standard 124 grain FMJ ammunition, thus it is +P pressure level (but not specifically marked +P). Winchester Ranger 9mm NATO ammunition is loaded to the same specifications currently used by the U.S. Military. The higher pressure in these rounds deliver increased velocity and energy over standard 9mm ammunition, which also promotes reliable cycling in modern 9mm semi-auto handguns as well as carbines.  This ammo is excellent for sub machine gun use but will work well in any high quality 9mm Luger caliber weapon. 50 rounds per box. Brass case, boxer primer, copper FMJ 124 grain. The glock 17 was designed around this ammumation. Although the box is marked 'Law Enforcement Only', it is legal for anyone to purchase or own. 20 boxes available $20 obo or trade for 22 rifle/scope or derringer 410/45 over uder

The modern SIG SAUER® pistol story began with the P220®. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector."

Not sure of all the differences over the Gen 1, since I never had one, but this one has plenty of rail space on the front stock, top and bottom and has a pretty good trigger that breaks around 6#.  This would be a perfect, under the seat car or truck rifle, trunk rifle, or it may even fit in some consoles, lol.  You can carry this in your car or truck folded up along with a red dot or 1-4x you can slap on in seconds.  It's very cool, accurate and easy to conceal in any vehicle.  Perfect paired up with a Glock 17 for having fun or any SHTF or WROL scenario, lol, but hey, you never know...  I just have too many for those occasions already, so need to move some out.

$580 firm in cash.  If you can find this model cheaper, great, but I can't find it in stock anywhere and when/if they stock them again the prices will likely go up from what is currently posted.

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal for me, I will politely pass.  Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others as long as it's a good deal.  I could use a good AR-10 with a 16""-18"" medium profile or lighter barrel, I can add cash or something else.

I have a 9mm SIG P226R made in Exeter, NH which I would like to sell. I have 4x15rd magazines (factory) and 2x18rd magazines (mec-gar), a Galco Kingtuk IWB holster, and original box and accessories. The pistol is equipped with Hogue grips and straight 8 style sights, and I still have the original grips in case you prefer them (they'll come with ofc)

This P226R has just shy of a thousand rounds through it and I've always cleaned and lubed after each outing. The trigger has smoothed nicely and is better than some I've tried. Cosmetically there is some very slight scratching on the beavertail, which I took a really zoomed up picture of to show it at it's worst so you could judge if it would bother you or not, from even arms length like if you were shooting they're hardly visible. Other than the beavertail scratches the finish has no other blemishes or wear.

I used to shoot this gun a lot more and really enjoyed it for a long time, and it was even my carry gun for a brief period, but ultimately I decided that even the aluminum frame was heavier than I wanted and I made the conversion to polymer. Now I hardly shoot it so it's time to move on.

I'd like $650 for the package considering all the magazines but make your best offer and I'll at least take a look. I'm happy to take additional photographs if there is some particular part of the gun that you want a better look at, thanks for reading my ad.

I'd like to sell my HK P30 v3 configuration. The v3 config is no safety, a decocker, and DA/SA trigger. I have the original box and all factory accessories (grip panels, manual, etc) as well 3x15rd factory magazines and an SHTF v2 IWB holster. The pistol itself outfitted with Trudot night sights that I'd say are still pretty bright, and I also have the original sights if you'd rather have three-dot for whatever reason.

The gun has less than 500 rounds through it, cleaned and lubed after every single outing and no failures have ever been experienced with FMJ or hollowpoint ammunition. This has been my carry gun for just over a year up until now and so unfortunately there is a bit of holster wear on the top of the slide, the slide release lever, and the loaded chamber indicator. It's pretty minor holster wear as I hope can be seen in the pictures, but I knocked some bucks off on account of that.

Let me know if you'd like any more pictures of any part of the gun in particular, and thanks for reading my ad.

I am looking for a cash sale, but I will entertain trade offers for specifically:
