The 300 blackout ar15 can be made deer legal in Indiana since it is built on a pistol length gas system, so cutting this down and threading and changing stock will make a reliable, safe cycling deer legal pistol great for stalk hunting!!!

The gun was Duracoated, Frame is Magpul Flat Dark Earth, and the slide and barrel were done in Matte black. New +10% mag springs were installed in all 3 mags. It has a new extended slide stop also. I have the original parts, and can send more pics on request. I will throw in 50 rounds of Ranger ammo.

From Leupold:

The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard riflescopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. From the Mark 1™ to the Mark 4®, each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm’s Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee.

The CCP operates as a semi-auto because of its blowback system. Walther calls their design a delayed or “SoftCoil” (not re-coil) technology. This means of course that the pistol directs a portion of the gas pressure from an ignited cartridge through a tiny port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. A piston inside a cylinder under the barrel opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has subsided—after the bullet has left the barrel. At this point, the slide slams to its rear-most point, opens the breech, and ejects the empty cartridge case."

Has various German markings to include the eagle. 4 digit Serial number starting with 99 and a Y on the end. Holster marked 1944 and looks like CWX P 38. The holster has the correct over spill of stain on inside and white stitching as it should. I saw this exact holster sell for 285$ by itself 2 weeks ago on another site. Back to the gun...I would guess 95% of original finish remains. The series number matches on frame and various components. The mags are marked JVD and a little German army bird and swastika. Right side of slide has several army birds and what appears to be a tiny little ""88"". Also on left side of slide is a ""cyq"".

Good overall shape I'd say...but I'm not some kind of ww2 memorabilia genius either. I didn't fire but solid and I know modern guns enough to think it functions fine. 650$ call or text REDACTED or email REDACTED

Comes with:

-(2) 15-rd magazines
-Speed Reloader
-Barrel Brush
-Case

This pistol is in great shape with only slight rubs on the safety and slide release. It's a good functioning pistol and has about 500-750rds through it. It has a double/single action trigger with a short trigger reset and double strike capability, ambidextrous magazine release and safety/decock. Taurus also provides a lifetime warranty regardless of whether you are the original owner. I am only selling it because I am moving to California and Taurus does not make 10rd magazines for it. Looking for $350 but would consider a trade for a S&W Shield 9mm. Email me if you are interested.

Enhanced grip texture, Enhanced sight picture and Wilson Combat®’s legendary attention to detail add up to a unique new offering destined to be a top choice of working operators everywhere. The new bi-directional, X-Tac front strap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gun handling without the course, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments. The X-Tac proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat® 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture."

For Sale or Trade: Gen 3 Glock 21 fatty. In my opinion this is the best Glock 21 ever made. I love how thick and beefy the slide looks and feels compared to the SF Glocks. I performed very nice and clean custom stipple job. Not to crazy but adds excellent grip without snagging on clothes. I was aiming for something different than most other plain Jane stipple jobs out there to distinguish my Glock from the rest. Also performed a grip reduction and undercut trigger guard. Now This Glock rocks and fits like a glove in my hands. Had other large sized hand shooters try it out and they say it's very comfortable while eliminating that notorious Glock Knuckle. Also performed trigger job to take away the gritty feeling in the trigger. Inner components are smooth as glass, while retaining factory trigger weight. I had the factory Glock rep but all brand new OEM springs in the entire gun. Only 50 round through gun with new springs. Detailed stripped and cleaned after every range trip. I strictly only use FireClean gun lube on this and all my other firearms.

The bear measures 5 feet 5 inches from nose to back claws. The head on the bear is enormous! The bear rug was professionally done by a taxidermist and the quality is excellent. The rug has always been over our pool table and am now selling the pool table. The rug comes from a non-smoking home with no animals. I am asking $1,000 for the rug. Rugs online are going for $2,000 (see link below). Even if you were fortunate enough to harvest a bear and do all the work to get it to a taxidermist it would still cost over $1,000. Most taxidermist charge $200 a linear foot which alone puts the bear over $1,000. The bear rug looks great on the wall, in the den, on the pool table, on the floor or above the fireplace. I am a bit torn about selling it and in no hurry to do so and think I priced it fairly at $1,000 so please no low ball offers. This rug is an excellent addition to any Central Oregon home!

 I would also be interested in trading the bear for a nice firearm or a firearm + cash depending on the value. I am looking for a nice revolver and would prefer a Smith & Wesson .500 magnum. I would also be interested in a .44, .454, or .460. I may be interested in other guns just let me know what you have. Thanks.

The bear measures 5 feet 5 inches from nose to back claws. The head on the bear is enormous! The bear rug was professionally done by a taxidermist and the quality is excellent. The rug has always been over our pool table and am now selling the pool table. The rug comes from a non-smoking home with no animals. I am asking $850 for the rug. Rugs online are going for $2,000 (see link below). Even if you were fortunate enough to harvest a bear and do all the work to get it to a taxidermist it would still cost over $1,000. McLagan’s Taxidermy in Bend charges $200 a linear foot which alone puts the bear over $1,000. The bear rug looks great on the wall, in the den, on the pool table, on the floor or above the fireplace. I am a bit torn about selling it and in no hurry to do so and think I priced it fairly at $850 so please no low ball offers. This rug is an excellent addition to any Central Oregon home!

 I would also be interested in trading the bear for a nice firearm or a firearm + cash depending on the value. I am looking for a nice revolver and would prefer a Smith & Wesson .500 magnum. I would also be interested in a .44, .454, or .460. I may be interested in other guns just let me know what you have. Thanks.

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

On to the rifle. It is a coharie mp5 10mm clone I have 2 magazines with it and 60 rounds of pmc ammo. It cycles flawlessly and has a new trigger group in it that is pinned to semi auto only. It does has some wear on the finish here and there and the safety is a bit stiff but over all a very nice rifle to shoot. Right now it is set up for using subsonic ammo as it would need a high impulse locking piece to run very hot ammo.

Also can provide more photos upon request.
