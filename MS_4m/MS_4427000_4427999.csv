I will have all three with me on that day. 

The first is just your standard Mosin Nagant 91/30, but an especially nice specimen. This is a 1939 Tula, and is in a proper pre-war stock with the screwed-in sling escutcheons. This is a great shooter, and a keeper. Already cleaned of Cosmolene, and ready for your collection. If if you are going to own one round receiver Mosin Nagant, this one is to be considered. I am 200 firm on the Mosin. 

The second is a Winchester Model 12 built 1929. The more desirous 16 gauge. It is the 2 3/4 full choke. Great patina, and includes the authentic Winchester 5 round plug for the tubular magazine. I am absolutely hard knock on 400 for this shotgun, and not negotiable. Will include about a dozen rounds as well. I do not wish to sell this shotgun, but I would like a left hand flintlock more. 

Lastly is a gun you don't see every day. This little rifle is a Belgian Flobert Parlor Rifle. This does not fire the 22 short, it fires the 6mm Flobert, or 22 CB Cap ammunition. Likely built prior to 1900. This particular specimen was in a collection for many years, and had a rimfire scope soldered onto the gun. I had a gunsmith remove the scope mount, and now this is a great piece. The bore is worn but shiny, and this will be a great addition to any collection. Asking 250 for the rifle. 

Again, I will be at the Washington County (PA) Gun Show on Saturday, June 20. I am shopping and selling that day. Please do not hesitate to contact me at Seven24 Nine9One 88FiveThree. I text like a teenager.

Important - this pistol had a broken magazine safety that was preventing fire - I removed the mag safety (one flathead screw) so now the pistol functions like a Beretta or many other pistols in that it WILL fire a chambered round without magazine inserted.

Unlike the 1911SL, the Model 40 is not designed to manual load by manually sliding the barrel by hand. This was Winchester’s second attempt at a self-loader. They made approx. 12,000 of them only during the years 1940-1941. Winchester placed a recall on them and sent people who traded them in a brand new Model 12. Consequently, many were taken out of existence and destroyed leaving a limited number out there with people who chose not to trade them in. So, numbers are low and consequently, appreciated by Winchester collectors and the like. This Model 40 is in very nice condition and it has a Full Choke. Serial number #28_6 so it is a first year.

The markings are visible and the screw heads are sharp.  Type of Finish: Blue  Finish Originality: Original  Overall Condition: Overall, the pistol retains about 60% finish, with the BALANCE￼ turned patina. There is some very light beginning frosting to the frame. The revolver retains much blueing on the barrel, with only a small amount on the frame and recoil shield. The wear is consistent with age and handling of a pistol of this type and was not abused.  Bore Condition: Strong lands and grooves, with traces of pitting towards the muzzle, consistent with the powder and primers AVAILABLE￼ from this era.  Mechanics: This little break-top revolver is in functional condition, with a small amount of play in cylinder lockup. The gun does not have a bolt, so the cylinder is free when the trigger is not pulled and the hammer is down.  Box: No  Assessment: This is a common type of break-top pocket pistol of the late 19th / early 20th century, marketed under various TRADE￼ names. This pistol is functional, and in reasonably good condition for its vintage."

I have a like new Rem 700 AAC-SD with a Nightforce NXS F1 3.5-15x50. I've put exactly 60 rounds of 175 grain Federal Gold Metal Match and it shoots 1/2 to 3/4 MOA at 100 yards. Not much to be said about the scope; it's a like new Nightforce. The scope is mounted to a Nightforce 20MOA pic rail using NF Medium rings. I'm looking to sell both together but might consider splitting for the right price. This would be a great set to drop into a chassis or Manners stock.

The rifle will come with ~60 rounds of 175 grain Federal GMM and a harris 6-9'' swivel bipod and a stock pad with round holder and pocket.

I'm valuing the scope at ~$2,000 (with original packaging) and the rifle (with accessories) at ~$700

These prices are not super firm; I'm willing to hear offers that aren't obvious low balls. I know the rifle isn't all that nice but the scope is top notch.

Selling my cz 550 tacticool to fund a new 308 project. I hate to see it go. This rifle is insanely accurate and has one of the best triggers you will ever shoot.  If you don't know what a single set trigger is, look it up. I love long range shooting and take care of my stuff very well. This rifle was broke in the right way and is ready to shoot.  I have only shot 47 rounds through it, 40 for the break in process and 7 rounds to see what it could do.  Best 3 shot group (out of only 7 total) was just over 1/4 MOA at .28.. The 2nd was just over 1/2"".. Have more pix
I will include the leapold 30mm rings with it as well, but not scope and bipod. 
I love this rifle and only selling it to build another. So please don't lowball me or offer me trades.

427,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4427427,For Sale:  Voodoo tactical Tobago pack in ACU pattern,"Hyde park, Austin, Texas",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, June 14, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This Tobago Large Pack from Voodoo Tactical is a great piece of equipment that competes with the CamelBak BFM and similar packs that sell for more than $200. Honestly, we think this is a steal at this price. It has all sorts of clever accouterments and extra touches, such as Velcro covers for the hydration tube passage and tie down straps in the main compartment.
The pack itself is 20"" x 19"" (at the widest point) x 12"" with two large pockets on the back and two additional pocket on each side. If that isn't enough space, you can add to it using the many MOLLE PAL attachment points. It also features internal pockets, two radio pouches and room for two hydration bladders of three liters each (you can add more hydration carriers in the main compartment or externally, if you wish). The thickly padded adjustable shoulder and sternum straps can be removed to convert the pack to a carry-all by using the top and side nylon carry handles. Fully covered zippers with pulls, bottom bedroll loops and side compression straps to secure your load.
The pack is surprisingly comfortable under heavy loads, with body-contoured shoulder straps, a sternum strap with lumbar support and a waist belt. It has an aluminum and polymer internal frame to add structure and also has individual back panels to promote maximum air flow, keeping you cooler.
The Tobago Large Assault pack is as big or bigger than many three-day assult packs, but we think it holds enough to last most of us much longer in the field."

I bought it about a month before last year's modern arms deer season for $998.00 plus shipping. Mounted it on my 270 and went deer hunting in a blind once. Killed my deer one shot one kill at 452 yards with a Neck shot. Dropped that deer right in it's tracks. This scope made my 270 a killing machine. Lazer beam accuracy, true tracking, illuminated reticle with brightness adjust. Other than that one deer hunt and about 50 rounds of range shooting thats all I have used this scope for. I hate to sell it but I am in need of immediate funds.

It has a lens shroud that came with it. I never used it. you can have it, if you buy the scope of course. I also still have the original box it came in.

It is a First Focal Plane scope. 

Optional Purchase. I bought these Vortex Precision Matched rings (PMR-30-87) for $105 (at the time I bought them) on Optics planet (now they go for $129). I put them on the gun and then realised they are the High rings and thus when I get check weld im not looking thorugh the scope but through the bottom of it. If you got a big head then they will work great for you. not so for my small head. They came right off the gun then and there, no field use at all. You can have them for an additonal $50 if you want. Not required for sale though.

Price is Negotiable. I have to have $500 minimum cash + something of $300 value. The ""Somethings"" that I am interested in are things like shotguns, pistols, self propelled lawn mower (has to run), lots of ammo for 45, 270, 17hmr, holographic sight's and abu garcia/okuma/penn/daiwa/avet conventional reels. 

I'm not pulling it off the gun until I have a sale since it is dialed in perfectly right now. please only text me for sale if you got cash in hand and are ready to buy.  

Four 0 Five Four 1 7 Zero one six five .Text Only, No Calls. If this posting is up then it has not been sold. I will take the post down after the sale.

PS - I gurantee there is nothing wrong with this scope and need I mention that Vortex honors all lifetime warranties on thier scopes, regardless of who bought them."

This Axis 270 has a standard trigger that was upgraded to a safe, crisp 3.5lb pull with zero creep.  Includes the Weaver 3-9 Kaspa scope that comes with some Axis packages like this one.  The entire gun is in the standard black matte finish set into the black synthetic stock.

The scope mounts were also upgraded with better Weaver extended scope base mounts.  These are needed for setting the scope back a bit (where it's usable at a comfortable position), OR for mounting scopes with less tube length than a long action allows (many more scope options are now available).  The base mounts were bedded correctly (and therefore, cleanly).  It shoots very nicely, easily MOA (like all Savages) and is very comfortable on the eye now (with any scope).

If you bought a new one, it would look just like this rifle looks-- it's as clean as ""used"" gets.  Less than 15 rounds through it since bought new last year.  Had another scope on it but the factory Weaver is back on and bore sighted (just as it would be new from the factory).

Asking $340 OBO.  I would also sell the rifle only (without the scope), for $300 OBO (and scope rings and bedded mounts come with for that price so about ANY scope you want to use will fit right).

Sincere buyers send name, location, and phone here (vie email) for reply in kind.  More pics available too.  Meet-up in NE Kansas possible on weekend or nearby Emporia, KS about any day.  Pics sent on request.  WILL TRADE for a better, full sized 9mm or 10mm pistol with extra cash on top (Glock, Springfield, better makes please)."

The 24 inch light weight barrel is chambered in 33 WCF caliber, the bore is as new with sharp, mirror bright rifling and no pitting or frosting. I rate the bore a solid 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. The barrel retains 90%+ blueing with light carry wear as seen in th photos. It has the correct Winchester 24F rear sight and a Lyman #4 Ivory bead front sight. The receiver is mechanically excellent, feeds, chambers and ejects smoothly. It has that fine old Winchester ""smooth as glass"" feel when you cycle the bolt and locks up tight and solid. The take down mechanism is tight and snug with absolutely no wobble or wear evident. The stock and forearm are nicely grained black walnut, both are tight and free of extra holes, chips or bad dents. There are light hunting and use marks but nothing I would rate as significant. The hard rubber buttplate is intact and free of chips and dents. This is a fine vintage 1886 Winchester that has seen light use but has been very well cared for. It will be a fine addition for your collection and an excellent choice for any game you'll find nORTH America. The 33 WCF has a muzzle velocity of 2,450 fps with a 200 grain bullet. The 348 Winchester's muzzle velocity is 2,530 fps - only 80 fps difference! If your're not 100% delighted with this 86 return it for a full refund! I'll provide any additional photos you'd like to see, just let me know the specific views you want."

These are a bit rare, Intratec no longer exists to manufacture firearms. This is currently not in working condition. Magazine is a bit damaged to feed correctly, but other similar .22LR mags can work as well, I'v seen it. I have gotten this one to fire single shot jam style once I got a round chambered, But then it started light striking the .22 brass it wouldn't fire then either! I know there are companies online that manufacture after-market parts for Intratec firearms that can be easily ordered, or even original parts online as well. This would be a good collector, or fixing project for gunsmiths and enthusiasts. I don't like to deal with fixing guns anymore. It's too dangerous and stressful for me right now. I know these are rare, interesting pistols so I am asking $150, or open to trades offers, Message or contact to talk or meet anytime-
