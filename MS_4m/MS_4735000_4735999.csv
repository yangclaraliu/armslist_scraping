From the frame slide sear assembly mainspring housing all retaining pins levers etc. Very little wear internally surprisingly. I believe this piece to be an early or pre war manufactured pistol. Ive had alot of compliments and nice offers from a lot of 1911 shooters. This pistol is very similar to the model 1911. Anyhow i digress....

This is a Model 50 "".38 Chief's Special Target"". Similar to the famous Model 36 Chief's Special but made with target sights. This revolver is built on the square butt J-frame with three screws, chambers the .38 Special, and has a five-shot cylinder. It wears a 2-inch barrel with tall serrated ramp front sight and fully adjustable rear sight. Overall condition is excellent. The original bright blue finish rates about 98% with a few handling marks, a couple of tiny blemishes on the bottom of the trigger guard, a small ding to the left edge of the front sight, and the usual cylinder turn line. The hammer and trigger both show bright case colors. The factory Magna stocks are in excellent condition, free of cracks or chips, and a serial numbered to match the revolver. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and lock-up. The bore is likewise excellent with sharp, bright rifling. It comes in the original box which numbers to the gun and includes the cleaning kit and warranty card.
Produced between 1955-1975, total production is believed to be 2136 guns counting all the different variations. This revolver belongs to a group that were shipped in 1973. Most of the Chief's Special Target revolvers were actually marked ""MOD.36"" (or unmarked) in the crane recess while those marked ""MOD.50"" (like this example) are more scarce. A nice find for the S&W collector!

I got this unit from my work. It has been sitting in one of our utility rooms for about 3 years. It's in very good condition and it looks like its barely been used. This scrubber also comes with a pull behind squeege(not pictured) The only problem is the key. We can't find the key yet and I really don't want to pull the ignition out and hot wire it just to make sure it works. I'm very hesitant about doing that because I don't want to cause damage to the scrubber. These scrubbers are over 7 or 8 grand to buy and used ones are about half of that. I'm interested in trading this for some nice handguns, rifles, or shotguns. I'm also interested in nice electronics like iPads, iPhone, iPods and nice tablets and nice smartphones. I will also accept cash or partial cash and guns. Like I said if someone is very interested and comes to meet me we can either wire it up to reassure the buyer that it indeed does work, or make a deal on it just as it sits.

You may not be able to buy a true Colt M4 anymore. This is an early run before Colt partnered up with FN to make the new M4's moving forward. This M4 may have been produced just as the switch was made to the 2013 configuration as it has the MaTech BUIS rear iron sight unlike all others Ive seen and NO magpul furniture. Has the original unopened accessory package that does have one 30rd P mag.

If Colt and FN only make only what they are contracted to produce for the Govt, there may not be any overruns for civilians. Colt is struggling to stay in business. When a company is scraping by, costs have to be cut, this is done through mainly two channels, labor or materials. This translates to figuring out how to make cheaper and cheaper guns but keep the price the same. For my money I dont want a gun that is being made cheaper than it was a year ago.

This model was once very plentiful online and at auction, it has become very hard to find, even the Colt website says its unavailable.

Ruger 22 semi-automatic pistols, from the Standard and MK I to the MK II and MK III models, have become the most widely used 22 pistols ever produced. They are cherished for plinking, small game hunting, both informal and formal target shooting, and they have even seen use by the US Military. The MK III utilizes Ruger's proven internal cylindrical bolt and fixed barrel design, that provides a higher accuracy potential over designs with sights mounted on a cycling slide by ensuring the pistol's sights stay in permanent alignment. The MK III Standard comes with a drift adjustable rear sight that's dovetailed solidly onto the receiver, and a Patridge-style front sight that's pinned onto the banded sight ramp; the sights are easy to see and allow for precise shooting. The weight of the pistol's steel frame and the angle of the grip allows the shooter to point the pistol naturally and acquire the sights quickly. Checkered grip panels provide a solid non-slip hold on the pistol in any environment. The MK III has several safety features, making it an extremely safe 22 pistol. A loaded chamber indicator on the side of the receiver indicates when the chamber is loaded by sight or touch. A manual thumb safety locks the sear, while allowing the pistol to be loaded and unloaded when engaged. A magazine disconnect prevents the pistol from firing once the magazine is removed. And, an internal key lock renders the pistol totally inoperable. The Ruger MK III Standard Semi-Auto Rimfire Pistol is a rugged and reliable firearm that gives a lifetime of service. Comes with two 10-round magazines. Made in USA.   Call or text REDACTED"

Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finish is super-hard black Melonite®. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual.

change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

I've added a Hi-Viz front sight to the pistol as well as a Walther branded under-barrel laser sight, but I do have the original sight if you wanted to bring it back to stock. 

Includes cable lock, three 10rd magazines. A KleenBore .22 caliber handgun cleaning kit. 6 dummy rounds. Walther under-barrel Laser Sight. Hi-Viz sight kit. Also included is the original Walther case as well as an additional plastic carrying case for easy range transport.

The gun is somewhat picky on ammo, it likes the good stuff. So I'm also throwing in 900 rounds of 22LR CCI Mini-Mag ammo. (copper plated, round nose, 40 grain, 1235 FPS) and around 200 rounds of some cheap Federal .22LR ammo.

Everything here will be sold as a bundle, no picking and choosing items. Ammo goes to firearm purchaser.
