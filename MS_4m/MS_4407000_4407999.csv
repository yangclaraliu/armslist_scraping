I have a brand new CZ2008 7.62x39 that I bought to be a deer lease and ranch gun and never took the sticker off the trigger guard. Never fired it.

It will come with the original packaging, cleaning kit, 3 mags (will not work with AK mags), and sling.

Just google CZ2008 and you will find a lot of info and youtube videos on it. Milled receiver with American made barrel. Stock is folding and it has 2 very sturdy sling attachment points. Would make a good plinking gun or ranch gun (which was my intention for it). Just decided to go another route.

I also have 160 rounds of ammo. 100 rounds brass, 60 rounds of steel.

Asking 600 OBO. Must be legally able to purchase a firearm in Texas. Will ask to see valid ID and I do prefer a firearms BOS just for peace of mind. Can meet in Plano area.

It was manufactured in the United States in 1997 for the Maryland State Police. It has Trijicon night sights from 1997. The white rings around the tritium vials make excellent 3-dot sights for daylight shooting, but the vials are very dim. Trijicon will install new vials in the sights for a nominal fee. (Visit https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/support/faq_BNTNS.php for more information.) Markings are clear and crisp. The bore is mirror bright with sharp lands & grooves. As with most police trade-ins, it shows signs of carry but few signs of being shot much. See the accompanying picture for condition. Additional high resolution pictures are available on request. The pistol comes with 2 correct factory 11 round magazines marked ""RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY"" and ""PB CAL.40 S&W - MADE IN ITALY"".  In case you are unfamiliar with Beretta D-type pistols, this 96D is a double action only (DAO) pistol with no manual safety. For this reason, some enthusiasts call them ""slick slides"".

The Range Officer® Compact brings the precision of a competition pistol in a small and straightforward configuration.

The Range Officer® Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the Trophy Match™ and TRP™ 1911s. It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too. Add in the same match grade steel barrel, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The Range Officer® Compact is topped with a fiber optic front sight and a low profile combat rear sight, so you have maximum visibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches"

With fixed sights and a custom Single Action/Double Action trigger for improved accuracy and speed, the 65 and 82 are the perfect partners for whatever trouble lurks around the corner. For even more firepower, the Model 66 steps up to the plate with an impressive 7 rounds of .357 Magnum. 

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

   7 Rd Cylinder Feature
Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest. 

   Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

This gun was purchased originally by a gun collector.  He recently liquidated his collection and this was sold as a new unfired firearm.  I sent it back to Kimber and they replaced the Meprolight night sights under warranty.  This firearm was manufactured in 2008 and they were only produced for 2 years.  Production ceased in January 2010 and this became a very controversial gun and lead to an investigation by the FBI.  

Meeting excessive expectations. In 2002, LAPD™ SWAT selected a Kimber 1911 .45
ACP as their duty pistol. In 2005, SWAT Team members put SIS Detectives in contact with
Kimber, and the Detectives requested that Kimber create a duty pistol that met their
high standards. Things worked out.

Features:
• All SIS models have 30 lines-per-inch
frontstrap checkering with bordered base.
• All SIS models have Kimber Service Melt™ treatment for rounded and blended edges.
• SIS Custom and SIS RL models have a standard (military length) guide rod.
• SIS Ultra has a rounded frame and mainspring housing.

SIS pistols have specialized features including SIS slide serrations and
light weight SIS Hammer™. SIS Night Sights™ have a cocking shoulder
that allows the slide to be cocked or released with one hand if necessary.

All SIS pistols have flat top slides, along with a premium gray KimPro
II finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to the elements,
salt and moisture.

A beavertail grip safety with pronounced bump and memory
groves, serrated mainspring housing, ambidextrous thumb
safety and special partially-stippled Kimber logo grips are standard.
A solid match grade trigger is tuned to break at 4-5 pounds.

These slide get wear marks on contact points to the frame no matter what precautions you take. The barrel bore was cleaned after every use. I use hoppes and KG oil and clean .22 with bore paste to polish the bore so it is easier to clean after next use and it is. There is no visible marks when slide is assembled except for the adjustment screw on the sight. Observe pictures.  Has some wear marks where it touches the frame. Fits all .45 acp pistols with 4 or 5 inch barrels. And with single stack magazines. Any mil-spec gun will work. I ran it on a kimber pro carry 2 4"" and a full size Springfield. Likes Winchester white box, cci mini mag, and federal. OOh magazines the follows have been sanded down to fit 15 rds so they are not 10 rounds. They function perfectly but just thought i throw that out there.
