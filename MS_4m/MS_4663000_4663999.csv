It will fit Gen4 and Gen3 mini-Glocks (G26,G27,G33).  

Manufacturer's description:

 The Glock is a wonderful gun...we all know that. But some of the parts should be changed to improve performance. This part is more than 50% heavier than the factory plastic part which will help you shoot the gun faster and more accurately because it reduces recoil and muzzle flip. 

 Factory Plastic Dual Spring = 14.78 grams 
 Stainless Steel Dual Spring = 27.28 grams 

Our Dual Spring stainless steel guide rod replaces the factory plastic part and improves cycling by allowing less torque on the part. It also helps reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip because it is 50% heavier than the factory plastic part. 

 It comes with a factory weight spring set: 

 G26/27/33 use 16lb spring weight 


 It drops in easily without any gunsmithing required. The Factory Weight spring is included and captured on the guide rod and should not be removed. The Dual Spring Guide Rod assembly is used in the Mini Glock handguns."

I picked this up off an AK collecter that was moving and needed extra funds. This is a standard Legion/Arsenal marked SGL21, but with a tasteful addition.

The rifle was sent to a reputable AK builder in Vegas to get the Bulgarian triangle folder treatment. They Installed a 4.5mm Bulgy trunnion and folding stock; everything looks stupendous. Just like the factory SLRs. Also included is the GRIP REINFORCEMENT PLATE which is VERY hard to come by and almost a necessity for folding SGLs. Look up Jim Fuller of Rifle Dynamics. Great work on AKs.

Barrel is clean, no pitting or rough spots. None of the furniture is canted, but there are some very light ""handling"" marks that you really have to look for. With my experience of AKs and specifically Saiga rifles, it looks like it had a max of 200 rounds fired through it. I'm looking at the bolt, hammer, rail paint wear, and carbon on the piston head (barely any). 

I know this thing's value, and how much they go for on the forums so please, no stupid offers. You won't hear a reply from me.

That includes the imbeciles that can't fathom an AK being too expensive for their trailer park operating.

The gun does have a poly-choke that according to Cabela's takes value away, but this was a hunting gun for me years ago.

this rifle will shoot inside a 4"" target all say,the barrel is a medium heavy,the action is the slick  Lee-Enfield mk4 action and it  is quite strong enough to allow the .45-70 to be loaded to its full potential, well beyond what would be safe in the weak Trapdoor Springfield rifle. The SAAMI pressure standard for the .303 is 45,000 PSI, that for the .45-70 (as used in the Trapdoor) is 28,000 PSI.  The extra strength of the Enfield means that bullets of 300-350 grains can safely be pushed a bit beyond 2000 FPS, at which point the .45-70 easily matches the .450 Marlin. Thus loaded the .45-70 is suitable for animals such as grizzly bears and bison.

This custom AR15 pistol build only has a couple of hundred rounds through it. Its a lot of fun! I built it because I wanted to try out the AR15 pistol platform. Shoots great, but now on to my next adventure... 300 BLK SBR.

- 10.5"" 223 Wylde with a 1:7 twist rate parkerized free float barrel w/ M4 feed ramps

It is an older Ar-15, i believe ban era due to the chopped bayonet lug, and permanently attached flash hider.  I fell in love with this rifle for its 20"" heavy barrel and A2 sights. Great for high power events. Also seems like thicker receivers and large hole take down pins. Very accurate, very reliable, no hiccups, this thing runs like a clock. I know I know Hesse, i did do the research about Hesse too so i don't know. Some markings on the guns are interesting like ""CM"" on upper receiver. c m/p 1/9 twist.

This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided.

The Ultra Light sports a featherweight alloy receiver, shortened magazine tube and a unique raised target rib made from the same super light, super strong carbon fiber employed in Formula 1 racecars. However this new Benelli is no lightweight when it comes to standing up to punishment. Chambered to shoot anything from field loads to 3 magnums, the Ultra Light features a two-lug rotating bolt head that locks up steel-to-steel inside the barrel. Powered by Benelli’s tried and proven Inertia Driven bolt system the Ultra Light will hold up year after year through thousands of rounds without missing a beat, but that’s not all.

Whether you’re slugging it out in wet New England grouse cover or a scorching hot dove field south of the border, you won’t have to worry about the Ultra Light’s beautiful walnut stock. Both the stock and fore-end are sealed with a five-step process called WeatherCoat. This new coating makes it impervious to any kind of weather and as a bonus, this special stock finishing process also enhances the fancy figure of the wood. No matter if you’re in those long pheasant fields in South Dakota or after scaled quail running through the cactus, if your average hunting day is measured in miles.

 Here is a very hard to find Ruger New Model Single Six in the desireable  32 H&R mag caliber.

6 1/2"" barrel.

 I believe this gun was produced in 1989, as best as I can research, it is long out of production, however.

 Spiffy little trail gun or small game getter. Timing & lockup are good.

 Definate turn ring and some muzzle/backstrap/and sharp edge bluing wear. I'd say about 92/95 % bluing left. No scratches and certainly no rust.

 Grips are good with no cracks or ships, there is a 1/4 "" shallow scratch on the left grip.

 Adjustable click sights.

 Shoots well (its fun to shoot!)

 Also included are 54 rounds of fresh Federal hollow points.

Reduced to $375.00 FTF American cash. Will meet at Bristow/Sapulpa/Sand Springs/Glenpool Wal Marts or Tulsa Hills Sams.

 Will meet at the Clown Burgers on the Turner Turnpike for you OKC folks.
