I am listing this for the holiday weekend only at my bottom dollar price of $700.

I have a Sig M11-A1. The ""new 228"".. Ok it may not exactly be a P228 but it's still a great gun. Has night sights, short reset trigger  (which is awasome), and corrosion resistant internals. Less than 500 rounds fired. Comes with 3 mags. I also have a crossbreed inside the waistband holster. The only reason I'm selling it is to fund another project. 

I might consider trades plus cash for U.S. made 1911's, Browning Hi Powers or Hi Power clones, CZ's ( no polymer frames), or maybe even a small carry 9mm. Any questions let me know what you have. The worst I can say is no thank you. 
I'm asking $700 (THROUGH THIS WEEKEND ONLY) for the gun and holster. The best way to reach me is the e-mail I provided through armslist. Or you can text me at (Six one five) 579-8575"

The Sheridan Blue Streak 5mm is still considered one of the best, rugged, hard hitting pellet guns around and has a loyal following. I acquired this pellet gun circa 1976 when in college and used it to cleanly bag a considerable number of rabbits, squirrels, and even game birds, some on the fly for my meals as a poor college student. It has only been used a few times since college to train newbies to shooting. It is still in excellent condition. It is very point and shoot and very accurate; you can shoot groups that a quarter can cover at 20 yards; the trigger is very light. All the seals are original and still in great shape.

The blue on the gun is 90-95 percent with no scratches. The top tube has very slight glueing wear where the tub hood slide over it. The stock has some dings in it consistent with its age, but the finish still looks great; I tried to capture that in the photos. There is some where under the lever handle where the lever contacts the air chamber. While I hadn't shot it in a coue decades or more,  the gun has been kept lubricated. It has never been disassembled. The mechanics appear to be perfect and I attribute that to how robust the gun is made.

The scope is missing the caps to elevation/windage adjustments, but otherwise is in good shape. The mounts are made for the gun, they were called B- Square mounts if memory serves.

I shot it several times before listing it and it is still accurate, hitting dead on at 35yrd with Beeman Silver Jets and it Zipped through both sides of a heavy gage soup can with 10 pumps, barely moving the can. When I used to use it for small game, I used to use between 10-15 pumps. I tested it with 15 with no issues.

I picked this rifle up from a very reputable collector/restoration hobbyist so I can tell you that beyond any doubt, this rifle is period correct down to the springs. The seller broke this rifle down part by part to show me each proof mark to prove to me that she's all correct by the book so after seeing me the parts and book laid out in front of me, I can say this beauty is a piece of art. 

The cool part about this rifle is that it has an original 1909 barrel on it that is correct for the receiver and this rifle is a former USMC rifle. The reason I can tell you that is that the receiver has the ""Hatcher Hole"" which was a USMC trademark.

Spine Matched Grouped Together Technology
We employ Grouped Together Technology to spine match each dozen arrows. This ensures precise consistency.
• Spine Deviation ±.010 Across Dozen
Shaft Straightness
We guarantee at the specified straightness or straighter. Unlike other companies in the industry, who measure a 28"" section, we measure the full length of the shaft
• .001"" Straightness Tolerances for longer shot accuracy
400 spine
Weight Sorted
We weigh and group all our shafts to ensure the perfect match. On our premium shafts we only allow for weight tolerances +/- 1 grain across the dozen, neither should you.
• ± 1 Grain Weight Tolerance
Carnivore flectched arrows will come with:
Length (Carbon to Carbon) 32""
Black Bohning double-lock nock-8 Grains
Carnivore Inserts - 14 Grains

It is a small polymer framed, striker fired, 8 rd single stack 9mm to make it easily concealable in light clothing.  But what makes it special is Walther's new soft-coil technology which makes the slide very easy to pull back.  They explain it much better on their website but the short version is there is a gas piston inside the pistol that uses the gases from fired rounds to soften the recoil.  They claim it reduces recoil and muzzle flip by one third when compared to similar guns.  If you want to read more about it here is their website page for it.  http://www.waltherarms.com/ccp/

Product Description

Be the envy of your shooting friends with the GSG 522 SD. This GSG MP5 22lr rifle has it all...the looks, accuracy, price and cool accessories. If you're looking for a great shooting tactical 22 rifle that doesn't look like an AR15, the GSG 522 is one of the best options for you. 

You can easily add on some of the fun GSG 522 accessories like a retractable stock, a nice BSA Red Dot or a 110 round drum magazine.

The 522 SD has a sling loop built into the left side of the standard stock and one on the trigger guard. The SD does not have a front sling loop like the 522 carbine does.

All versions of the GSG 522 has a tactical rail up top that allows you to easily mount red dots, reflex red dots or any size scope you'd like to put up there. The rail is built in so there is no added parts to buy.

The GSG 522 SD features a rubber ribbed hand guard and larger ""SD"" barrel shroud. The GSG 522 carbine features a more rigid plastic hand guard and smaller barrel shroud. You can easily remove the front hand guard for cleaning or to put on an after market front hand guard."

This is an early WWII production Thompson M1 (A1 overstamp, rare) SMG Kit. 90% matching/complete.

This is a rare find and quite the conversation piece. Only to increase in value.

-*Disclaimer*-This is a demilled parts kit and is not functional as it is. This kit is fully legal to own and build as a non functional display piece. All NFA rules/Laws are to be followed.

The receiver sections that are there are extremely rare due to their size. Most commonly these are cut into 1"" sections. There is however a 1.5"" piece missing from the middle. Typical of bring back guns being demilled when the 1987 ban went into effect.  Have seen sections such as these 2 pieces sell for $1000 by themselves.

The bolt is a rare type that I can only find described as the ""lightning bolt"". Basically it's has slots milled out of it to reduce surface area and drag and also make the bolt itself lighter increasing the cyclic rate. It is in extremely good condition. 

The lower shows little abuse but honest wear. The stock is missing the hardware other than the sling swivel. Complete lowers with internals minus stocks sell for over $500.

There are 2 spare bolts, these can be used as paper weights or I can keep them and reduce the asking price. They are also collectable and will increase in value.

There is also several extra receiver pieces. *These are not to be used to assemble this kit into a functional state. The missing section from the kit can be taken from the receiver section that has been bead blasted. This piece is not to be welded into place but can freely fill in the gap. *The receiver must remain cut into 3 pieces.  If you do not wish to have these I would reduce asking price and keep them.

Though missing some small pieces this kit is very collectable and valuble. It will only increase in value. I'm sad to put it up for sale but I have other things I need to take care of and want it to go to a good home.

$3400 Or Best Offer.

So, I figure $35 is fair for a box of the latest greatest super watermelon-exploding/ zombie killing ammo!  Trade  for two boxes of FMJ target ammo because I'm boring like that, which is to say Ima let you take care of the zombies, 'kay?"

It is in excellent shape as I hope you can see from the pictures. Comes with two mags and an extra pinky ext. for the mag without one. The magazine holds seven rounds and you can have another round in the chamber. The box and papers are also included. I doubt it was fired more than 100 rounds and the bulk of those were Remington FMJs. This is a pretty accurate pistol. I had one of these and sold it to a member on here. Wanted it back but he lives just this side of the edge of the earth. So what did I do? Why I went out and bought another and the recoil spring on this one is just as tough.   One thing I should have put in here and did not is that if you buy it you'll need either a permit to purchase or a permit to carry and an NCDL.

It is full tang which is shown by the two dowel pins showing on the handle. The tip of the blade is slightly bent, but came from the factory like that, I however straightened it out for the most part. The blade is made of 1060 carbon steel.This would make a great intermediate or beginner sword, and cones at a great price. I bought this sword as a display (but is fully functional) and spent almost $100 on it. I'd let it go for around $65, or $75 trade value. I will throw in the free display stand which cstted me another $15. I have cleaned the blade often and it has been very well maintained.
