51,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4640051,For Trade:  S&W 59 for 39,"Vestavia, Birmingham, Alabama",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, August 27, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a S&W model 59 1st generation 9mm automatic. I like it but the grip is a little too thick for my hands. I'd like to offer it to anyone with a model 39 who might prefer the same gun with a higher capacity magazine. They are essentially the same gun, and the slides are in fact interchangeable. The only difference is that the 59 uses a staggered, double-column magazine rather than a single-stack, and therefore has a much thicker frame.

The Model 59 holds the distinction of being the first true ""Wondernine,"" a 9mm pistol combining a double-action trigger with a double-stack magazine, beating the Beretta 92 and CZ-75 by five years.

The 59 will come with three 14 round magazines, and four pairs of grips: a Pachmayr wraparound, a pair of thin Uncle Mike's rubbers, a pair of very pretty Thai made custom cocobolo grips that emulate the look of the factory wood grips on the 39, and best of all a pair of gorgeous black water buffalo horn grips made by Eagle. These are the ones its wearing in the picture, though the picture doesn't quite do them justice; they basically look like black pearl. (Apparently, these retailed for $200 when originally offered, though I acquired for much much cheaper.) Unfortunately, the only grips that make the handle thin enough for me to hold comfortably are the bland but comfortable Uncle Mikes. Hopefully someone out there has some real mitts on him.

The 59 is in ""shooter"" condition at best (a little worse than the picture shows), so I'm not looking to trade for a showpiece. If the condition of your trade is nicer than mine, I'll throw in an original Jackass shoulder holster (the awkward birth name, understandably changed, of the company that later became Galco). This is the holster Don Johnson carried his Bren Ten in on Miami Vice."

I'm not very picky I would prefer a 870 mossy 500 or a Maverick 88. But I'll take anything if the price is right. The shotgun must have screw in chokes or a fixed modified barrel and it must come with a plug. I will obviously pay more for a 870 then a Maverick 88 but I'm not try to pay more then 200. Please let me know what you have and what your trying to get. Let's see if we can make a deal.

And just when you thought Sig Sauer couldn't top the 1911 Scorpion, they release the Carry version, the “Big Boy” Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation!  It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry and with a Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)!

It remains un-fired.  And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once!  It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A James Bond style removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, 45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi.  You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on your Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dustcover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight, that emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight thus enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single shot and no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition.  This give the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario!  Now that is the winning advantage that I want for my self and all of the other “good guys” that keep our country safe! 

This Vokul detachable 532nm Tactical Green Dot Laser Sight includes：Green Laser sight ×1,Metal 22mm Picatinny Rail Mount, Switch button Pressure Pad Switch and “8”type mount, Allen Wrench and a 3V CR123A Lithium Battery

And just when you thought Sig Sauer couldn't top the 1911 Scorpion, they release the Carry version, the “Big Boy” Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation!  It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry and with a Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)!

It remains un-fired.  And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once!  It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A James Bond style removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, 45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi.  You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on your Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dustcover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight.  It emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight, thus enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single tap/shot with no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition.  This gives the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario!  Now that’s the winning advantage that I want for myself and I want it for all of my brother Marines, other military, spooks, law enforcement and all of the other “good guys” that stand up each day, keeping our country safe!  Special Ops has it And So Should You!

This Vokul detachable 532nm Tactical Green Dot Laser Sight includes：Green Laser sight ×1,Metal 22mm Picatinny Rail Mount, Switch button Pressure Pad Switch and “8”type mount, Allen Wrench and a 3V CR123A Lithium Battery

lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

It was first used in later stages of the Philippine-American War, and was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam era !
 but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.

I have shot this a bunch, such an accurate rifle. Takes 5-round stripper clips, two of them, to deposit 10 rounds into the magazine. The stock is not in amazing condition, it is a military surplus rifle. The top piece of wood (near the rear sight), is cracked and missing a piece. The main stock is rough, but could be refinished if you so choose. There is a dent above the left side near the trigger. The rifle still has the unit markings on the butt, pretty neat. The bore is great, I have kept it oiled and have not shot corrosive ammo through it.

The gun will come with 4 boxes of surplus ammo (15 rounds per box). This, I believe, is corrosive ammo. I think the ammo is Turkish, it has cyrillic writing on it.

The length of the eye piece that swings up is 3”. The markings on the end of the gun barrel, at the top, near the hammer says: “Markings: ""F. Wesson's Patent, Oct. 25, 1859 & Nov. 11 1862, Worcester, Mass."" There is a number stamped on the bottom which is hard to read but it is four digit and what I can make from it, the number 4006. The hammer pulls back, the barrel open and the triggers work. Other than that, I am not sure if the gun fires and I do not know when the gun was fired last. The buffalo rifle has been in our family for a very long time and is from Massachusetts originally. History of Frank Wesson's Guns include information gathered that Frank Wesson rifles were a series of single-shot rifles manufactured between 1859 and 1888 in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were purchased by many state governments during the American Civil War, including Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio. They were one of the first rifles to use rimfire metallic cartridges. The rifles were initially made in .22, .32, .38, and .44 rimfire. Centerfire cartridges were added later, and some rifles were capable of firing rimfire or centerfire cartridges, by altering an adjustment on the hammer.

The barrel is fully free floated 26"" medium contour with 1:7.7"" right hand twist which is also threaded for muzzle devices. I have a Vortex Viper PST FFP (first focal plane) 6-24x50 with the ebr-1 mrad reticle illuminated. Scope has tactical turrets with .1 mil adjustments, side focus, and is mounted with seekins Precision matched rings. On the scope I have a vortex bubble level and vortex switchview throw lever for quick and easy zoom adjustments (there is also a bubble level mounted on the rail just underneath the scope). The bipod is an Atlas PSR bipod by B&T Industries. It is adjustable from 4.75 - 9 inches, has 15 degrees of pan and cant, and attaches via 170-S quick detach lever. Rifle will also come with two 10 round and two 20 round pmags, factory box for rifle and scope and all other accessories. I also have a case (200 rounds) of hornady 95 grain sst ammo that I may include for the right price/deal.


I did a barrel break in on this gun and zeroed it at 100 yards. All together it has had 160 rounds put through it. I have shot it out to 333 yards and grouped 3 shots just over an inch at that distance. At 100 yards it easily puts 3 shots in one ragged hole if you do your part (.19 inch is my personal best). 


Gun is used but in perfect condition. These are nearly impossible to find right now. I will sale as complete package or seperate. Package price is $3,000 but I'm open to offers also... cash speaks.

The Vortex rangefinder Ranger 1000 6x22 (vor-rrf-101) is developed to excel in all ranging conditions. All lens surfaces are fully multi-coated for optimum light transmission and bright, sharp Images make it easy to acquire subjects you want to range. Compact and lightweight, the ergonomic design of the Vortex rangefinder is complimented by a rugged, adjustable/removable utility clip for easy carry. Included lanyard offers an additional method to keep the unit close at hand. The menu is quick and easy to use and features a low battery Indicator light - all powered by a commonly available CR2 battery. Primary hcd (horizontal component distance) mode displays an angle-compensated distance reading. Distance measurements can be displayed in either yards or meters. Ideal for gun hunters, target shooters and hunters, the Vortex Ranger 1000 rangefinder is sure to be a hit - and ensure hits. With accuracy to 1,000 yards, the Vortex rangefinder features three ranging modes that are quickly accessed using an uncomplicated, common-sense menu. Horizontal component distance (hcd) mode displays the slope angle compensated distance to the target.This is the primary mode used by most bow and rifle hunters. Scan mode displays distance readings when panning across a landscape or tracking a moving animal. Line of sight (Los) mode displays actual line of sight range.This mode will be used by shooters making high angle/long distance shots in conjunction with slope angle corrected ballistic cell phone applications, ballistics range cards, or pdas with ballistics programs. Display also shows an incline Correction number (Inc) to adjust bullet drop data for ballistics applications not including slope angle Correction."

Selected for the M4 and Mk18 carbines by US Special Operations Command after placing first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted, it also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding.Compact and lightweight, the SOCOM556-RC suppressor adds only 4 inches (approximately) to the overall length of your rifle. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-RC produces minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.The SOCOM556-RC features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire's patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a current-model SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous versions, and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.The SOCOM556-RC is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page.SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.FeaturesPatented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds New design provides superior sound attenuation, virtual elimination of first-round muzzle flash, and decreased dust signature Minimal and consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach/detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimal impact on weapon handling characteristics Internal blast shield increases durability Advanced core design reduces back pressure, suppressed cyclic rate, and gas blowback Constructed from advanced high-temperature US mill-certified alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color"

MODEL 338BA SUPPRESSOR Thunder Beast Arms Corp. MODEL 338BA SUPPRESSORODEL 338BA SUPPRESSORBrake-attach .338 caliber suppressorThe 338BA is our high-performance .338 caliber suppressor design for applications where the rifle will be shot with and without the suppressor and recoil reduction is required in both cases. The 338BA effectively suppresses the extreme muzzle blast of the .338 magnums down to levels similar to suppressed .308. The 338BA brake is left attached to the rifle at all times, and reduces recoil when the suppressor is not used. When the 338BA suppressor is mounted to the brake, the rifle's ""suppressed zero"" returns and the mount design ensures accuracy.We developed the 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 338BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 338BA, like the 338P-1, has additional volume to handle the gas pressure of the .338 Lapua Magnum, but only weighs fractionally more than a .308 suppressor.The 338BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and method of construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. Our suppressors are designed from the ground up for superior accuracy. The 338BA can take whatever your big-bore precision rifle can dish out while keeping all your rounds on target.The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake.Special FeaturesBrake-in-suppressor designConical shoulder surfaceHelical Baffle Technology100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreRock-Solid POI RepeatabilityExtreme suppression levels for .338 cartridgesCustomers who desire a ""direct thread"" version of the 338BA can order one with a brake fixed in place.

ULTRA 9 SUPPRESSOR (CB MOUNT),"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,195","Listed On: Monday, April 11, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"GREAT DEALS SELL QUICKLY, CHECK HERE FOR AVAILABILITY OR TO PURCHASE> Thunder Beast Arms Corp. ULTRA 9 SUPPRESSOR (CB MOUNT) MFG # ULTRA-9-CBULTRA 9 SUPPRESSOR (CB MOUNT) MFG # ULTRA-9-CBLightweight Precision Rifle Suppressor, .30 caliber, 9 inch.The ULTRA 9 is our full-size .30 caliber precision rifle suppressor. It is best for applications where maximum suppression is key.The ULTRA 9 will suppress a typical .308 bolt-action rifle down to approx 132-134 dB1. The ULTRA 9 will suppress a typical .300 Blackout bolt-action rifle to about 118-120 dB shooting subsonic ammunition. The ULTRA 9 weighs just 11.9 ounces.ULTRA SERIESThe ULTRA series represents a revolutionary improvement in titanium precision rifle suppressors. We took everything we've learned over the last half decade building the best precision rifle suppressors in the world and put it into the ULTRA design. The ULTRA series offers unprecedented light weight and class-leading suppression levels.Compared to the prior 30P-1/30CB9 series, the ULTRA series is 25-30% lighter, 4-5 dB quieter, and much stronger. The ULTRA series holds the same precision and repeatability as the 30P-1/30CB series.The .30 caliber ULTRA series includes three suppressors: 9-inch, 7-inch, and 5-inch versions are available. They are available in either our Compact Brake (CB) Mount (a ""thread over muzzle brake"" type mount) or in a direct thread mount. The CB mount and direct thread mount have equivalent accuracy and repeatability.With the CB mount, the suppressor mates to a conical shoulder on the brake and locks up rock solid and extremely tight. In direct thread configuration, the ULTRA suppressors use a heat-treated 17-4 thread insert and initial blast shield. The .30 caliber ULTRA series suppressors also have the flexibility to be changed from direct thread to CB mount and vice versa via a simple factory service operation, in case your needs change. This is accomplished by removing or replacing the default brake from the direct thread version.The ULTRA series is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded core. This material and construction provide a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The ULTRA baffle stack was completely redesigned, but retains the principles that made the 30P-1 stack such a great precision and long-range suppressor. Thunder Beast Arms Corp suppressors have racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events nationwide, and have been the most popular suppressor used in the Precision Rifle Series (top 50 competitors) for three years running.Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The ULTRA series was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum (18"" barrel), but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.Special FeaturesDirect thread attachment optionCB series muzzle brake and flash hider attachment optionIonbond DLC coating on CB muzzle devicesConical shoulder surface on CB mount100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreHelical Baffle TechnologyMagnum ratedRock-Solid POI RepeatabilityMaterial PropertiesThe Ultras were designed to be the ""ultimate"" lightweight precision rifle suppressor. This means we used materials to meet those goals. Titanium, even Grade 5, is ultimately limited by temperature. The Ultras are very strong but excursions above 800 degrees are not good for the material. If you take it far enough above 1000 degrees, it will get too weak to sustain the blast and you would eventually get a failure. We recommend keeping the Ultra series less than 800 degrees.Full auto by itself does not really increase the pressure or stress on the can, it's the heat energy input in combination. Full auto or bursts would be fine on an Ultra as long as the material temperature does not exceed that 800 degree safety mark. In our testing, one magazine fired rapid (mag-dump) from from an AR-10 or AR-15 does not exceed 800 degrees. Keep in mind this is firing at a full-auto-like rate. At that point you'd just have to let it cool. The second magazine may or may not cause it to exceed it depending on ambient conditions, loads, barrel length, etc. A shorter barrel will cause more heat input into the suppressor and its temperature will rise faster.SpecificationsCaliber .30 caliber, up to .300 RUMMaterial TitaniumLength 9 inchesDiameter 1.5 inchesMounts CB series brake or flash hider, and Direct ThreadWeight 11.9 ounces (CB mount) , 13.7 ounces (direct thread)Threads (Brake or Direct Thread) 1/2-28*, 5/8-24, 9/16-24, 3/4-24, 3/4-28, M18x1.0, M18x1.5 * Note: The 1/2-28 brake has part number 223CB-BRK:1/2-28 and has a .223 caliber aperture!Finish Black CeraKote; OD Green or FDE availableBrake Material Heat-treated 17-4 stainlessBrake Finish Ionbond DLCUse Precision/Long-range rifle, bolt or semi-autoPrice $1195 CB Mount (one brake included"

This is a 1969 (serial number dated) Ruger M77 tang safety rifle chambered in .308. This gun has a flat bolt as well as the original red Ruger recoil pad. The barrel ha been re-cut and crowned with a full width 11 degree target crown. The barrel has been floated and the gun has been completely gone over and cleaned up. The barrel length currently sits right at 17"" if measured off the face of the receiver. The gun came with a 1:10 twist barrel from the factory and as it is pictured it shoots right around 3/4"" at 100 yards with 168 grain ammo. The scope is an older Redfield 3-9x40 that I've had lying around that I tossed onto the gun. The scope has some decent outer wear on it but it still holds a zero and tracks straight. I was ringing silhouette steel at 500 yards with the gun just two weekends ago.

I'm looking to sell / trade my 5"" Rock Island Armory (Armscor) 1911 FS1.
I purchased this new from West Coast Armory about a year - 16 months ago. I've shot roughly 500 rounds through it without any problems! The trigger is pretty great for an entry level production 1911! This 1911 runs great.

I have the original box, wood grips (synthetic installed right now and will go with it), and 3 extra Chip mags(2 shooting star, 1 power mag) to go with it. Screaming deal for someone.

If I had to put a cash price - lets say $500 for the original package, mags, plus the OWB holster and some ammo to get you going. This is my last .45, and I have a fair stash of self defense (Hornady Critical Defense I think) and remanufactured ammo to go along for the right deal.

This was my first 1911. As such, I put a small idiot scratch on it. Not too noticeable unless you look for it. Rest of the finish is in excellent condition.

I'm sorry I have no photos taken of the pistol at this time. I assure you it looks nearly as good as the day I bought it and cleaned it up (minus the idiot scratch of course)
FS1 features:
- Skeletonized trigger
- Combat hammer
- lowered & flared ejection port
- Ambi safety
- Full length guide rod

Accessories to go:
- Original box w/ papers, CD
- original wood grips & black rubber grips
- High Noon holsters ""Skin Guard"" OWB hoslter (nicely broken in and very comfortable!)
- Potentially 45 or 9mm ammo to supplement trade

Ideally, I'm looking to trade up to a SR1911 LW, SP101, GP100, or AR15 I have cash to supplement. But I'm open to offers.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

833,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4640833,For Sale:  (New) Thunder Beast MODEL 30CB9 SUPPRESSOR,"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,077","Listed On: Thursday, May 5, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"CALL TO VERIFY IN STOCK STATUS BEFORE DRIVING TO STORE OR BUYING ONLINE> Thunder Beast MODEL 30CB9 SUPPRESSOR MFG # 30CB9Thunder Beast MODEL 30CB9 SUPPRESSORThe model 30CB9 is the new ""Compact Brake""-attach version of our flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. This model replaces the 30BA. It shares the same competition-proven baffle stack as the 30BA and 30P-1 (with a few new optimizations), but we've designed a new brake that is smaller and more efficient than the old one.When used alone, the new ""CB"" brake is approx 30-40% more effective at recoil reduction than the old 30BA brake. The new brake is proportioned correctly for .223 and .30 caliber rifles, but it provides a suppressor mounting surface just as solid as the old 30BA series.The way to interpret the model number for the 30CB9 is: .30 caliber, COMPACT BRAKE, 9-inch long (full size)The 30CBx series replaces the 30BA/BAS series as of May 2014. We will continue to sell 30BA series brakes and suppressors to existing ""BA""-series customers if requested.The 30CB9 offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30CB9 is designed to mount over our new compact muzzle brake. It is particularly suited to applications where the rifle will be shot suppressed and unsuppressed, and a brake is desired when shooting without the suppressor.The ""CB"" series suppressors was designed to mount over our new compact brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30CB9 features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 30CB9 was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.The 30CB9 uses the baffle stack of the 30P-1, which has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The 30CB9 is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The 30CB9 is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.com* NEW VERSION WORKS WITH LARUE HANDGUARDS* The MUR is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall making the MUR upper receiver a more rigid platform. A more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability while extending the life of interfacing components such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. The main benefit of the MUR is it's dimensionally correct. Unfortunately, with the current war effort, a number of AR suppliers are rushing through production, bypassing critical dimensions which will either make or break the reliability and accuracy of the weapon. With the existence of the MUR, you'll receive the best and highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell-Deflector only. Being a modular design, Vltor offers the service of exchanging the Bolt-Assist assembly for a Shell-Deflector only assembly and vise-versa. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door. ** Vltor will not sell the Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector assemblies separately. Vltor will offer the service of conversion only. Installation and legal note: The installation and the assembly on the MUR should be performed by a qualified gunsmith and/or certified armorer.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: VLTOR MODULAR UPPER RECEIVER, W/BOLT ASSIST/SHELL DEFLECTOR"

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comOne of the most innovative products available from Vltor is the Versatile Interface Structure (VIS) upper receiver assembly. After 12 years of concept, development and testing, the VIS integrated receiver and rail platform is now available. The VIS is a polylithic upper receiver assembly that ties the normally individual receiver and handguard into an aggregate single part. This combination overcomes many problems that are associated with the traditional ""two piece"" design, most notably being greatly improved structural strength and repeatable accuracy; while affording the user the benefits of a free-floating barrel and rock solid railed fore end. The VIS features four properly dimensioned Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny rails: The top rail is one continuous rail from the back of the receiver section, to the front of the VIS; the two side rails extend from the front portion of the receiver section, to the front of the VIS; and the bottom rail is attached to a removable lower section of the handguard portion. This removable lower section allows for the attachment of the M-203 grenade launcher, as well as assists in cleaning and maintenance. The manufacturing process of the VIS is unique...starting with what is essentially a traditional separate upper receiver and handguard, these parts are partially machined then permanently joined using an exclusive welding process - this composite unit is then stress relieved, final machined and heat treated. This innovative process allows the VIS to accept any standard AR barrel! The only thing that is changed is the barrel nut used with the VIS, the required barrel nut and wrench is included with each VIS kit. Another Vltor exclusive is the modular shell deflector and bolt assist assembly. The VIS gives the operator the opportunity to choose between a shell deflector/bolt assist combo or a shell deflector only. While the VIS is not the first one piece upper receiver for the AR-15/M16 family, it is the first design that retains the use of standard barrels, as well as a removable bottom rail section that allows the mounting of the M-203 grenade launcher and all SOPMOD components.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: VLTOR VIS SYSTEM CARBINE MODEL WITH FORWARD ASSIST AND SHELL DEFLECTOR"

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle. In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything you’d expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some.

954,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4640954,For Sale:  TEMPORARY OUT OF STOCK (New) Thunder Beast Arms Corp. ULTRA 7 SUPPRESSOR (CB MOUNT),"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,095","Listed On: Monday, April 11, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"GREAT DEALS SELL QUICKLY, CHECK HERE FOR AVAILABILITY OR TO PURCHASE>Thunder Beast Arms Corp. ULTRA 7 SUPPRESSOR (CB MOUNT) MFG # ULTRA-7-CBLightweight Precision Rifle Suppressor, .30 caliber, 7 inch.The ULTRA 7 is our highly efficient compact .30 caliber precision rifle suppressor. It is best for applications where a compact form factor is important but excellent suppression is still required.The ULTRA 7 will suppress a typical .308 bolt-action rifle down to approx 134-136 dB1. The ULTRA 7 weighs just 9.7 ounces.ULTRA SERIESThe ULTRA series represents a revolutionary improvement in titanium precision rifle suppressors. We took everything we've learned over the last half decade building the best precision rifle suppressors in the world and put it into the ULTRA design. The ULTRA series offers unprecedented light weight and class-leading suppression levels.Compared to the prior 30P-1/30CB9 series, the ULTRA series is 25-30% lighter, 4-5 dB quieter, and much stronger. The ULTRA series holds the same precision and repeatability as the 30P-1/30CB series.The .30 caliber ULTRA series includes three suppressors: 9-inch, 7-inch, and 5-inch versions are available. They are available in either our Compact Brake (CB) Mount (a ""thread over muzzle brake"" type mount) or in a direct thread mount. The CB mount and direct thread mount have equivalent accuracy and repeatability.With the CB mount, the suppressor mates to a conical shoulder on the brake and locks up rock solid and extremely tight. In direct thread configuration, the ULTRA suppressors use a heat-treated 17-4 thread insert and initial blast shield. The .30 caliber ULTRA series suppressors also have the flexibility to be changed from direct thread to CB mount and vice versa via a simple factory service operation, in case your needs change. This is accomplished by removing or replacing the default brake from the direct thread version.The ULTRA series is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded core. This material and construction provide a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The ULTRA baffle stack was completely redesigned, but retains the principles that made the 30P-1 stack such a great precision and long-range suppressor. Thunder Beast Arms Corp suppressors have racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events nationwide, and have been the most popular suppressor used in the Precision Rifle Series (top 50 competitors) for three years running.Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The ULTRA series was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum (18"" barrel), but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM. Special FeaturesDirect thread attachment optionCB series muzzle brake and flash hider attachment optionIonbond DLC coating on CB muzzle devicesConical shoulder surface on CB mount100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreHelical Baffle TechnologyMagnum ratedRock-Solid POI RepeatabilityMaterial PropertiesThe Ultras were designed to be the ""ultimate"" lightweight precision rifle suppressor. This means we used materials to meet those goals. Titanium, even Grade 5, is ultimately limited by temperature. The Ultras are very strong but excursions above 800 degrees are not good for the material. If you take it far enough above 1000 degrees, it will get too weak to sustain the blast and you would eventually get a failure. We recommend keeping the Ultra series less than 800 degrees.Full auto by itself does not really increase the pressure or stress on the can, it's the heat energy input in combination. Full auto or bursts would be fine on an Ultra as long as the material temperature does not exceed that 800 degree safety mark. In our testing, one magazine fired rapid (mag-dump) from from an AR-10 or AR-15 does not exceed 800 degrees. Keep in mind this is firing at a full-auto-like rate. At that point you'd just have to let it cool. The second magazine may or may not cause it to exceed it depending on ambient conditions, loads, barrel length, etc. A shorter barrel will cause more heat input into the suppressor and its temperature will rise faster.
