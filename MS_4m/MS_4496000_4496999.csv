Our dedicated Law Enforcement departments will provide you with the firearms, training & Individual Officer Support Programs that are tailored to your needs.When the success of your job or mission requires unfailing reliability, turn to the name synonymous with the world’s most reliable firearms – SIG SAUER®. Law enforcement professionals have made our pistols and rifles their weapons of choice for the best reason of all—they perform the first time and every time they’re needed. A long history of reliability, durability, accuracy, and success. Our name and our reputation have their roots in a wagon factory above the Rhine Falls in Switzerland. It is here, that in 1860, Freidrich Peyer im Hof, Heinrich Moser, and Conrad Neher created a state-of- the-art rifle that would become the Swiss Army’s standard. They named the company the Schweizerische Industrie-Gesellschaft (Swiss Industrial company) or SIG as it became known worldwide. SIG evolved into the Swiss Army’s choice for pistols as well, first adopting the P49 forerunner of the P210®, then the P220® and the P230™. SIG’s small arms division was expanded to include J.P. Sauer & Sohn, GmbH, of Eckernförde, West Germany and Hämmerli Target Arms from Lenzburg, Switzerland. Following great success in Europe, the company came to America, opening its U.S. division, SIGARMS®, in 1985. The Virginia based company moved to its present location of Exeter, New Hampshire in 1990 to begin domestic production of the P229®. Today, we are officially known as SIG SAUER, a corporate name and brand that continues to pay tribute to a worldwide legacy and reputation. SIG SAUER is an ISO 9001 certified company with over 500 employees. Our depth and breadth includes not only the manufacturing and distribution of the world’s most reliable handguns, long guns, and accessories, but unparalleled training through our world-renowned SIG SAUER Academy™ located close by in Epping, New Hampshire. U.S. Navy Seals, Federal Air Marshals, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, state and local law enforcement agencies from coast-to-coast increasingly trust their SIG SAUER weapons to perform the first time and every time they’re needed. Shouldn’t you?Sig Sauer P320Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models: - Striker Safety - Disconnect Safety - 3-point Take Down Safety System - Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine - System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear - Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP). Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.

""The M6 Scout is a multipurpose firearm, combining rifle and shotgun. It has been in and out of commercial production several times since the late 1970s (out of production again as of March 2008). The latest models were sold by Springfield Armory. Other variations of this firearm are the M6 Carbine and the M6 Scout Pistol. The M6 Scout was produced in two types, a standard model with Parkerized finish and a version made from rustproof stainless steel.""

""The M6 design and model number come from the M6 Aircrew Survival Weapon, issued to U.S. Air Force aircrew from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. The commercial model is nearly identical to the USAF version, though there are a couple of minor cosmetic differences. There is a removable trigger guard. The greatest change is that the commercial model has a barrel length of 18.25 inches (46.4 cm) instead of the 14 inches (36 cm) barrel length of the USAF version. Athens Arms produced a 14"" barreled version that qualified as ""Any Other Weapon"" (AOW) under the NFA exemption for the Marble Game Getter: combination of rifled and smooth bore barrels between 12 and 18 inches."""

I bought this glock used about 10 years ago (I guess at that time a Gen 2 was still considered a newer version). It seemed close to a brand new gun then. I put about 400 rounds through it and it stayed in a safe for most of those years back in my home state after

 joining the Army. The gun is just fine. I don't have the original box. It comes with a 10rd mag (like I bought it). I see brand new Glock 21s going for $585.00 on gunbroker.com. For any used Glock 21, this is a good price. Glock barrels can take multiple thousands of rounds through it and the spring can take up to supposedly 5000+ rounds before needing to change it out, (and that's only needed if it's not cycling).

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

The Barrett 82A1 stands at the pinnacle of firearm design, and has been proven in long-range accuracy, ruggedness, and dependability in any environment (military or civilian). The low recoil and self-loading action of the 82A1 created it’s own hallmark! If you are anything like me, the more that you research the engineering that goes into the Barrett Model 82A1, the more you will be inspired by the close tolerances and meticulous engineering that has gone into every single part of this gun. It is unparalleled.

I was so overwhelmed by Barrett’s development of the Model 82A1, that I got this rifle to hold onto. I am the sole owner, and this rifle has remained new and unfired, to this day. It has been well maintained and stored in climate-controlled conditions with thorough cleaning and lubrication regularly. I NEVER intended to sell this beautiful gun, but must now due to financial necessity.

If you are unfamiliar with the Barrett Model 82A1, please watch some of the You Tube demonstrative videos of this rifle. There simply are NO Comparables.

The Swarovski Optik high-performance scope is made in Western Austria by Swarovski; a family business that was established in 1895 after Daniel Swarovski invented the first electric grinding machine for jewelry stores. In 1935, Wilhelm Swarovski pursued his passion for astronomy and built far better optics for telescopes than the world had ever seen. This gave rise to Swarovski Optik, a company that still stands firmly behind their products. I believe this to be the best scope, atop the best rifle.

The Pelican 1750 case for the Barrett Model 82A1 is built like a tank, and is specially designed for the 82A1. It is watertight, crushproof, and dustproof, and comes with a Lifetime Guarantee of Excellence. It measures 53” Length X 16” Width X 6.12” Depth, and is made of polypropylene with stainless steel bearings. It comes with a side handle, end handle, and roller wheels.

I cannot bring myself to piece out the gun, so I am selling it with all of the accessories. EVERYTHING IS IN NEW CONDITION. This includes everything detailed in the attached photos, including:

WILL SELL BOTH THE AR AND 800 ROUNDS FOR $800 FIRM PRICE
Hello all, I am selling my Franklin Armory AR-15. Its in perfect working order, I bought it new during the Sandyhook scare for $1200-1300. I only fired maybe 30-50 rounds to zero the sights. It has a hard case, shot-lock, 10 round mag, and owner's manual. I'm in the Army Reserve and bought it to keep sharp, I'd like a handgun now so I'd take trades for a Glock 22 .40S&W with cash. I also have 800 rounds of 5.56 if you'd like that.

The Muzzleloader is in great shape. Camo synthetic stock, stainless steel, Fiber optic sights. I could be convinced to throw a red dot on it if the deal is interesting and you deem it necessary. I only hunted with it for 2 seasons (early and late, early and late)...then I got a bow. Since then I only bow hunt. Rather than collect dust I'd like to move these rifles separate or together.

It is a K-frame smith with nonadjustable sights and a bull barrel.  It has a hammer mounted firing pin and it all stainless steel.  It has pachymar grips.  The gun appears to be in pretty good shape to me.  The only issue that I have encountered is that some force needs to be applied to eject spent casings.  I am taking it to the gunsmith tomorrow to have him check it out.  I haven't had the gun long, I have large hands and I just enjoy shooting n frames more.  I would be willing to drive to South Bend or Lafayette to sell the revolver.  $450 obo, NO TRADES, thanks guys"
