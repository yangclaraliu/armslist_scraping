Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition **This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.

This was my dads camera. He bought it at the NRA convention last year. He used it less than five times before passing. I have not used it since he passed, and don't plan to. I simply don't get to the 300 yard range more than a couple of times a year, and when I do, I just shoot steel. As for the company themselves, they have great customer service. I remember him having an issue connecting, and they were more than helpful getting him setup, even though the issue was his phone.

 This is not a beginner pistol, nor for the first time buyer. Modern ammunition is available for this pistol, but is better suited to low power handloads, or historically equivalent black powder loads.

 The serial number, 21,XXX, puts the date of manufacture between 1888-1890. The grip safety functions fine with no issues. The cylinder release locks up tight, and so does the cylinder itself.

 It shows some wear for the age, with minor pitting in the barrel. The serial numbers on the pistol itself all match, but the grips, while period correct, do not match the other serial numbers.

 From my research on these, prices are anywhere from $100-$500. This isn't a $100 gun, and certainly isn't a $500 gun either.

 I'd like to get $300. I'm not interested in other firearms for trade, but would be interested in specific pistol powders, hardcast lead boolits for certain calibers, primers, or even silver.

Action was trued by Wyatt's Outdoor in Medford Oregon, who also installed the shilen 1:9 twist barrel. Only about 120 rounds have been fired through this barrel. I turned it down, but it is still heavier than a Rem Varmint contour. It is about 25 inches long, straight for about 4.5"", then tapers to about 1"", then tapers to about 0.9"" at the muzzle. This was done on an older lathe, barrel is rough on the outside with tool markings and most likely not perfectly concentric. A machinist cut the 5/8-24 muzzle threads, but these are a few thousandths smaller than they should be and could be recut for ideal fit, but they still work for a flash hider.
The stock is a heavily modified Bell and Carlson. I opened up the barrel channel to free-float the heavy barrel. I also widened most of the body and lengthened the forend using high-grade fiberglass. I also bedded the action and several inches of barrel with JB Weld, not perfect but functional.

This rifle is completely functional, and with proper handloading should be very accurate. The reason I'm selling it is because I'm switching to a lighter rifle/caliber combination, as I simply don't need this much gun for the type of shooting I usually do.

Included is a set of RCBS loading dies, over 900 Berger 168 grain VLD bullets, 200 pieces of Norma .280 brass and about 30 other brass of different brands. Only about 60 brass have been fired, the rest are new, unfired.

Flash hider, scope and rings are not included. 
Steel TPS Products 20 MOA scope base is included.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.
Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Comparable in size to a smartphone, the Beretta 3032 Tomcat is tiny while offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge. The controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide while also preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.As such, this double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic.The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense. Manufacturer: BerettaModel: 3032 TomcatBarrel: 2.4""Action: Single/Double Action"

Well here are some good reasons not to do that. 

1. Time and fuel. Yeah it costs time and $ to buy it and it costs time and $ to sell it. Buying in limited retail store quantities (1 brick at a time) gives you less than McD's lunch money. You are not ""doubling your money"" selling at double the price you bought it for. 
2. Bulk ammo does not store forever. In 10-12 years all your ammo stash will be trash. Bulk ammo (in loose rounds that touch each) start to corrode and oxidize in as little as a decade since the lead is touching brass is touching cooper etc. google it. 
3. What goes up must come down. Hoarding goes up= costs go up and later the market gets flooded with old unused product. Once more people start realizing they don't need or can't sell this older ammo then market rate drops below $0.02 per round. 
4. 22 gougers inflate retail rates for retailers. Retailers see individual people posting 22 on the Internet for high prices so they adjust their pricing to meet the gougers so they can keep their inventory longer and get in some some gouging themselves just due to hype and talk. 
5. This ammo hype is getting attention from lawmakers and congress is getting pressure to pass laws that individuals must have a license to sell ammunition. Sounds ridiculous but it could happen with all these democrats. If this does happen then retailers will have the same advantage forever that gougers had for a couple years. 

So there I did my part to help limit this 22 ammo stupidity and ridiculousness. Please keep your ammo fresh (less than 5 years) and don't buy 10X more than you need."

The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.
The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.
The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.
Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.
Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.
About VFZ Mounts:
VFZ is a new theory in the concept of clamping accessories to MIL-STD-1913 rails. Instead of using a horizontal cross-bolt, the VFZ uses a vertical bolt that draws up a clamping foot against the lower angle of the rail, seating the mount similarly to a fully-closed LaRue lever.
Once installed on the firearm, index marks allow the user to remove the mount, then reattach to the same tension, providing unprecedented return to zero for a non-QD-levered mount. The unique vertical alignment of the clamp allows components that are structurally stronger than traditional cross-bolt designs"

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

Head or helmet mounted, the PVS-14 allows the user to retain their night adapted vision in one eye while viewing their surroundings through the illuminated eyepiece of the PVS-14. The new battery housing completes the perfect package by allowing the user to power off the unit when in an upright position and power on when flipped down.

Strength is its ability to be weapon mounted behind most collimated daylight aimers and Reflex sights such as the ACOG, Aimpoint and EO Tech systems. This allows the user the ability to use their PVS-14 both as a night vision monocular for increased mobility and tactical awareness and as a short range weapon sight.
Gain control gives the user the ability to increase or decrease the tube gain. Under extremely dark conditions, gain control allows the user to adjust the gain upward, giving a better image. Under high light conditions, details can be washed out due to an excess of light. Lowering the system gain can allow those details to be better seen. Additional features of the PVS-14 include an infrared LED with LED indicator and a low battery indicator. All in all, the PVS-14 has set the bar for what a night vision monocular should be."

Round count is probably 300-500.. number of paint-jobs, no clue but several at least.

I bought it not knowing the specs, hoping it would fit me. Unfortunately that is not the case. So whoever ends up with this piece of history will have a pretty nice setup. I would say the draw length is 27"" - 29"" adjustable and the draw weight #45 - #60 I was trying to keep it original as possible, minus the paracord. The only items keeping it from being 100% original are the cable guard (Which is vintage Martin. Just not the roller guard that was originally meant for it.) and the limb stabilizers (which I couldn't seem to find anywhere.). It just recently had a new string and peep put on it. I am entertaining offers for trade. Specifically for a recurve. I would prefer to stick with Martin. If you have a vintage metal riser Cougar recurve, you are my hero.

9mm : out of 300 rounds of WWB 115gr, it has had 5 failures to eject.
Out of 250 rounds of Federal 115 gr, it has had 5 failures to eject.
It has NEVER failed to eject with any hollowpoints I've tried or with any 124 gr ammo. I fired 200 rounds of assorted 124 gr ammo.
I have been told by MANY Sig enthusiasts that this is a common sig issue. But I don't like it and don't want to deal with it. I need something that will be happy with the cheapest ammo I can find. I've never kept a gun that was the least picky about ammo. 
with the .22 slide, out of 50 rounds of american eagle I had 5 failures to feed. out of 150 rounds of cci mini mag, I had ZERO failures or any kind.

Sig P229R DA/SAClassic .22 with Sig 9mm Caliber X-change kit.

Boxes for gun and conversion kit. Manual and lock. Two Sig .22lr magazines. Four 15 rounds Sig 9mm magazines. Two Mc-gar 17 round 9mm magazines. Original grips plus set of Hogue grips.
It is a GREAT gun, excellent range gun and if you can afford 124 gr ammo, its a great carry gun. I unfortunately CANNOT afford to feed it anything other than cheap ammo and for my ONLY carry gun 10 failures out of 750 rounds is just too much.
