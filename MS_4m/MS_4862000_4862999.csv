The bear measures 5 feet 5 inches from nose to back claws. The head on the bear is enormous! The bear rug was professionally done by a taxidermist and the quality is excellent. The rug has always been over our pool table and am now selling the pool table. The rug comes from a non-smoking home with no animals. I am asking $850 for the rug. Rugs online are going for $2,000 (see link below). Even if you were fortunate enough to harvest a bear and do all the work to get it to a taxidermist it would still cost over $1,000. McLaganâs Taxidermy in Bend charges $200 a linear foot which alone puts the bear over $1,000. The bear rug looks great on the wall, in the den, on the pool table, on the floor or above the fireplace. I am a bit torn about selling it and in no hurry to do so and think I priced it fairly at $850 so please no low ball offers. This rug is an excellent addition to any Central Oregon home!

I would also be interested in trading the bear for a nice firearm or a firearm + cash depending on the value. I am looking for a nice revolver and would prefer a Smith & Wesson .500 magnum. I would also be interested in a .44, .454, or .460. I may be interested in other guns just let me know what you have. Thanks.

The gas block was exchanged to accommodate the rifle having a low powered scope without optical interference from the F marked front site.  This rifle was purchased to hunt with as a brush/pig gun.  It is well cared for but has been in the woods and shows it.  The barrel shows some wear, as shown in the pictures, near the gas block.

It shoots Hornady 150g SST like a laser beam.  I am selling because I plan to hunt with a 450 bushmaster on my next hog hunt.

Â An ORIGINAL ORIGINAL Whitney Wolverine. NOT a dealer, so no trades, no credit cards, no special requests. Â Price on this gun isÂ FIRM. NOÂ negotiation on price possible. Please DON'T CONTACTÂ if you plan to ask for a lower price. Â However, a second gun purchased at the same time might be discountable as a favor to fellow users orÂ collectors, if delivered to the same FFL Â transfer agent, or end user.Armslist does not always succeed in forwarding info requests. Â Please see illustration for other contact routes if this becomes a problem.Â Please note, in some areas and jurisdictions, this gun IS an ASSAULT WEAPON and is banned. Â Exceptions exist to that ban in some, but not all of those jurisdictions for individuals with approprate licensures.This gun is one of the rare early ones actually marked WOLVERINE (see image). Excellent condition, NOT perfect cosmetically, due to tiny chipping in paint on grip, some rubbing from cardboard contact on one grip area, some rubbing and channel formation on the shroud paint where it was in contact with the box, and at hammer area of frame. Little use. Extra magazines available (OEM Whitney) and a few other parts. Includes SN matched box and instructions, not other paperwork. Box insert is one that was used very rarely: NOÂ yellow Wolverine overlay due to the trademark dispute that was active at that time. The box has shelf wear, and the SN is hard to see, but it is there and does match. The price has been reduced for these cosmetic defects.
The FIRST TWO images are of this gun. The third is the non-WOLVERINE marked Whitney that also is available, for optional purchase ALONG WITH this gun. At this time, the non-marked Wolverine is NOT for sale separately. Buying the two is an excellent choice for a person who wants both a collectable version, and one that is in excellent working condition, but looks worn enough so there will be no regrets for actual use.Is this gun worth the price? Â For a target shooter, certaintly not. Â These are not target guns. Â For a true collector, it's a very good valueÂ in the current market. Â Take a look at aÂ recent sales Gunbroker for guns NOT marked Wolverine, has no box or papers, repainted guns, or such. Â If you wish to purchase this gun, there is anÂ option for a second ""use"" gun if you want that too, as a ""collector service"". Â The minimally collectable second gun is NOT available separately at this time.  Lots of these guns have been repainted. The original paint was not the best quality, so the repainted ones generally look better than the originals and is the first indication of repainting. On WOLVERINE-marked guns, that name should be in white-ish paint (it is not true white) overlay on black. Otherwise, most likely it is a repainted gun. To a typical collector, these repainted guns areÂ not a valuable collector's item any longer, but become ""shooters"".  More images on request.Â   It's been difficult to establish a fair price for this gun, as so very few have been sold in the last 10 years that are marked WOLVERINE. To a ""traditional"" collector, those are the only true Whitney Wolverines, and all else is not quite a true Wolverine. There is no difference, of course, in the guns and their function.Â   Also, perhaps best to explain ""rare"". To a collector, that can mean one of a kind or not more than 5 in existence. Among guns, a total quantity in existence of perhaps 200 qualifies, for some guns. For example, only about 30 SAKO TriAce were imported into the USA, so the gun is rare IN THE USA, but not world-wide. About 150 of their Finnmaster were made in two versions, so each version worldwide could be considered rare for a gun, but not quite there if the 5 or fewer criterion is used.  This gun is not that rare. But it is very very uncommon, with the WOLVERINE marking, so compared to other mass produced guns, at least it's borderline rare.  A few comments about this gun. It is a ""backwards"" design for any handgun, with the only true lockup being at the muzzle. The end result is a tolerable gun that is difficult to reassembly correctly (the reason so many are chipped at the hammer area), with moderate accuracy. It is not as accurate as the Hi Standard Victor, and far inferior to the Hammerli 208 or Walther GSP. Also unlike those guns, trigger pull and position are not adjustable. These are NOT target guns by ANY standard, and due to the basic design, can NOT be converted into one of that accuracy or quality.  The collector world for these guns is ""strange"" despite a very concise book on their history, which interestingly, does not mention the unusual overall design, its potential values and failures as an accurate pistol. The early guns like this one were marked Wolverine as he mentions, and this was removed from the guns due to a trademark infringement suit against Whitney company. The resolution was to remove the marks from the gun, but leave the name on the boxes and inserts. A few of the guns are plated, most are not. A fair number of scrap parts were assembled into guns after the company failed. The box for this gun never had the yellow insert, probably because of the timing (suit filed, not settled, no decision on how to compromise). These guns are considered collector's items by some, or pastiches by others of scrap value only. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, perhaps, as is value. For the optionalÂ more typical one, moderately heavy use, mechanically reconditioned for much less---- see third image. Â Available with purchase of this gun, in case a collector wants a ""useable"" gun of equal accuracy, as well so one can stay on the shelf, and the other be used. Price for both guns including 4 magazines, spare parts is $1650 plus shipping. Â  IL transfer on FOID after state police confirmation is possible, in the more forward-thinking areas that have not defined this gun as an assault weapon. NH transfer on any of the several appropriate NH IDs (with NH police dept confirmation) also is possible. FFL shipping and C&R FFL shipping can be provided as well, to licensee of your choice. However, be sure the gun can be delivered to you, due to local or state assault weapon bans.  Also available are : Hammerli 208 S and 215 S, Hammeril 215 (non-S) Walther GSP, Walther OSP (all versions, 10"" barrel) Hi Standard Victors (Hamden, Â 5.5"" bbl) Â steel and aluminum rib, Al ribbed oneÂ with full length barrel weight OEM.

	Hey All, 
	I have another really great entry level AR for sale/trade. This is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S AR15 chambered in 5.56/223 REM. This will come with the gun, Ambi single point sling adapter, 4 Used Metal Surplus Mags, Quick Release NC Star Holographic multi reticle sight with blue illumination, forward assist, and dust cover.. This is a 6 inch barrel with 1:9 twist and a standard Bird Cage flash hider installed. This is a awesome little starter gun that I would keep, but i donât need another AR at the moment. This is in used shape and shows some signs of use, but still feels fine and tight. 
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357 etc., PLR-16, CMR30, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, Black Powder Revolvers, Redhawks, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at 4058212160 and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one.

A few of you have shot this rifle and know it's capabilities. The only downside to it, is weight - it is heavy. I have a .338 Lapua now for unknown distance and long range shoots, so my .308 class long range rifle will now be used for off-hand long range shoots. I recently picked up a Remington 700 with an MDT because it is 3 lbs lighter. I stuck the same trigger and bolt in it and turned it into a shooter that I can support without a rest.

History of the Beretta 92FS
Designed in 1975 by Carlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti, and Vittorio Valle; the Beretta 92 (made in Italy) pistol is an evolution from the M1922 and M1951. Taking the open slide design from the M1922 and its alloy frame and locking barrel from the M1951. Along the way the Beretta 92 also adopted a direct feed and a ""double-stacked"" high capacity design to its magazine.

In order to meet the requirements of select law enforcement agencies, Beretta added a slide-mounted combined safety and docking lever. Thus the Beretta 92S was born and adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.

Eventually Beretta modified the 92SB (a special model with a firing pin block designed for the U.S. Air Force) with an enlarged hammer pin to stop the slide from flying off the frame in response to reports of defective slides during U.S. Military testing."

The JP Silent Captured Recoil spring assembly is a self-contained unit that replaces the standard buffer and spring. The components of the assembly are highly polished for extremely smooth and quiet operation. The system is optimized for use with a JP Low mass bolt carrier and adjustable gas system, but also works with standard weight components. The system is designed to work with a carbine length buffer tube, and includes a spacer for use in A1/ A2 fixed stocks. The spring is also removable for custom tuning for your rifle. This captured recoil spring assembly is designed to eliminate the noise and vibration of the standard buffer, spring, and buffer tube. When used with a tuned gas system, this captured spring and buffer dramatically reduce the feel of the mechanical recoil of a standard system, making it feel more like a bolt gun.

The pistol was initially released by Walther in 1921, and production of this then-popular weapon continued largely unchanged until 1945. It's chambered in 6.35mm (.25ACP) and has a 5-round single-stack magazine. The cartridge is discharged via a striker-fired mechanism, and as a result the pistol is able to be fully-functional in a significantly smaller package than would have been required if Walther had used a hammer-based design. The result of this design was the smallest-ever semi-automatic 6.35mm pistol, even to this day. The design was so popular that many other companies had to create similarly-sized (but larger) pistols in order to try to take business from Walther.

I purchased my Model 9 from a collector online who misstated the quality and condition of this particular example. I was made to believe that it has 97% finish or better, and that it was all-original. It is in just fine condition and functions well mechanically, but the finish is at maybe 90%, and I believe that the grips are too nice to be original. It's just a little too rough to keep in my Walther collection, so I'm hoping to find someone who will enjoy it for what it is: an honest, functional, little conversation piece with a fun history with which you don't have to worry about accidental fingerprint marks or letting people handle it.

I'm open to trades or partial trades for other Walther products, and would be happy to pitch in extra cash if you have something interesting. Please feel free to contact me with anything you'd be interested in trading.

Thanks,
