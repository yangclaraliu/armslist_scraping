Reduces Muzzle Flash & Protects Nearby Personnel From Side Blast

Unique design redirects concussion forward to provide better flash suppression than standard A2 suppressor on short-barreled AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and other centerfire gas-operated weapons. Virtually eliminates side blast to protect nearby personnel during CQB, building entries, and when shooting from inside vehicles. Lessens felt recoil and reduces muzzle rise to help keep sights on the target for fast follow up shots and superior recoil management on full-auto assault rifles, especially with barrels 13"" or shorter. High-carbon steel with matte black manganese phosphate finish stands up to the heat and pressure of thousands of rounds. Crush washer included."

It is a beautiful rifle with all brand new wood. It is also from government surplus, so it is in great shape and hasn't been mistreated or worn down from many owners.

I have completely disassembled the wood pieces to oil them properly with raw linseed oil as was the original treatment at the time. This really brought out the grain of the wood and the CMP cartouch stamped in the stock. This also provides some amount of water proofing and will turn into that characteristic red color of the Garand in a year or two as the oil oxidizes. The parkerizing is also in great shape, very dark and free of the many scratches and bright wear that would be typical.

The muzzle and throat readings are 1 and 2+ respectively. I have cleaned and inspected every part and replaced the main op rod spring due to compression. I have also checked that the timing and headspace are within the specified ranges using appropriate gauges.

I have fired a half dozen clips or so through this M1 and it fires beautifully. My brother picked up the other one I had just like this one and he loves it!"

Rifle in good condition.  There are no scratches, gouges or rust.  Just some normal handling marks from being fired.  The bore is nice and shiny. 

The SR9s are modified HK91-series rifles intended to qualify for import as sporting rifles after the US ban on imported assault rifles in 1989. The visible differences include the removal of the flash suppressor, bayonet lugs, and pistol grip in order to improve the design's acceptance as a sporting rifle. The SR9s have a medium weight barrel that is slightly less than 20"". Internal differences include a new buffer system and a change to polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is more accurate. This gun is very hard to fined and great investment for collector or a great base for a sniper rifle.

Rifle also comes with 3 20 rd magazines and 3 520rd spam cans of ammo plus some loose rounds brings the total to approx.. 1575 rounds of steel case ammo.

I also have all the boxes and packaging for all the extras I have installed on it : If you want the factory box and all other new boxes and packaging I can give them to you as well.

Reliability: Unmatched by any weapon system currently known. Drop it from the roof top, immerse it it water, burry it in sand and mud, leave it there and when you come back (and find it) just pull the trigger: It WILL fire as usual in the heat of the desert or far north of the Arctic Cirle.

Condition: Uncomparably superior to a factory new, unfired Saiga for the following reasons.
We had a long standing argument with a friend who is a a well-known and often cited author of gun and shooting related books and articles. He was adamant about that the AK 47 platform was inherently inaccurate at anything past 50 yards. I persisted that I could make an AK shoot touching holes at 200 yards. We made a bet. I won - but it cost me a LOT of work and preparation.

I went and bought this Saiga .308 brand new, unfired. Took it to the best gunsmith I know and asked him to cut a 10 degree target crown, install a high performance spring set and polish the trigger. Loaded up on Hornady 308 Win 168 gr Match Grade ammo and a carefully assembled tool kit and took it to the range the first time. Broke in the barrel as you would brake in a pro sniper barrel: It is a lengthy and labor-intensive process which is crucial to the future accuracy of the weapon. I'll be glad to explain in great detail to the buyer of this rifle. NOT much fun, very tedious and people next to you look at you like you are out of your mind.Took it back home, did a deep cleaning on all parts and took it back to the gunsmith for a very detailed exam: I wanted every single part to be in absolutely perfect condition.  I then purchased and mounted the sighting system: RSRegulate AK-303 Full-Length Rail & RSRegulate AKR Picatinny Mount Upper Rail - it being the ONLY optics mount for the AK pattern that guarantees perfect alignment with the bore - the Nikon scope mount and the Nikon Buckmaster scope, making sure that everything came out perfect: Bore alignment, scope center height, eye relief, etc.

The next time at the range I took 10 shots to initiate the barrel for the session and used those shots to align the front and rear iron sights as close to perfection as possible at a 100 yards. Then I zeroed the Nikon Buckmaster first at 100 and then at 200 yards. Waited over an hour for my friend to arrive and to finally settle the bet. He came with an expensive and very fancy bolt action rifle - just to show me how precision shooting is done. We set up a few 3"" targets at 200 yards and verified the distance with a laser range finder. He shot first, all five shots hit the 3"" target in a 1.1 MOA radius but none of them touched. I fired 5 shots next, four touched - right on the darn center dot to make him even more upset - and one ""Flyer"" 0.75"" H/R. I told him that it must have been a wind gust. He wanted to walk all the way out to the targets because he didn't trust his own spotting scope. On the way back he admitted that I won and also that proper initiation of a barrel makes for an exceptionally accurate rifle. He shot the Saiga for the remainder of the session with a few different types of ammo from high-end to dirt cheap and he enjoyed this more than he will ever admit to me. The range masters gathered around and hinted at that we may have had mixed up our targets. 

He became truly intrigued and we agreed to travel to a range that we could shoot out to a 1,000 yards and beyond the next weekend. Long story short, my scope's internal elevation setting only allowed me to adjust to 700 yards, after that I was left with the BDC marks and the top of the bottom post out to 1,088 yards max. I didn't have a 20 or 30 degree riser, that would have made a major difference well past the 1,000 yard mark, out to almost a mile. The longest distance we could shoot that day was 700 yards due to the weather (686 yards measured by the laser range finder). We used the pre-installed 12"" x 12"" metal targets and we both hit the targets on every single shot, no misses.

This setup is now for sale. I have not shot this rifle since then so the round count is somewhere between 2-300. I can sell just the Saiga or the whole setup with the RSRegulate mount set, Nikon base and Nikon Buckmaster scope. All are in like new shape.

Considering what this rifle can do some people would ask some crazy number for it, simply because it's notorious reliability combined with an accuracy that your friends will want to chalk up to luck instead of  quality and skill probably deserves a healthy premium. 

Instead, I chose to let you make a a reasonable offer and let's go from there. My cost is slightly north of $1,700 with all accessories included. Please be reasonable, for just the rifle or the whole nine yards.

I will consider trades with cash or other items added either way if the values don't fully match.  The following would be preferred either alone or in any combination: Sig Sauer, H&K, Colt or Glock semi-auto pistols; Pelican or SKB long rifle cases in nice condition, Rifle Scope(s) with transferable lifetime warranty; factory new quality ammo in .308, 7.62x51, 5.56, .223, 9mm, 10mm, 45 ACP. No reloads, no corrosive or steel cases. Let me know if you have something else not listed above and I'll consider it as well.

A little info on the Saiga: 
This rifle was built on the same machines, in the same plant, by the same people that manufacture AK rifles for the Russian military. It's as close as you can get to an issue Russian rifle without paying an extraordinary price. 

THESE RIFLES ARE NOW BANNED FROM IMPORTATION, PER EXECUTIVE ORDER 13662

For importation reasons, the the magazine well on stock Saiga rifles only accepts proprietary 10 round, single stack magazines. When these rifles are converted to accept AK magazines, the companies converting them often do a poor job, and the magazine wobbles excessively even when seated properly. The fit of magazine-to-magwell on this one is great."

First of Gen 4 glock 17. Bought new paid $630 at Philadelphia gun and archery club, legitimately put 15 rounds through it at my buddies house, realized right away I don't like the angle of the grip and put it in my safe. It's about as new as you can possibly have a gun be. Still has the gold factory lube on it in some parts. Nothing special about it just a regular 17, there's also nothing wrong with it, I'm just used to 1911 and the angle of the grip on the glock just isn't something I'm comfortable with. 

Next gun is a walther ppk. Bought it maybe a year and a half ago, thought my gf would like shooting it, she doesn't, she prefers full size guns. Together we probably put 100 rounds through it. It just sits in my safe now.

They have a good You Tube video explaining the process. I started out with the included speedloaders but there just isn't enough meat between the rounds to work well. Having the cylinder cut to accept moonclips made all the difference in the world for a quick reload.
