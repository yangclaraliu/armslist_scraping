The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.

IT HAS A ""D"" IN A CIRCLE DATE CODE THAT EQUATES TO 1952 DATE OF MANUFACTURE. THAT IN ITSELF ISN'T SO SPECIAL. BUT, IT HAS 26"" ORIGINAL BARRELS THAT ARE CHOKED MODIFIED AND CYLINDER, WHICH IS THE PERFECT COMBINATION FOR DOVE, QUAIL, PHEASANT, OR OTHER CLOSE IN GAME. IT ALSO HAS AN OPTION THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE. MID BARREL AND MUZZLE END BEADS. THE FINISH ON THE BARRELS IS IN GREAT SHAPE FOR A 62 YEAR OLD GUN. THERE IS ONE VERY SMALL DING ON THE TOP OF THE LEFT BARREL ABOUT 9"" FROM THE MUZZLE, BUT I DOUBT IT WILL INTERFERE WITH PATTERNING AND WILL NOT CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS WITH SHOOTING. THE BORES ARE BRIGHT AND SHINY WITH NO RUST, DUST OR PITTING AT ALL.

IT LOCKS UP TIGHT AND THE EXTRACTOR FUNCTIONS AS IT SHOULD. THE COLORS FROM THE CASE HARDENING HAS FADED FROM USE AND AGE, BUT ABOUT 50% REMAINS. TRIGGERS FUNCTION AND THE SAFETY WORKS AS IT SHOULD.

THE STOCKS FRONT AND REAR HAVE BEEN REFINISHED WITH A BEAUTIFUL GLOSS OIL FINISH, NO VARNISH OR URETHANE. THE CHECKERING HAS BEEN REFRESHED AND LOOKS BETTER THAN WHAT THE FACTORY USUALLY DID WITH THIS SERIES. THE STOCKS WERE NOT SANDED DOWN TO COMPLETELY NEW WOOD WHEN THEY WERE REFINISHED TO RETAIN THE SIZE AND THE ""OLD"" SENSE. THERE IS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL DING AT THE TOE END OF THE BUTTSTOCK WHERE IT MEETS THE BUTTPLATE. THE REST OF BOTH THE FORE AND BUTTSTOCK ARE AS SMOOTH AS A BABY'S BEHIND AND SLICK AS GLASS. BROWNING DOESN'T DO A FINISH LIKE THIS. THE BUTTSTOCK HAS AN EPOXY REPAIRED CRACK BEHIND THE FRAME THAT WAS REPAIRED BEFORE THE STOCK WAS REFINISHED. IT'S HARDLY NOTICEABLE, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW IT'S THERE.



I HAVE LOTS OF PHOTOS THAT I'LL EMAIL TO SERIOUS BUYERS. I WILL SHIP TO YOUR FFL FOR $35.00.

PRICE IS $400.00 PICKED UP IN MIDTOWN HOUSTON.

The rifle is new and has never been fired.  Includes original box, manual, etc. Please contact me regarding any questions.  

The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x39 is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount, hand made walnut thumbhole stock. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years.

• 7.62x39.
• RPK-type receiver with extra reinforcements and a thicker receiver and barrel for superior accuracy.
• Bore is chrome-lined.
• Threaded Barrel with welded thread protector for importation (easily removed during conversion)
• Thumb hole wooden stock.
• Side rail.
• Comes with (1) 10rd and (1) 5rd mag Vepr mag
• SGM Tactical Surefire makes NJ legal Saiga 15 round magazines that work with this rifle
• Comes with manual and cleaning kit.
• 16-1/2"" barrel length.

Veprs are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcement each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!
Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.

A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.

1.	Why the Vepr is better than the average AK
2.	Hammer-Forged, Russian Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel.  Most durable AK Barrels Made.
Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.
Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionality was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.
3.	Most Accurate.  Consistently better groups than other AKs.
4.	True RPK Receiver.  Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver.  Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.
5.	The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market"

I will put a link and the description from the Adams Arms website below. 

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

CONSTRUCTION
The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine.
The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC.
The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor.
The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism.
The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety. The functioning of the mechanism greatly surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. 
The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer Dupont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.
The P-3AT is normally supplied with a 6 round single column steel magazine.

•Fiberglass bedded stock provide longevity
•X-Lock four-screw scope-mounting system

•60° bolt throw is easily operable with heavy gloves
•Rotary magazine feeds rounds in line with the bolt
 Browning's X-Bolt Composite 3D Bird's-Eye-Maple Rifles are packed with innovation that rivals firearms costing thousands more. Their 60° bolt lift prevents your thumb from hitting the scope and provides quick cycling for follow-up shots. The 3- to 5-lb. adjustable and predictable Feather Trigger breaks like glass at the precise moment for tack-driving accuracy. A lightweight polymer detachable-rotary magazine feeds the rounds in line with the bolt for perfect feeding into the chamber. An ergonomic top-tang safety quietly clicks into fire mode to prevent spooking your trophy. The bolt-unlock button atop the bolt lever provides peace of mind while unloading your firearm because it prevents the safety from being turned off to unlock the bolt. The receiver's X-Lock™ scope mounting system uses a four-screws-per-base design that secures the scope in accurate placement, providing reliable accuracy on demanding hunts. Glass bedded to provide a sturdy foundation, connecting the receiver to the stock. Inflex Technology recoil pad is constructed of a soft rubber that directs recoil forces to prevent muzzle climbing while drawing the comb away from your cheek. Matte-stainless steel receiver reduces game-spooking glare that keeps a showroom-quality finish. Matte-stainless barrel looks as good as it hunts. Free floating and hand chambered with a target crown, providing superior accuracy. Composite stock with a bird's-eye-maple finish resists the elements. Black-textured gripping panels on the forend and pistol grip provide a sure hold when the weather doesn't cooperate. Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides long-lasting dependability."

He bought it from an elderly guy that had moved down from Alaska.
My online research on this rifle shows that all of the rifle parts match for the timeline when it was manufactured.
It's all Springfield parts. The barrel has the usual issues with a WW ll gun, so I would rate the barrel as a shooter grade and the rifle as a service grade.

Made in Feb 1944 with the following parts #'s.

Serial # 2,606,8xx
Barrel # 3-S-A-2-44
Bolt # D 28287-12 SA
Trigger # D 28290-12-SA
Op Rod# D 35382 9 SA
Receiver # 28291 1 32


Stock has what appears to be the original cleaning rods and oiler can in the butt stock.
The stock has seen a lot of handling and has a nicely done home crack repair to the upper hand guard.
Op rod is uncut.
Comes with a bayonet (no sheath) and 8 enbloc clips (not shown).

I can't find any evidence of an arsenal rebuild, but I'm just learning about these rifles, so any advise on whether I'm correct about this being an original Garand would be appreciated.

I seriously don't think a screw has been turned on this one. For a 59-60 year old rifle, itt shows little to no wear in the regular places. The wood is nice. The metal is nice. Unfortunately I need to sell it. I have more pics or can take more with better close ups and would be happy to send them to your e-mail---just ask. I am pretty sure most of us know what these look like but if you are serious I will send you better pics of exactly what you need to see to help you decide that this is the one you have been looking for. Those places that look like the bluing is thin, are actually from the flash. The only thin bluing is near the muzzle and even this is very little.

I can meet at FFL for all transactions, including trades (no exceptions).  I will cover the FFL fee if we use my FFL in North Seattle.  Will consider using another established FFL buy fees will then be on the buyer.  FYI per several queries, this particular model, when you can find one, retails for $1300 and typically can be found discounted for just over $1100. The MSRP is on the product page here: http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p229-elite-stainless.aspx  Tax will add another 9.6%. I paid just over $1200 for mine.  My FFL charges $25 and no tax for a face to face transfer of a used gun.   The 9mm version is the most difficult to find as they sell out pretty quickly."
