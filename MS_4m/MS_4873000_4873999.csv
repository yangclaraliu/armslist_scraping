From pictures of springfield of the time it Looks to have been a flaming bomb Springfield (previous owner often past filed off the flaming bomb and slide markings(smooth on slide)..the slide still has the patent dates on the slide..no clue why they would remove lettering on slide.., was informed it was  reblued in the past not sure when or if the gun was reburbished for ww2 or something. Barrel proofed Springfield. Other internal parts appear to be proofed according to Springfield at the time. Period correct trigger as well.  There is some blue wearing on the backstrap and finger hold area, hand slide wear near front end edges , but still have that nice blue colt look to it..the barrel condition is great no rust or is sure with barrel..feels great in the hand. And every functions great on it..as it is it more of a shooter grade gun than high collector value since it doesn't have original mag, grips , and since it's been reblued...but it's cool to shoot this old gun..questions please ask.if you wanna see it in person that's fine..also if you have any information to why the markings may of been removed please share with me and I'll update this post"

Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.

Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability

The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. It’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.

I am the original owner of this rifle, purchased it 2 years ago and ran about 2,500 rounds through it. I bought it with the mind-set of modding it and seeing how far I can shoot with the .22lr. I was able to achieve shooting clay pigeons pretty accurately at 155yards outdoors and stretched it to about 180yards. I had a lot of fun with this rifle, but want to fund some other projects. Rifle shoots and operates fine. Only thing to note is the bx-25 mag is sometimes finicky with certain brand of .22lr's. Otherwise, rifle operates perfectly with it's original 10-rd mag. I have also tried a friend's generic 30-rd mag and it cycles fine. I had never worried too much about the bx-25 mag or took it to the level of addressing that.

Comes with: Scope, bi-pod, bx-25 mag, original 10-rd mag, and original wood stock.
*Scope and bi-pod isn't anything fancy. It works well and functions with a .22lr.

This is a 1994 Norinco MC5D (Monte Carlo 5rd Detachable) SKS.

Takes regular AK mags, not the ""duckbill"" ones. It sports the paratrooper length barrel and has the highly desirable milled triggerguard. All numbers matching. All metal parts are 98%+

I have the original lower stock, and unfortunately, someone down the line had a stroke of ""genius"" & decided they were going to mod the stock to take drum mags! Errrrrr!!! Anyways, if there's a deal struck, that will go with it.

It's currently sporting a brand new Archangel OPFOR stock, 4 position adjustable buttstock, 7 position adjustable cheek weld and recoil pad. Makes it sorta resemble an AK in ways.

Comes as seen, 1 Chinese mag, and original stock.

Anyways, make your offers, stupid ones get nixed and no reply.

This G27 is Massachusetts compliant with serial number BZB610. Manufactured date around August 1996. Comes with Tupperware box (not original to this handgun), two mags (the high capacity mag shown on pic is not included if you live in a restricted state. You will get 2 ten rds Glock mags, instead), one loader, one manual, one cleaning brush and one rod. All Glock stuff. Fixed front and adjustable rear sight. It's really a nice set. Very little wear and fading on barrel. Great and clean rifling. The grip has a nice plug in it. Brand new Glock recoil spring. I just replaced followers and mag springs. All internals polished.  I had it for many years and I have never had any malfunctions. It's hard to rate firearms but this one is between excellent and perfect, if using NRA rating system. Perhaps a 95% or 98%. It has some light scratches only noticeable during cleaning with solvents and under the light, but being completely honest here, this weapon looks and works absolutely great. I put about 200 rds after I got it and my gunsmith at FMJ estimated about 200 to 300 based on barrel wear, and if you know Glocks, this one has been barely broken down. It's a must see and I'll send you detailed pics of any part of the weapon upon request. We can meet in Newington here in Connecticut at Hoffman Gun for inspection. If you like it, you tell me the name and address of your FFL in Massachusetts and you can watch me drop the G27 at a local UPS so you can pick it up at your FFL in MA. Please make sure your FFL will accept firearms from non-licensees (private parties). I know a FFL in MA who charges $15 per handgun and accepts firearms from non-licensees, just in case you need help finding one. * Price is firm. Buyers pay shipping and FFL fees. No trades. As Is. All laws follow. When responding to this ad, if you are a serious buyer, please include name and phone #, so I know you're not a robot or a troller. Thank you for your interest."

This gun has a unique history. It was furnished by FNH for a side match at a 3 gun match in Georgia. The gun was a prize for the guy who won the match. Unfortunately he lived in Maine where 17 round magazines are outlawed.  He sold the gun to me. While I don’t know the exact round count it was factory fresh; shot just that one day. Let’s say 500 rounds down the tube to be safe. It’s barely broken in!!

It's had maybe a couple hundred rounds through it. The stock is finished with pine-tar for weather resistance. Right now it has a rubber buttpad to extend the length of pull a little bit, but I have the original plastic butt plate. Includes sling and carry case.
The sights are Skinner sights - really nice quality sights made by a fella up in Montana. The front is a blade, the rear is a peep. The aperture can be changed out for different sizes. The rear peep is screwed down to the scope mount holes giving a much better sight radius. The remaining holes have plug screws and the empty dovetail on the barrel has a dovetail blank. Really nice shooting rifle, deserves a good home and to be shot a lot.
This rifle is stamped North Haven CT and JM, so I assume it's a pre-Remington model. It's free from all of the problems that plagued the Remington Marlins.
