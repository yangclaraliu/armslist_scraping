Hello fellow firearm enthusiasts. We're a custom wood shop that specializes in high quality finishes for all of our projects. If you're like us, you know how a day in the field can be a little rough on a gun. Sometimes it's the picker bushes, sometimes somebody knocks it over. Unless it sits on a shelf for decoration, it's inevitable that a gun will find itself a victim of a knick or scratch. Or perhaps you're replacing the stock with a new laminated stock and need it finished.

We've been there so we also offer gun stock refinishing. Basic refinishing starts at $150. 

We've spent years developing our finishing techniques and believe we've found some of the best products on the market.

Let us know what you've got and we can give a quote."

In April I purchased a 10.5"" barrel AR pistol that came with a Sig Brace.  It took numerous attempts to register. The with the caliber written on the RI-060 as ""Multi"" from my FFL dealer.  They sent it back.  I contacted my FFL and they said they write that all the time and its fine so I contacted Lansing and they told me when they enter a caliber they don't have an option to enter ""multi"" so just write 5.56.  So I did and sent in the RI-060 again. Today I received a letter from the Michigan State Police Firearms Records Unit.  It stated that paperwork I submitted shows a barrel length of 10.5"" and a overall length of 27.5"".  This AR I bought came with a Flash suppressor and a Sig Brace on it.  So my FFL measured from front to back which was 27.5"".
This letter states that MCL 28.421 (1) (e) of the Michigan Firearms Act has recently changed and now defines a ""Pistol"" as a firearm 26"" or less, previously 28"" I believe.
So this letter stated that since my firearm was above 26"" it was not considered a pistol and therefore no registration was required and this registration will be removed from their database.
Also when I was talking to my FFL he told me that the firearm should be measured without the Sig brace on it (someone that works there screwed up) and if the muzzle break was not pinned or permanent, if it had a threaded one it should be measured to the end of the threads and not the end of the muzzle break which would take my overall measurement far below 26 inches therefore keeping classified as a pistol.
That doesn't make much sense to me but that's what he said. He said they are both parts that come off and are not necessarily part of the rifle so we do not need to include them in the overall measurement. 
Thanks Dan



I am still a little confused by this.  I asked my FFL, well then , wouldn't now be considered a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR)?  He said no be cause of the length.  So what exactly is the definition of an SBR now? That was the part I did not understand.  
Maybe someone with more knowledge than me can clarify this?

The value of these special edition Microtech knives only go up. I have been collecting them since 1996.  The knife has a black drop point blade with a tritium insert on the double action lever/switch. It also comes with a special fitted dust cover should you decide to carry it in your pocket. Unlike a Nemesis or HALO, you can carry it in your pocket and not really have to worry about it firing accidentally. Of all the Microtech knives I havevever owned, the Scarab navy edition has the strongest spring. When you fire it, the blase shoots out with authority and great strength. When open, there is no blade play and it feels like a fixed blade.  I am asking $1050 for it shipped to the lower 48. No international shipping.

The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual “gas-seal” system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile.  This one is a Tula made in 1931.  It works. I have fired it.  Comes with 3 packs of Russian surplus ammo  3 x 14 rounds

This AR-10T has fired less than 200 rds. In all likelihood it has had less than 100rds. All either bench or firing at coyotes with a twilight scope. 

It has a made in Japan 10x42 adjustable to distance/focus SWFA Classic ""Super Sniper"" Scope. This scope was made by the company that made the Bausch and Laumb Elite series scope for Bushnell. This scope has an NSN assigned to it- the Navy used them in testing, thus the NSN number. This one was mil-surp but never been mounted. They are nitrogen filled and the environment/temp/etc does not effect focus.

I am an a-hole in a hat when it comes to semi-auto bench rest shooting, but it honestly shoots like a bolt gun in terms of accuracy. I've shot into a pack of coyotes and dropped one dead and the resulting pass through crippled another and I got him later.

From the factory:
In production for nearly a century, the SA-22 is unlike any other rimfire rifle on the market. Much more than ""just a 22,"" the history of this fine rifle can be traced back to the mind of the gunmaker himself, John M. Browning, and is a lasting tribute to his genius. 

The SA-22 is sure to become your favorite plinker and varmint rifle. It is lightweight and easy to carry on a squirrel hunt, and easy to load for a day of plinking at the range. Construction quality and materials are top notch to ensure longevity and lasting beauty. The fine Walnut stock is sharply Checkered and polished to a sheen.

The SA-22 ejects fired brass out the bottom of the receiver to make shooting a pleasure for right- and left-handed operators. Perhaps the most interesting feature is the ability to take the rifle down into two parts — the buttstock and receiver and the forearm and barrel — for storage or to simplify cleaning.

A popular upgrade for the SA-22 is to add the aluminum scope base and a scope. This combination makes shooting more accurate and more fun than ever. When the rifle is taken down, the base and optic stay with the barrel to help ensure zero is not affected.    

Get your hands on a piece of history. Pick up an SA-22 today.

From the manufacturer:

1301 Tactical: Ultimate Reliability for Home-Defense, Law-Enforcement

The 1301 is Beretta's new gas operated semi-automatic shotgun designed for law-enforcement and home-defense.

1301-Tactical-intro

Engineered to be ultra-reliable and easy to use, it has all the features that a modern tactical shotgun should offer—and more. And thanks to its compact size (barrel length: 18.5”), it is ideal for negotiating tight spaces as well as for being safely stored away when not needed.


Easy-CustomizationEasy Operation, Plenty of Features

Right out of the box, the 1301 Tactical features an oversized charging handle, large textured bolt release and an oversized reversible safety button. This makes it easy to use under most weather or lighting conditions—your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the fore-end and stock makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves. As far as sighting, the 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, giving the user the opportunity to adapt it to its intended use, whatever the conditions.


Easy Customization to Most Shooters’ NeedsEasy-Operation

Although perfect out of the box, this tactical shotgun is easily adaptable to most users’ needs, body type and shooting posture. The stock is adjustable for length of pull with provided spacers, so that you can ensure it will always come up naturally to your shoulder and point easily to where you are looking. Drop and cast are adjustable as well. And for extra flexibility in customization and accessorization, the receiver offers a MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail, making it a snap to add tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or modification to the shotgun.



Super-Fast-ShootingSuper-Fast Shooting

The integrated BLINK gas operating system, featuring a cross tube gas piston, allows the 1301 Tactical to cycle 36% faster than any other shotgun on the market. This also makes it ideal for three-gun tactical competitions: when shooting the 1301 Tactical, you will simply and objectively have an edge over your competitors. And regardless of the use, with a 1301 Tactical you will always know that you have the best of Beretta to rely upon—with its unmatched 500 years of experience, passion and know-how.

Also available is the 1301 Comp, a version of this shotgun optimized for 3-gun and tactical matches.


NOTE FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: In conformance to federal law, the magazine-extension tube is available only as an after-market accessory that the customer may purchase separately and install."

These are nearly as accurate as the Pythons and top anything made by other manufacturers of the period-hence they Colts were favored for Competition..and ruled at the range.
I ve had this Colt since 1982-I m the second owner.It spent many years in my car/truck when I traveled as my go to defensive weapon. Last year I sent it out for a tuneup-had some springs replaced and a new hand fitted (all Colt factory Python parts) and then had it refinished. Has Hogue Mono Grips ,factory accro adjustable site,and couole speed loaders with it.
Pic of target below is a testament yo how accurate these pistols are-shot couple weeks (+/-) back at Armsroom with 130gr fmj offhanded at 25 yards. Single action is crisp and light,double action is light and predictable-lockup is tight.

Unfired and in essence ""new"", but not exactly like new in box because of handling marks on the stock and scope rail (I scoped it once).  However, blueing and bore are pristine.  (I also believe I have the original box and papers around here somewhere - if I cannot find them, then subtract $30 off my listed price below).

This less-common Varmint version has the 20.5"" heavy barrel and wide forearm.  Not sure why it says 452 American on the side - it's definitely the Varmint version.  Comes with one all-metal 5-round magazine.

CZ doesn't make the 452 any more, just the 455.  Very nice rifle.

Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety.

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."
