This is a PSA build rifle in very good condition, with less than 200 rounds through it. Built from a PSA rifle kit, so it is all PSA aside from the lower (Anderson), and the upper was bought complete so it was factory assembled. Has a 20 inch HBAR FN made chrome lined barrel with a 1:10 twist, fixed A2 front sight, fixed A2 stock, and magpul MOE handguard and grip. Has a Bushnell AR223 1-4 power scope on it, zeroed at 25 meters (shot 1 inch groups offhand with XM193). Have 8 magazines for it and about 100 rounds of XM193 5.56 ammo. Have $1200 invested in it.

Its in great shape and I've enjoyed it, but I rarely shoot my rifles, so if I'm going to only have one Id rather have something in .30 caliber. I'm looking for a .308 battle rifle of some sort (PTR91, Springfield M1A STD, similar), or a nice AK47 (No WASR's). Would also consider a .357 magnum lever action rifle. Depending on what you have I can also include a NIB Glock 22 for a higher value trade. Would consider a lower value trade plus cash or a handgun of some sort (9mm or .40, no Taurus or Kel Tec). or I could do a deal without the scope. Would also be very interested in an S&W M&P R8.

IT ALSO HAS AN OPTION THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE. MID BARREL AND MUZZLE END BEADS. THE FINISH ON THE BARRELS IS IN GREAT SHAPE FOR A 62 YEAR OLD GUN. THERE IS ONE VERY SMALL DING ON THE TOP OF THE LEFT BARREL ABOUT 9"" FROM THE MUZZLE, BUT I DOUBT IT WILL INTERFERE WITH PATTERNING AND WILL NOT CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS WITH SHOOTING. THE BORES ARE BRIGHT AND SHINY WITH NO RUST, DUST OR PITTING AT ALL.

IT LOCKS UP TIGHT AND THE EXTRACTOR FUNCTIONS AS IT SHOULD. THE COLORS FROM THE CASE HARDENING HAS FADED FROM USE AND AGE, BUT ABOUT 50% REMAINS. TRIGGERS FUNCTION AND THE SAFETY WORKS AS IT SHOULD.

NOW, THE STOCKS FRONT AND REAR HAVE BEEN REFINISHED WITH A BEAUTIFUL GLOSS OIL FINISH. THE CHECKERING HAS BEEN REFRESHED AND LOOKS BETTER THAN WHAT THE FACTORY USUALLY DID WITH THIS SERIES. THE STOCKS WERE NOT SANDED DOWN TO COMPLETELY NEW WOOD WHEN THEY WERE REFINISHED TO RETAIN THE SIZE AND THE ""OLD"" SENSE. THERE IS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL DING AT THE TOE END OF THE BUTTSTOCK WHERE IT MEETS THE BUTTPLATE. THE REST OF BOTH THE FORE AND BUTTSTOCK ARE AS SMOOTH AS A BABY'S BEHIND AND SLICK AS GLASS. BROWNING DOESN'T DO A FINISH LIKE THIS. THE BUTTSTOCK HAS AN EPOXY REPAIRED CRACK BEHIND THE FRAME THAT WAS REPAIRED BEFORE THE STOCK WAS REFINISHED. IT'S HARDLY NOTICEABLE, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW IT'S THERE.

The barrel is finished inside and out with a highly durable and corrosion resistant Black Nitride, a treatment that produces an extremely hard, slick surface on the steel that resists carbon adhesion for easier cleaning and maintenance. The Nitride process converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside a barrel's bore.  This 16"" barrel features a 1 in 7"" twist and is threaded 5/8""-24 at the muzzle for easy installation of flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and/or sound suppressors. It utilizes the versatile carbine length gas system, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure. Barrel assembly includes a carbine gas tube, low profile steel gas block, barrel extension and locator pin. Also includes a AAC Blackout 51 tooth Flash Hider for Flash Suppression or Quick attach/ detach of AAC suppressors. A $105.00 value.¬† Requires barrel nut for installation (not included).

The rifle has only seen 30 rounds from me and it functioned flawlessly.  The rifle comes with the original magazine along with a steel 30 round mag and a sling.  Rifle does not include a bayonet.

The characteristics that set this apart from other C2C holsters is, when in the holster, the entire pistol is surrounded by ABS plastic that allow for a snug fit. I know that other holsters just have one side of the pistol touching plastic and the other against leather. After time, the snug fit isn't so snug any more.

The only mistake that needs to be corrected on this firearm is the beaver tail. The safety was improperly fitted, and the grip safety does not function. The other safeties function 100%. I'm not one who is worried about the beavertail safety too much, but I know plenty of people want it to work which I respect."

Steel jacket copper coated bullet in steel case, NON-CORROSIVE, made by the comrades who later made Bear and Wolf ammo. This reliable slightly spicey ammo came in sealed plastic packs of 2 boxes of 50 rounds each for long term storage and long distance shipping. I think it was the first ammo available after clinton cut off the Chinese supply.Sold the Makarov years ago but found these in the back of a safe forgotten. If you have a 9X18 Makarov, Tokarev, or CZ, you probably know this ammo is not sold everywhere and a gun without ammo = scrap metal. No shipping, trades, or offers. I don't do pictures but you can Google it. If you just want 1 box of 50, I'll open the sealed plastic and sell 1 for $30. AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL CASH SALE ONLY.¬† There are probably a couple of boxes¬† of ""shooter"" 9 X 18 in the basement for $20 a box.

For your consideration is this nice Remington Model 14-R. It has a 18"" barrel chambered for 30 Remington. The wood finish is very nice with a few light scratches and 1 1/4"" ding. Not sure, but I believe that the wood has been refinished. The metal finish is a nice shiny blue with a light rust spot on the left side of the receiver. The original rear sight is missing and a Williams Peep was added to the receiver. The checkered metal butt plate is in good condition with no dings or dents. The gun shows little wear on the action bar and magazine.

Boat has Bennett trim system on it.
Has two live wells (need to be wired up) I have an extra pump as well. Boat has hydro steering. I have all the cushions for the front and sides as well but they need to be recovered.
The tilt trim system has a leak it only leaks if you leave the motor up. Boat has soft spot behind the console.
Boat ran fine last time we ran it to horn island, but the last time we went out it went into limp mode. I replace the water pump, I think it maybe the thermostat or a sensor. I was going to get it fixed but my kids informed me that they wanted jet skis again and don't want the boat. 

Trailer has 4 new tires as well.

Price is 6k as is for an extra 500$ I'll throw in a running Yamaha 150 just needs a tilt trim unit. It was the motor that came off the boat before I put the 200 on it.

Boat is also full of fuel. 85 gallons of non ethanol 93 oct with 50:1 mixture. It has the tank for oil injection but I run premix. I trust it more.

The new Guardian 22 is shorter, stronger, and quieter. We raised the bar, not the price.+The entire serialized registered part (not just a thread insert, like a few of our competitors) is now made of heat treated 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer.A 316 stainless steel tube to handle your most abusive use.All baffles are encased K baffles, providing a ""tube within a tube"" for ease of cleaning and durability.The first baffle is stainless steel, with all other baffles constructed from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminum for strength and durability.Length and outside diameter have been reduced.Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 model.Retail price unchanged at $199.You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.SuppressionThe Guardian 22 compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.MaintenanceJust because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.Guardian 22 baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.With the Guardian 22 full user servicability is a reality. We are so confident you will be able to service the Guardian 22 yourself we offer the only clean silencer guarantee in the industry. If your Guardian 22 gets so dirty you can't clean it yourself, send it back to us and we'll clean it for free. Yes, free. Who else makes such a guarantee? No one. How can we do this?

I bought this a year ago and barely used it ( not even broke in yet ) perhaps 50 rounds down the pipe ( chrome barrel )
no failures of any kind using ( junk ) Tula ammo , highly impressive accuracy even with subpar ammo ...

I know I brag this up a lot you you must be wondering why I want to sell it or trade it ...
well its simple I just do not use it as I also have the Sar B6p compact that is use as my every day carry
( 2500 rounds through it not 1 failure with the same junk ammo ) so they are a very reliable handgun but also very hard to find

CZ75 like but IMO better build quality , take it apart and see for yourself ...

In addition, an Envelope Feeder Attachment is available for high-volume envelope printing environments.
Canon's patented RAPID Fusing System‚Ñ¢ dramatically reduces energy consumption costs while virtually eliminating long warm-up periods typically associated with conventional solutions.

I am a private FFL dealer located in northeast Nebraska, specifically South Sioux City. I am putting this ad up to generate some business interest and help out my fellow 2nd amendment supporters. If you are looking for any firearms, optics, reloading supplies including powder, or anything related, I'll do my best to locate and provide competitive price points. I don't have much stock right now but will be adding as time goes on. Availability continues to be volitle and very unpredictable in some areas notably .22 rim fire as well as certain specific weapons. Others are plentiful and reasonably priced. I can also do transfers and welcome transfer requests. I'll charge a reasonable fee. After all, the ATF expects us to operate as a business and keeping them happy seems like good business sense.

I've talked to many folks at the dealer as well as the wholesale level and the consensus is most of the .22 ammo is going to the big box retainers who do business directly with the manufactures. Most local gun stores, myself included do business with distributers who are telling me time and time again that they are not seeing it in any appreciable quantities. 

Despite this, I've managed to find quantities of .22 and can get some to resale. I will not gouge and will say up front that anything I find will be available for a penny per round above what I end up paying. I don't buy junk and refuse to pay unreasonable prices just to say I found some. That being said, specific brands or favorites my or may not be available. I can't get case quantities and will spread out what I can get. 

Thanks for taking the time to read and God Bless

This rifle is commonly called a model M96/38 since it was originally a 29"" barreled M96 that was later converted to the handier 24"" barreled M38. The receiver for the rifle was manufactured by Carl Gustaf in 1902 using high-end machine tool quality Swedish steel. 

The receiver, bolt, bolt handle, bolt release, barrel bands, magazine floor plate, and butt plate all have matching serial numbers.The stock, metal, and bore are all in good condition, although most of the bluing is missing. The rifle shoots very well; uses a fast cycling ""cock on closing"" action;  and is capable of producing groups as tight as the shooter can manage. The 6.5 Swedish round is perhaps the best all around rifle cartridge of that era with its mild recoil, excellent ballistic coefficient, and favorable sectional density.

The P250¬Æ, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER¬Æ P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Winchester model 42 410 pump. Please do your research.
this is what I found on blue book.

first pump specifically designed for the .410 bore, hammerless, 2 1/2 (introduced 1935) or 3 in. chamber, 26 or 28 in. barrel, plain walnut pistol grip stock with circular grooved forearm (modified 1947), invented by William Roemer, approx. 6 1/2 - 7 lbs. Approx. 164,800 mfg. in 4 grades between 1933-1963.
Add 40% to any Model 42 chambered for 2 1/2 in. shells.
Add 25% for factory installed Cutts compensator (no choke marking on barrel).
Add 25% for pre-war guns.
Subtract 50% for non-factory installed Cutts compensator (choke marked on barrel).
Special order features on field guns have captured much collector interest in recent years. Combinations of these features can add a considerable percentage to the base values listed. Special orders on rare variations are very desirable, and prices can double, or more than double, if the combination is right.
A note on Model 42 Vent. Ribs:
Early Model 42 vent. ribs were designed ""Winchester Special Ventilated Rib"" circa 1954 in the 125,000 ser. no. range. This rib had a wavy line matting on top of the rib, no stamping on the side, is known as the ""Doughnut"" post rib, and were in production until the end of 1957 with approx. ser. no. 149,000. The second variation Model 42 rib appears on guns in the approx. ser. no. range 141,000-149,000. This rib was made with both solid and hollow round posts. All parts for the vent. rib were made at the Winchester plant. A third variation was introduced at the end of 1957, when Winchester decided to send its Model 42 barrels to the Simmons Gun Specialty Co. in Kansas City for installation of the vent. ribs. In-the-white barrels were proofed in New Haven and marked on the left side so that the rib would not cover up the proofmark before shipment to Simmons. The ser. no. was not stamped on the receiver extension until the gun was completely assembled. This last variation, or oval post, appears on Model 42s starting at approx. ser. no. 150,000. This third variation is marked either ""SIMMONS PATENTED"" or ""SIMMONS GUN SPECIALTY CO., KANSAS CITY, MO"". The longer Simmons marking was stamped on the rib until the end of production.
  Model 42 Slide Action Standard Grade	Add to Collection

I have a premium condition CZ 612 shotgun for sale.  It has been fired 6 times during last year deer season.  This is a very impressive shotgun. It is very light but the recoil is very manageable and it is modeled after the Remington 870 as far as mode of operation.  It has dual action bars, synthetic stock and cross bolt safety.  It can fire 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells.  This is a cylinder bore so no chokes.  It holds 5 rounds in the tube and one in the pipe.  Let me know if you are interested.

It comes with the manual - remind me to tell/show you how to take it down since it is a tad different than the manual shows.  You have to depress a plastic release button as you turn the magazine spring retainer.

I am selling a Barrett M107A1 sniper rifle to help fund my next firearms project.
I have a couple of them so I'm not desperate to sell so please don't think I will take some lowball offer

I have successfully shot steel targets at 1800+ yards with both 660gr & 760gr bullets and have found this setup to be consistently accurate.

I purchased the gun new and added the Nightforce scope and the Barrett BORS system.

The gun has been properly broke in according to manufacturers specifications.

My wife is 5'3"" 110lbs and she enjoys shooting this gun. There is minimal recoil.

I am willing to sell the rifle for $10,000.00 without the scope and BORS system or for $13,500.00 as shown.

The rifle itself retails for $14,000.00 the scope was over $2,000.00 and the BORS and mount was around $2,000.00 as well so the price is a good one for this setup.

I have over 1300 rounds of ammo that I am willing to make a deal on as well. It will be much less than it costs in the store.

Barretts BORS Information


LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE.
The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.

BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.

After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.

BORS
The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.

Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles.

It‚Äôs much smoother than Hard Chrome, it‚Äôs easier to clean, makes the rifle cycle smoother, it can be run almost lube free for thousands of rounds, and it will never chip, peal, or flake off! Because of these benefits, Nickel Boron is being adopted by the Military as well as many Government agencies. As you can see, these BCGs are a huge improvement over a standard Phosphate BCG and it‚Äôs even an improvement over Hard Chrome.
Upgrade to a better BCG today. You won‚Äôt be sorry!
NOTE: This BCG works in AR-15s. This BCG does NOT make your rifle fully-automatic.
Machined from 8620 Tool Steel (Carrier) and 158 Carpenter Steel (Bolt)
Shrouded firing pin.
