The stock is flawless and the bore is very good. The person who had the gun before me removed the rear sight and mounted a scope. i have an original rear sight for it all you need is a roll pin from home depot or lowes to place through the rear sight and base. it will come with a bsa sweet 8x32 scope. the scope is very clear and crisp. this is a great gun for someone who likes bolt guns. the mauser action is one of the most sought after actions. it will always be smooth and feel like butter. it saw two range trips and only put 40 rounds through it myself. it was accurate and reliable. this gun just doesn't see enough action for me  to keep it.

What I have here is a brand new 5 + 1 Escort Tactical Pump Shotgun at a really great price, with extras. This gun has never been shot; I repeat. I have not put one single shell though this firearm. I like this gun a lot, but I decided to sell it because I just don't have the time to get out and shoot. I would rather put it in the hands of someone that’s ready to use it.

These Escorts pumps are very high quality. I believe because they are made by a company called Hatsan in Turkey, people assume there might be quality issues, but I don't believe this is the case. I went over this gun very closely when I bought it and I didn't really see any weak points, just look at the pictures for yourself. The slide action is smooth and solid, and it balances well. There's a picatinny rail at the bottom and top, so it's ready for upgrades. The fiber optic sights work well in the daylight, but for low light, just pop a red dot sight on top and you're set.

I wanted to make sure that you won't find a better deal on a shotgun than this one, so I really marked down the price and added some extras. Here's how it breaks down:

HAT00062  Escort Tactical Home Defense Pump…...$275
55 Rounds of Assorted slugs and No. 00 buckshot…...$40
4 A-zoom practice blanks (comes in packs of 2)…..$10
Limbsaver recoil pad…..$15
Case......$10

There you go. If you're looking for a great shotgun with some extras, all at a great price, this is the one. Let me know if you have any questions. There was a three picture limit, but if you want more pictures I would be happy to send them, because this is really an attractive well made firearm. 

All of the items are sold together. Only local buyers please. 

Thanks, -Craig"

I like this gun a lot. But I just want to get something else or want a handgun. No canted sights. Handguards has the Russian red/orange stain finished. Also has the correct Krinkov type muzzle brake. It also has a magazine release extension, and a Russian red bakelite pistol grip. Factory black plastic pistol grip is also included. Must have CCDWL to trade this gun. Kentucky residents only.

*** Update: (12/16/15) Trade only. Unless you want to pay my full cash price of $550, like I've mentioned above. Then it's yours. And please stop sending me emails to just low ball me, and offer me below my asking price. It's insulting. If you don't like my price or trade value, you don't have to reply.

I’m not a lawyer and I don’t pretend to offer legal advice. Do your own research. There is nothing magical or quasi-anything about AR Pistols. The above discussed AR Upper is just that, an AR Upper. It’s not a ‘pistol’ or a ‘rifle’ in this configuration. I refer to it as a pistol because I’m thinking ‘pistol’ and if anyone wants to think ‘rifle’ (as in SBR, Short Barrel Rifle) then that’s their concern. An AR Lower can be a “Pistol Lower” or a “Rifle Lower”. This is merely a designation based upon a collection of parts and the intended use of the lower, also called “Constructive Intent”. This is a hugely important point. An AR lower created as a “Rifle Lower” must remain a rifle lower and the fitment of a barrel less than 16” is a modification to the rifle creating an Undocumented SBR. Having said that, it is quite easy to stay on the sunny side of life and the BATF and complete your AR Pistol without concern. As I am aware, an AR lower that is initially assembled as a “Pistol Lower”, can be used as a pistol lower and also can be converted to a rifle lower and back again as often as you wish. A Pistol Lower will have a buffer tube (receiver extension), maybe with a pad, and/or one of a couple of approved products like the SIG Brace or the KAK Industry Shockwave. To use the same” Pistol Lower” as an AR Rifle and fired from the shoulder, you will likely have some sort of buttstock. This is another hugely important point. If the buttstock ends up on your pistol upper, you have made it into an SBR. The best way to create yourself an AR Pistol is to buy a stripped AR lower and build it into a “Pistol Lower”. This is not at all a difficult process. An important point; make all your new stripped lowers into pistol lowers first. Also, you cannot use a Vertical Grip on an AR Pistol unless its overall length is 26” or greater. A vertical grip on an AR Pistol shorter than 26” creates an undocumented AOW (Any Other Weapon). The AFG (Angled Foregrip) or similar is legal for the AR Pistol."

Listed here is a Remington Model 600, chambered in 6mm, with an 18"" barrel.

The rifle is equipped with a Leupold Vari-X II 2-7 scope, with Weaver mounts. 
I am not entirely sure of the history of this rifle and I'm unsure if this is the original stock or not, educate me if you are more aware than I! But, it is a beautiful stock and if not original it has to be a higher end custom job.
Also, unsure of the trigger but it is the smoothest and lightest trigger I've ever pulled. Just bought a brand new Model 700 SPS Tactical and this trigger makes the 700 SPS feel like dragging a 2x4 over sandpaper.

Overall, the rifle is in great shape. This a fairly rare model, as the 600 was only produced between 1964 and 1967. The stock is near perfect condition, the bluing of the barrel shows very minor ""wear"", as pictured.

The rifle will also come with 69 rounds of factory ammunition in the original boxes. One could estimate the box's are from the 60's as well. 27 brass cases also included. Lastly, a brown rifle case is included, likely to have been purchased with the rifle originally. 

From what I can tell, an original 600 with a ""standard"" stock and nothing else included goes for around $600-800.
I'm going to start off with asking $800 for everything.

Please let me know any questions you may have!

Hornady 366 Reloader 20ga 2.75""
Hornady's 366 Auto Shotshell Reloading Press is the ideal press for the avid target shooter. The time-tested design lets you load high-quality, low-cost ammo in a hurry, just set the case and wad in place, and pull the handle. The 366 Auto does the rest, automatically.
FEATURES INCLUDE:
PRIMER TUBE FILLER
Every 366 Auto includes our Primer Tube Filler. Holds a full box of shotshell primers, and fills the tube with a turn of the dial. Will not drop primers upside-down into the tube.
EASY EMPTY POWDER AND SHOT HOPPER TUBES
If you need to empty your powder or shot, this entire assembly can be easily removed without spilling, a feature unique to the 366 Auto. Baffles let powder and shot flow more smoothly for more uniform loads from start to finish.
AUTOMATIC PRIMER FEED SYSTEM
Makes priming shells automatic with the pull of the handle. Extremely smooth and reliable design reduces to nearly zero the chances of crushing the primer. Primer Tube Filler ensures no upside-down primers enter the feeder tube.
THREE-STAGE TAPER LOC CRIMPING
Starts crimp, closes and tapers. Perform more reliable crimping with both six or eight point crimps. Give factory taper to your shells.
PRIMER FEEDER SHUT-OFF (optional)
SPRING LOADED SEATER PUNCH (optional)
STANDARD SHOT AND POWDER BUSHINGS
These easy-to-change standard bushings make it easy to switch to a different shot or powder for most popular target loads.
POWDER SHUT-OFF AND SHOT SHUT-OFF
The shut-offs for powder and shot let you operate the machine as you need to by shutting off individual stations.
SWING-OUT WAD GUIDE
The wad guide swings out to give you better access, making it easier to place the wad. Helps to speed up your reloading.
AUTOMATIC INDEXING
Each pull of the lever automatically rotates the shell plate, so you do not have to do it manually. You will be amazed at how much faster and smoother your reloading efforts go with auto indexing.
FULL-LENGTH RESIZING STATION
You can resize your shells to factory dimensions, or skip this station entirely and speed up your reloading. Many presses force you to resize. The 366 Auto gives you the choice.
PRIMER CATCHER
Every pull of the handle ejects the spent primer from fired shells into the primer catcher for neat, easy disposal.
AUTOMATIC SHELL EJECTION
Completed shells are automatically ejected behind the press, so you don't have to remove them manually. Another speed advantage over other presses.
SHOT DRAIN HOLES IN SHELL PLATE
If you reload, you will eventually spill shot. Spilled shot rolls to the edge of the shell plate and through the holes, so it won't jam.
ALL DIECAST CONSTRUCTION
Solid die-cast frame is long lasting, and provides a stable, rigid platform for precision reloading."

Listed here is a Weatherby 340 Magnum Mark V 26"" Barrel. What a rifle! 
Fitted with a Leupold Vari-X III 2.5-8 and Buehler Rings, this rifle is nearly flawless! 
From what I can tell there is only one noticeable blemish on the rifle, as pictured on the back portion of the cheek rest on the stock. 
This is one beautiful firearm. I got the opportunity to fire it before listing it for sale, and I must say holy ****! Talk about a cannon. This is one you want to make sure you have a firm hold on.

Along with the rife, I have 280 rounds of ammo in the original boxes. If you aren't familiar, $5 a round would be a realistic estimate. That makes for $1400 in ammo alone.

I'm listing this as a package to begin with, $2000 for the lot.
Would take $1200 for the gun, or $1000 for the ammo. Willing to separate the ammo for $80 per box!

This is a Russian type 45 SKS. The SKS is one of the best rifles and the Russian is the best of the SKSs. These are very well made and have a chrome lined bore. They last forever. I used it as my hog gun in northern California so it has some scuffs and dings from much carrying but only approximately 150 rounds fired through it. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount but I no longer have the mount as I found the scope to be a hindrance in the thick brush encountered in hog hunting. When I did have the scope it would group 5 rounds into about 2.5 inches at 100 yards easily. This is really good for a semi automatic military type rifle. Also included is between 1150 and 1200 rounds of East German steel core armor piercing ammo and 400 rounds of regular ammo. Also included is (39) 10 round stripper clips. The East German ammo is very accurate and I have never had a malfunction of any kind with it. Actually I have never had a malfunction of any kind with this rifle but from past experience I believe real military ammo to be more reliable than commercial ammo. The regular ammo is just for the fun shooting. I would consider a partial trade for a lever action .357 or a Glock or Sig 9mm. I don't hunt anymore so except for a fun rifle such as the 357 lever I can't see what else I might be interested in although you could run something by me. We might also consider a small camping trailer but nothing too big or heavy."

New Haven is one of O.F. Mossberg & Sons' private, promotional brands. The New Haven 600 is identical to the Mossberg 500 from O.F. Mossberg & Sons, with the addition of an anti-rattle system in the magazine tube. The 600 series comprises widely varying models of hammerless, pump action repeaters, all of which share the same basic receiver and action, but differ in bore size, barrel length, choke options, magazine capacity, and ""furniture"" (stock and forearm) materials.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
