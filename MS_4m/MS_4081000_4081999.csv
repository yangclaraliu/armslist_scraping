With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP.
 Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.
 The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length."

Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades. It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment .22 LR it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.

Practical, Safe and Reliable

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

This motor has good compression and is in good shape but it needs a few things.
Here is the list of what I think it needs:
-An oil change 
-A good cleaning
-A new flywheel (the old one cracked)
-a new set of points and condenser 
-possibly a new coil

I have already cleaned the carburetor and the gas tank was empty before the previous owner put it away so there is no varnish or gum built up inside.
There is a dent in the gas tank but it doesn't leak. It's rusty in some areas but it doesn't affect the function of anything. I also have a new sparkplug for it. 

I'd like to get $50 obo

Bought it new almost exactly 2 years ago to the day. Have shot between 1000-1500 rounds through it with not a single hiccup. The gun is  completely stock except for I installed a Ghost Ultimate 3.5 pound trigger connector. That turned an already good trigger into a GREAT trigger. I have the original 10 and 17 round mags along with 2 additional 10 round mags with pinky extensions. I also have a Crossbreed supertuk deluxe for it that I have had for about a year and half. Also a Galaco IWB that I can't remember the name of it. I use it for quick IWB carry and mostly just holding the gun on the nightstand and for when I have the gun in my truck to help keep scratches off it and to keep the trigger guard covered. Both the gun and holster have typical wear showing. I would not post this if it was not 100% reliable. Asking $450 OBO for the whole package. Willing to split up the gun from the holsters but would like to sell as a package. I am going to grad school and will be needing money so sorry no trades and please no low ball offers. Thanks

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

For sale is my Egyptian built maadi AK 47. 
Russia sold a complete set of machinery to the Egyptian government which was than set up in the town of maadi. This is as close as your likely to get to owning a Soviet Era AK 47. As is common among maadi rifles the finish is not in great shape however the gun fires any kind of ammo I have ever offered it. There is no pitting or damage to the bore. 
Sold with the rifle is 370 rds, 6 steel Bulgarian mags and a site tool. 
This is a blast to shoot. I am selling it because I never take it out to the range but, it's super fun to shoot. 
Feel free to offer trades and if it's worth more but I want what you have i have money to make the trade equal.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The suppressor and tube are so thin it looks like the rifle simply has a bull-barrel.The suppressor tube is held in place with the factory flash hider so any tool that will remove the flash hider is all you need to maintain the suppressor. They even engineered a special ""scraper"" into the design so that the tube will remain easy to remove regardless of how dirty the tube is.They (IA) take a standard Smith & Wesson 15-22 and make it stealth quiet. The barrel is ported to give you the ability to use high velocity ammunition while achieving subsonic velocities. You read that correctly, no need for subsonic ammo. In fact you are not supposed to use subsonic ammo in this gun. This gun utilizes a patented one piece core that is machined from billet stainless steel bar stock and is completely user serviceable. The construction of the integral is built to last! It is also FULL AUTO RATED so it can handle some serious use. You can add a Slide Fire stock and upgraded trigger and you can bump fire this all day long. Close as you can get to a silences/suppressed full-auto without a $10,000+ purchase price. Tons of fun! This will quickly become a rifle that you’ll take to the range every time. The only complaint that you’ll have is that you are spending too much money on .22lr ammo. Now that .22lr is starting to be available again at reasonable prices there is no reason not to purchase this. Here are the Smith & Wesson specs: Capacity: 25 Round Detachable Magazine Action: Blow Back Semi-Auto Front Sight: Adjustable A2 Post Rear Sight: Adjustable Dual Aperture Collapsible Stock: 6-Position CAR Stock Weight: approximately 5.5 lbs.

I bought the bike back in the spring as a project. The bike was wrecked but i have gone back and fixed everything. It does have a salvage title but I will be sending off for rebuilt tittle soon. Only things left to do is set up suspension and put all the plastics back on. I have everything for it. Motor has 13,xxx miles on it and just changed the oil and filter before the winter also have new plugs and air filter to put on when it warms up. Tires have 90% tread left. Chain and sprockets are good. Just flushed front and rear brake fluids and put new fluid in, also installed new pads on front (rear pads were good). Has a new radiator and fluid too. I recently plastidipped the rims orange with gold metalizer. Exhaust has a yoshi rs 3 can that i shortened. I have a 8000k hid light kit for headlights when I finish it. I installed an 03 954rr led tail light to clean up the rear end, also have led signal lights ill be installing soon. The fairings have minor scratches, nothing to bad. The right side fairing though I had to use zip ties to stitch it back together doesnt look bad. The nose faring and front fender is new unpainted but Im getting those painted soon. No dents in the gas tank. Ive got a new tinted windscreen also to put back on it. Got a new battery and can start the bike to show it runs. I think thats it, I'll still be working on the bike weather permitting until I finish it or get rid of it. I want to keep it (and may if the right trade does not come along) but i have 2 kids and the wife doesnt  like the idea of it. Trade value $2,500.

 There may be an attempt going on to ban it. But there is no ban yet. The ATF is being sued by several people and have very good cases. 

Do not give gougers the time of day. Part of the reason gouging happens is because people give the gougers their money. If you don't give them anything, the prices won't skyrocket. Do not believe anything the gougers say. If the post has the words ""get it before its banned."" Ignore it and report it for a scam, because that's exactly what it is."

The barrels for the turkey and waterfowl shotgun are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions. Unlike other backbored brand barrels, this unique design spans the entire length of the barrel, providing a gas ''cushion'' for the shot charge. Not only does overboring reduce felt recoil, it also reduces pellet deformation and internal barrel friction, resulting in the exceptionally uniform, dense shot patterns for which Mossberg overbored shotguns are renowned. Both combos are finished in Mossy Oak Infinity, one has a 24'' fully-rifled Slugster barrel and 24'' Overbored Turkey Barrel, and the other has a 28'' and a 24'' Overbored barrels. Both combo feature fiber optic sights. **This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.

It utilizes a long-stroke piston system modeled after the ultra-reliable AK-47.
This thing RUNS. Have fired somewhere between 600-700 rounds. Not a single malfunction of any kind, not once. I've fed it everything from quality brass to cheap steel cased Russian stuff like silver bear. it Eats Anything you feed it. It also runs extremely clean, significantly cleaner than DI guns. This is of course due to the design, gases are not kept in contact with the BCG, rather they are pushed into the piston tube. Upper breaks down exactly how a DI upper would, except there is a piston rod attached to the BCG. It is the simplest and most reliable piston AR design out there. All the other piston ARs (I've tried most of them..LWRC Barrett POF LMT Sig etc) operate using short-stroke piston designs which utilize more proprietary parts and result in more metal on metal action, and IMO are more problematic (at least potentially, someday down the road). The other thing I should mention on the topic of other piston guns, is that all the other piston ARs I've tried (while nice) are no where near as light or as well-balanced as the PWS. Most the other piston ARs are front heavy and/or bulky. The PWS is as light as a DI and AS well-balanced as a DI. Weighs in under 7lbs.  Also shoots very flat..the FSC556 muzzle break flash hider is excellent.

Do your research and you'll find not a single bad review on PWS. It is not quite as well known a company as say LWRC, but I believe it is due to marketing, not the quality of builds, b/c PWS has an extremely loyal fan base. I for one am not interested in buying any other rifles outside of the PWS brand. Only selling b/c I'm tight on cash, otherwise I'd keep it. If I didn't have another PWS sitting at home I wouldn't even be selling it regardless of cash needs. You will not be disappointed by this upper I can assure you that.  

Asking $1000 OBO

Would sell the entire rifle (complete upper with complete lower) for $1500 OBO,
but would prefer to keep the lower as it has the best buffer tube system on the market.

This is a piston operated 5.56x45/.223 rifle with a 1 in 7 twist barrel, drum sites (think HK rifles), side folding stock, ambidextrous safety, and magazine release. The trigger is a two stage factory trigger and has a light 3.5lb pull to release the hammer. The rifle takes all AR-15 magazines and will come with the GI mag from the factory. I have added a Magpul Vertical Fore Grip and sling as well to the rifle. This model also comes with a quad rail in order to place lights or whatever you want as well. Both of the sights are removable with only a simple Allen wrench so you can put on an optic without co-witnessing it if you'd like. 

I have not fired the rifle, but instead would like to sell it as I found an FS2000 for sale and would like to buy it. This Sig rifle has the standard Sig quality and construction that you would expect, and since it uses a gas piston and not direct gas against the bolt it doesn't get even a fraction as dirty as an AR-15. Comes with the factory box, docs, and lock as well. I welcome offers, but please don't try and low ball me. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED."

FN Herstal FNX-40. Looking for a full size pistol with around a 5 inch barrel. Prefer S&W M&P, Springfield XD or similar in 9X19 or 40 S&W. Additional magazines and holsters a plus. I do not care about some holster wear but I'm not looking for ragged out junk either.

I genuinely hate to give up this pistol, but I need something a bit larger as I have gorilla hands. Pistol has been froglubed from the day I bought it less than a year ago and has about 400 flawless rounds through it. I have never experienced a failure of any kind with it. It is in excellent condition with just a bit of holster wear from being carried and practiced with daily. It has also been cleaned thoroughly after being fired without fail.

Comes with original hard case, extra backstraps for custom fit, three 14 round magazines, (not pictured) a Snag Mag for carrying an extra magazine, (not pictured) one Alien Gear IWB holster, an off brand IWB holster that's in pretty rough condition, (but works great and is actually more comfortable than the Alien Gear) and a Blade Tech OWB holster with either belt loop or paddle capability.

Trade value for all is $600. Willing to travel a reasonable distance for the right trade."

In fact you are not supposed to use subsonic ammo in this gun. This gun utilizes a patented one piece core that is machined from billet stainless steel bar stock and is completely user serviceable. The construction of the integral is built to last! It is also FULL AUTO RATED so it can handle some serious use. Includes everything that Ruger packaged with the rifle (box, bag, lock, manuals, and 10 round magazine) at the factory. Here are the Ruger 10/22 specs: Stock: Black Synthetic Capacity: 10, 25 Material: Stainless Steel Finish: Clear Matte Here are the specs from Innovative Arms: MSRP: $1325 Caliber: 22lr Full Auto Rated: Yes You can buy it here:http://shop.redcircletactical.com/catalog.supressors?&manufacturer=103087Here is a link to a Innovative Arms video of this model. Notice how quiet it is: Innovative Arms Ruger 10/22 IntegralThese are a riot to shoot and everybody that runs it a few times ends up wanting one. This will quickly become a rifle that you’ll take to the range every time. The only complaint that you’ll have is that you are spending too much money on .22lr ammo. Now that .22lr is starting to be available again at reasonable prices there is no reason not to purchase this. This will transfer for free on a Form 3 to your NFA dealer for those of you who live in states where silencers/suppressors are allowed.

This pistol is striker fired, but has a rare ability to be fired as a double action pistol as well as single action giving it second strike capabilities. The grip is extremely comfortable in your hand, and it features the Anti Stress trigger. The trigger has a very light pull until it reaches the break point, then a light 3lb pull with a crisp break to release the striker and fire the pistol. I just purchased this and found another rifle that I'd really like so I'm selling the pistol with an extra magazine so you have 3 mags not just the 2 it came with.

It utilizes a long-stroke piston system modeled after the ultra-reliable AK-47.
This thing RUNS. Have fired somewhere between 600-700 rounds. Not a single malfunction of any kind, not once. I've fed it everything from quality brass to cheap steel cased Russian stuff like silver bear. it Eats Anything you feed it. It also runs extremely clean, significantly cleaner than DI guns. This is of course due to the design, gases are not kept in contact with the BCG, rather they are pushed into the piston tube. Upper breaks down exactly how a DI upper would, except there is a piston rod attached to the BCG. It is the simplest and most reliable piston AR design out there. All the other piston ARs (I've tried most of them..LWRC Barrett POF LMT Sig etc) operate using short-stroke piston designs which utilize more proprietary parts and result in more metal on metal action, and IMO are more problematic (at least potentially, someday down the road). The other thing I should mention on the topic of other piston guns, is that all the other piston ARs I've tried (while nice) are no where near as light or as well-balanced as the PWS. Most the other piston ARs are front heavy and/or bulky. The PWS is as light as a DI and AS well-balanced as a DI. Weighs in under 7lbs. Also shoots very flat..the FSC556 muzzle break flash hider is excellent.

Do your research and you'll find not a single bad review on PWS. It is not quite as well known a company as say LWRC, but I believe it is due to marketing, not the quality of builds, b/c PWS has an extremely loyal fan base. I for one am not interested in buying any other rifles outside of the PWS brand. Only selling b/c I'm tight on cash, otherwise I'd keep it. If I didn't have another PWS sitting at home I wouldn't even be selling it regardless of cash needs. You will not be disappointed by this upper I can assure you that. 

Asking $1000 OBO

Would sell the entire rifle (complete upper with complete lower) for $1500 OBO,
but would prefer to keep the lower as it has the best buffer tube system on the market.


Make an offer.

This is a Glock 29 with TFO tritium fiber optic sights that fires the very potent 10mm round. What is really surprising is that this Glock hand cannon fires a round that puts a .45 acp round to shame yet is NOT punishing to shoot. I fire 100 rounds of the ammo I plan to use for home defense through each of my home defense pistols, clean them, and then load them and stash them in strategic places in my home. 

For various reasons, I no longer need 3 of these man droppers stashed in my home. No Glock 29 I've ever owned has ever failed to chamber any defense ammo nor failed to fire. Since they certainly are not pretty, they have to be the ultimate in reliable and dependable along with being world class accurate for a compact pistol. I have added Meprolight TFO sights to all of my self protection firearms. The sights are NOT cheap, but they are the brightest sights you can buy for daytime as well as night time shooting. 

This pistol comes Glock box, owners manual and two 10 round magazines that both have the Pierce pinky grip extension. As you can see in the picture, he original Glock copper lube stuff is still on this pistol. If you want a man dropper, and not a pistol that may just possibly dissuade any intruder, this is for you. The night sights are less than 2 years old, so you should get at least 10 more years out of them before they dim.  If you want the pistol without the TFO sights on it, I own the $600 sight pressing machine and can put the original sights back on for $50 less.

The package deal for this home protection system is $525 with all pictured and with the TFO sights. I will need to see proper Indiana ID and preferably a carry permit. This is a fantastic firearm that will last for decades and tens of thousands of rounds. Just ask if you have any questions. Thanks for looking at my ad. If you want to see more pics, just ask. I'm no computer wizard and I kept exceeding the size limit allotted for this ad. Thanks again!"

It is a 7 shot .357/.38 Special with a 4"" barrel.
The trigger has been professionally modified, making the double action just slightly heavier than most striker fired pistols, and the single action is comparable to a precision rifle.
The sights have been professional improved into night sights, and I believe I still have the original ones somewhere.
It has 3 grips. Two different sizes of Hogue, and on it is a Crimson Trace LG-207 red laser.
Will also come with a quality Bianchi leather holster, and two speed loaders.

Years ago, I bought a couple stripped pistol lowers when Spikes had a members only deal going on arfcom... Intending to build one up and keep one as a spare. Well, as anyone who's ever assembled an AR will tell you, that wasn't going to last long, parts have a way of finding their way into a build.

Anyhow, I've got a bottom end I hardly use, and a need for some cash.

It's a Spikes multi-cal / pistol marked lower, Ergo Grip, Rock River extended winter trigger guard, right now it's got a very early style pistol buffer tube from my first pistol build. The rest of the LPK and the buffer and buffer spring are standard fare from my parts bin.  $200 CASH

I can put my Sig Arm brace and newer style buffer tube on it for a total of $300 CASH if that better suits your needs.

Buyer must be willing to meet me in Stayton/Aumsville at a public locale for FTF transaction.

p.s. I don't need any more green tip than I already have, so please don't bother with silly over valued trade offers."

I would go even up round for round for Federal or PMC X-tac M193 55 grain ammo only. No other brands thank you. Not really looking to sell. My firearms are all sighted with 55 grain Federal and PMC X-tac ammo. Not really interested in selling I am just looking for someone who would like to trade. I know SS109 Green Tip amour piercing is sold out everywhere and going for stupid prices if you can get it. M193 55 grain is still available at OK prices. So an even up trade is a very good deal. I'm not a gouger and a reluctant seller but if someone really wants it it looks like $425.00 is the going rate these days...
