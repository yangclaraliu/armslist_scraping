When he got bored he carved his initials and doodled some military emblems into the stock.  At one point, he carved a big square into one side of the stock.  We'll never know why, but it is kind of cool.

This SKS looks rough but functions perfectly.  I picked this up a while back for fun, cleaned it up, took apart the bolt and cleaned it inside out (firing pin functions perfectly, no slam fires here).  I've run a bunch of steel case through it and it eats it all no problem.  I don't need to sell it, it's a fun gun to have, but I'm not a collector.  I thought I would like it for hunting hogs but really like my AR better.

This gun has only the serial number and no arsenal or Chinese markings.  From what I understand, these are referred to as ghost guns and are very early guns.  This one, from what I can tell, is from 1956.

Asking $400 or best offer.  Open to trades but would prefer cash.  If interested please respond via email with name and contact information.  I am real and I will get back to you.

56,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4238056,For Sale/Trade:  Rare Chilean Military Surplus 7mm Mauser ammo,"west wichita, Wichita, Kansas",$ 60,"Listed On: Monday, April 13, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"As the title says I have a quantity of surplus 7mm Mauser ammo I'd like to sell or trade.

This is Chilean Military Surplus, circa 1976.  Comes packaged 15 rounds to a box in original cardboard boxes.  7 boxes of 15 along with some loose rounds for 126 total.  Reloadable brass case fmj ammo, but I am unsure of the bullet weight.  Some of the cases have some corrosion on them but they should all still be firable. However as this is old surplus I can't guarantee that there won't be some bad primers in the bunch.  Fired several hundred rounds of this through my mauser and only had a few duds but this has been close to a decade ago.
In any case this is great ammo if you have a Spanish mauser, particularly if you reload for it.
I also have 10 rounds of Federal soft point hunting ammo

Well sell all of it for $60, or will trade for an equal value of 9mm, 380, 7.62x39 ammo or Glock 42 or M&P9 magazines.

Feel free to contact me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 with questions or offers.

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 16"" barrel with flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent, near new condition. no rust or pitting at all. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired! the mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is likewise excellent. The Galil was imported in rather small numbers and only a few hundred of the Model 392 are in the Country. Blue Book on this rifle is $3100-$3450...if you can find one! This is a hard to find and much sought after pre-ban ""assault rifle"".

Please note that I use the term ""assault rifle"" loosely and only due to the popularity of the phrase. A real assault rifle is selective-fire with full auto capabilities while this is a semi-automatic rifle, of course.

These are pretty uncommon. 

This is a 1903 dated Carl Gustav, all parts matching except the bolt. Bore on the rifle is immaculate, especially for a 112 year old rifle. Also interesting is this rifle's stock disc. All swedish mausers had inlets cut for a stock disc on the right side of the stock, but a few rifles had discs inletted in to the comb of the stock. No one really seems to know why. 

Stock is in decent shape, with plenty of nicks and character marks. No cracks. 

I've only seen one other 94 in person, at Heritage Guild in Easton. They have one for 1300. I'd like to get in the neighborhood of 1100 for this one, also interested in milsurp rifles of similar value. Garands, AG42, even an SVT with cash on my end. Not really in a hurry to sell, just testing the waters.

I bought this new last October and have competed with it the past several months. I just upgraded to a new competition gun, so I'm letting this go to help recoup some of the cost. It has approximately 600 rounds through it total. I have polished most of the internal parts, which results in a smoother trigger. It's got a couple marks in the finish (the worst are pictured) but is in fantastic mechanical shape. This is NOT the version with the Omega trigger.

It comes with the factory box, paperwork, 2-16rnd mags(which have never been used), and the factory cleaning rod and brush.

I'm an AL resident, but I'll be happy to meet a buyer at an FFL in Pensacola (preferably Ammunition Sales) to perform the transfer.  Buyer responsible for all applicable fees.

I am looking for $350 OBO for EVERYTHING: 
-Pistol and everything that comes with it from the factory (Talon ruberized grips installed)
-ALL .40 ammo I have laying around for it (1 box of Remington Golden Saber plus a bunch of FMJ target ammo)
-2 right hand IWB holsters, a full kydex with carbon fiber pattern made by OnYour6Dedsigns with a 1.5"" belt clip with adjustable can't and a very comfortable IWB holster with 15* can't hand made from leather and kydex by ""FirearmHolsters.com"" - Both holsters are included and were made in the USA and are amazing.

Shoot me an email and I will send more photos over, and I will also get a total count on the ammo I have for it.

Buyer pays all transfer fees.  I cannot travel far to do the transfer because I am so busy with my business, so plan on meeting somewhere around me for the transfer, I have 2-3 shops locally that I deal with.

I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
Therefore, I am looking to make a trade for a Sig Sauer P938 in new or like new condition. I have a quantity of .380 ACP ammo, additional magazines, and/or cash that I can add to make up any price difference. Finish is not a huge deal, but I would prefer a model with wood grips, and would be particularly interested in a SAS model.
I might also consider other pocket 9mm's, like a Ruger LC9s or Sig P290, but I will expect some cash on top. 
I am primarily looking to make a trade, but might also consider a sale, my price is $500 FIRM- these retail for 600-800, so I feel my price is more than fair.
The best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. I have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. FTF Wichita area only."

My camera on my phone is currently lacking the ability to take pictures, however, hopefully I can upload some this evening. Gun resembles picture posted but is a flat brown color. The gun is Turkish made and is a great shooter and very accurate. Very underestimated gun.

This particular model has the upgraded Trijicon fully adjustable, 3-Dot tritium night sights installed from the factory, as well as the integral accessory rail. This 1911 is truly a work of art and has the potential to be the centerpiece of any gun collection. Included with the pistol is a hard carry case, hip holster, twin mag carrier, original grips, Hogue grip, cleaning brush, factory literature, and two 7 round magazines, three Chip McCormick 10 round magazines, and a custom kydex holster from K-Rounds.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
 Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the TRP Operator.

Bought this from the original owner who got it when he left the service back in the early 90's (or so he said; he seemed fairly believable and the condition seems to support his account).  He shot a box through it, then cleaned it and stored it until he sold it to me about a year ago. Essentially a safe queen.  I've shot about two boxes through it.  It is clean, pristine, and ready to go.  Flat black parkerized finish, factory fixed sights, and original Colt grips.  In addition to the original Colt 8 round mag, it also comes with a Kimber stainless 7 round mag, an unmarked stainless 7 round mag, and a ProMag black 8 round mag.  Comes with original brown Colt case, and a set of Pachmayer finger-notched rosewood grips that I paid $45 for (Bass Pro Shops).   It's a fine gun, no problems or issues, and in the 2 boxes I've shot through it I've no misfeeds, jams, stovepipes, or failures to eject.  The 1911 format just isn't for me.  I've shot 9mm for too long I guess.  Prices on Gunbroker are putting these anywhere from $800 to $1000, so with the condition, lack of use, extra mags, and the Pachmayer grips, I'm asking $850. 

Now, if you can't or won't comply with the following, please don't contact me: You will need to meet me at a public place/parking lot, and provide a valid NH driver's license as well as a valid NH permit to carry a concealed weapon, so that I can know you're allowed to own firearms.  If not, we'll have to meet at a local FFL (Riley's, Morse's, etc.) for background check, and I'd be willing to split the cost there (usually $25)."
