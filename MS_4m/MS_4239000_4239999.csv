I picked this gun up to use as a woods carry gun for places I didn't want to carry one of my more expensive handguns. It has some scratches and nicks, but it functions perfectly. Would make a great nightstand or backup gun for hunting. The only reason I want to trade it is that the grips are made for a right handed shooter and I shoot left handed. 
This gun was imported by Excam from H. Weihrauch in Germany and branded as a Warrior. The same gun has been imported by several companies over the years and including Arminius and EAA. this gun is the forerunner of the current EAA windicator and many Windicator parts will fit it if ever needed. This gun has a steel frame, not the pot metal frame that the early Arminus revolvers used.
I added a picture of it beside my Smith and Wesson model 66 too show the size of the gun.

Also, has anyone else had trouble with Armslist losing their listings? I went in to edit some spelling, and the listing disappeared."

Other Features: Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full-size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3? Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use."

Nearly all Security-Sixes were chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, which also permitted the use of the shorter .38 Special cartridge. Ruger also chambered the Security-Six in .38 Special for some police orders by fitting different cylinders that could only accommodate the .38 Special cartridge.

I work at an Atlanta area gun club and just don't really shoot this one anymore. I'd rather pay off some debt and throw some money in the bank. I've had this for about 8 months and only have 800 rounds through it or so. It has a Troy rail system and gas tube. I had a machine shop install the gas tube to make sure it won't move for an optic to hold zero properly. Originally the furniture is OD green and all that furniture is included in the package. I've also installed a smaller .034 front sight. The rifle shoots really well, best AK47 I've ever held by far, the milled receiver really makes it feel solid. Along with the rifle and original box are 3, 30 round p-mags, the original 10 round magazine from Arsenal, and around 200 rounds of ammo with the plastic ammo can.

The sidearm comes with the following
3 x Wilson combat magazines.
1 x Springfield OWB holster
1 x Springfield duel magazine holster

 Copied below is some of the statistics for the gun. For what it's worth, I've never shot a more accurate sidearm than the Springfield TRP. It's a heavy 1911, but it's fantastic. I'm guessing if someone is seriously looking at this gun, they probably already know a decent amount on it as these models tend to fall in what many would consider the ""collectors"" or ""semi-rare"" gun category.

If you're interested, or have any questions, please shoot me an email. Likewise if you would like additional pictures of the gun or of any part of the gun, I'm not opposed to breaking it down for internal pictures if someone is serious.

I am not interested in trades as I'm selling this to fund another purchase. 

Face to face sale preferred. CCW or military ID is also preferred, but not required. I may be willing to consider shipping. Be forewarned, if you want me to ship, all the payment risk (as in you pay first and I make sure all clears) and costs associated with shipping will be on your end.

Price is firm, no trades. I will not respond to low-ballers. thanks.

Note: the 2nd picture looks like there are some scratches on the top left corner of the pistol, but that is actually a reflection from the gun oil; the actual gun has NO scratches there.

From the website: 
The CZ 75B Omega features a simpler, more robust version of the 75's trigger system. The interlocking design of the trigger mechanism's parts allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools, so taking the pistol down beyond a basic fieldstrip is much easier than on a standard 75. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials, enhancing durability, operation life and reliability."

I purchased this car about two weeks ago with big ambitions to build a custom street/strip vehicle, however, I do not have the time nor the space to store this. As you can see from the pictures, the previous owner began to spray the car in primer (that is NOT surface rust) in order to block it out for body work. Vehicle does have typical fox body rust but nothing excessive or anything that can't be easily fixed. Engine and trans was removed prior to my purchase so it is not available. Overall this would make an excellent roller for whatever you have in mind. As previously stated, car does have a clean Ohio title with an accurate title and odometer reading of 63,000 miles but again does need TLC as this is a project vehicle. Vehicle does come with Kenny Brown Performance Extreme Matrix Subframe system still in the box which costs $459 new so you are basically getting the frame connectors at cost and the vehicle free. I am 100% firm on my price of $400 so please do not ask for a lower purchase price. Just a heads up, for those of you that want to show up and then try to ""wheel and deal"" to get a lower price (it always happens), you will be asked to leave. I do not appreciate having my time wasted, serious offers only. I will not deliver the vehicle so please plan accordingly. My price is low for a quick sale however I will trade for ($500 trade value) lever action rifles in 30-30 or 17HMR, pistols in 9, 357 Sig, 40, or 45, and possibly revolvers in 357 Magnum.

I've upgraded to a Dillon, so this is not being used anymore. Here's what I've got:

1 Loadmaster press in fine working order.
4 turrets ready for your dies.
Lee Pro Autodisk powder hopper and compete set of disks. This has been updated with the Pro update, a $30 kit
Large and Small primer systems, both complete including trays.
4 Shell Plates :

#11L - 45 Colt / 44Mag / 44 Special
#1S - 38/357

Will include the bullet feeder for 38/357 though it's really more hassle than it's worth.
Will include a stand I made for the tool heads and shell plates. It's nothing fancy, but it works well.

Again, there are no dies - you must supply your own - the photo is a STOCK photo showing dies, but they are not included. It also does NOT come with the case feeder tubes or tube holder (though it does come with the slider). I managed to crush the tubes some time ago so I remove the assembly and just fed brass one by one. The entire feeder can be bought from Lee for $25 including a collator.

Let me know if you have questions.  Price is VERY fair and firm. a set of dies is all you need to get up and running. price does not include shipping, though I am willing to ship at cost."

Cimarron's recreation of Henry's 1860 original rifle. Each rifle is hand made by Uberti of Italy and each piece is machined and finished to match the original rifle. B. Tyler Henry of the New Haven Arms Company introduced the Henry the year the Civil War began. Only 1,700 of the lever-action repeating rifles were issued to Union troops, but the gun’s reputation quickly grew. After an encounter with the 7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which had the good fortune to be armed with Henrys, one Confederate officer is credited with the phrase, “It’s a rifle that you could load on Sunday and shoot all week long.” Through Cimarron's and Uberti's efforts you have the opportunity to shoot and feel a rifle from yester-year. Buy one and feel history in your hands, but don't tell Aunt Bessy ya done bought it, 'cause she'll have ya sloppin dem hogs fer sure.
