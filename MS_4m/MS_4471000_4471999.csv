The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

It has a 24"" ported barrel for reduced muzzle rise and holds 4+1 without the plug and 2+1 with the plug installed.  I have upgraded the magazine spring to a higher powered Wolff spring and upgraded the follower to a GG&G steel/aluminum follower for more reliable feeding.  The barrel has an integrated cantilever scope base ready to mount a scope of your choice.  The stock is a monte carlo style and is polymer.  I have also added a shell holder on the stock to carry an extra 5 shells.  This shotgun will shoot 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells.  It has a spacer system to adjust the drop angle of the stock.  It also has a quick empty button that will release all of the loaded shells with the press of the button.  I have the original box, owner's manual, lock, the stock magazine spring and magazine follower, as well as an extra recoil pad and a Limbsaver recoil pad.  I am also including 3 boxes of Sabot slugs to get you started.  I had this out hunting 1 day last year and dropped a deer in its tracks with it at 60 yards.  This is a great deer gun, I just no longer need it.

Remington of Herkimer N.Y. who completed the contract obligations. Remington then filled the contract of September 22, 1845 calling for 1,000 Maynard tape equipped carbines.

Serial # 1,369,xxx dates the nickel steel receiver to 1931. Barrel is original to the rifle and marked SA (Springfield) and dated 2/31 with the flaming bomb ordinance symbol. Stock is the original ""S"" stock cartouched ""SA"" over ""SPG"" for Stanley P. Gibbs who was the small arms inspector at Springfield starting in 1931.

This rifle is in original 1931 condition and was never rebuilt. Stock, receiver, and barrel all date 1931 and are original. Very fine condition overall. Vintage WWII leather sling included. Action is superb and bore is very fine. Fit and finish are excellent. 

Springfield production numbers were very low in the early 1930's as the Great Depression was in full swing and there were many '03's left over from WW1. As a result, in 1931 production was very limited and quality extremely high. Many National Match rifles were made during this time frame. This is a beautiful example of their production capability at that time. 

Springfield started using nickel steel receivers around serial # 1,250,000 making these later  model's the pinnacle of original 1903 development prior to the much more common WWII 1903A3 models.

I'm very sad to see this thing go, but I have bills that need to be paid. This is my go to/SHTF battle rifle. The reliability and accuracy of a M1A is unmatched. She is a nail driver. In this sale you are getting a M1A Loaded, meaning she has a National Match barrel. The rifle is in great shape, and the metal in excellent shape. Round count is unknown, but it can't be much at all. Not that it matters, the quality that Springfield Armory brings to the table on these rifles is awesome. This will be a rifle your child/grandchildren will be fighting over when you pass.

 It comes with a few nice extras. These include a spring action adjustable bipod for solid prone shooting, a tactical mag release (think Call of Duty speed reload), hard plastic gun case, and three, yes, three 20 round magazines. Has an upgraded steel spring op rod and spring. Also included is the original box, literature, and gun lock.

 If you know anything about M1As, you know this is a good deal, and you also know this is a must have gun for any collection, big or small. When shit hits the fan, everyone will be running around with their home built, shaky, misfiring .223s, and you will have a solid battle tested, true shooting rifle, with a larger caliber 7.62X51MM NATO (.308WIN). The M14 platform has swept the competitive world, and it's no wonder why. Get your hands on this gun while you can, and be above the rest."

I've shot this rifle once in the past year, to zero it at 50 yards after putting the EBR stock on it.  Spray painted the stock, it's functional but not duracoat by any stretch of the imagination.  Retail on all this stuff is over $3 G's, I'll take $2500 for the lot.  If you offer me something ridiculous I'll counter at $1,000,000. :)

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
