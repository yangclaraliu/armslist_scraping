Jimenez Arms J.A. 22cal all black.
Includes 2 magazines, original box, trigger lock, paperwork, pocket holster, and soft case about 2 sizes to big.

I will also toss in a bag of 22LR Winchester Super X. I will admit, this gun doesn't love this ammo, that is why I have some left. Like most 22 semi-auto's this gun hates life shooting bulk ammo and really only eats good CCI stuff. Shoots consistently with CCI Mini Mags. I gave the gun a soft fluff and buff. Really enjoyable to shoot and great for teaching first timers 

Will entertain all trade offers."

There are 2 revolvers listed in this ad, the prices are listed on each revolver. The listed prices are the lowest I will take for each, don't waste either of our times asking if I'll take lower. I'm not in need to sell, so I'll wait for my prices to be met. 

First up is a Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan in .454 Casull and .45lc. This has a 2.5"" barrel in stainless steel. It was manufactured in 2014, I've put 20 rounds of .454 and 10 rounds of .45lc. Included is 102 rounds of reloaded .454 ammo (in the green boxes). The price is not adjusted for the reloaded ammo as it cannot sold, so it's included in the price. Since I'm getting out of .454s the 200+ rounds of factory ammo (in the blue boxes, 12 rounds in a green box) is included in the price, 29 pieces of once fired brass and the 3 piece carbide reloading dies. 

Factory Ammo is:
174 rounds Winchester a Super X 250gr hollow point Retails at $1.75ea
12 rounds Buffalo Bore 250gr hollow point Retails at $2.55ea

Also included is 500 rounds of ammo ( 400 FMJ, 80 rounds defense & 20 rounds +P. With extra mag & ammo over $800 value! This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame. Will only sell to KY resident legally allowed to purchase a handgun. Price is firm, no trades please, thanks for looking."

But when analyzing the production of Grade 4 and above guns, there were only 560 Grade 4 guns produced in all gauges, with about 150 or less in 20ga. guns. This gun, sn455798 built in 1929, is a FULLY OPTIONED TRAP CONFIGURED GUN, AND IS ONE OF A TINY HANDFUL OF GUNS SO PRODUCED. In near mint condition, with ULTRA RARE 32"" vent rib barrels, beavertail forend, SST, ejectors, double ivory beads, factory pad, this is a true investment quality shotgun with CONDITION, RARITY, AND DESIRABLE AND RARE OPTIONS. And of course, it has that fully figured Ithaca walnut with the fancy flor-de-lis checkering that sets the Ithaca guns apart from all others. This is a great gun!

The gun weighs 7 1/4lbs. and balances nicely between the hands. This is not a lightweight field gun you would want to walk all day with, but a fantastic gun for ducks or doves, high volume pigeon or crows, and maybe the perfect sporting clays or trap gun. The weight will greatly reduce felt recoil and the long weight forward barrels will keep your swing smooth and moving; the perfect scenario for the above mentioned uses."

I searched for about a month to find this gun in FDE and ended up ordering it from out of state.  
I'm asking exactly what I paid for it; $699 for the gun, $30 for shipping, and $20 for FFL transfer.  $750, no tax, no FFL transfer fee, non-negotiable, FTF.

This time a year ago there would already be 40 pages of firearms. The honest people have just gotten tired of it and moved on to GB GA GI and I don't blame them. It use to be that you never saw a scam on here and met some very nice people and made some good friends to go shooting with and found some wonderful deals on used firearms. The part I don't understand is how can you sell your used firearm for more than a new one cost at the gun shop? Its like the ammo scare right now that's never going to happen the NRA want let that happen. They own every politician in Washington! Its like the Newtown scare with the ARs every one ran out and bought ARs now they are a dime a dozen and the markets flooded with them and don't even mention the parts bin guns! The ammo ban want ever happen and within the next year the market will be flooded with that stuff until its worth about 30 cents a round. Now if some one on here can tell me what in the world has ruined this site other than what I have just stated please feel free to email.

 The first picture is a 6-shot group typical of the accuracy of this revolver, fired at 20 yards with the above listed loads. I loaded them in 44 Magnum cases to avoid leading in the front of each chamber, and to eliminate the jump from the case to the forcing cone which CAN affect accuracy when using 44 Special cases.

A & S is often credited with establishing the Italian engravers and the art of bulino style engraving as the pinnacle of the engraver's world.

Rainier makes the highest quality copper plated bullets on the market. Rainier offers a large selection of swaged lead core copper plated bullets that are low in cost but substantially high in accuracy. Rainier swages their bullets twice with lead wire in an effort to ensure the tightest uniformity as well as prevention of premature wearing of barrels. This unique design makes them suitable for most indoor ranges, which often require the use of bullets with no exposed lead. The base is slightly concave to maximize the bullet to bore seal.

But when analyzing the production of Grade 4 and above guns, there were only 560 Grade 4 guns produced in all gauges, with about 150 or less in 20ga. guns. This gun, sn455798 built in 1929, is a FULLY OPTIONED TRAP CONFIGURED GUN, AND IS ONE OF A TINY HANDFUL OF GUNS SO PRODUCED. In near mint condition, with ULTRA RARE 32"" vent rib barrels, beavertail forend, SST, ejectors, double ivory beads, factory pad, this is a true investment quality shotgun with CONDITION, RARITY, AND DESIRABLE AND RARE OPTIONS. And of course, it has that fully figured Ithaca walnut with the fancy flor-de-lis checkering that sets the Ithaca guns apart from all others. This is a great gun!

The gun weighs 7 1/4lbs. and balances nicely between the hands. This is not a lightweight field gun you would want to walk all day with, but a fantastic gun for ducks or doves, high volume pigeon or crows, and maybe the perfect sporting clays or trap gun. The weight will greatly reduce felt recoil and the long weight forward barrels will keep your swing smooth and moving; the perfect scenario for the above mentioned uses."

Suitable for night vision
Battery indicator
Control cap with safety strap eyelet
Easily mounted thanks to a large number of mounting adapters

There is a choice of three types of innovative electronic control. Thus the light point intensity can be even better suited to the application.

In addition, the brightness control can be adapted to the ambient light conditions with all types of operation.

Dynamik — Standard curve with balanced features
Power — Increased basic brightness and high maximum brightness
Minimum power consumption ensures long battery life times. The integrated battery warning informs of the low energy condition of the lithium cell in good time. Because of the numerous mounting possibilities it can be quickly and professionally mounted on almost any weapon.
