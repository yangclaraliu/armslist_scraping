This one bears a date of the 307th day of 1954 from the Julian date stamped into the inside of the stock when the wood was tooled out by the Frank Overton Company. Line Materials made the barrel. They set out to produce among the finest barrels ever put on a Garand. This is arguably the scarcest Garand to be had and this one is just about as-issued in 1954, save probably the handguards have almost assuredly been replaced at some point.

Take a micrometer with you or a reloading gauge and measure the cases. Personally if it's not factory I don't carry it for self defense, practice my own reloads only. If your carry reloads for self defense consult your lawyer.I know of at least 6 cases of guys that ended up in prison for using reloads that were hot or weak or even different brands of cases than what was left as evidence to test.

Each pistol is hand-engraved in the Czech Republic in true old-world style, with a hammer pushing the engraver's tool through each minute detail of the art decorating the slide and frame, which are then polished and finished in a deep, glossy blue. The controls, extractor, grip screws and magazine baseplate are finished in a rainbow tritium nitride, an attractive and extremely tough finish. This is the same type of finish applied to drill bits to extend their working life up to three times. To finish off the look, smooth, high-grade California birds-eye Maple grips are added. Dyed to match the hues of the frame and controls, the grips seem otherworldly, looking less like wood and more like a snapshot sent to Earth from the Hubble Space Telescope. Chambered in 9mm, the 40th Anniversary Limited Edition ships in a leather-bound hard case with two (2) 16-round magazines. Only 1000 pieces will be produced, each individually numbered and accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.SpecificationsType: PistolAction: DoubleCaliber: 9mmBarrel Length: 4.6""Capacity: 16+1Safety: AmbidextrousGrips: Maple  Sights: Fixed  Frame Finish: BluedFrame Material: SteelSlide Description: Blued Stainless SteelCase Type: Hard BUY HERE"

Other info: Purchased from Tracy Rifle and Pistols about a year ago. California model with Bullet Button and pinned (non folding) stock from the factory to comply with CA DOJ requirements. (Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it

Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss
Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen.

Selling because I just picked up the pistol model which is what I originally wanted.

Beautiful wood stock but you can switch out to a more tactical style if you ever chose.  This is not your average cheapo AK.  Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.
  Nice rifle that will last you a lifetime if you don't run it over with a truck.  They say you can  bury it in dirt and mud, drag it across the field and it will still work....just don't run it over with the truck."

I cant believe I am selling my prepper survival gear, but the time has come to sell a few things to make ends meet.  For sale is 10 cases of mixed food stored in #10 cans (60 cans total).  I bought this lot of food from a dear friend of mine who is with Church of Latter day Saints, which has a fantastic program for canning and storing food supplies.  Included in this lot is wheat, white flour, milk, carrots, fruit, oatmeals, and an overall standard selection of items that store well.  All of the cans were properly labeled and sealed at the church and content stickers and dates on every can.  I helped him can at the church before and this is a legit process.  I paid under 500 bucks for my ten cases as part of a huge group-buy which was about 3000 dollars worth in one run.  It was and awesome experience to be part of.  I will sell for 250 which is only 25 a case or just over $4 a can.  All of the products were canned in May of 2011 making it four and a half years old with at least 13 and a half years left to go.  They cases have been stored in the pantry.  No disappointments, full list and pictures will be updated Thursday night.  Cash only.  Other prepper type supplies available also such as medical supplies, military gear, bug out bags, and gamma buckets to name a few.    Iam available after 3pm on weekdays and free this weekend.

	Hey all, 
I have available for trade/sale a new/unfired AR rifle. This is a 16 inch stainless 1:8 barrel chambered in 223 wylde (223 or 5.56) with the standard birdcage flash hider. This is an anderson Lower with a Anderson LPK. This model has no Forward asset or Dust Cover, so it is a bit more sleek and lighter. This will also come with the red/green dot sight (with custom little reticles), collapsible stock, single point sling ambi-adapter, single point sling, 30rd Magpul Windowed Pmag, rail covers as pictured, Free float quad rail. This would be a sweet little entry level AR for someone needing a good starter gun that will perform great for them and would serve as a great starting point for many upgrades!
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357, etc. PLR-16, CMR30, XDM with threaded barrel, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s, Blackpowder, or 22s unless if is heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one.

For consideration is an excellent condition, impossible to find, incredible sporting shotgun.....the Remington 1100 Competition with the coveted WOOD STOCK with adjustable comb!  Very few were made with the wood stocks, even fewer with adjustable comb, and they are nearly impossible to find (none on gunbroker OR on Armslist if that tells you anything).  Please do not make an offer similar to the price of the synthetic model, it is significantly cheaper.  

Gun is in excellent condition, with a couple of minor dings from safe movement.  Has Dave's Metal Works easyloader extended carrier release installed for ""blind"" loading and faster manipulation of the carrier (works amazingly well).  The Competition model has a backbored, lengthened forcing cone 30"" 2 3/4"" chamber vent rib barrel with double bead sights.  Barrel accepts Remington Pro-Bore choke tubes and comes with a set of chokes (IMP/MOD/SKT/FULL).

From Remington's website:
Our Model 1100 Competition is super-tuned for the competitive scene. By overboring the 30"" barrel and lengthening the forcing cones, we improved shot-to-shot pattern consistency and made what was one of the softest-recoiling actions in the world even easier on your shoulder. The receiver and all internal parts feature a nickel-Teflon® finish for the smoothest, most reliable cycling ever. It’s optimized for 2 3/4"" target loads and light field loads, and the barrel has a 10mm target-style rib. All these, plus a host of other upgrades, transform an already legendary design into an unstoppable force at the range."

MANUFACTURER DESCRIPTION: 

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

I did find the Tranter that is almost exactly this gun, but it had markings including the Tranter name, serial numbers, caliber stamp, etc. The octagonal barrel is 3 1/2"" long.
