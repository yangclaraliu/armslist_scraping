It's a 1960's Remington 700 action with what I believe to be a Shilen Varmint contour barrel but I can't verify the barrel 100%. Barrel has less than 50 rounds down it by the previous owner. It measures .811"" thick at the muzzle.

As you can see the finish in various spots shows some wear and tear. Not really an issue if you're planning on putting a finish on it but wanted to highlight the areas that looked the worst. Bolt and bolt face are in great shape.

This is considered a project rifle because I believe the headspace to be a little over what I would normally like. It does NOT close on a field gauge but will on a no-go gauge meaning it's most likely safe but I would get it checked out by a smith if you are not capable of checking yourself.

Comes with a Shilen Competition trigger set at about 2oz give or take. (This trigger only adjusts up to 6oz... it is VERY light) It is currently in a Hogue overmolded stock that I happened to have around. Not pictured are the new stainless action screws that I put in to replace the ones that were there when I took these photos.

Trigger would cost you $155 new, barrel around 300. This is an excellent price on nice rifle to build from or just set the headspace and go varmint hunting."

I bought this gun new a couple of months ago. 

At most 30 rounds have been fired through the gun. It duplicates the functionality of other guns I own so I'm downsizing the collection a bit.

Priced at $375. Not sure what I'd want to look at in trades, but I have NO interest in non-handgun trades, nor would I be interested in anything that wasn't a carry gun without manual safeties. Beyond that, as long as it's a quality maker (no KelTec, Taurus, Rossi, Jennings, Hi-Point, etc.), I'll either ask you for more information or politely decline!

Located in Argos - along the US 31 corridor. FTF only - no shipping. I can meet as far south as Peru, as far north as US 6, west to Grovertown, east to Etna Green.

I'll need to see the buyer's Indiana drivers license and License to Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. For those who question this requirement, I apologize if it offends, but I can't perform a background check so I will deal only with those folks the State Police have cleared. 

This item will be cross-posted in multiple groups. FYI. I will respond to all offers in the order I receive them. I consider my word as my bond, so the first person I come to terms with will get the same consideration. That being said, once a deal is pending I'll mark the listing as such but this will stay up until the meet is finalized."

Spyderco will undoubtedly fulfill many knife knuts knife fantasy picks with the introduction of the Endura with Emerson's opening feature. This model combines all that's functional and performance-based in a Spyderco folder with the blade-opening feature made popular and patented by Ernest Emerson of Emerson Knives. The Emerson opening feature is a hook curving out the top of the knife's blade. When removing the knife from a front pocket it catches the pocket's edge quickly opening the knife blade for use. The knife can also be taken out of the pocket without engaging the opening feature by pulling it straight up and out with your fingers on top of the closed blade. The Endura with Emerson's opening feature has screw construction making cleaning and adjusting easier. The blue-gray fiberglass reinforced nylon handles are molded with Bi-Directional Texturing® for traction and improved ergonomics. Inside the handle dual skeletonized stainless steel liners strengthen the knife without additional weight and create an anchor for external and internal components to attach through for more sturdiness and rigidity. The VG-10 blades are flat saber-ground with a stronger tip and larger 13mm opening hole. Added to the blade's spine is slip resistant jimping. Phosphor bronze washers smooth out the open/close action and the clip is upgraded to a four-way tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed clip.Specs: Blade Steel: VG-10 Blade Length: 3.812” (97 mm) Length Open: 8.812” (224 mm) Length Closed: 5” (127 mm) Blade Thickness: .125” (3 mm) Handle Material: Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon Weight: 3.6 oz.

Because, at Spyderco, they practice the principle of C.Q.I. - Constant Quality Improvement. If they can refine and improve the ergonomics or cutting performance of an established model, they do it. Their 2010 Para-Military 2 has several changes over the classic version. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profiled thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position. It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket. They kept the same high-performance CPM-S30V full flat-ground blade but they've also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil. Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances. Larger lanyard gives more options for carry. Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the G-10 textured handle to the CPM-S30V steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

Less than 5”OAL and 4” tall, and at 10.2 ounces it is a perfect pocket pistol.  

This is less than 2 months old and in like new condition.  I’ve put about 150 rounds through it, that just means I’ve already paid for ¾ of the ammo for the 200 round factory recommended break-in, so that will save you about $50 right off the bat in wasted ammo breaking it in.  Other than me telling you that, you wouldn’t know it by looking at it.  

What does it come with…. everything a new one does, box, paperwork, lock and one magazine.  PLUS the EXTRAS- a second factory magazine, Pearce pinky extensions on both magazines (and I have the factory butt plates), Kahr grey/black tiger stripe grip tape (will peel right off if you don't like it), and an extra pack of 2 new Pearce pinky extension (in case you get more mags),  and I’ll even throw in a Blackhawk, soft, pocket holster that fits it perfectly and conceals it well.

How much?

$330

…….. and yes, I know you can find this online for $300, but it will just be the gun and one magazine, and you’ll have probably have to pay shipping and a transfer fee, and blow through that 150 rounds that I already have breaking it in properly…….  Or you can buy this one, and get the same thing…. minus shipping, taxes or transfer fees….. plus $100 in extras (the 2nd mag, extension, grip tape and holster) for 60% off.

The math is simple. Unless you can buy wholesale, it’s $425+ if you bought all of this new, for $340.  Oh, and for those that would ask, no, there’s nothing at all wrong with it, my needs have changed and I decided on something else.

No longer imported to the USA of of just a ways back ago. Banned from import but what's in private sales and owning one in USA is completely legal to do. I have also noticed there are less 20"" barrel AK47s on the market which makes this one more rare then others.
I own more tgen one AK so this one is up and know there is an AK lover like myself looking for one.

I prefer it over my AR, it simply maneuvers better. This one is the newer E4 that accepts all stanag (AR ) mags, so no $$$ proprietary ones needed. It also features the 18.5"" Heavy barrel that is the most accurate (and a little extra velocity) with a .223 Wylde chamber (shoots both 5.56mm and .223 but is awesomely accurate) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.223_Wylde

It has surprisingly ample rail space, the foregrip folds up easy. The ford/barrel is extremely easy to remove.
It has the manual and original box, was $1599. 2 movable sling adaptors, and one fixed on the left (I'll include a 1 pt bungie for it). As well as a windowed pmag. It also has adjustable offset sights on it, but if you prefer I can give you polymer Flip ups in place of them.
 Has about 100 rounds through it, just not shooting enough right now and looking to step up to some other toys.

About the only trade I would be interested in would be a nice AK at the right price chambered in 7.62, plus $$

In portland area off 205 and Foster. Meet me near Johnson Creek Blvd off 205. Come get it today! Need money for a motorcycle otherwise I would not be selling this. Yes, the firearm is configured legally. No, you can not put a rifle stock on this gun without a short barrel rifel tax stamp. While it looks like a rifle, this gun is considered a pistol. 
You can still shoulder the rifle just fine and the recoil does not hurt. 
In my opnion, I have a better time shooting 7.62x39 from the AR platform than the 556. More power than 300blk also. It's like an AK and an AR in one. Don't knock it until you try it! So much fun..

Rounds for this machine are $5 for 20 rounds at walmart. 556 is twice as much money and 7.62x39 creates a bigger dust cloud! ;)

 Definitive Technology W9 Audiophile-Grade Wireless Speaker

 Audiophile-grade wireless speaker
 The W9 is Definitive Technology's flagship audiophile-grade wireless speaker. Created for audio aficionados with unrelenting performance expectations, the W9 delivers exceptional dynamic range and extraordinary bass response. Transducers on the front baffle and on both sides of the enclosure create a ""Tri-Polar"" dispersion pattern that radiates sound off of the surrounding walls.

 What Obsession Sounds Like
 There's a fine line between loving music and being obsessed with it. When it comes to making music sound the best it can sound, we have a hard time believing that good enough is acceptable. It has to be flawless. Perfect. Uncompromising. In short, we think it would be crazy to give music anything less than everything it deserves.

 Definitive Technology Apps
 The free Definitive Technology App allows you to mix-and-match speakers with the open PlayFi™ Technology standard and future-proof your home music solution. The Definitive Technology Utility App provides extended functionality, including product firmware updates, source selection (if applicable) and EQ settings for the W Amp.

Hogue® overmoldings on the stock facilitate sure handling, and it has a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability off a rest.

It has an extended magazine, a caldwell bipod, and a 10-40x50mm Barska scope in leupold rings. 
Has less than 100 rounds down range, haven't found a range around here with distance even close to being able to challenge what it can do.

886,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4255886,"For Sale/Trade:  36"" Sneaky Bag - Rifle Bag","Monroe, Seattle, Washington",$ 125,"Listed On: Thursday, May 7, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Covert Rifle Bag was designed at the request of armed professionals who were looking for the most discreet way to transport a ready to use weapons system in some of the worlds most dangerous environments where the consequences of being discovered would be dire. 
There are only so many ways to hide an object with a fixed set of dimensions. Change the object or use a version of camoflage that  tricks the mind into thinking the object is something else.  With external bungees and daisy chain  for securing non gun items, rounded edges and designed to be carried over the shoulder like a quiver or backpack the CRB blends into enviornments where a traditional squared off discreet case might get ""Made"" more easily.  The CRB  looks enough like a sports equipment bag or hiking backpack that it does not immediately scream ""Gun Inside Here""  to bystanders.  We think we struck a nice balance here because you do not need tp dissasemble your loaded weapons, making them faster to get into action while also having a profile that gives you extra time if you are under scrutiny in a denied area.
The internal weapons compartment is slick, with no ties or dangling things to facilitate a speedy weapons  removal from the bag, even with magazines and optics attached.
There is a plastic insert at the bottom of the bag so that sharp muzzle devices do not poke through the bag, when weapons are carried muzzle down or set on hard surfaces with the muzzle facing down.  There is now also an internal padded divider to facilitate carry of more than one weapon, broken down weapon systems or other tools. The main compartment utilizes a lockable YKK zipper to secure contents and to allow the CRB to function as a lockable container in those areas or agencies that require it.
There is a main external storage  pocket with MOLLE/Velcro grid inside should you want to attach other pockets, pouches or holsters. In addition to the main external storage pocket, there is a concealed ""Flat"" pocket suitable for paperwork or other items as well as a small ""Key Pocket"" that is sized to fit keys and most smart phones.
Many users report this external pocket (10"" x 10"" x 1.5"") is the perfect size for a small active shooter bag and trauma kit, allowing you to have a small fighting load with your primary weapon. 
The long and thin overall profile lends the bag to being attached behind car seats without being too obtrusive while still giving quick access to the bag contents.
Comes in two sizes to fit most popular weapons in use (31"" x 12"" x 2"" and 36"" x 12"" x 2"") the CRB's were designed to be slung over the shoulder ""Quiver""  style but can also be carried ""Backpack""  fashion with a simple re-routing of the shoulder strap.
Features:
Made of 1000D nylon
Milspec webbings and bungees
Removable closed cell foam and HDPE plastic. The CRB will protect the contents inside and keep you from getting jabbed by sharp charging handles or other accessories.
MOLLE/Velcro grid in the extermal pocket which accepts all MOLLE compatible accessories on the market. We like the ones we make but any other manufacturers product should do fine as well.
Dimensions 36"" x 12"" x 2"" (4"" where the external pocket is).
In the 36"" overall length CRB, we have seen the folowing Weapon Systems fit with magazine inserted and an optic attached:
AR15/M16 Family of weapons with an overall length (Non Colapsed or fixed) of less than 36 inches.
AK family of weapons with fixed stocks.
Some Shotguns with 18 inch barrels and shorter stocks or folding stocks.

This gun is in the hard hitting 300 savage.  It routinely shoots 1"" groupings for me at 50 yards and is in extremely nice shape for a gun of its age.  The serial number on the gun dates it to a 1950 date of manufacturing.  The gun is NOT drilled and tapped for a scope.  This was one of the last model years that Savage did not drill and tap these guns.  It is getting to be tough to find one in this shape that has not been drilled and tapped.  The blueing is still very nice on this gun and the lever case coloring is also very nice.  The wood on this gun shows a few hunting scrapes, but not any large dings or gouges.  It is a good honest savage 99 survivor.  

Good thing about the 300 Savages, you can go down the road to gander mountain and still buy shells for this cartridge.  It is very similar ballistically to a 308 winchester.

I have lowered my price to $575 on this rifle, can't go much lower on this one.  It is worth every penny of that and would be a nice addition to anyone's collection. Please call or text REDACTED if you are interested or send an email to me."
