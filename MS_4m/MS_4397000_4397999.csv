This safe retails for $3800, and once I take it off my trailer, it will likely stay in my garage forever.  It has a time delay function, digital keypad (combination can be changed), three shelves, excellent fire rating, and weighs approximately 2750lbs.  Few scratches, but nothing that couldn't be touched up if you want it to look perfect.

I'm interested in trading for weapons valued at or around $1k or $800 cash.  I would also consider trading for a Trijicon ACOG (or other high end optics), and if you have something that is valued higher than $1k, I will add cash, ammo, or firearms.

I will deliver once we have made our deal and you have seen the safe and know you want it.  

This is not a safe you can buy at Walmart- it's the real deal.  

45"" tall on the inside- will hold at least 15 long guns, probably 20 if you do it right."

Basically you get a firearm that is very versatile between the three different barrels it comes with, the extra capacity from the higher mags, or easier concealment from the sub compact mags. The night sights make this a great shooter any time of the day, but since this has a custom light rail it's an easy bedside gun by attaching the Varidian CTL. 

A light rail to fit a Varidian CTL has been custom cut into the front of the frame and fits like it was made to be there. It has not affected the firearms ability to shoot on target nor has any stress been shown on the frame.

The Cobra Tactical features a return spring in the forearm. Simply pull back on the forearm and release, the spring will return the forearm forward thus closing the chamber. This makes for rapid firing in a pump shotgun. The spring can be removed and the gun will work like a traditional pump. The Cobra Tactical is also fitted with a picatinny rail located under the forearm. Removable choke system that uses Beretta® Mobile threads includes one choke tube (Cyl), choke box and choke wrench. Highly durable injection molded stock and forearm. Rubber recoil pad, backed with a five-year mechanical warranty.

Features:
• Spring Loaded Forearm for Fast Cycling
• Picatinny Rail on Forearm
• Blade Front Sight
• 5 Round Magazine – Shot Plug Included
• Chrome-lined Chamber and Barrel
• Swivel Studs
• 1 Beretta® Style Choke Tube (Cyl)

Action: Spring loaded pump action shotgun. To open bolt, hold release button and pull down on forearm. This will open the action, to close, simply release forearm as spring will close the action. After the trigger is pulled the same action will need to be repeated to eject spent shell and load another from the magazine.

Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile.

Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading. Shot plug is included and comes installed. Shot plug is easily removable by unscrewing the magazine cap. Simply pull plug out and replace magazine cap.

I'll take trades but cash talks. I'm located in Stillwater.  I make frequent trips to Tulsa and OKC."

I got this at Cabelas a couple years ago as a starter rifle since it was all I could afford at the time and have since upgraded and need to clear space in the safe. It came with all the accessories: ammo pouches, sling, bayo, oil can, tool kit. I have added a few others as well but have not made any modifications that change the original gun: butt pad, brass stacker mount, 2-7 x 42 AIM sports long eye relief scope. I have not fired any corrosive ammo thru the gun while I've had it. The stock is in overall good condition with no major repairs or blemishes, the bore is in fair shape with a lot of rifling left, but some pitting apparent towards the muzzle end.  It still shoots very well with the Hornady SST custom ammo, about 1.5"" five shot groups @ 100yds. Definitely respectable for this ol' gun! I have also compiled a reasonable amount of ammo I would like to sell with it:

haven't even filled out the warranty card yet so you would get the lifetime warranty from leupold/redfield 

""The Redfield Battlezone tactical rifle scope is the perfect choice for the AR-15, LR-308, or precision bolt action enthusiasts. Each Battlezone includes a tactical 1/4 MOA turret calibrated to a .223/5.56, 55 grain FMJ @3100 fps, and a second elevation turret calibrated for a .308/7.62, 168 grain HPBT @ 2650 fps. The combination of a ballistic MOA turret and MOA based reticle give shooters the option of dialing for known ranges or using the TAC-MOA reticle for quick holdover points. No matter how shooters choose to use the Battlezone, rest assured its rugged body is 100% waterproof, fogproof and shock proof.  Covered by a Full Lifetime Warranty.""

Will do a bill of sale. Buyer must show valid WI ID and have no felonies and over age of 21 to own a pistol. If you're not willing for me to check backround I will not sell it to you.

The lenses also feature the Diamondcoat 2 lens coating which provides abrasion resistance and are edge-blackened to improve resolution by reducing glare. The precision twin spring erector has cryogenically treated adjustments to provide the utmost precision and 30 percent more holding force to ensure reliability. The fast focus eye piece allows for quick adjustments in the field at times when a split second might mean the difference between filling your tag and going home empty-handed.

PIG CR-UTV-MS Upgrade Straps, standard.
Internal drainage grommets.
Compatible with PIG CR H-Harness Kit.
