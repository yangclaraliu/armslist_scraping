I dropped about 15' and it slightly bent the barrel. I had a supressor on it and it hit the supressor so no ""contact"" damage done. I took it to a gunsmith and he said its fine to shoot so i shot it 4 times and put it up. Barrel shot fine bo heating or anything that scared me. I purchased a new one before i got the green light i could shoot this one so i figured id throw it up for sale. Trade or sale

I bought this on a whim and have not even shot it. (Too busy playing with a Hi-Power I recently bought). I need to clean up some space in the safe and get some cash back so have decided to sell it. This gun is in excellent condition. There are no wear marks on this pistol, at all. No holster wear and no visible signs of chambering and firing. The only signs that this pistol has seen some sort of use are the grips, the right side has a mark on the upper side of the grip that looks as if an asset tag was there, the left side has a small chip missing from the upper screw recess (see both in pictures). Other than that the gun is immaculate. It almost seems as if it sat in an armory and rarely if ever got checked out. The gun comes with a 92S compatible magazine. Please email with any questions. Shipping is a flat rate $30 for the continental US and must be shipped via FFL. Local purchase requires a pistol or NC CCH permit.
