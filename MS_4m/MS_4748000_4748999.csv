I took it out of a new LWRC IC rifle and replaced it with a two stage trigger (just personal preference). This is a very nice, crisp single stage trigger that LWRC makes 100% in house. They X-ray the trigger to identify any internal imperfections within the trigger group so the quality of these triggers are second to none! It is coated in Lwrc's proprietary nickel coating, so you can be sure in knowing that this trigger is not just a standard mil spec trigger that other companies/competitors take and simply coat it in nickel boron. This is quality from the ground up. 

Brownells website sells this trigger for about $108 plus shipping, so I feel $80 is very fair, being that it's brand new.

Rifle is in pristine condition. 5.45 is a great round to shoot and cheap.  Comes with one 30 round mag.  I have an SGL-31 and have considered keeping this one and using it as a torture/rough AK but it's way too pretty!  The only way you can tell a difference in the two is the furniture and the action is actually a little smoother than the Arsenal believe it or not I'll even bring the SGL so you can see for yourself.  Would rather sell but open to trades just let me know whatcha got I can add cash to offers as well.  Thanks!

I just got word I'll be moving back home to California soon, so, I either have to make this ACR CA-compliant or sell it. This ACR-Enhanced MSRPs for $2766.48. I bought it brand new from Sportsman's Warehouse for a good deal, I then added the SureFire Scout ($280~), the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced 2-stage trigger ($250), a Troy aluminum full/stubby front vertical grip ($80), and a Magpul dual/single point QD sling ($80). I've only taken this rifle out once, and put no more than 200 rounds through it. Seeing as though its essentially a $3300+ rifle and it's awesome, I don't want to install a bullet button magazine release, subject it to 10rd magazines, stake the flash hider, and buy the $110 stupid ugly fixed stock. AND, I could really use the extra money when it comes time for the move.

Aside from the aftermarket parts I added, the ACR-E comes with a hard case, front/rear Magpul MBUS polymer flip up sights, and 2 30rd magazines.

Original Pricing:
ACR Enhanced - $2766.48 MSRP + $221.32 tax = $2987.80
Extra Parts - $690.00 + $55.20 tax = $745.20

Upgraded to be a superior mini Glock suited for serious concealed carry. Frame has been stippled for better grip, finger grooves removed, trigger undercut and support hand undercut, thumb rest ledges added as well as mag well cutout to aid in mag removal. Also has been modded to accept Gen 4 back straps. Extended mag release and extended slide release. Internal mods include polished trigger bar and connector as well as polished firing pin and firing pin safety. The result is a very smooth trigger pull and positive reset. Trigger pull weight has not been modified. XS Big Dot night sights recently installed. Comes with two mags. Each has either a Vickers Tactical base plate or an extended pinky rest base plate. Also included are a Raven Concealment Phantom belt mounted holster (new condition, paid $90 less than a year ago) and an Alien Gear IWB hybrid holster (great shape). One point: This is not a numbers matching gun. The complete slide assembly had been mated to the frame by the previous owner. Not sure if it was a damage case or if he bought the parts separately for another reason. Gun was box stock and mint when I bought it. Very low round count, as this was the emergency backup to my Glock 17. Shoots great. Never had an issue. Sorry, no tupperware case. FTF via Mass EFA10 preferred."

It has a 20"" smoothbore barrel with 8+1 shot capacity, parkerized matt-black finish from the factory with the corrosion resistant coating on the bolt, standard Mossberg pump and rifle stock equipped, the Mossberg pistol grip it came with can be included if you want, picatinny accessory rail for optic is also optional.

I have owned it about 6months and have only taken it shooting once where I fired 24 rounds of 8shot, 8rounds of 00-buckshot and 5rounds of 1.25oz 4"" Magnum Slugs.
37 total rounds have gone flawlessly through this firearm, I clean it twice a month even though I never shoot it. I just prefer to fire pistols and have started using them for home defense, the only original purpose for the purchase of this shotgun.

All reasonable cash offers will be considered. I do not want to trade at this time as I do nit need to sell I just hate to see a good firearm sit around unused. With both the stock and pistol grip (both are in like new condition and worth about $25-$30ea) I am firm at $300. If you have any questions about the firearm please do not hesitate to contact me.

**EDIT**
 The heat shield seen in the photo is no longer on the barrel. The barrel was replaced with a brand new one from Mossberg because the finish had started to look shiny. I have not fired any rounds through this barrel."

The Huldra Mark IV 5.45x39 Carbine Complete Upper comes complete and ready to go into any mil-spec AR 15 lower. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome. 

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This upper has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. Each upper also comes with a Wolff Extra Power Hammer Spring to ignite the older hardened primers. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining."

It is an Israeli pistol designed after the Czech badass the CZ 75.
It fits palms like a glove. ZERO malfunctions with around 900 rounds thru it.
It is a Double Action/Single Action pistol so you CAN keep it ""Cocked and Locked"" which is how i carry it
Locked breech and operated with short recoil.
Three-dot adjustable sights, large trigger guard (since Israeli security agencies and military use them it was designed for optimum trigger engagement with gloves), it does have a thumb safety and a half-cock safety also, 17 round mags x 2 (uses EAA witness mags), 
They also have a stock you can buy for it if you are willing to get the tax stamp for it (i wish i did),
BOTH the barrel and slide are forged.
Disassembly (field stripping) is easy and COMPLETE teardown is also easy,taking only a few minutes to do.
It obviously had a rail for those who use lights or lasers or both.

This pistol runs right around the 500 range NEW but some who know me personally know i dont rip people off like most others try so im not even asking $400

Last price at Buds Gun Shop was $456.00

 $350 Is my price

Exact dating is almost impossible.  All numbers match and the condition is excellent.  95% blueing, great shiny bore, tight slide, just show holster wear.  This pistol has been shot very little in its 85 years.  By the markings it belonged to swedish service regiment #1 and was pistol 596.  inspeced and proofed by the carl gustav factory.  Very collectable and rare.  Check gunbroker completed auction listings,  prices range from $500  to $600 plus shipping and transfer fees.  I will trade for any service rifles in .308 no cash on my end.  A quality progressive reloading setup will also be considered."

Head or helmet mounted, the PVS-14 allows the user to retain their night adapted vision in one eye while viewing their surroundings through the illuminated eyepiece of the PVS-14. The new battery housing completes the perfect package by allowing the user to power off the unit when in an upright position and power on when flipped down.

Strength is its ability to be weapon mounted behind most collimated daylight aimers and Reflex sights such as the ACOG, Aimpoint and EO Tech systems. This allows the user the ability to use their PVS-14 both as a night vision monocular for increased mobility and tactical awareness and as a short range weapon sight.
Gain control gives the user the ability to increase or decrease the tube gain. Under extremely dark conditions, gain control allows the user to adjust the gain upward, giving a better image. Under high light conditions, details can be washed out due to an excess of light. Lowering the system gain can allow those details to be better seen. Additional features of the PVS-14 include an infrared LED with LED indicator and a low battery indicator. All in all, the PVS-14 has set the bar for what a night vision monocular should be."

I moved my hunting to a rifle zone and no longer have a need for this firearm.  It's been sighted in and I shot a deer last year at 100 yards with it, so it probably has about 20 rounds down the pipe.  It's a total tack driver and it great for stand hunting.  The heavy barrel really helps with recoil.  You don't need more than one shot with this gun.  It has a beautiful walnut stock and blued barrel.  It has a factory installed rail to mount your scope.  NOTE: THE SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED

These guns are increasingly hard to find.  They don't carry them at all the major sites as far I can find.

Here's some more information:

A true tack-driver, this shotgun has a 24"" fully rifled Ultragon barrel crafted of heavy steel. This barrel design promotes more consistent harmonics and better long-range accuracy with today’s high-velocity slug loads. It has a walnut-stained American hardwood stock with a Monte Carlo comb that promotes rapid alignment with your crosshairs."
