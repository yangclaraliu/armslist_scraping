0,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4303000,For Sale:  PWS MK107 Complete AR15 Piston 5.56 Upper with PWS CQB Muzzle Device,"Willing to drive or ship, Tacoma, Washington",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, May 4, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"$800 Or Best Offer ($1450 MSRP, $1300 common retail for upper/ $150 retail for muzzle device) I've also got a sig brace that I'll include with the upper if you are putting it on a pistol.
This is a great upper for an AR15 pistol or SBR. Includes BCG and 2 stock rail sections. I have the stock PWS Triad flash hider on another rifle if you'd prefer that over the CQB. Upper has about 180 rounds through it total without an issue. I really like this but I'm going with a slightly longer PWS barrel.

http://primaryweapons.com/firearms/mk1/
Official descriptions: The PWS MK107 (Diablo) Upper was developed specifically for CQB requirements and as a replacement option for MP5-style weapons. The short compact design retains lethal capability out to 200 meters and has been proven highly effective in the military and law enforcement community. It features the same great long-stroke piston used in all PWS products for reliability and reduced fouling.
The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail. Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle.
The CQB Comp, originally designed as part of the MK107 Rifle, provides as much compensation as possible while suppressing flash and sending all the blast forward of the shooter and those next to the shooter.
The CQB Comp features a 2 part design with a removable end cap for ease of cleaning. The primary function is to send all the blast forward while suppressing as much flash as possible."

BRAND NEW - VZ58 - 2008 V (Výsadkový—""airborne""), manufactured by Czech Small Arms (formerly known as D-Technik) in Jablunka, Czech Republic and includes the following: Three 30 round alloy magazines, cleaning kit, and sling. Imported by Century Arms.

MUST HAVE FOR MARYLAND RESIDENTS - WHERE AK47'S ARE ILLEGAL * magazines for MD purchase are MDSP compliant.
Dubbed the VZ2008, this carbine sports the side-folding steel stock and features a combination of original Czech and new US-made parts for legality.
With the stock folded, the 7-pound VZ2008 measures just over 26 inches long. This compact size, combined with the powerful 7.62x39mm chambering and 30 + 1 capacity makes it extremely well suited as a law enforcement patrol rifle or home defense.
Our test rifle – after more than 2000 rounds, has performed without a hitch. Despite its light weight and compact dimensions, the perceived recoil of the 7.62x39mm carbine proved to be quite pleasant and manageable. Accuracy at 100 yards was also quite good; with only the iron sights.
•	All VZ58  - 2008 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped. 
•	One pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
•	Last round bot hold open
•	The VZ 2008 can be reloaded with stripper clips with magazine inserted in the rifle.
•	More ergonomic safety, making a faster first shot possible with the VZ2008.
•	HUGE ejection port, no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action.
•	Gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
•	Alloy magazines - half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine.
•	The VZ2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47, reducing number of parts to fail

•	OUR TEST RIFLE 2000 rounds, no cleaning, no problems at all 
•	Battle rifle accuracy that I am sure I could improve 
•	At $540.00 this rifle is an absolute steal 
•	Minimal buildup after shooting 
•	Easy to take down 
•	Surplus parts available for low prices 
•	Ejects to consistently, away from other shooters"

With the stock folded, the 7-pound VZ2008 measures just over 26 inches long. This compact size, combined with the powerful 7.62x39mm chambering and 30 + 1 capacity makes it extremely well suited as a law enforcement patrol rifle or home defense.
Our test rifle – after more than 2000 rounds, has performed without a hitch. Despite its light weight and compact dimensions, the perceived recoil of the 7.62x39mm carbine proved to be quite pleasant and manageable. Accuracy at 100 yards was also quite good; with only the iron sights.
•	All VZ58  - 2008 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped.

•	Last round bot hold open
•	The VZ 2008 can be reloaded with stripper clips with magazine inserted in the rifle.

•	Gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
•	Alloy magazines - half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine.
•	The VZ2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47, reducing number of parts to fail

•	OUR TEST RIFLE 2000 rounds, no cleaning, no problems at all

Completely original, this pistol has the correct light grey parkerized finish that was used in the last months of production (after about serial number 2,380,000). All parts are correct/original and the condition is very hard to beat, this pistol is nearly new! It has the correct late serrated slide lock, late 8-rib mainspring housing, HS contract barrel, correct hammer, correct Keyes Fibre grips, etc. The finish is completely original with the ""P"" proofs matching in size/shape and showing the characteristic burnishing, having been stamped after parkerizing. The ordnance crossed cannons, FJA inspectors marking, and the serial number also show the stamped after finish, burnished appearance. As expected, the bullet ramp is bright, milled after finish. The original light grey parkerized finish shows a few normal handling marks, but is one of those rare military 1911A1's that has almost no takedown scratch. The original finish rates about 98% and is free of any rust or pitting. The grips are in excellent condition as well with little wear and no cracks, chips or gouges. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. This exceptional pistol comes with three original, late WWII General Shaver contract magazines as well as an unissued/original Boyt 45 marked holster w/ lanyard, original pistol belt, WWII double mag pouch (Boyle 1942), and original late war style Carlisle bandage in the original first aid pouch (Brede Inc. 1945). This pistol is serial number 2445758...the last 1911A1 produced by Remington Rand was 2465139..."

The Ruger is almost new, only 25 rounds through it.  Comes with the box and all factory stuff, and can include 25 rounds.  This is the new LCRx model with the exposed hammer for single action as well as double action shots.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it, I've just had a few revolvers and I'd like a single stack 9mm of some kind.  Primarily interested in a Ruger LC9s or a Springfield XDs essential, maybe other similar handguns.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus please.
Would also consider a recent production Glock 42, or a 2013 or newer Ruger LCP.

My fiancée is a Mary Kay representative, and she is spear-heading a fund raiser to send our troops who are stationed in the Middle East sunscreen & lip balm sets. Operation Shield Our Troops is a small way of saying thank you to our military serving in the harsh desert climates of the Middle East. Will this totally nullify the sacrifice being made by them for all of us, in short, no, but if it can alleviate one aspect of the many conditions they deal with everyday, then what would it be to give that gift to them. Just to let them know that they are being thought of, appreciated, and possibly reinforce their mettle in the endeavor they have chosen to do, is a small price on our part to help them in any way we can. So please give generously, and know that for your donation you have made one of our troops time in service that much better. Every set that is donated, there will be a personalized card saying from whom the gift was donated by, so they know exactly who supported them in their time of sacrifice. If you could please circulate this, it would be greatly appreciated. She has set up a donation page; here is the link to the page, thank you.

I have never fired the launcher cause I never bought ammo for it however I will include 2 adapters that allow you to fire all kinds of different types of rounds. This is the legal civilian version not the military version which is 40mm and illegal. The AR has been very reliable for me and I would trust my life with it.

I don't know the barrel twist and I only sighted it out to 100 yards. I never intended to use it as a sniper rifle since I can't hunt with it and most real world engagements occur within 200 yards.

This gun has always run flawlessly for me. I've recently replaced the extractor as these wear out on the Hi Power design. These Arcus handguns are tough as nails and built to military specs. There are a number of armies around the world that use these as standard issued side arms.

Sorry, no trades

The only issue with this pistol is something got on the slide at some point on the right side and discolored the black finish in a couple spots. It's not that bad and I can send pics of it on request. I had always intended to have the slide ceracoated but never got around to it. Functionally, the gun runs perfect. It would look like new again if you had the slide done. Last I checked, it's about $75 to have something like that ceracoated. I was gonna do desert tan. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions about it and I can deliver this within the greater Greenville area too

Destined to be a top choice of North Country guides, it delivers the massive punch of a 45–70 Gov´t. with unmatched speed – with the lethal assurance of a 6–round capacity thanks to a full–length magazine tube. Rapid target acquisition comes natural with its 18½"" barrel and XS Ghost Ring Sights and scout scope mount. And its Wild West Guns style big loop lever adds a distinctive traditional style while promoting sure follow-up shots, even with gloves. True to the inhospitable territory it was born to thrive in, the Model 1895SBL features the weather resistance of a grey/black laminated stock and stainless steel finish on all major metal components."

I will cancel if I have sold it. Very nice, lightly used Mauser, Model Hsc Super, in .380 or 9 mm short.  I have field stripped, cleaned, and it is about the cleanest gun I have ever gotten.  Looks to have been holster carried but shot very little. 10 Round magazine, so it's made in the 1980's.  Double action/single action, semi-auto.  Hammer drop safety.  Came to me as part of a trade and I just don't have a need for it.  I am a collector more than a shooter and have enough home defense carry guns, so this is surplus.  Finish is very nice with only some what I'd term holster wear on some high edge.  Wood grips are also very good, with a couple small dings on the butt, and a scuff or two, but these are superficial, not into the wood.  No rust, pitting, cracks, scratches or patina.  Bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling.   I would ship for $25 using the customary FFL transfer laws, with up front payment, etc.  My GB and e-Bay ID's are both Rmasters3-- you'll see I handle my business responsibly."

I am desperately looking for a full or partial set of 223 turrets for a Cabelas Multi-Turret Centerfire Scope. I have the turrets for 300 Win Mag. I am willing to buy or trade turrets for one or more 223. Prefer 55 gr but at this point I'm not picky. Tried buying a set from cabelas but since it's a 300 Win Mag they won't sell a separate set of turrets in a different caliber (bastards). I'm also willing to buy the whole scope package if necessary but I don't have much money (3 kids in grad school and this is for my 9 yo boy's surprise rifle). 

Otherwise I'm def in the market for a Nikon M-223 scope with BDC reticle. 

We are moving and I have stuff to trade if anyone is interested.  Have a dual stage MTD snowblower I'll let go for a steal for the right package deal.

BACKGROUND:
I bought it brand new from Sportsman's Warehouse in Spokane Valley about 8 or 9 years ago. I rarely shoot it, but it was my regular carry gun for a while (you wouldn't know it just by looking at it). I've probably put 1,500 rds down the pipe at the very most. I've taken great care of it and cleaned it thoroughly after every range session, although it does have a couple very minor character marks (close-up photos below). Overall, it's in excellent shape.

This gun will eat anything you put through it - steel cases, +P, you name it. I've never had any issues with feeding or ejection. It's built like a tank and feels solid in your hands. I've also been pleased with the accuracy. I just have other things I'd like more, so this is on the chopping block.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
- 9 factory stainless 13-rd mags
- 1 factory stainless 10-rd mag
- 2 XD Gear speed loaders
- 1 XD Gear dual mag holder
- 1 XD Gear right-handed polymer holster
- original factory hard case, cable lock, and keys
- Uncle Mike's Size 5 IWB concealment holster
- BLACKHAWK! black soft case (1 gun compartment and 4 magazines slots)
- 50 rds of Federal HST +P 230gr JHP
- 20 rds of Federal HST 230gr JHP (not +P)
- 18 rds of Federal Hydra-Shok 230gr JHP
- 133 rds of Federal 230gr FMJ brass
- 14 rds of CCI #9 shotshells

PRICE:
I'm asking $500 cash (firm) for this package, or $550 trade value. There's about $200 in mags and $100 in ammo, so I think this price is more than fair. If you don't want everything that's in the package, we can work out a deal for what you do want. Send me an email if you are seriously interested. I'm in the Lynnwood area, so I prefer to meet nearby to do the FFL transfer, but I can be flexible depending upon where you're coming from. We can discuss the transfer fee."

$849.75
This .22 caliber Tribute Edition appropriately wears imagery that commemorates the 1869 event, displaying period-style scrollwork surrounding a 24K gold-plated Jupiter roaring into railroad legend, behind a gold bannered THE LAST RAIL IS LAID with a forward panel carrying a gold rendition of the Golden Spike next to another banner inscribed THE LAST SPIKE IS DRIVEN, on the right side of the polished nickel plated receiver cover.
The walnut stock bears the celebrated Promontory ceremonial image, laser-etched and hand filled, above a PROMONTORY, UTAH MAY 10, 1869 banner, and below the Morse Code letters DONE. On the fore-end, AMERICAN RAILROAD TRIBUTE is bordered by a stylized railroad track.
With one single word, telegraphed in Morse Code on May 10, 1869, history ushered in a new era, connecting both coasts via steel and wood that now spanned the continent for travel and commerce. The Union Pacific, driving hard from the East, and the Central Pacific from the West, met at Promontory Summit, in Utah Territory, after specially chosen Irish and Chinese workers took only 12 hours to lay the last 10 miles of track in time for the ceremony.
Positioning the Union Pacific’s No. 119 and the Central Pacific’s Jupiter locomotives facing each other one railroad tie’s length apart, photographer A.J Russell unlimbered his camera to document the unprecedented accomplishment, speeches were made, the famed Golden Spike was driven, champagne corks popped, and the telegrapher clicked the word “Done” on his key to notify the entire nation. The vast American railroad network now annually moves billions of tons of freight, and hundreds of thousands of people, all around our great country.
Henry Repeating Arms gratefully acknowledges the men and women who kept, and keep, the iron horse smoothly running with the American Railroad Tribute Edition Golden Boy. An outstanding American tribute to a vital American industry."

This rifle has a 1:9 twist rate, fired less than 20 times. As in only 20 bullets have been shot so still very new condition. The warranty is truly no BS, contact them and you will be taken care of very quickly. Some of my upgrades include magpul gear all around, backup sight, fore grip, pistol grip, and mil-spec stock. Just the collapsible stock and mil-spec buffer tube was 150 bucks, this rifle is about 700 on budsgunshop but doesn't come with all the goodies mine does! Also have upgrades not yet installed but that come with the gun….custom things like an ejection port cover with the flag and USA on it. I have a fully loaded mag and Pmag with it and 140 rounds of ammo plus 20 rounds of the zombie green tip rounds. Txt me if you have an offer and ill respond soon as i can. REDACTED. I am open to offers so let me know what you can do! I am asking 900 for the rifle, case, extras and ammo. Shoot me an offer via text and I will get back with you.

Sadlak mag release
Sadlak aluminum scope mount
Schuster adjustable gas plug
JAE-100 stock
GG&G XDS heavy duty bipod
Gemtech M1A flash hider/Suppressor mount

Rifle will come with the original national match front site post/muzzle brake (was purchased as a Cali legal model so it didn't come with a flash hider). I'll also include the original bedded wood stock.

The Sadlak mount was cut down in the front to accommodate an EBR stock. I'm not factoring that into the price. It still works perfectly fine, just has a couple of rails sections in the front missing.

Right now, it has a Zeiss Conquest 4.5-14x44 Z800 scope on it. It is not included with the rifle unless the buyer wants it. If so, I'll give you a heck of a deal on it.

Only trades I would be interested in are high quality FFP scopes. Mainly looking for a Steiner t5xi or m5xi (SCR or MSR reticle). 

Rifle will come with one ten round magazine. FFL required. I'll cover fees up to $40."

A little background info on it -- this FEG is a Walther PPK clone made in Hungary imported by KBI in Harrisburg, PA. It's an interesting gun for several reasons. It is 4.1 inches so it could be imported under the Gun Control Act of 1968, and the left grip artificially widens it to 1.3 inches for the same reason, but if you switched out the grips it would be only 1.1 inches wide. It's a Walther PPK clone with an alloy frame so it's a few ounces lighter than the PPK.

This one was my daily concealed carry for a while because of that small size and light frame. It's got a beautiful blue finish on it too. Over time, however, the rear sights got loose in the dovetail, and the magazine got worn and caused feeding issues. It took too long to track down a replacement mag so I switched to a different weapon, and now this one is for sale."

Overall condition of this gun is very good with a few scuffs on wood stock and a couple light marks on barrel and action. But it looks good. But here's the best part! I am including over 400 rounds of Hornady ammo! That's 8 full boxes of 50 each, and a partial box with what looks like 25 rounds. I won't lie, the ammo can be difficult to find.
