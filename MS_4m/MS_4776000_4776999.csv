	I would also consider trades as well. Im open to most firearm trades. Would like a folder AK47, double stack 1911s, CMR30, Super Redhawks, 45LC Schofields, XDMs with threaded barrel, Marlin 357 levers, maybe 30 carbines, GP100 with boot, SP-101, SP-01, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Some will require boot on your end, some will on mine. Need to meet in norman on this due to my schedule. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

This means that personal security teams can reach farther and hit harder while maintaining the concealability and portability of the current, leading SMG.

The LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle is outfitted with our patent-pending ARM-R™ rail system, featuring a removable top platform and return-to-zero reinstallation with no tools required. The carbine- length rail over a low profile gas block gives the operator their choice in rail-mounted BUIS and is ideal for optics.

The PSD™ rifle combines submachine gun size with a battle rifle cartridge and our ultra reliable gas-piston operating system, offering the professional shooter never-before realized capabilities in one sweet little package.

This other identical rifle has to be the best firing 22LR rifle I've ever shot or owned. It's dead on accurate each time. I paid $650 shipped for the rifle when I purchased it new. I'm wanting $575 for it. There's another like it on Armslist out of NH that's used for $700. I had to order it because finding one around here then or even now in a store is impossible. I've never seen one in a retail or gun store before personally.  I ordered it from a Browning ""Full Line Dealer"" up north. The details below are from Browning's web site.

I do have a set laying around if you needed them. The bolt does have a matching serial number to the action and works perfectly. The only real flaw with the rifle is where the stock was modified (not by me) to accommodate the trigger. It was done fairly well, but needs a little stain and finish to be less noticeable. 

I bought the rifle to use the action and trigger to build a benchrest rifle, but plans have changed.

If you can find it cheaper, great.  I don't want any hassles. I have been advised that they sell a 1000 round brick a lot cheaper.  I have checked Cabelas and Midway.  Both sites are inactive/unavailable. Gunbroker gets $90.00 plus $25.00 shipping.   A 500 round brick is around $65 plus shipping. Check around. Most 22 LR is going for an average of 10 cents a round.  Why not get the good stuff in time for X-mas.

The gun runs flawlessly, and one of the cooler body kits out there for the Ruger 10/22.

Why pay over a dollar a round for a real PS90 chambered in 5.7, when you can spend pennies on the dollar for rounds for a .22 clone. This gun not some cheap kit, the quality of it is solid. The gun's charging handles even function the charging handle on the Ruger 10/22. The safety on the body kit works as well (there are two functioning safeties on this). This gun loads like a normal 10/22 in the back of the stock (where on the 5.7 version, the shells would exit). Included are two standard ten round magazines for the gun.

I am open to offers on the price, as well as for trades."

The timing and lock up are just like the day it left S&W. Fit and finish are second to none and the stainless looks wet no matter which way you turn the gun The double and single action pull are as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today.   Comes with all front sight blades it left S&W with that can be changed without tools. Also comes with build certificate and case locking key all housed in a beautiful Mahogany Case that's in mint condition as well. If you know anything about S&W 44s you know the Magna was the most accurate 44 S&W ever made.

It was produced by Royal Ordnance Factory Fazakerley in Liverpool in 1946.

It is evident this gun was carried a lot but shot very little. 
Bore is sharp and strong, but the black enamel finish is about 60%.

This is intended by Colt to mimic their .223/5.56 M4 platform, so this would be great if you want to train on a gun that is less expensive to shoot.  It's also just a fun plinker!

This is a good shooter that cycles pretty much every type of 22 LR out there.  I have shot CCI, Federal, Winchester and Remington 22 ammunition through this with no problem.

Comes with a collapsible stock and removable carry handle.  You can remove the handle and mount an optic directly on the top of the receiver, which has a picatinny rail.  In addition, I will include a separate picatinny rail that fits on top of the carry handle and allows you to co-witness the iron sites.

These guns come from the factory with one 30-round magazine.  I will include three extra Colt/Walther magazines that typically retail for $25 to $30 each.  I chipped/repaired a feed lip on one of the magazines - it still functions fine.

Also included is a black canvas adjustable sling, the original manual/tools and the original box.

The gun has been well maintained and is in very good condition.  I have four other 22 cal. guns I shoot on a regular basis, so am looking to thin my rimfire herd a bit.

I bought it, put it in the safe and never shot it. Literally the only thing I've done to the rifle is install the QD sling mount on the rail that Sig provides, the Sig band is still even on the pistol grip. The rifle is incredibly light and can even be fired with the stock closed using both hands on the pistol grip (and I don't exactly have monstrous strength in my forearms for that), Plus it uses a number of standard AR parts so replacement isn't expensive and you can get them yourself. as well. The rifle will come with the original box and everything from Sig, including two key mod rails that you can add to the rifle. It has a two point Quick Detach sling with it as well and will come with the original 30 round metal magazine from Sig. If you're former military then I'll give you a discount as well.

Barrett M107A1 is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in .50 BMG. Barrett touts that the M107A1 is “a lighter yet stronger” version of the original 82A1/M107. Barrett was able to make the rifle lighter by using titanium, aluminum and steel materials to make up the rifle. Also, the muzzle brake is made of titanium as well. But the biggest incentive to the M107A1 isn’t the weight reduction, it’s the fact that it can be suppressed.

The bolt and bolt carrier were specifically designed to work with a suppressor and the suppressor can be easily attached. It fits right over the muzzle brake.

olymer bi-pod. Like the 82A1, a rifle praised for its lightweight, low recoil, dependability and accuracy, the M107A1 has a straight-forward design.

The M107A1 has a 29-inch fluted barrel, which puts the overall length of 57 inches, and it weighs 30.9 pounds. However, a shorter barreled version is also available.

Features include flip-up iron sights, a 10-round box magazine, and a Picatinny rail that runs along the top. The rail allows for easy mounting of optics or accessories.

I had some upgrades done to it: Apex (Machined Aluminum) Forward set sear and trigger kit (parts plus labor was $250) turns spoungy stock trigger into a match grade trigger with very little take up, about a 4lb pull weight and almost no overtravel also trigger is one piece instead of the factory hinged trigger which makes it much nicer to pull/shoot accurately, Stipple Job on front strap and backstrap of grip also the safety, mag release button and index points on both sides ($80), and Tru Dot ""Night Sights"" ($120), also barrel feed ramp was polished along with all internals, trigger guard was undercut and magwell flared. It comes with 2 factory mags a bottle of froglube and two boxes of Black Ops ammo 185gr. Also both mags are loaded with premium hollow points: Barnes tac-xp solid copper hp, and Winchester PDX 1's. 
The only complaint with the Smith & Wesson line of pistols is the trigger. The factory trigger is spoungy and has ALOT of take up and reset and approx a 5lb pull weight. That has all been upgraded. I could sit here and Try to explain it but you really have to feel it for yourself. 
I also still have all the parts for the factory trigger plus when the APEX trigger job was done I had to upgrade the sear housing block to the newest version so that's another new part. So if you have any questions please just let me know. I have roughly have $900 into it I'll sell for $700. PRICE DROP TO $650 Thanks,

It's been refinished at some point, is missing the top hand guard, and looks like an arsenal refurb. Proof mark is sharp on the bottom of the stock but the inspection mark is very very light. Stamping on the receiver is very light from refinishing. Serial is in the 8594xx range. Some loss of bluing but bore looks pretty good, will clean up nice. Priced pretty well for the condition really! I left the remaining piece of sling on it after the sling broke on me. Have the buckle from the other piece if you want it.

Comes with 3 investor choke tubes and Ducks unlimited carry case.

I have used this gun for the past 6 years very moderately and it is in good shape.

On a hunt 4 years ago after taking a shot, half of the stock blew off.  It separated from the rest of the gun in a very clean way about half way down the stock.  I was able to position a wood screw perfectly in order to reconect the piece and I have never had any issues with it since.  No idea how or why this happened in the first place and I have put many rounds threw the gun since.

A new stock runs about $200 but isn't necessary for its proper function.

This gun is 1 of 4500 made."

Despite its low use, I have disassembled it and cleaned it thoroughly, so it's almost brand new. It is known for reliability and accuracy, and I can certainly attest to the latter. I was able to get a grouping the size of a half dollar coin at 100 yards once the scope was sighted in while shooting very casually and rapidly. Someone with experience and patience can literally drive nails with this thing at 100 yards.

The scope included is a Simmons designed for use with a .22 magnum round. It has 3 to 9x magnification, and is very easy to adjust even while looking down the scope. It has a comfortable area of eye relief and a clear sight picture. The reticule is a Truplex and works very well at 25 to 100 yards for me. The scope has held its zero very well after transportation and shooting.

The Bob Allen case was purchased from Cabela's. The lining is torn up a little bit from catching on the sights before I attached the scope, but the padding is all intact and not damaged at all.

I'm asking $190 for everything based on:
- Marlin Model 60: $150
- Simmons Scope: $30
- Bob Allen soft case: $10"

This pistol has been stippled and has had frame reduction performed. The magwell tightened from the frame reduction and so the magazines do not drop freely, fixable, but I never saw it as a problem. Other than that, it is a Glock. 

Cash only, FTF at a dealer of your choice in the Hillsboro or Beaverton area, I will not travel to make sale. You pay BCG fee.

Price is FIRM @ $400, which includes the pistol equipped with night sights, 1 magazine, and original box with paperwork and accessories.

NO TRADES, I am not interested. This is to fund another gun so I will not be trading. Please don't ask.

I also have a large amount of 10mm factory ammo available as well. Please see this link:

92SB (92S-1)[edit]
The extremely rare 92SB, Initially called the 92S-1, was specifically designed for the USAF (US Air Force) trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the 92SB. It included the changes of the 92S, added a firing pin block (thus the addition of the ""B"" to the name), and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. A compact version with a shortened barrel and slide and 13-round magazine capacity known as the 92SB Compact was manufactured from 1981 to 1991"
