I bought it with a Butler Creek folding stock and decided to take it off because the original walnut stock came with it was perfect and looked better. I'll sell the BC stock to the buyer cheap if they want it, and even install it.

When I took it off, I noticed that the internals of the rifle were just as perfect as the externals.  There were minimal, and I mean minimal signs of use.  The blueing on the internal stuff that always has wear from use and contact during the automatic function was all still present and looks like a gun that has been fired only a few times.

The rifling and bore also are perfect.  I'd guess that this rifle had been fired less than 100 times and probably alot less than that.  I took pics of everything and the third pic here shows the trigger mechanism where the hammer gets forced back during racking the gun and after every shot.  As shown, the surfaces that would quickly and violently connect aren't worn like a mini would with even minimal use.

Will make a great rifle for its next owner and has obviously not been used and abused.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol for the nightstand or the shooting range, the XD® 5” Full Size will do the job.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be. The 5” barrel brings you a longer sight radius and decreased shot-to-shot recovery time. The advantages don’t stop with easy shooting, though – the XD® 5” Full Size includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®.

If you’re looking for a pistol that maximizes the XD® platform, put an XD® 5” Full Size in your hand. It will make your day at the range that much more enjoyable. With a variety of finishes, sights and calibers, you can find one that fits your needs.

History:

George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company. He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995. In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design. 

This pkg. is $1500. A cash sale is preferred, but a cash plus pistol trade may be considered with more towards the cash end."

So, for the price, this will be a reliable hunting rifle for anyone getting into hunting, and the season is around the corner.

It has the following additions/upgrades:

Magpul MBUS Pro sights
Magpul SL stock/grip (hated the DD stock ones)
Magpul MS1 2 point QD sling in stealth grey
Palmetto State Armory enhanced trigger (mil-spec pull weight, but crisp with ZERO crunchy-ness)
Strike Industries enhanced takedown pins
Strike Industries enhanced trigger guard
Strike Industries enhanced dust cover
BCM handstop
BCM Gunfighter charging handle

I'll be keeping the optic and the ambi safety (putting the stock safety back on it).  I'm also happy to keep the MBUS Pros, and will deduct $150 from the price if you don't want them.

Bought it recently from a guy who bought it new and never fired it.  I've put 200 rounds through it zeroing the sights and that's it.  Cleaned after firing.  This rifle shoots amazing, I just need to downgrade a little because I don't shoot enough to justify it.  

This rifle sells new for $1,500+ at Rainier Arms and other vendors without the $200+ in add-ons like sights/sling etc... not to mention the other upgraded parts and taxes.  Price is firm.  I will cover the transfer fee at Lynnwood Guns.  I do accept Paypal, so you can use a credit card!

Happy to provide additional pictures, just tell me what you want to get s better look at.

Glock Gen4 22 in 40S&W, includes all factory parts/accessories. Factory barrel has about 1500 rounds through it, all factory loaded brass. I'm looking to get into a smaller framed 9mm for carry, otherwise I'd definitely keep this thing forever. Never had a hiccup of any kind and the Ghost and Wolff internals really give you a nice rolling break on the trigger. Cycles just fine with a weapon light, (not included in price, see below) even when I purposely limp wrist it. Having the TLR installed makes an already very tame .40S&W shoot extremely soft. I'd honestly say it feels like shooting a steel frame 9mm like a Beretta M9/92FS or 9mm 1911, in terms of perceived recoil. There is some very minor holster wear around the front end, but it is defect free otherwise.

I might be willing to separate SOME elements. If you want to talk about doing that, we can. I may ask more for certain things if you choose to separate though, the best pricing I can do is everything as a package deal, itemized below.

This is NOT a WASR or a century put together. This is a like new (maybe 100 rounds fired thru it) Zastava Arms OPAP 7.62x39 AK. The OPAP's are much harder to find and much more desirable than the commonly found NPAP variant. This gun still appears as new finish wise. It does have Yugoslav military furniture. The handguards are M70, the buttstock is from an M76 sniper. The straight comb of the M76 stock eliminates the so called ""cheak slap"" that is common on the M70 and NPAP variants and positions your head properly on the sights. Not only that, it looks nicer (IMO). This rifle comes with one Yugo bolt hold open 30 round mag (I have many others listed seperately). It also comes with a cleaning rod, original Yugo sling, and 2 muzzle brakes - borth a slant brake and a birdcage brake (both Tapco). This gun is 922r compliant, as it was made for Century at the Zastava arsenal in Yugoslavia (with the exception of the M76 stock which was added). It is matching - except for the M76 buttstock of course. 

First to say they take it, gets it. I do have it cross listed (along with mags, chest rig, ammo, etc.). Trades will not work. The price is $700."

I have tons of pics of the internals, etc. 

$650 cash this weekend only. Shipping off Monday for that if still isn't sold. Quality trades considered but trade value is higher than 650.  Don't bother offering less because it won't happen. Thanks.

The P-Series are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. It utilizes a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel.

It has an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released the firing pin springs back to the normal position. It features an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.

Constructed of investment cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel; while the slide and ejector are carbon steel.

It uses double-column box magazine and has a 10 round capacity.The P-Series pistols have an ambidextrous magazine release located behind the trigger guard, it can be pushed forward from either side to eject the magazine."

I won. 1 shot, 1 kill with this thing. It'll also killed a double pane sliding glass door. Lol. That was on accident. In my euphoria of winning the war and shooting from cover at 3am from the kitchen table. I went to put the safety on and pulled the trigger by accident snd blew out the sliding glass door. Wife still won't let me live that one down. It's like new though. Still got the box. Small game will not be a problem with this. Or if your sliding glass door pisses you off.

From ""truth about guns""
The Russian Tokarev was a military service pistol produced in Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, North Korea, Egypt and China. The Tokarev typically chambers the powerful 7.62x25mm bottleneck cartridge. The Chinese made a unique variant chambered in 9mm—the Norinco 213— for the civilian market. The State Factory 66-manufactured all-steel 213 is nearly identical to the Russian TT-33 Tokarev with one key difference: an additional frame mounted safety. (Given the similarities. some gun guys speculate that the Hungarian Tokagypt 9mm pistol inspired the 213.) The 213 is pleasant to shoot, remarkably accurate and extremely reliable."

Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number from the same lot of shotguns we might have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a very attractive specimen from Mossberg’s model 500 Military & Police series. Manufacturer and warrantor is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, TX. Model is 500, Persuader series. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably. Construction is steel barrel, magazine tube, double slide bars, bolt, trigger and internal parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with durable synthetic stock and traditional synthetic forend. Finish is blued steel with semi gloss black anodized receiver. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced combat trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is new factory 3 inch chambered 18 1/2 inch matte blue steel plain bead sight, with .730 vicinity Cylinder Bore muzzle. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. If this shotgun didn’t have a heat shield, we have added a trench type black polymer heat shield for the barrel, that will be obvious from the photos. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are minimal on this shotgun and its mates, not even as much as many unsold new ones on display in gun shops that get handled. We rate them as Excellent, 90 to 95 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. The letter U is factory stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 Special Purpose comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its substantially identical mates, for only $ 239.00.

A great little CC gun.  Comes with 3 Mags (1 Extended & 2 Shortened)
Tritium Night Sights.
I love this gun and am hesitant to sell so I may only keep this up for a week and get cold feet.  But I am looking for a possible trade or sale if the deal is right.  Only 300 rounds put through it.
I like guns that I can get wood grips for and unfortunately this gun I cannot get those types of grips for it and I also like a little bit of a longer barrel.  This is a great great gun for CC.
Guns I would consider trading for:
Sig P229 or other high end Sigs.
Open minded to other good quality handguns like S&W, HK, Beretta, etc.  I tend to favor DA/SA rather than Centerfire.
Also please don't offer up poor brands like Highpoint or Jimenez to name a couple.  I am not interested in cheap guns.

This made in the USA rifle is USED but is in VERY GOOD condition. The powder finished 22“ barrel has very few handling marks and no rust. The receiver is in the same condition and the barrel’s bore is bright and the rifling clean. The Gray stock is in very good condition with very faint handling marks. The Bushnell 3-9x40 scope is clean with clear optics, it has a duplex reticle. A great hunter for any age shooter. I accept MC/Visa with NO charge or Certified Bank Check/USPS Money Order by mail. Shipping charges are fixed and quoted above unless otherwise noted. Shipping is via ground service, faster shipping is available at the buyers expense. Shipping charges include insurance. California sales are welcome, but it is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure he can purchase and own this firearm in his state. All firearms and accessories are for sale locally and I reserve the right to close any auction or listing with no online bids if a local sale becomes available. As with all firearms sales, I recommend all purchases be inspected by a certified gunsmith before firing.Based on the same principles as the Remington 700 series, the Model 710 uses a centerfire bolt action cartridge, a 3 lug bolt system as opposed to the Remington 700's dual opposed locking lugs, with a 4 round detachable magazine (or a 3 round for the 7 mm Remington Magnum and the .300 Winchester Magnum). All can be equipped with a bipod and sling, and comes equipped with a gray.The Remington 710 is a moderately priced rifle. With the synthetic stock and the already mounted scope, it makes an adequate gun for the novice shooter or hunter."

I would also consider trading for a Leupold Deltapoint (original or new Pro model...doesn't matter to me).

My only requirements are that your optic is 100% functional and not beat up (no major scratches on the lens, etc.).

I've had my RM04 mounted on a 9mm handgun for a little over a year. It's an awesome optic, and it's great that it never needs batteries, but I just prefer the adjustable LED reticle more. The lens is in fantastic shape - no scratches and very clean/clear. I've taken very good care of it. Comes with original paperwork, manual, and Pelican case.

Pictures available upon request, but honestly it looks like a new RM04, so a Google image search should be sufficient.

I am aware of the difference in price between the RM04 and the RM06/RM07 models, so as long as the function and condition are comparable between your optic and mine, I will make up the difference with cash or other trade items (ammo, pmags, etc.).

If you're interested in making a trade, send me an email with what you have. Please be sure to offer more information than just ""I have a RM06."" Describe the condition, how it has been used, etc."

This is a GREAT deal, as it is 2 shotguns in one.  I have 2 different barrels, 2 different fore-ends, and 2 different stocks.  I also have 3 different chokes for the longer barrel, the round limiter for waterfowl hunting, as well as the original Mossberg gun lock.  This has been meticulously cared for and cleaned with Frog Lube regularly.

I am only selling because I am looking to upgrade to a semi-auto shotgun for 3-gun purposes.  I currently use this shotgun in my 3-gun training and competitions.

You can see from the pictures it can be configured for either trap/skeet shooting, hunting, or home defense.  If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures please do not hesitate to email me and ask."
