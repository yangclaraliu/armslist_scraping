This pistol is 100% original and looks as close to new as possible. Original grips do have wear as it is a 50 year old + pistol. Recoil spring and all components are 100% original and it fires like the day it was made. It is accurate, powerful and a great gun rather to shoot or collect.

These guns are starting to become more and more rare. The prices keep climbing but I am downsizing my collection so this one is one that is going to a new owner who can appreciate it for what it's worth, a piece of history and a fantastic shooter. It takes all 380 ammo. I've shot it with 380 pmc and 380 Hornaday Zombie. No FTF's at all. Clean, oiled and well preserved. 

Field stripping is a very easy quick under 3 second set up. 
It has 1 original magazine. 7 + 1  / No documentation but I do have a hard shell case included as well with it.

This ammo is new and in the box/brick.  The only reason the brick has been opened was to take ammo out for the photos.  These are 60g all lead projectiles loaded onto .22 Short cases with minimal powder in the case.  These are great for discrete pest control on animals up to the size of rabbits.  These are significantly more quiet than standard or HV .22LR ammo, but not totally quiet as the movie industry or Hillary Clinton would lead you to believe.  I bought these for my .22 and suppressor, but as I am military I have to move to a rather unfriendly state that has stated suppressors and .22 subsonic ammo is not welcome.  Therefore, I have to sell my ammo (suppressor is not for sale).  I will sell 50 round boxes for $8 per box or the entire brick for $75.  Located in Bloomington.  Will meet in/around Bloomington.  Cash only.  If you wish to trade, send me an email with your proposal.  All sales are ""as-is"" and final.  Please email if you need more photos or have any questions."

The stock has the Russian refurbishment mark (the little square with diagonal line through it), but there are a ton of other markings that I was unable to identify.

The amazing thing about this rifle is it's the cleanest stamped Mosin Nagant I've ever come across. The bore, bolt, and receiver are all in near pristine shape as well.

I purchased new from Keiths Sporting Goods on 1-20-15 for $1050.  

I’ve since added the following accessories to it.  

Wilson combat main spring housing $50
Sig Sauer grip safety $50
Cylinder and slide short trigger aluminum $27 (hand fitted)
Kimber extended thumb safely $31
20lb Wolf Mainspring $8
thin Aluma Grips $70
heavier mag button spring $2

Barrel has been polished also.   Gun only has 200 rounds through it.

Most of the original parts come with the gun, in case you want to return to stock.   The gun was mainly set up to fit my smaller hands, hence the thin grips and short trigger and I absolutely love the set up.  The trigger is also a bit lighter than stock and butter smooth.  

Total investment:  $1288.  I’m asking $925 OBO.   Selling to procure funds for another gun purchase.   If you want to see more photos just let me know.  

At this point, not interested in shipping, need to meet in person.  Would prefer in the Portland area.   Would prefer a CHL for my peace of mind, but require at least a valid Oregon Driver's License or ID.   Oregon State Police offers free stolen firearm checks over the phone for your peace of mind if you desire.

Everything is in excellent working condition but does show slight signs of wear, but nothing that will affect the performance at all. The camo finish on the bow shows no marks at all and looks brand new. The string is in good condition and was waxed regularly.

One 20rd box Hornady ""Zombie"" 165gr HP's


Over $800 invested WITHOUT the ammo, that would easily be another $150. So, well over $900 between the gun, ammo and extras. Grip tape in pics peels right off.

I listed everything REALISTICALLY as you can see, a new G23 is easily over $500 with tax so I have priced this at $450 although it's LNIB.

I figured low on everything else not to mention TAX and SHIPPING.

$650 O.B.O. CASH.....prefer a trade."

From the Northwoods to the Texas hill country and in every deer camp and lodge in between, the .30-30 rifle remains the perennial choice of whitetail hunters. More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it’s a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America’s most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. This latest addition to our world-famous line of lever-action repeaters was built with the traditional deer hunter in mind. Like its predecessors, it’s both lightweight (just 7 to 8.3lbs.) and maneuverable (39″ long), – the perfect combination for hunting in dense timber and heavy brush.

Like every Henry rifle, it’s 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing. The Henry H009 has a steel receiver and a round blued steel barrel that is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling.

The H009B has a visually impressive 20″ octagon barrel and a handsome brass receiver and brass barrel band. Both rifles are drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting. The magazine holds five rounds that chamber quickly and smoothly thanks to our crisp, perfectly machined action.

If you’re a deer hunter who wants to carry a rifle like dad and grandpa did back in the “good ol’ days,” treat yourself to a Henry .30-30 and relive the golden era of deer hunting while starting a few traditions of your own.

I have a safe queen Kimber for sale. I put 100 rounds through it after purchasing it from a gun store. The owner stated at the time that he believed the gun to be relatively new. You can see from the photos that this gun has wear. I can't guarantee number of rounds other than to say it was in good enough shape for me to buy it from Parker Guns several years ago. I believe the gun to be at least 7 years old. 

It has night sights which are visible in the dark. It fires well and doesn't jam. What can I say? it's a Kimber CDP. It's really smooth doesn't shoot like a run of the mill glock. All safeties work. 

Comes with: 
1)Galco Holster Leather
2)Practice magazines-3
3) Factory magazine-1
4)Wilson Combat extended magazine-1
5)Police magazine holster concealed-1 by Bianchi
6)40 rounds or more of ammunition depending how much I can round up


Basically, I bought this to pass on to my son one day. I have no sons and my girls want nothing to do with it.  

Terms: Cash. I will meet you at Pony Express guns in Parker for the transfer. The price is the price. There will be no negotiation. You can examine the gun in the store prior to transfer and agree/not agree to buy. If you agree to buy, you show the cash right there. At that point, you will pay for your half of the transfer (20) and I will pay for my half. 

I look at it like this. The accessories are worth new 150. The gun new is about 1100-1200 depending. You get a break on the gun and all the accessories. If it's too much, then move on. I am not negotiating.

This rifle is in great shape. It comes with bases for scope rings. Ready for a scope to be mounted and taken into the woods! It's also a great platform to re-barrel because anyone with a sturdy vise can re-barrel this rifle in the chambering of their choice.

I'll be happy to sell this to an FL resident. I can meet the buyer at Kenny's Gun Room near the Wilcox Rd. exit (exit #53) on I-10 for the transfer. The buyer will be responsible for all applicable fees.

I can include a Simmons Aetec 4-14x44 Illuminated scope and rings for an extra $50.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I believe this was an early to mid '50's production model. Good barrel with clean rifling, no bulges, some blue wear, with Marlin's accurate mirco-groove rifling. See pictures for parts. THERE IS NO MAGAZINE. I also believe the charging handle is missing so please don't ask if I have every component. Its mostly there, along with the parts sheet but I'm listing as project gun. Armslist limits me to three pictures unfortunately. I never got around to finding a magazine and working to bring this old .22 back to life but the action is unique and interesting. 2 wood stocks - 1 walnut, 1 oak. various trigger components are in plastic tub.  Bolt and firing pin and springs are there. You would need a charging handle or to fabricate something which I've seen done on this style of other antique .22s with similar action. 

If you don't like to tinker - do not buy or inquire about this - you'd be better served spending another $50 dollars ;-) The marlin 88 was a sister gun that fed through buttstock via tube instead of magazine below action as this 89c does.
