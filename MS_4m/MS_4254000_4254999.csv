The milspec comes with some very nice upgrades over the g.i. model, lowered and flared ejection port, better barrel, three dot sights, beveled magwell, and a polished feed ramp. The stainless model is a sweet up grade over the parkerized finish which is prone to chip and come off easy. The package comes with 2 stainless mags, holster, mag holster, cleaning brush, tool kit, and extra black grips so you can keep the cross cannon grips put up and looking nice. The Springfield's in my opinion are a top quality 1911 because your getting a forged steel frame instead of a cast frame {like on your Rugers and rock islands} plus they come with a life time warranty regardless of who the original owner was. I am selling because I found another gun I've been looking for.  The asking  price is 625, no trades.  If interested please call or text Matt at REDACTED Mo residents, ftf, and b.o.s, ccw preferred"

This is a very nice AR and it has a very low round count. I've probably only shot a couple hundred through this at most and that's really the only reason I'm considering selling it. I just don't shoot very much anymore and when I do it's usually just plinking in my back yard with my AR 15. This gun will shoot some pretty respectable groups, you won't be disappointed. I've got a good bit of money wrapped up in this and would like to get some of it back out, rather than having it just sitting in a rack. It's far too nice for that. I definitely have well over $2k into this and really have to get a fair price for it or it can stay locked in the rack. I'm looking for $1550 and going to have to stay pretty firm at that price. I really don't need to sell, so if nobody thinks it's worth that much to them, it still is to me and I won't feel bad about keeping it."

Walther commissioned InterArms to make their pistols after an import ban (Smith and Wesson makes them now). It will come with 3 mags; two are Mec Gar and the stainless one may be the factory mag, but I'm not sure. It will also come with a Bianchi leather holster and Midway pistol bag. I acquired this pistol quite recently in a trade, and decided to sell, since I already have a blued Walther. I have put one magazine through it at the range and it seemed very accurate.  I will sell everything for $500 firm.  I am looking to sell but will consider trades- especially a colt mustang or revolver- I can add cash for the right trade. Thanks for looking!

The previous owner special ordered this upper from LWRC and fired 150 rounds through it so it is in mint condition to my eyes. This upper was built with an LMT 16"" barrel m4 profile and of the highest quality. I've researched the LMT barrel and found that they have a fiercely loyal following and are very hard to get with a waiting list in the years in some cases. In any case the original owner thought that the LMT barrel was better and ordered it that way. I've had a couple piston AR's and I absolutely feel it is a superior system with a very precise feel. The upper comes  with everything in the picture."

Comes with 900 pieces of new, discontinued, and hard to find pieces of brass, and some fired brass. Also comes with extra 10"" barrel, 2 barrel change out wrenches, scope mount, and a soft case. This will shoot .357 max, .357 mag, and .38 special. This thing is big, beautiful, and very powerful. It'll be hard to find one in better condition, if at all. You can order different size barrels and change them out of you are wanting a pack gun instead of a 100 yard hunting gun.  It has the smoothest action of any revolver I have ever owned and I have owned multiple snakes, PC S&Ws, and Rugers.  This tops them all.  Fit and finish is amazing. 
To help get an idea of value I have priced the extras online:
Brass $500 (new RP brass on gunbroker is going for $52 a bag plus shipping)
Tools $60
Extra Barrel $80
Scope Mount $70
Soft Case $10
For the entire package, a trade value of $1550 is not unrealistic."

Even when compared to my bullseye gun, I'm pretty certain this is the best 1911 trigger I have ever felt. Gun probably has about 300-400 rounds through it. Only selling because I'm funding another project and this doesn't get nearly the use it deserves. Comes with Wilson 47D mags-we can talk about how many. Also included is a second extractor (Wilson BP, just like the one in the gun) that Dave tuned in case the first one ever went down.

Also available are a Raven holster for this w/an x300, a few OTG concepts kydex mag pouches, and a bunch of 47D mags. Price listed does not reflect these items.

Could definitely use the cash more than a trade right now, but a newish gen4 G17 could get me interested as far as a partial trade."

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $30 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $24.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes, that is our specialty, making holsters for large, bulky or rare guns is always a challenge. We aren't happy until you are happy.

What about a Calico M950? Yes, that was one of our most challenging and difficult guns to date.

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $40 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $34.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.

It is a very good looking pistol with almost no finish wear on the slide (only a tiny bit on the corners) and some wear on the higher edges of the frame. It has the beefed-up slide as well as the steel cross pin. It also has the wide, white dot front sight and the wide white stripe rear sight so fast sight alignment is a breeze. Trigger is very smooth and not too heavy (surprising for a Walther). I have stripped it and the internals are in excellent shape (and it was reassembled properly, I know my way around one of these). I have not fired this one, but I have put well over 5-600 rounds through my '61 P38 without a single malfunction. It eats hollowpoints and ball without discrimination. I would be willing to bet my life on this one doing the same. It comes with a Bundeswehr holster and 2 magazines. I will ship. If you have any questions, feel free to email me."

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $40 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $34.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.

Gun has less than 200 rounds through it and has worked flawlessly the entire time, even in the break in period.  I don't see a lot of CM9's for sale on here, so for those who don't know, it's a more affordable version of the PM9.  It's a great bargain on a gun that's just as good at half the price.

Gun is still in great shape. Comes with 3 mags; 2-6rounders, and 1 7-round extended mag. I also cut some decal tape to add to the grips and it feels great.

I also have a Kramer leather IWB holster that I'm going to sell separately for $70.

A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options,you find out that most customers want it just the way it is. When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. They designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds. The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius. Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol. Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Cerakote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own."

2013 Saiga 7.62x39, New in box. I went through 8 saigas at a local gun shop a year ago and this was by far the best one. Izhmash stamped trunnion and fantastic fit and finish. I replaced the rear sight leaf with a hard to find Russian 300m phosphate one. 10 rounds were fired to check zero and it is dead on and all the sight are perfectly centered. Out of the other 7 this one was the only one that had the factory accuracy testing under 100cm. I don't think that is a true test though as I put a few in the same hole. The box is even mint. Comes as pictured with all correct accessories, 10 round magazine, cleaning rod, and paperwork. $575 shipped to your FFL. You will not be dissapointed.
