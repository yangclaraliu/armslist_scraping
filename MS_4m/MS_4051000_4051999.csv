In great shape as mentioned and comes with all the Xd gear as well as 4 sixteen round magazines.  I'm a big fan of the XD line but I'd just like to see if there's anything else interesting out there.

I prefer to trade.  Would be interested in 3-4 inch 38/357 revolvers, particularly a Ruger GP100 or S&W Model 10 or similar,  but no Taurus or Charters please.
I'm also looking for a 12 gauge Hd/tactical style shotguns, no field guns please.
I've had Hipoint carbines and would like to have one in 9mm, an entry level AK47 (like a WASR 10 or IO made rifle), or a Mossberg MVP patrol in 5.56 or 308 preferably.  Would also be interested in a complete AR15 upper with a 18-20 inch barrel and mid or rifle length gas system.
I'm fine with lesser value trades if you're willing to make up the price difference with cash or ammo, so feel free to let me know what you have.

If you'd prefer to buy I will sell the gun, mags, and 50 rounds of 9mm for $450.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested,  texts preferred.

Genuine factory colt upper. These are hard to find, I know alot of people say this about some guns but this is actually one that is not just floating around your everyday market. Comes in the Colt box, with everything it did new iincluding the factory Matech flip up sight. I put it on a pistol lower and ran 60 flawless rounds through it. It has a blemish in the top rail from the trijicon mount rubbing it, just giving a full disclosure on it. $750 cash. $850 trade

Would go pretty good on one of those Sig Braces.

AR Upper is direct from PSA bought in Spring 2013. Details from vendor (PSA) website about upper receiver:

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The mid profile barrel  is high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated to mil-specs.  Barrel is finished off with a sleek SQR 11"" free-float quad rail with built-in sockets for QD sling swivels, low-profile gas block and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 Flat top AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring M4 feedramp cuts, and T-marks,  these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

I am the original owner and have had this pistol a few years.
Only about 100 rounds ever shot through it but had no failures of any type (no failures to feed, no failures to eject, no failures to fire). Always worked like a charm and is very thin and light (only 6.6 oz. unloaded.) very very low recoil so it's easy to shoot for recoil sensitive people.
Has just a little wear on the slide finish from holstering but has no effect at all on function.
I am throwing in everything in the pics...the pistol, original box and manual, 5 snap caps for practice firing and the ammo pictured.

Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

Awesome little revolver and it's in pretty good shape for being over 100 YEARS OLD. I have had this revolver looked at by a local gunsmith and it is in perfect firing condition. I myself have shot about 80 rounds threw it. It's very rare and has an awesome top break action as shown. It's not the rarest or biggest revolver out there but all of my friends love to shoot it. It's unique, powerful, and small enough to be concealed. The timing is perfect and the bore is still in good shape for its age. Please note that this is not .38 special, its .38 S&W. I have two boxes of ammo for it that I will sell with it for the price listed. 

I'm open to all and any kinds of trades. I would love a short, pump shotgun and can throw in some cash for the trade.

Magpul AFG2
Trijicon 1-4x24 Green Arrow
ARMS #22 scope mount (rock solid)

Very nice MOLLE Rifle bag (Voodoo tactical)
300+ rounds 5.56, including hollow point, plastic tipped, steel core, and a box of ~50 match quality rounds. None of the boxes in the photo are guaranteed to be full but most are.

That rifle with throw rounds down range accurately, basically forever. It's got sights that fold down and out of the way when you don't need them, meaning you'll never be caught without some sort of iron sights. Google the Noveske Ares and check it out. One. Hot. Gun. That scope? Tritium and sun illuminated it'll glow for years in the dark, and forever with even a hint of light. I'm including the scope and the rifle, as well as a sweet sling, 20rnd PMAGs w/ ranger plates (pinned at 10rnd cap), a bag, a bipod, and more, too.

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two blue secondary LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination. Blue secondary LEDs serve the same purpose, but in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. 

The Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body available in Black or Desert Tan. Black models attach via an included low-profile mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via two socket-head machine screws. Tan models attach to the same helmets via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, the Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest."

For sale is a beautiful Winchester Pre-64 Model 94 lever action rifle in 30-30 Winchester caliber.  The Serial No. is 223XXXX, which means it was manufactured in 1956.  It is one of the nicest original Pre-64 Model 94’s that you will ever find and it functions perfectly.  It is rust free and has nearly 100% of the original bluing.  It does not have any touch-up bluing- it is all original.  The stock, which has never been sanded or refinished, has only some faint scratches and dents.  All I have ever done to the stock is wipe on a little oil finish, as they can dry out over time.  The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on February 19, 2015.

The rifle has a Williams peep sight and sling swivels.  In addition, I installed a new follower for the Hornady LeveRevolution bullets.  The original follower is included. 

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.  I do not want to go through the time and hassle of mailing the rifle.  And I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  I checked and there is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Anyway, give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to see the rifle and purchase it.

Thanks for looking!

The Gen 2 Glock 19's are considered to be the best overall Glocks ever made. The condition is exception as these are usuallyl found with lots of holster wear. The frame is spotless and there is only some very minor wear on the slide finish. The internals are original with the exception of a new recoil spring. The original will be included. I installed a new set of steel factory Glock sights to replace the original plastic ones. The original sights are also included. The round count is unknown but, judging by the amount of wear on the barrel bluing, I would guess it would be under 2000 rounds during its 21 years. The bore looks pratically new. Once you pull the slide and pull the trigger on this one, you will know why these are so loved. The fit is superb. It shoots incredibly well with a very nice trigger. Being a Gen 2 model. there are no uncomfortable grooves on the front strap either. Included is the original box with matching serial number lable, original 15 round magazine, a new Gen 4 15 round magazine, and the original owners manual. You will search far and wide to find a Gen 2 19 in this condition. These are the guns that Glock built its reputation on. This one will eat anything you feed it . Not finicky like a lot of newer Glocks. I am asking $560.00 for this gun. I am located about 10 miles West of Fort Worth but can meet you within a reasonable distance. Feel free to call or Text me at 817-71 four -111 Five . I would trade for a Glock 17 Larry Vickers Model . No rifles, shotguns, or revolvers please. Thanks"

Description below is from Surefire's website. Asking $50 OBO 

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two blue secondary LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination. Blue secondary LEDs serve the same purpose, but in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. 

The Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body available in Black or Desert Tan. Black models attach via an included low-profile mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via two socket-head machine screws. Tan models attach to the same helmets via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, the Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest."

Guaranteed waterprooof, fogproof and shockproof.
Model 6421

One of the world's best-known optics companies, Nikon Sport Optics, has teamed with one of the nation's most respected sporting organizations, Buckmasters, to produce a riflescope line featuring high-quality optics.

Built to withstand the toughest hunting conditions, these scopes integrate shock-, fog-, and water-proof construction, as well as numerous other features rarely found on riflescopes in this price range. Nikon's Brightvue anti-reflective system of multicoated lenses provides over 92% anti-reflection capability for the high levels of light transmission and optical clarity necessary for dawn-to-dusk big game hunting. After the lenses are cut and polished, Nikon coats them with multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds. The compounds serve to boost light transmission, improve contrast to pull game out of its surroundings, deliver true color rendition and flare-free viewing, and enhance the overall image quality.

The brightest in its class, the Nikon Buckmasters riflescope has a proven track record of reliability, durability, and precision, making it a true hunter's workhorse. The scope is at home on nearly any hunting rifle, muzzle loader, or even rimfire, boasting a rugged, one-inch main body tube, a bullet drop compensating (BDC) reticle for easy holdover out to 600 yards (magnum calibers), and ultra-high-performance lenses.

The BDC reticle is perhaps the most compelling feature, as its trajectory-compensating system is designed and calibrated to provide fast, simple aiming points for various shot distances. The unique system integrates a series of small ""ballistic circles"" to produce an unobstructed view of the target.

This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

Price $399 will take some trade's let me know what you got...

The Career 707 blew the doors off the PCP market when it was introduced in the US in the 1990s. Even after all these years, this airgun continues to be a favorite among hunters.

The variable power levels give you a huge range of energy for taking small- and medium-sized game at distances previously reserved only for firearms. The gun is manufactured by ShinSung, a Korean company that knows what hunters need and want, because Koreans have been using the Career far longer to hunt all types of game.

The Monte Carlo Indonesian hardwood stock has a raised cheekpiece and checkering on the wrist (directly above the lever). The forearm also has checkering to ensure a firm grip when you're in the thick of things. The lever-action cocking mechanism works quickly, smoothly and effortlessly as you chamber each pellet from the multi-shot magazine.

The number of shots you can load in the mag depends on the length of the pellets, but most people load about 6 pellets (although you can fit 10 Crosman Premiers!). Longer ones take up more room, so you won't be able to load as many. 

The built-in manometer (air pressure gauge) shows you how much air remains in the two built-in air reservoirs, located directly below the barrel. This air rifle was the first to offer adjustable velocities with its integral power wheel. Adjust the wheel to accommodate heavy or light pellets, long or short distances and the type of game you're shooting. The gun adjusts to YOUR needs instead of the other way around! Max velocity is 1,250 fps in .22 cal. and 1,000 fps in .25 cal. You'll get up to 20 full-power shots.

The two-stage trigger can be adjusted to your shooting preference. The front sight is a hunting-style ramp with a bead, and the rear sight is fully adjustable. The Career 707 is known for its accuracy."

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."
