I already have 5 other similar sized 'pocket pistols'. The pistol has only been fired six rounds. Per Beretta, the specs are:

Action	Striker
Barrel length (mm)	78
Barrel length (in)	3
Caliber	9x19 (PARA)
Magazine	6 and 8 round magazines included
Overall height (mm)	106

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

This pistol gets very good reviews and everyone seems to agree that the pistol is reliable, durable and accurate. It comes in the original factory box with everything from the factory and that box comes in the thin cardboard box from Beretta. Literally, it is like a 'new' pistol. I'm pricing this pistol for a quick sale. If you have an Indiana ID and a carry permit, this pistol and all that it shipped with can be yours for $300.00! For $300.00 I will include a custom made leather holster that can either be used for front pocket carry or, with a matching snap on leather rear flap, carried where it looks like a wallet in your rear pocket. This will make a fantastic concealed firearm with a LOT more stopping power than the smaller .380 pistols yet is really no larger physically than the micro .380's.  I don't intend to sound rude, but $300.00 is my absolute bottom dollar price."

Having sold my Glock 19, I no longer need my FoxX IWB hybrid holster and my Blackhawk! Serpa Sportster OWB holsters. If you are looking for a well taken care of set of holsters that are good to go, let me know! If you look in the album, you can tell that the leather on the hybrid holster is well broken in and supple. The wear you see is normal, and by no means degrades the quality of the holster. I am asking $50 for the holsters. If you have any questions, shoot me an email.

History:

Around 50,000 of these unique guns chambered in 9mm Luger were custom ordered from Spain by Nazi Germany during the second world war. Only the first 10,000 were actually received by the Nazis as the Allies cut off the supply route by liberating France. The remainder were ordered shelved in a warehouse by the king of Spain. After the war, Germany came looking for them to use as police weapons but Spain refused to recognize the new government and made Germany buy them a second time. This one is neither Nazi or Police marked and was sold on the civilian market in the early 1950s. It is not import marked. These are getting to be fairly rare, especially in this condition.

Notes: This is the smoothest best performing gas operated rifle I've ever had the pleasure of owning. This is a tier one competition rifle with tier one equipment. 
I also have a bunch a Crye Precision gear that'll be up for sale once this sells.

I'd be interested in trading this rifle and all my gear(I have a list already itemized if anyone wants more info on that) for a jeep...a jeep is the only reason I'd like to sell this stuff. I'm not interested in trading for anything else.

I simply cannot go any lower on the price. I'm already losing way too much on this final listed price. Cross reference these things, and you'll find that this is a VERY reasonable price considering it's barely used (not even fully broken in).

Day or night, long or short range, this package does it all. Best part, it's BRAND NEW, never been fired!

So, what is it?!? Awhile back, I enlisted the help of my friend (who happens to be an active Army Sniper) to build an multipurpose AR15 platform that would be equally effective day or night, long/medium/short distances, and can be used to hunt/dispatch predator and varmint (or mid-sized game), and even a home/self defense weapon if so desired. Built using high-end, factory assembled parts and components, coupled with effective and functional accessories. 

Here is a list of everything included (I'll try not to miss anything):

- Rock River Arms Lower Receiver with factory installed and performance tuned 2 stage trigger. Crisp trigger break at exactly 3.75 lbs.
- Black Rain Ordnance Match Grade Upper Receiver and Barrel, chambered in .223 WYLDE - Best of both worlds - the near precision of a .223 bolt action with the ability to accurately fire both .223 and 5.56 ammunition. Includes match grade BCG.
- LWRC Free float aluminum mid-length quad rail (paid over $300 for the rail alone, it is worth it too).
- MagPul CTR Mil-Spec stock with LaRue Tactical RISR cheek riser (gives the perfect cheek weld for precision shots)
- MagPul MIAD pistol grip w/optional grip changes and carry compartment for oil/etc.
- Death Adder Mil-Spec mid-size charging handle
- Atlas BT10 V8 Precision/Military grade bipod (this is not your average bi-pod, it is precision engineered and extremely rugged. Paid over $200).
- 45 degree flip up back up sights (don't remember the manufacture, but they work well and look pretty cool).
- Single point adapter w/single point sling

Optics:

- Steiner Predator Xtreme - 3-12x56mm - Designed by one of the top rifle scope manufactures in the world specifically for predator/varmint and medium to long range hunting/precision shooting. Nothing cheap on this scope, Steiner is commonly used by Military elite for operations and training. This is my second one and I have nothing but great things to say about it. Zeroing, tracking, return to zero, etc. is a breeze. Includes a tactical scope cover as well. (see link below of more information). COMES WITH A STILL UNUSED 30 YEAR FACTORY WARRANTY!!!

- Burris P.E.P.R quick detach one-piece scope mount. 

- ATN Gen 2+ Night Arrow 4-2 Night Vision Weapon Sight (see link below for more information on this amazing night vision rifle scope). Military grade night vision, very clear and effective in complete darkness out to 300-400 yards. This is the only piece of the entire package that is used. Purchased it from a gun show awhile back and have used it a few times to hunt coyote with on another rifle, it is truly awesome, a must see to appreciate. 

- Boxes and everything included from the factory for each optic are included as well.

Misc. Accessories:

- AirGlide hard case specially designed for high end scoped rifles to keep this from laying on their side and provide padding all around for trips and/or shipping. I purchased this for a hunting trip out west that never happened. Brand new.
- 100 rounds of 40 grain V-Max .223 ammo (designed for predator/varmit hunting).
- 20 rounds of Hornady Match Super-performance .223 BTHP ammo. Great for long range shooting.
- 2 MagPul Gen 2 PMAG 30 round magazines - factory sealed.
- Ergo Predator Game Call - factory sealed (paid $40). 
- Boxes and manuals for most everything in this package is also included if the buyer wants it.

Gus is a Keltec KSG in Bronze (hard to get), it comes with box, manual, etc.
I'm located in Gresham for a Face to Face deal with an Oregon resident, I paid over $950 for it, will sell for for $720 cash or will trade, or partial trade plus cash for:
-Tactical Pump, like a Mossberg 590 or a Remington 870, tactical/home defense.
-A full size 1911, non rail (Colt, Smith & Wesson, Sig or Springfield)
-Glock 21 4th gen (maybe), have to make sure that I can hold it with my medium size hands.
-A Tikka T3 7mm-08, or?
For trade values, to be fair, if you want to use new price on yours, I'll do the same on mine.
Thank you."

The bluing and steel of the rifle is in excellent shape, the receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mount, rifling and chamber are in beautiful condition, there are a few character knocks on the wood of the stock, just a few light blemishes in the finish, but doesn't go as deep as into the wood, not nearly what you'd expect out of a 40 year old rifle though. There is a small chip out of the stock near the back of the receiver, and the factory butt pad is in ""roughish"" condition, but it has a brown slip on recoil reducer over it. Comes with soft case, mid-height scope rings, and a box of core lockt ammo. It's extremely nice rifle, but I'm not a hunter nor a collector of rifles. So I think someone else could appreciate it and put it to better use than I. $400 cash/trade, really looking for a carry pistol an m&p shield, ruger sr9c/sr40c, or something along those lines, but not really a fan of Taurus.

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured. The mags are 1 colt and 2 cmc mags, and 59 rounds of ball ammo. This finish is tough to photograph but you won't be disappointed. I would say the finish is %95 consecutively. Very little wear. 

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it. 

H&k VP9 depending on what yours comes with I'll likely need some cash.

Beretta USA is well known for designing and manufacturing some of the most durable and reliable firearms for law enforcement, military, hunting, personal defense, and concealed carry. Beretta has a history steeped in tradition with their Competition Shotguns like the Beretta 692 and DT11, and Field Shotguns like their Beretta 686 and SV10. They also offer modern day firearms like their innovative and exciting Cx4 Storm Rifle, ARX Series Rifles, and their famous Beretta M92/96, and Nano. Beretta USA has something to offer every shooter on the planet regardless of skill level or venue. After all, everyone should own at least 1 Beretta in their collection. Finally, a training training in .22 caliber that looks, feels and shoots like Beretta's heralded ARX160 military assault rifle. Just like the military version, the ARX160 .22 LR is lightweight, user friendly, and an ergonomic masterpiece. This is a rifle full of cool features that will be a thrill to put its paces at the range. Beyond its striking physical and working similarities to the combat version, it also shares its ambidextrous advantages. The two-position safety, magazine release, and cocking handle can all be set to the right or left hand preference. Picatinny rails allow the user to build on anything they can dream, the rifle can be dissembled for cleaning easily without tools, allowing access to clean the barrel from the back round. There is also easy access to the bolt and trigger system, just like with a .223 Rem rifle. Constructed of reinforced polymer with flip up sights, the ARX160 .22 LR gives shooters the experience of shooting the world's preeminent military rifle at a price they can afford."

If you looking for the perfect assault rifle, then this has your name all over it.  It has everything on it you would want or need and is a few pounds lighter making the weapon that much more perfect after being modified.  Below is a breakdown of what this weapon has or has been modified to.   Also I have the stock parts that were swapped out for lighter and modified Parts (unique folding butt stock, trigger, hand guards etc). The ATF stamp/engraving is done on the outside of the trigger guard in a very small font.

Yes I said that, the miscellaneous stuff to include the ammunition is FREE with purchase of the weapon.   I still have all the packaging, boxes and receipts for everything and will send the boxes and packaging to you if you like.  

$$$ I have a number what I will take for the weapon and currently I am taking all offers.  Please make a serious offer and don't waste my time as I won't waste yours.  I know realistically I'm not going to get what i paid but keep in mind, everything is still unused, brand new and in the box.

It has been fired, has a couple light scratches but is in great condition.  It will be sold in the MAC-90 configuration to be 922r compliant.

It will come with 3 authentic Chinese 30 rnd. mags, 1 five rnd. mag, authentic Chinese sling with markings, tool kit and 100 rnds of ammo.

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4278985,For Sale:  Springfield Model 1870 .50-70 Rifle,"IL, Springfield, Illinois",$ 700,"Listed On: Sunday, April 26, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Model 1865 ""First Allin"" Rifles were finished in 1866 and issued to soldiers in the field. The Model 1865 fired a short, copper-cased, .58 caliber rimfire cartridge with a powder charge of 60 grains and a 500 grain bullet. Reports from these units identified several problems with the new rifles. First, the copper cartridge case had a weak case head that was often torn off during extraction, leaving the rest of the case inside the chamber. Ballistically, the .58 caliber round was also considered underpowered. And the breech system itself was considered too fragile with problematic extraction and ejection components. The problems identified were severe enough that Springfield made the decision to completely redesign the breech action and develop an entirely new round. The new cartridge that was designed was based around a .50 caliber bullet that had a more pointed tip than the earlier .58 caliber round. The case was also significantly different with a longer overall case length and a centerfire ignition system instead of the earlier rimfire design. The new case held 70 grains of black powder, giving the new round a significantly higher muzzle velocity than its predecessor. Springfield also designed a new breech that was stronger and had more robust components. The new design was, unlike the earlier Model 1864 ""First Allin"" Rifle, based on the later Civil War issued Model 1863 and 1864 Rifles. The concept was the same, however, in that the rear portion of the original barrel was cut away and the new breech block was hinged in the ""trap door"" style. The smaller diameter of the bullet necessitated a more radical change to the existing Model 1863 barrels. The .58 caliber rifled barrels were reamed out along the entire length to a diameter of .640 inches and then fitted with a .50 caliber liner or barrel insert that was brazed in place at the muzzle and breech. This new rifle was designated the US Model 1866 Rifle, also known as the ""Second Allin"" Rifle and it performed much better than the Model 1865 First Allin Rifle. The Model 1866 saw active combat service soon after it was issued and was considered instrumental in the Army's defeat of Sioux Indians under Chief Red Cloud at the Wagon Box Fight and Hayfield Fight, both occurring in August 1867 along the Bozeman Trail in the Wyoming and Montana Territories.
