I love firearms and would like to work with someone over the summer here and there. I'm not an expert, but I know quite a bit and learn quickly.  

I am mostly looking for someone who is experienced to show me the ropes and help me become more proficient in disassembling/repairing and cleaning of firearms of all sizes and types. I'm simply trying to decide if a future career in firearms is for me, I've checked some online forums about becoming a gunsmith/armorer and a lot of people suggest asking to help other people who are already established. 

I serviced a lot of crew-serve weapons during my time in the Army as a M1 Abrams crew member and did do a combat tour in Iraq so I am not completely inexperienced as I said earlier. I don't care if its a one time thing, or if you need help more often, I do have other things going on so please, please understand I don't want to be an employee, simply someone you can share knowledge with and get a extra hand."

Day or night, long or short range, this package does it all. Best part, it's BRAND NEW, never been fired!

So, what is it?!? Awhile back, I enlisted the help of my friend (who happens to be an active Army Sniper) to build an multipurpose AR15 platform that would be equally effective day or night, long/medium/short distances, and can be used to hunt/dispatch predator and varmint (or mid-sized game), and even a home/self defense weapon if so desired. Built using high-end, factory assembled parts and components, coupled with effective and functional accessories. 

Here is a list of everything included (I'll try not to miss anything):

- Rock River Arms Lower Receiver with factory installed and performance tuned 2 stage trigger. Crisp trigger break at exactly 3.75 lbs.
- Black Rain Ordnance Match Grade Upper Receiver and Barrel, chambered in .223 WYLDE - Best of both worlds - the near precision of a .223 bolt action with the ability to accurately fire both .223 and 5.56 ammunition. Includes match grade BCG.
- LWRC Free float aluminum mid-length quad rail (paid over $300 for the rail alone, it is worth it too).
- MagPul CTR Mil-Spec stock with LaRue Tactical RISR cheek riser (gives the perfect cheek weld for precision shots)
- MagPul MIAD pistol grip w/optional grip changes and carry compartment for oil/etc.
- Death Adder Mil-Spec mid-size charging handle
- Atlas BT10 V8 Precision/Military grade bipod (this is not your average bi-pod, it is precision engineered and extremely rugged. Paid over $200).
- 45 degree flip up back up sights (don't remember the manufacture, but they work well and look pretty cool).
- Single point adapter w/single point sling

Optics:

- Steiner Predator Xtreme - 3-12x56mm - Designed by one of the top rifle scope manufactures in the world specifically for predator/varmint and medium to long range hunting/precision shooting. Nothing cheap on this scope, Steiner is commonly used by Military elite for operations and training. This is my second one and I have nothing but great things to say about it. Zeroing, tracking, return to zero, etc. is a breeze. Includes a tactical scope cover as well. (see link below of more information). COMES WITH A STILL UNUSED 30 YEAR FACTORY WARRANTY!!!

- Burris P.E.P.R quick detach one-piece scope mount. 

- ATN Gen 2+ Night Arrow 4-2 Night Vision Weapon Sight (see link below for more information on this amazing night vision rifle scope). Military grade night vision, very clear and effective in complete darkness out to 300-400 yards. This is the only piece of the entire package that is used. Purchased it from a gun show awhile back and have used it a few times to hunt coyote with on another rifle, it is truly awesome, a must see to appreciate. 

- Boxes and everything included from the factory for each optic are included as well.

Misc. Accessories:

- AirGlide hard case specially designed for high end scoped rifles to keep this from laying on their side and provide padding all around for trips and/or shipping. I purchased this for a hunting trip out west that never happened. Brand new.
- 100 rounds of 40 grain V-Max .223 ammo (designed for predator/varmit hunting).
- 20 rounds of Hornady Match Super-performance .223 BTHP ammo. Great for long range shooting.
- 2 MagPul Gen 2 PMAG 30 round magazines - factory sealed.
- Ergo Predator Game Call - factory sealed (paid $40). 
- Boxes and manuals for most everything in this package is also included if the buyer wants it.

I like all Mosin's, but especially the M44's because the increased muzzle blast and fireball.  This rifle is no exception.  It's well balanced, points easily and accurate.  I can hit 2"" steel plates at 100 yards at the range no problem.

I'm the original (American) owner of the rifle, and picked this up from J&G Sales.  I paid the extra $10 for a handpicked one.  I removed ALL traces of cosmoline (soaking metal parts in mineral spirits and heat treating the stock) and scrubbed it clean.

Upgrades include an ATI Monte Carlo Polymer Stock with Scorpion Recoil Pad, S&K All-steel Scout Scope Mounts and a Millet Compact Red Dot Sight.  Links for all these are at the bottom.  These are copied from the Mosin in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqG5GJRies  I intended to do the duracoat and a bedding job too but just ran out of time.

The original stock has been sold.  The bayonet has been removed, but works just fine with the ATI stock and will be included.  The Millet scope came with Weaver style rings which I'll also include.

The blueing is great, no rust or pitting and every serial # matches including one of the mags (the extra mag doesn't match the guns serial #) Everything works as it should, decent single action trigger and also surprisingly accurate. These are very, very similar to the 1911 - only real difference is the lack of a grip safety. Comes with 2 mags and original military holster.

It is very much like a conceal size version of the 1911. The overall length is 5.5"" and the overall height is 3.96"". The SAS weighs 15oz so it fits great as a pocket carry weapon. It has gorgeous wood grips and has the SigLite night sights on it.

I bought it for my wife, and she put 2 boxes of .380 shells through it, and decided it was too small for her liking. The SAS has the smoothest slide I have ever found on a new gun.

While the rifle utilizes a 10.3” barrel, it is not classified as an SBR (Short-Barreled Rifle) because the suppressor is permanently attached.  The DDM4ISR 300’s sound suppressor is threaded and welded to the proprietary ISR Integrated Gas Block, bringing the barrel length to 16.145”.  While the rifle is at the 16” legal limit, the ISR’s integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp.   This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip."

However when trying to put on a pistol grip I snapped the bolt off in the receiver stud and havent taken the time to get a new one.  So its just sitting.  My loss, your gain. 

This is a 870 clone and said to take most 870 parts. 

So, all you'd need to do is get a new stud and you'll have yourself a cheap reliable shotgun.

Second picture shows where the receiver stud goes and there is no issue there at all. 

Last picture shows the receiver stud which the bolt is broken off in.  I tried getting it out a while back...made it worse.  Which is why it'll most likely be easier to just buy another receiver stud unless you're handy and like to fix things...unfortunately that is not my specialty.

This is Ruger's ar15. Upper is all Ruger w/dual piston driven gas controlled operating system. Smoother and cleaner. Gas is adjustable for different loads or to even make the rifle fire like a bolt action. The Piston system drives the BCG and the gas exits the front so the BCG stays free from all the junk that gas blows all over them in an AR Upper.  Lower is a mil spec lower. Great trigger. Shoots as good as it looks. Forward grip handle is a MFT. The 45* Canted BUIS are fully adjustable for windage and elevation.  Shoots as good as it looks.  

I have other optics choices for the buyer: a Bushnell trs-25 Red Dot for $55 more or a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x50 BDC for $210 more. Both are hardly used as in have been mounted on another gun, fired a couple times at the range and put back in their boxes.
