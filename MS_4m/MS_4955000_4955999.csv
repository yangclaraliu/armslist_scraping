In truly fantastic condition. The stock is in good shape with no cracks and only very minor scratching/chipping. The barrel is smooth and clean and the rifling looks flawless. The real beauty is the action: it looks brand new. I seriously think I may actually be the first person to shoot this gun. It's obviously never seen use in the field. Perfect example of mil-surp.

The sights are adjustable, the rear sight featuring the white outline blade, the front a ramp with red insert. Condition is close to new and the gun shows no wear aside from the usual cylinder turn line. There are no scratches or dings, no rust or pitting. If I had to pick a number I'd call this Colt 98%+. The original Colt medallion grips are in excellent shape with a few minor marks. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent as well. Mechanically, the King Cobra was essentially a stainless Trooper Mark V and was a heavy duty revolver made to take a steady diet of full power magnum cartridges. It appears this example has been fired but very little. It comes in the original plastic case with the outer sleeve which is serial numbered to the gun. The owner's manual and miscellaneous factory paperwork is included, According to Colt, this King Cobra was manufactured in 1996. A very nice example!

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

-oil/filter changed with 10w40 Valvoline MC and HiFlo filter

Few dings on the tank, and a scuff here and there, but it is to be expected for this class of bike that is regularly chosen by new riders.

I'm currently holding a deposit from a purchaser.  But if that deal falls through for some reason, I'll take a list of interested buyers.It was built new for me by my friend, master boat builder, and duck hunting fanatic Terry Rose, and delivered in April 2014. It has been used fewer than a dozen times. It came with the optional motor mount/mojo attachment. I have personally water tested it to over 500 lbs. In fact, with all of my gear, gun, waders, bag, ammo, etc. I weigh 215 lbs. To make the Ambusher ride as low as I like it, I add 120 lbs of ballast (6 sandbags weighing 20 lbs. each), bringing the payload in the Ambusher to 335 lbs. I'll include the ballast in the sale. By the way, the Ambusher weighs approximately 100 lbs. It's very easy to handle, and can be launched and retrieved by one or two people. The Ambusher is in perfect condition, and has been stored in my garage when not in use. In my opinion, there is no better layout boat than Core Sound Layouts. If you want to kill ducks, it's probably time to get serious, and start layout shooting. This is a great deal on a great layout boat. You WILL NOT find a better deal out there, period. But for the trolls, I'll include my usual disclaimer at the bottom. ""Core Sound Layouts: When they see you, it's too late!"" Thanks for looking! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN FIND THIS ITEM CHEAPER ELSEWHERE. IF YOU PREFER TO BUY ELSEWHERE, THAT'S A-OK WITH ME.

Some history, the 32 caliber is what Ian Flemming had 007 carry in the Bond novels not the 380. The original design was the 32 with the 380 being an afterthought. And on April 30, 1945 Adolf Hitler killed him self with the 32ACP. All laws apply. Thanks for looking."

Winchester designed the Realtree Max-5® model SX3 shotgun specifically with the waterfowl hunter in mind: it comes with the Realtree Max-5 camo pattern, that’s filled with cattails, reeds, cane, and grasses, which blends in perfectly to marshes, corn stalks, and most any waterfowl habitat. The Active Valve System™ automatically self-adjusts, allocating the exact gas pressure necessary to fire a wide range of hunting loads — critical for any autoloader used by avid waterfowl hunters who hunt multiple species in varied habitats. When firing heavy magnum loads gases vent upward and out of the Quadra-Vent™ ports in the forearm, further regulating bolt speed. A Inflex Technology recoil pad effectively absorbs recoil, allowing you to stay on target with fluid follow-through shots all day. The stock easily adjusts for length of pull, cast, and drop at comb to give individual shooters the perfect fit. The SX3 uses the proven Invector-Plus™ interchangeable choke tube system (comes with F,M,IC) that works hand-in-hand with the back-bored barrel to reduce shot deformation and promote the uniform shot patterns you need to wallop birds at long range. The Winchester SX3 Waterfowl shotgun’s stock and forearm are slim and trim allowing for fast handling and ease of use while wearing gloves. Today’s waterfowl hunters demand shotguns that preform flawlessly in all extremes of weather and in excellent condition and i will ship if you are not local."

It’s in near perfect condition. All specs are listed below, but comes with hard plastic case and 5 Crio chokes and choke tool, aluminum plug, fit adjustment shims, all manuals and Benelli oil. Has very cool detailed etched pattern across the receiver as well as game scenes on both sides with ducks on one side and pheasants on the other.  Walnut stock and forend have fantastic grain and patterns.  There is one little nick on the forend.  This is still setup as stock and no changes have been made for custom fitting.  All fitting accessories are new and unused.
This gun is beautiful and very reliable.  They are light, shoulder like a dream and will cycle almost any round through their inertia system.  Makes them super versatile for light 7-1/2 grouse loads to 3” mag loads for Canadians and Snows.  It’s just not the feel I’m looking for in a 12 gauge and almost always go back to hunting with my old classic anyways.  Better to have someone use it then just a gun case viewer. Contact with questions or for more pictures.
I will meet locally to show the gun and can only sell locally as I don’t carry an FFL.  For any final sale I will write up sales receipts for both parties with buyer’s information and signatures of both for record of sale only…following verifying buyer’s ID.  No personal checks (or wait until they clear).    $1,350.00 Obo

This is the 2015 model I bought it new last month, in mint condition with only 100 rounds fired. 
Will come with all the original goodies, and two mags.  

For those who don't know this is the revamped version of the classic uzi pistol. Very compact weapon with the 4"" barrel but still has a lot of potential. I was getting good groups at 50 yards with a red dot sight and angled fore grip attached. Some upgrades it has over the classic uzi are a full rail system, side charging handle that can be switched, upgraded sights, and a polymer frame that fits the hands much better. Sweet shooting gun, awesome for cqb or home defense. I shot the 137 grain Critical Duty loads through it and they performed awesome. 

I was going to build an SBR with this one, but plans have changed. You could make this a SBR, enjoy it how it is, or add a pistol brace to it.  Please make me an offer, i''ll respond to all. I want cash, trades plus cash or just straight trades. Please don't low ball me I paid $1000 for this last month. Interested in a 600cc motorcycle, honda ruckus or other guns. Other items as well just offer."

One of the headlights (the hazed one, passenger side) has a broken bracket and aims super low. Also, the clear coat is coming off of the top of the car, and all the rims have clear coat issues. It's also going to need a clutch throw out bearing. 

Couple of dents and a couple of small spots of rust round out the bad, they're shown in the pictures.

Good tires, good leather, power windows, just put new brakes and rotors on the front, super fun to drive. 

Inspected until March 2016. Sun roof, power seats, windows and mirrors, heated seats and steering wheel. Leather interior in good condition. It would be a great first car.
