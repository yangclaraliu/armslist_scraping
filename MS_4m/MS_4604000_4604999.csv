UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS (HB 13-1229)

Background Check Requirement

Under the new law, before any person who is not a licensed gun dealer transfers possession of a firearm, he or she must arrange for a licensed dealer to obtain the required background check. In obtaining the background check, the dealer must follow all procedures that it would follow were it transferring the firearm in a retail transaction, including recording the transfer, retaining the records, and complying with all state and federal laws. The dealer must provide a copy of the background check results and the Bureau's approval or disapproval to the transferor and intended transferee, and may charge a fee of up to $10. 

A prospective transferee may not accept possession of the firearm until after the transferor has obtained the Bureau's approval, nor may he or she knowingly provide false information to the transferor or licensed gun dealer for the purpose of acquiring a firearm.

Great little 22 caliber rifle. Light and super smooth especially with the large loop lever. Could be a great varmint gun or training gun for youngsters. Bought it in 2014, kept in the gun safe mostly. Less than 50 rounds through it. Some light scratches on side of Receiver - could most likely be buffed out as they are very light. Sights may or may not need adjustment - I had a scope on it so I never used the iron sights.  

This is NOT a Henry Silver Boy. Receiver Cover and Handguard Retainer came from factory with a gloss paint. I removed this gloss paint and polished to a mirror like luster myself.

This carbine has original finish on the metal.  There is some pitting on the barrel,  but is light and could be easily cleaned.  The wood is in good original condition. The forend has a crack down its length, but is stable and does not affect the use of the carbine.This carbine is chambered in .351 cal.  It comes with one original removable magazine."

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $215 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Florida, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at REDACTED to inquire about my services."

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $225 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Arkansas, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Florida and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at REDACTED to inquire about my services."

Its only difference, apart from the lettering, is actually an improvement. This AR12 has a cosmetically correct gas tube linkage piece between its forend and the front sight. This is the Leader Arms AR12 shotgun. Type is Benelli style action built into an AR15 style platform. Not, mind you, that it will accept an AR Upper; it will not. Type is gas operated semi automatic shotgun. Manufacturer is Leader Arms Technology in Kizilay, Republic of Turkey. Importer is PW Arms of Redmond, WA. Distributor and Warrantor is AR57 llc of Monroe, WA. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, gas tube, magazines and internal parts, with alloy upper receiver and magazine release; and polymer lower receiver, trigger, forend or barrel sheath, and faux upper gas tube. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch standard bore, furnished with a total of 4 Benelli thread choke tubes and wrench, .712 improved cylinder steel ok slug ok; .704 modified steel ok; .695 improved modified no steel no slug; and .688 full no steel no slug. Sights are fixed .140 partridge blade front with removable AR type windage and elevation adjustable, black blade rear. Forend assembly has a 27 slot Picatinny rail, with a receiver integral 21 slot rail behind it. Bolt handle is knurled Beretta type. Safety is standard AR two position lever for a right handed shooter. Gas mechanism is housed inside the forend, and operates much the same way as a Beretta shotgun, with heavy and light load settings possible. Magazines are factory steel body, with steel springs, polymer shell follower and floorplate. Each mag holds 5 rounds of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shells. Magazines with up to 24 rounds are readily available throughout the US, since this is exactly the same shotgun as the MKA 1919 except for its cosmetic gas tube above its barrel. Trigger is .325 polymer two stage, pulls in the 10 pound vicinity with moderate felt creep and overtravel.

I bought a nice used MEC 600 Jr reloader and a case of Winchester target loads.
I fired two boxes and find I am no longer able to shoot a shotgun with out damaging my shoulder.
Box, papers  wrappings, everything that came with it new along with 9 boxes of factory Winchester AA loads (No.8) and the MEC 600 Jr. Set up to duplicate AA loads.
The gun has the slightest of wear on the magazine tube from shooting the two boxes of shells and the rest is like new.
It is a very nice Walnut stocked shotgun w factory choke tubes and 28"" vent rib barrel.
Please e-mail me for pictures or info.
Probably going to break this up and sell separately Monday due to lack of interest as a package.

This was my kids pistol for the last few years. They are moving up in age and caliber so I'm trying to get some cash to put towards another pistol or rifle for them. 

They sell new for about $425-450 new. The reason I'm marking it down this much is because it's used and I adjusted the spring on the 
trigger so the pull would be a harder pull for my kids. I've never measured the pull but it's not too bad, it's more than the standard pull but not so much that a 8 year old can pull it. 

Also included is a Volquartsen Forward Blow comp. They run about $75 to $125 depending on which on you get.

These are the nicest ones I have seen.  I bought them for myself so I looked around before buying to get some good ones.  If you know PSL magazines you know most of them look like they were stored in a submarine with a screen.  These do not look like that.  I paid $290 for them.  I have the receipt I will show you.  I would like to get as close to that as possible.  I will trade for other gun type stuff.  I am really interested in an AR-10 and threaded .22s.  I will add cash obviously on those.  Shoot me any kind of offer I like to trade.  I have more pictures of them if you want.
