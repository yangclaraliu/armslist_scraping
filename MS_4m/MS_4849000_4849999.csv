I have for sale/trade one used rifle:

Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle  
.308 WIN

Asking: $675

Includes:

2x Ruger Steel 10 Round Magazines
1x ""The Claw"" rifle sling
Factory Ruger 1"" Scope mounting rings (for traditional over-receiver scope mounting options)
1 Factory Buttstock spacer (to extend length of pull)
Bob Allen Rifle Case
Factory Manual


*DOES NOT INCLUDE FACTORY SCOUT RAIL MOUNT.*

I removed it when the gun was purchased, and it seems to have been lost in a move.  This part is available from Ruger's parts department if you prefer that type of optic.

Selling this gun to finance other builds.  I've loved the rifle, but it does not pass the ""Do I shoot this"" test.  It's got around 200 rounds through it, mostly fired in the first two months of ownership (bought the gun last Fall).  Has been meticulously maintained and safe-stored for the year I've owned it.  Fun rifle to shoot and hunt with, but it's not a go-to rifle for me for any one task, so it's time to part with it. 

Fast and insured $30 Shipping to anywhere in the US via UPS Ground (FFL Transfer rules apply)

Face-to-Face pickup available in Gwinnett County, GA. 

Please email to request pictures or ask questions.  I will usually respond fairly quickly."

- Excellent condition - Roughly 900 rounds fired
- Original Dan Wesson case
- 2 Dan Wesson magazines

- Original G10 black grips
- VZ alien grips
- Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 3.0 Holster. Brand new, never used. Gun was never put in it.
- Willing to meet halfway, within reason.

This gun was broken in EXACTLY according to Dan Wesson specifications. Clean with recommended cleaner and lube with Dan Wesson brand lube, fire 50 rounds and do again. I did this process for the first 600 rounds then fired about another 300 over the next couple months, cleaning thoroughly after every range trip. This weapon has performed flawlessly and it's pure joy to shoot. I can't stress enough how great this gun is.  

Breaking these in is a pricey venture itself. Skip that process, know that you're buying a gun that definitely works flawlessly.  I'm an honest, easy going person. Let me know if you have any questions.

The main difference between this guns and the previous Colt series 70 is that the former incorporate a new firing pin block safety system, consisting of a series of internal levers and a plunger positively blocking the firing pin from moving until the trigger is pressed, hence eliminating the possibility of the gun going of if dropped onto a hard surface or struck hard. Other than that, the Colt series 70 and the 80 series do not differ too much from one another. On the other hand, there is really no difference between the Colt 1911 series 80 and the M1991A1, which is mechanically the same as the colt 1911.

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sonic’s was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.
Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business.
 
Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short, they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock for better fit and  reliability.

Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Manufacturer: Beretta ( Made in Italy )Model: PX4 StormCaliber: .45 ACPBarrel: 4""Action: SA/DA"

Norinco 1911 that's been customized by a professional gunsmith. Gun is used. Slide has a major patina, and had some very minor pitting prior to being cleaned up. There is no rust to speak of now. It's a shooter, not a show piece. But you can certainly make it one. I had it customized by a friend and very competent gunsmith, who has been at his craft for many, many years. It started life as a basic GI configured 1911. It has several modifications, some of which are obvious in its appearance, such as the extended safety, Mainspring housing, etc. All added parts are either Wilson Combat or Colt. The gunsmith smoothed the action to near perfection; the slide feels like it's on ball bearings, and the trigger is arguably the best I've ever used. That's not an exaggeration to sell it, either. It's damn good. It's extremely accurate and ultimately reliable. It's just not pretty anymore. I'm selling it because it's been sitting in the safe not being used like it used to, and Xmas is creeping up, and I'm short on cash. So it goes. It'd be a good shooter or beater gun, or an excellent base for your custom 1911, if you want to go further with it. The allure of Norinco 1911s over others is that the steel used in the frame and slide is railroad steel, which is some of the toughest, if not the toughest on the market. I had to replace my gun smith's tool set because the steel ruined it. These 1911s also come reliable from the factory, so they make great base guns for a custom build. Hence why I chose it. The gun will come with a soft case, one Ed Brown magazine, a full box of Speer Gold Dots, and a Blackhawk Paddle Holster.
I will provide additional pictures upon request.
I need to sell it for extra cash for Xmas. $400 OBO. I will come to you if I get the full 400.

The most significant change is the weight. Our FULL SIZE 10in x 12in shooters cut weighs a mere 7lbs with coating (6.2lbs without coating). This is a 2lb drop from AR500 Steel Armor. With a 25% reduction in weight we feel this Steel Armor is a game changer for the armor business.The extra level of care has also been taken to prevent metal spalling by adding a Line-X base coat and build up. This makes for an extremely well designed, and balanced plate which is already shattering records and expectations. The 1 ¼lb. build up is what is required for maximum protection from spalling and brings total plate weight to 7lbs Threats: Green Tip M855 5.56mm rounds (at 3200 FPS) 7.62×51 (308)"

No idea on the manufacturer; I originally bought this on a rifle from M&A Parts Inc. at a gun show in 2009, and it has had roughly 200-300 rounds shot through it.  Ran flawlessly for me with brass and steel case ammo.  FSB was shaved down and re-blued to fit under a free float rail.  It came with a flash hider pinned on, but I took that off to switch the barrel out.  The channel in the threads does not affect another flash hider from threading on.  The gray ""scuff"" marks on the barrel are from the aluminum jaws in the vice; they will wipe off if you're so inclined.  It'd be a good solid barrel for a beater/truck build.

Keep in mind, it's not pinned anymore, so under 16"" and possibly subject to NFA if not put on a pistol build.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.MOSSBERG 500 12M/28MC&18CB 3IN1 SPLDescription: MOSSBERG 500 12M/28MC&18CB 3IN1 SPLManufacturer: MossbergModel #: Model 500 ""3 In 1"" Home Def, Hunting & CruiserType: ShotgunFinish: BlueStock: Black Synthetic, Checkered & Pistol Grip KitSights: BeadBarrel Length: 28"" Vent Rib and 18.5""Overall Length: 47.5"" or 39""Weight: 7.5 lbs or 6.75 lbsCaliber: 12 GaugeCapacity: 2.75"" 5+1Action: Pump Action# of Mags:Chokes: 28"" Multi-Choke (F,Mod,IC) 18.5"" Cylinder BorePackaging:Receiver: BlueChamber: 3"""
