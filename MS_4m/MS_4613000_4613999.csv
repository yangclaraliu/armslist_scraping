My intent is to fund my very expensive suppressed 300BLK build which i would only be able to do if i have the money from selling this. Thus, im not accepting trades at this time unless it's cash along with an item(s) that would be easy to sell (glock pistols, etc). I realize this is a very expensive purchase, and most people wouldnt even consider spending this much on a firearm, so im not expecting too much interest. But for someone interested in the SCAR platform or a high end weapon, this is as good as it gets. As for the condition, ill put it this way, if i told you it was new you'd believe me. Now for the list:

* (10) 20-round magazines
* 200 rounds of 165gr Outback brass-cased ammuntion
(all replaced items will be included (the orginal stock, charging handle, etc))


Im asking $4100 for everything with reasonable offers considered.

However, the items marked with a * I would be willing to remove and adjust the price accordingly. I understand that some people may not find some of the little things such the charging handle, the extra magazines, the stock, etc worth what they are.

Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable back straps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Commander-Style HammerBesides being a custom-looking touch, the Commander-style hammer is lighter; hammer-fall during firing is therefore crisper and will not disrupt your aim. Ambidextrous SafetyEasily train or shoot with either hand. Automatic Firing Pin BlockThe PX4 gives you an extra level of safety while in the holster or not in use--the firing pin is blocked automatically to prevent any type of accidental firing. 3-Dot Sight SystemThe 3-dot sight system is adjustable for windage, and makes target acquisition easy under most light conditions. Picatinny RailThe built-in Picatinny rail makes it easy to complement the PX4 with a variety of tactical accessories such as lighting devices, with no gunsmithing required. Reversible Magazine ReleaseMost controls on the PX4 are reversible or ambidextrous, making it possible to train or shoot right- or left-handed. Interchangeable BackstrapsThe interchangeable backstraps will make the PX4 grip fit ergonomically most hand-sizes and shooting styles. Drop-Free MagazineTactical magazine-exchange on the PX4 is easy and lightning-fast. When you operate the magazine-release, the magazine falls free and does not require the use of the off-hand.

The XD 4"" Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD 4"" Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD 4” Full Size is the original XD offering from Springfield Armory, and the most basic XD. This is the XD that started it all.

The XD 4"" Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory XD’s have several features that make the XD easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.

Bought it last year and practiced three times with it. Had a baby and have no time for it. Going to use the money to buy baseball cards so no trades. It is 50lbs and has a nice bow stringer, foam arrow block target, medium adult finger glove and wrist guard. There is a custom made back quiver made from Kevlar material which makes it almost indestructible and some very good arrows all with practice field tips. Selling everything for $140. The bow has maybe 10 arrows through it. It is setup for instinctive archery so has no sights. Powerful enough for large game and not to hard to pullback but not for youth lol. Its a takedown bow and can be broken down into a backpack with an simple Allen wrench to travel or for hunting in the field.

It is originally a 1943 rifle modified with a new modern Archangel stock with a 5 & two 10 round magazines. It has a 12x mounted Bushnell Scope. Also included is a second modified bolt used for this stock as well as the original bolt. In addition it has an altered Finland style trigger and a bipod. As a bonus I'm including 1320 rounds of ammo. This is a specialized rifle and although you could return it to original, this kit is being sold to someone who is interested in a Mosin which has been brought up to modern spec. I built it for fun and it shoots incredibly well and accurate but I don't get to shoot much these days so I'm letting it go. 

Please note that while I'm happy to meet you to show the rifle, due to my job and hours it will be limited to the Ooltewah area or the TN Riverpark location.

The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.Easy Accessorization and MaintenanceThe most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable MagazinesAnother feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target.Absolutely Reliable, Designed to LastThe base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.External HammerLike its forerunner the 92FS (M9), the A1 version has an external hammer. Ambidextrous SafetyThe safety may be easily operated by right- or left-handed shooters; also, the ambidextrous safety makes it possible to operate it with a variety of shooting/gripping methods. Disassembly LatchThis pistol was designed to be easily field-stripped and disassembled without any tools. Recoil Spring AssemblyThe recoil spring assembly is captive, meaning that it comes apart as a unit rather than as individual parts. This makes cleaning and maintenance considerably faster and easier. Frame Integrated Recoil BufferThis pistol was designed to be super-durable; it incorporates a recoil buffer that protects the frame from even the hottest +P loads. Picatinny RailThe most noticeable outward difference between the classic 92/M9 and the A1 configuration is the Picatinny rail extending forward of the trigger guard. This can be easily equipped with a variety of accessories such as lights, lasers and other tactical devices. Dovetail Front SightThe front sight may be removed by the user and replaced, if desired, with a variety of accessory sights. Rounded Trigger GuardThe trigger guard of the A1 series is rounded; apart from giving the pistol a classic look, it helps fully utilize the length of the accessory rail without the trigger guard getting in the way. Reversible Magazine ReleaseThe magazine release button is reversible by the user, making this tactical pistol easy to use both right- and left-handed.

Gun was manufactured circa 2000, I have owned it since Summer 2002 when I bought it at a gun show. I cycled a lot of rounds through the gun, but it has never been fired. Never had any feeding problems. I realize now that my cowboy action shooting dreams will have to wait until later.

Rifle is offered with the original box, but I cannot find the manual or the hammer extension that was included.

The 'JM' mark on the side of the barrel was applied sloppily, but that's about the worst thing I can say about this gun. No nicks or dents in the walnut, finish is 100%, with the slightest bit of wear to the loading gate. 9 round capacity tubular magazine.

I am the original owner and it was custom designed by Mr. Josh Perkins with the following work: Action was blue printed, squared off, and glass-bedded into an H-S Precision PST Stock in Dark Olive Drab/Black Stipling with triangular VTR SS barrel in a 1:9 twist fully free-floated at Joe Collier Precision Rifles-by Mr. Joe himself. Bolt was sent to Mr. Carl Kampfield of Kampfield Customs and bolt handle was skeletonized and bolt spiral fluted perfectly with the Trademark engraved on top rear of bolt. Trigger was reduced to a perfect crisp 2.5 lbs by Mr. Mike DeLoach of Nine Run Gun. Rifle has a 6-9” Harris Bipod with sling swivel ring and solid scope rail. Rifle is for sale with or without the pictured Zeiss Conquest 6.5-20X50 with exposed parallax and windage/elevation turrets and sunshade held securely by Burris XTR Low Mounts “Zeiss box, docs, and lifetime warranty would come with it”. This is the most accurate 223 I have ever shot, and I have shot many. It has been fired 30-40 times for load development only and is in perfect condition, being cleaned after each range session, and the scope is in equal condition.
With standard/universal length fully resized handloaded 55 VMax’s this rifle shot the pictured group of 10 consecutive shots at 100 yards out of a cold barrel. The high and right shots were first 2 “warm-ups”, and next 8 made a hole. The rifle will come with 100 rounds of these precision handloads and the recipe for the loads. With match-grade handloads bump or neck-sized and bullets set 10 thousandth’s off the lands of rifling this thing shoots ridiculous groups “or a hole I should say”. I’ll let the rifle with everything but the scope and rings go for $1,600, and $2,100 with scope and rings. The stock and bolt work run almost $1,600 alone, so I am not going any further down on this price…at all..so please don’t ask...not happening. I will mail to FFL for same price as well. Only selling so cheap to help start a new project quickly. Located in Nahunta, GA. Can text REDACTED. Thanks for lookin’!"

With the advancement of combat medicine, most injuries when treated quickly and effectively may take someone out of the fight, but not forever. The Trauma Kit NOW!™ with Helium Whisper™ attachment system can supplement or replace a typical Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK). Serving as an essential traumatic wound kit for the modern warrior that carries only the essentials you need, none of the fluff you don’t. The Large Trauma Kit NOW!™ is built to work with the latest issue USMC IFAK. The TKN consists of two main components – the outer MOLLE attachable shell featuring our lightweight, durable Helium Whisper™ backing and the removable inner supply carriage. The pouch is slightly tapered to make for easy removal, despite how full or empty the inner carriage may be. A single column of MOLLE on top of the flap can hold a Helium Whisper™ Single Pistol pouch for a flashlight, or multi-tool, or our Tourniquet NOW!™ Strap, keeping all of your medical essentials in one place. The TKN can also be purchased with a basic trauma refill kit. The inner carrier is deployed by pulling the reinforced tab up and out of the outer pouch, unfolding itself making the secured contents easily visible and accessible. The flap on the outer pouch has been streamlined to reduce the possibility of snags when seconds can mean life and death. Six rows of various sized heavy duty elastic neatly hold the Trauma Kit Refill pack or user determined medical equipment secure to a stiffened backing. Once out of the outer pocket, the top flap of the chassis can be closed and secured with hook and loop points to keep the carriage closed to transport or passed off to a teammate in need. As with all Blue Force Gear, it is made with excellence in the USA and carries a limited lifetime warranty.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: HELIUM WHISPER TRAUMA KIT NOW!, EMPTY, LARGE, COYOTE BROWN"

Since it is from their military sales line it does not have US OPTICS written on the side of the scope body as you'll see in most standard USO scopes.  It has a 30mm tube, Gen II Mil-dot reticle upgrade, First Focal Plane reticle, EREK elevation knob and US Optics #3 windage knob with windage stop option upgrade.  Elevation/windage are in 0.1 mil incriments.  This scope DOES NOT have an illuminated reticle.  

This scope has seen less than 100 rounds fired with it, all from a .308.  It has just returned from the US Optics factory after being cleaned/inspected, and is ready to go.  The only blemish on the scope is a small scratch on the windage knob from being in the gun safe.  The scope never saw field conditions and was just used at a static range.  It has never been dropped or abused.  The lenses have only been blown off with air and never touched.  

This scope retails for about $3,000.  Included is the owners manual and ""field cap"" for the EREK Knob (put on after zeroing) and allen keys.  This is the link for more technical specs and to see what the upgraded GEN II mil-dot reticle and #3 windage knob with windage stop upgrades cost, along with the standard specs.

I accidentally ordered 3, only needed 1 but never got around to sending the other 2 back. I have used mine to pump out over 500 beautiful hollow point bullets out of straight wheel weight alloy. The included pic shows what Im talking about. So I am selling the other 2 molds. 

I will admit there is a little bit of learning curve using these... you have to get the mold hot (5-8 bullets around 800F) before it starts dropping consistent bullets. But once you figure it out and keep a steady pace, the results speak for themselves. The holllow point is a gaping for the caliber... expands reliably and beautifully. 

For the prepper or enthusiast - this mold is a MUST if you are running 9MM, 38 Special or .357 Mag. The ability to crank out QUALITY hollow point ammo yourself will save you a lot of money for practice, defense, hunting... it is the most useful design.
Bullets drop out around .359... and you can size down to .357 or .355. 

These Molds are Priced to sell at $65 dollars EACH. Buy one buy both... your choice. They are hard to find... and run between $73-$95 each online PLUS shipping. I paid $73 each plus $10 shipping on backorder, didn't realize I ordered 3.

More Pics of the bullets or molds can be sent on request."

Most SA Loaded Champions are in the ""high gloss"" stainless finish but this one came from the factory with a unique Polished finish which I'm finding is pretty rare in my research. This pistol has been nothing but impressive the entire time that I have owned it. I purchased this used from a local gun shop in 2010 and have owned it since. The pistol has been a ""safe queen"" for me as I've only gotten around to firing it at the range and then cleaned/locked it back up. I had grand plans of carrying this pistol but fell in love with my XD/Glock instead as my primary CCW's (they are worth less and if anything cosmetic happens to them I'm less worried).

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, in fact I had it totally cleaned/lubed/inspected by Springfield several years ago and still have the paperwork to show for it. I originally sent it in to have new Novak night sights installed and signed up for the additional services while it was already in shop.

I'm not in a hurry at all to sale/trade so please do not lowball. Price/trade value is $750 with all valid VA ID's and willing to do Bill of Sale. I am Active Duty Mil and will provide all background docs upon sale.

Trades I'm looking for:
- HK USP Compact 9/40/45
- Sig P220/P245 Compact SAO
- Colt Commander's Model (Long story short but it is very symbolic of my grandfather and would like to have one)
- Springfield Armory EMP
- Officer Model 1911 (Springfield/Colt/Kimber/Sig)
