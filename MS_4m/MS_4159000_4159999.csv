This gun is in great shape, in fact on parts of gun there is still cosmoline, sat in safe most of life, the bore is mirror shiny, no rust, this gun was barely fired out of factory. Year of manufacture is 1973. The bolt face were the head of the cases sit against is not even marked and still has cosmoline on it in parts. 

You can email me for photos and more info. 
My phone takes high-res photos so i will upload as many as i can eith the 4mb limit. They will be cropped to make smaller file size. If you want full size photos just email me and i will be happy to send them to you. 

On a side note for the ati stock included i do not have one screw for the pistol grip, and the bottom of the pistol grip itsself has some minor damage but nothing that is going to stop the performance of the stock or xut you the rubber overmolding was damaged. 
The stock is the ati strikeforce folding adjustable stock in black, it has 3 rails on front and does not have the bayonet groove. There are other models available from ati with a bayonet groove but no rails. The stock has a ridiculous amount of sling swivel studs (6 total) but they are in all the right places for right and left handed shooters. They are removeable like any other stud on any other firearm. Stock does have the 1/2 inch recoil pad installed."

This is a Centennial J-Frame with a Scandium Frame/Stainless Cylinder and factory Trijicon Night that is out of production. It is chambered in .38 Only unlike its brother the M&P 340. The M&P342 is a rare J-Frame that doesn't pop up for sale too often. In fact, there has only been one (1) for sale in the last year on GunBroker. 

I bought this gun new, and have shot about 50 rounds through it. It does have some handling marks from sitting in a drawer, but it has never been carried. Pictures are available upon request.

A .38 S&W K200 Victory model revolver. This is the forerunner to the .38 special we know today. This particular revolver is a .38/200 British Service Revolver made by Smith and Wesson in the USA. It has a 5 inch pinned barrel and was made somewhere around 1943. Most of these revolvers went to England around this time but there are no proof marks on this to suggest a military or export model but it does have the original lanyard ring. It has the original grips with silver medallions. It does not have the ""V"" serial number prefix or the ""US Property"" mark meaning it was most likely a civilian model. I never lettered it from Smith and Wesson to find out any details since it was bound to be a restoration piece for me. This gun was never converted to .38 special after the war like a lot were and is chambered for the .38 S&W (short .38). According to experts the serial number puts it in the range of the later hardened steel cylinders so if you decided to shoot this beauty it can take modern .38 S&W ammo, NOT .38 Special though! It was expertly refinished, and the hammer and trigger (re)case hardened by Ford's in Florida, the best of the best. 

Here's what I need:

I am searching for a Remington Model 700 8mm Rem Mag for a project. That would be my first choice. Any long action Remington 700 would work for me but I would prefer a stainless Sendero if there is such out there. I believe there are in 7mm Rem Mag. Anyway, I'm open to cash offers and trades like I suggested. I put the price at what I consider its trade value. Let me know what ya got! Thanks!"

item # 66SS00WC

New - Never Used.  It still has the manufacturer's product tags and registration card attached.  I've had this in storage for several years.

Pouches  are attached to the inside with velcro, so you can position them however you want.  If I remember correctly, these are called ""SOCOM"" cases because they were originally developed for the HK Mk23 SOCOM pistol.  

http://www.blackhawk.com/Products/Bags-Packs-Tactical-Nylon/Cases-Mats/Cases/Handgun.aspx   It appears that the only SOCOM pistol case that Blackhawk makes now is the ""discreet"" black one.  MSRP $91.95, although Amazon sells them for $67  http://www.amazon.com/BLACK-HAWK-INC-66SS00BK-BLACKHAWK/dp/B000S5INRE

So if you want a Woodland Camo case for the retro look, or you're just nostalgic for the camo pattern from an era when Ronald Reagan was president and Clint Eastwood had his own police force, this is the SOCOM pistol case to get."

Model: 1873 
Caliber: 38-40 
Barrel: 24"" Octagon 
Sights: Lyman Hunter Ivory Bead Blade Front, Semi Buckhorn Rear Sight w/ Elevator 
Serial: 272,05X 
Date of Manufacture: 1888 
Rarity: This is a factory original 1873 deluxe rifle. The 1873 deluxe rifles are getting very hard to come by. The rifle letters correct from the factory with all 7 special order options seen! This would include: Shotgun Butt stock, Pistol Grip, Checkered, 3X Stocks, 1/2 Round 1/2 Octagon Barrel, 1/2 Magazine configuration, and Case Hardened. 

Hello, up for your consideration is a beautiful Winchester Model 1873 factory deluxe rifle in 38-40 WCF. The rifle letters from the factory in its current configuration. The special order options are listed below: 

1 in 600 1873 Rifles has Shot-gun rear stock and buttplate 
If you combine all of these features, this is a one of a handful of 1873's ever made like this. With total 1873 production in the 720,000 range, this is one super scarce rifle! The rifle was made in 1888 and is an antique. Being an antique this rifle can be mailed to the winning bidder without the use of an FFL dealer. To start on the condition, the wood is in good condition on the both the buttstock and forearm. Has some of the normal bumps and nicks of light field use. There are some rack marks/dings in the comb, wrist, and bottom forearm. The stocks are the correct reddish tone from the Winchester factory. The wood to metal fit is very good. The checkering is nice. The correct ebony insert is seen on the pistol grip. Overall, very good deluxe 3X grade stocks. 

The metal finish on the gun is an overall a pleasing plumb-blue patina on the barrel and a nickel color on the receiver due to the case coloring. Only faint case coloring is seen in protected areas. The barrel and magazine tube retain 50% or more of its patina finish. The buttplate is an 70% patina finish and shows nice. The brass door operates correctly and holds tight. Both the front and rear sights are period correct and appear original to the rifle. The Lyman Hunter Blade with the ivory blade sight was a special order on the model 1873. All markings such as serial number, barrel markings are correct and show very well. The function and mechanics of this gun are excellent. The action cycles smoothly and the lock up is tight. The screws have been turned, but show well. The bore is your average black powder with heavy wear and light pitting. Overall, in my opinion this is a beautiful special ordered Winchester Deluxe rifle with 7 special ordered options that would be a show piece in any Winchester collection. The condition is very good for the age of the rifle. Thank you for looking, and ask any questions that you have.

A few words from the manufacturer...STI was the ﬁrst to develop the 2011 platform, and the Eagle leads the way in STI’s development of the 2011. This gun was the first ever high capacity handgun featuring the tried and true John Browning 1911 design. This level of gun gives you the ability to be a more proﬁcient shooter whether slamming targets, or defending your livelihood…
The glass filled polymer and modular grip absorbs recoil and is extremely lightweight. Since the grips are injection molded with steel inserts they are much stronger and thinner than all-steel grips. Both a 2011 and a standard width 1911 are 1.30” wide and both have a 17 degree grip angle. In total, the grip diameter of the 2011 is only about 0.25” larger than a traditional 1911.

--MAGAZINES --------
• 3 Standard (126mm) 14-round capacity 
• 4 Extended (140mm) 17-round capacity   

--HOLSTER --------
• Blade-tech, 'Black Ice' 
• Tek-lok attachment
• 3-Position adjustable

A few words from the manufacturer....'Black Ice' OWB holster is a 'Full Combat Grip' designed to give the shooter a fast, smooth, unencumbered draw stroke from either standing or seated positions such as when in a vehicle or behind a desk. Drawing from the BLACK ICE™ takes less range of motion to clear the holster enabling the shooter to gain fast target acquisition. Re-holstering is also quick and easy. This holster is a great choice for competition or everyday carry. It is especially suited for those who drive long hours or who may have a limited physical range of motion."

The only trade I would be interested in is a burnt bronze PMR-30 (MSRP $419) with two magazines.

I saw two black PMRs at Sportsman's last week for $369 each, so these guns are finally hitting the shelves at market price. This trade would give someone with a burnt bronze one the chance to recoup some of their money if they overpaid, or were overcharged.

The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (.380ACP, 9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from SIG SAUER.

Sorry my photo skills and phone aren't the best.
This is a Glock 17c (compensated).  You can see in one of the pics that the barrel and slide over the barrel are ported for reduced  recoil.  I had the factory glock night sight replace with the snake eyes sights.  It functions a lot like rifle sights.  I find that they aren't the best for longer range accuracy but they make quick shots at self defense ranges super easy.
The snake eyes front sight was throwing off my aim so I had an armorer replace it with a raised blade front sight.
Here is some information on it:

Factory hard case and 3 17 round mags go with it.

I bought this for my wife hoping that I could make something simple with a lighter trigger and easier sights for a relative beginner to shoot.  We did a 4 day handgun course last week and the take away lesson was that she liked my handgun better - a walther ppq 40 cal.  This is a fun, reliable, fast shooter that I passed the class with just last week with >600 rounds and no unintentional malfunctions but I'm just not a glock guy.

With this gun and these upgrades and accessories this is a $600+ gun all day long so I'm firm on my price.
Only trades I'd be interested in would be a Walther PPQ M1 in 40cal."

The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.Comes with two 18 round magazines, poly holster, paddle attachment, belt attachment, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty.Specifications:Manufacturers Part Number    HG3277DNProduct Model    TP9SAType    PistolAction    SingleCaliber    9mmBarrel Length    4.5""Capacity    18+1Safety    Loaded Chamber IndicatorGrips    Interchangeable PalmswellSights    Blade Front, Dovetail RearWeight    20.8 ozFrame Finish    DesertFrame Material    PolymerBarrel Type    Cold Hammer-ForgedSlide Description    Desert CerakoteCase Type         Hard PlasticIs this handgun legal in your state?  It is your responsibility to know your State and Local handgun laws.No Refunds Will Be Given On Any Firearm That Is Not Transferable.Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.  There is a 3% fee for credit card purchases to cover processing feesThere are no returns on firearms.  Warranty Issues Are Handled By The Manufacturer.Shipping  $25.00 If Required.   I must recieve your local dealers FFL before the item can ship.    Your dealer may email or fax his FFL.  Fax  REDACTEDLocal pickup is available by appointment.   Call REDACTED to make an appointment.You must have a pistol permit or current Concealed Carry Permit for handguns.  A NCDL or State ID is required for all firearms."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Review: SIG P228 Review articled in ""THE ARMS SITE""
Reliability:
The SIG P228 is supremely reliable out of the box. Its reliability can only be matched by the P226 and arguably bested by the Beretta 92.

Accuracy:
Every SIG P228 I've shot is accurate enough to reach out and touch a target to 100 yards with confidence. This can't be said for many other popular pistols. The only popular service pistol that beats the P228 for accuracy out of the box is the SIG P226.

How it shoots:
If you are a federal agent(Secret Service standard issue), intelligence operative, law enforcement officer or civilian possessing a SIG P228, don't feel shortchanged or undergunned. You're carrying one of the best pistols made. World-class reliable, accurate, ergonomic and easily controllable, you can't get much better. Stick with it, practice often and with realism, and know that this gun will hold up its end of the bargain when you need it to."
