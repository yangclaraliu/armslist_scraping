My g19 is a stock 2014 production gun with around 1000rds through it. It has some holster wear, and it functions 100%. It will come with backstraps and its original box. Your gun needs to come with the same.

No mags need to be exchanged here in the case of a g19 trade, we both keep the mags that came with our guns. In a g30s trade, I'll expect 2 10rd mags and you'll get 2 15rd mags. Back to the 19 possible trade, I would like something extra thrown in from you to make up the difference in value between a gen 3 vs. gen 4. Get creative-ammo/holster/cash/whatever.

I have my ccw, you'll need one too or an original pistol permit (I'll keep). Ftf Indian Trail area only."

three dot sights, completely stock from the factory.
It came with two 10 round magazines and I purchased a third 10 round Beretta magazine. It also came with a loader, loading cup, instruction manual and I purchased a black hawk paddle holster but only carried it a couple times because its a full size pistol and weights as much as a boat anchor. This gun cycles and shoots like a machine and I never had a single malfunction. All internal parts and barrel are fine. I have shot in the area of 3000 rounds through it. It has some scratches but this is a lifetime gun and  if your familiar with these 92's you know their quality.
I have my eyes on something more compact to carry so my 92FS is up for sale with the following list if stuff below.
I’m asking $400 and am in the lower Hudson Valley area. You would need to have a NY State handgun license and the transfer transaction must go through an FFL (gun store). If you desire to shoot it first I have a range in my area we can do both.

It is chambered in famous well sought after 35 Whelen.  It came with a rail for scope mounting. I purchased a pair of Burris Zee Rings and a Bushnell Banner 2x-7x variable scope. I also stuck a quick attachment unit for an action cam on the side please see photos. It can be removed.
I took it out last year and harvested a buck with it. The deer dropped in its track’s and never needed more than the one shot. 
As a note:
These rifles have synthetic stocks, the trigger has no creep, over all is light in weight. They do not have the best (bluing) finishes on them but they shoot descent.  This rifle shoots great with the Hornady 200 grain superformance cartridges. It shot great with some left over 250 Grain SP ammo I had also but stuck with the former.
I don't think I have put more than 30 to 40 rounds through it and the bore is excellent.
I'm looking for $250.00 for it.
Thank you for looking if interested you can respond to this add.

Good condition rifle, barely used. Based on what I researched, these were made in the U.S. to be sent to the U.S.S.R. during World War II but were never sent. I purchased it still coated in cosmoline, cleaned it up, put 20 rounds through it, cleaned it again, and put it into the safe. It was fun to shoot but I need to thin the herd in the safe.

gun functions perfectly and is very accurate.

here's info i found out about it it's one of 1336 guns so it's a rare odd duck.

*Double S Huntsman: The serial number series that began with 001001S passed 100000S in 1976, and reached 101336S before it was noticed that numbers used in 1952 were being duplicated. In order to salvage the 1336 guns already numbered past 100000S, they were hand stamped with an S prefix, in addition to the suffix, thereby creating the ""Double S"" variation. All KNOWN examples are Huntsmans. (Thanks to Ed Brink, in his Colt Rimfire Automatic Pistols, for the ""Double S"" information.)

This is the best value, and easiest shooting pistol in the market.

This PX4 Storm comes with everything from the factory plus factory “Night Sights.”

PX4 Storm Double/Single-Action Semi-auto
The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semi-auto is the culmination of Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.

Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use.

Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense
Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts, with more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable. The PX4 just keeps delivering.

Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with Features
The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and re-holstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable back-straps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.

Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to Maintain
This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.

Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down."

The action is solid and the trigger is crisp. This is a beautiful looking rifle with a hex reciver and is a real head Turner at the range. But with that being said, this gun is not without its faults. The stock has been refinished (looks good IMO, but not original), and there is a crack in the stock that a previous owner decided should be fixed with screws rather than an epoxy. But this gun is easily accurate enough to hunt with and still has years of use left in it. You can see in the picture how much beefier it is than a standard mosin nagant. I'm not looking for anything specific for trades, but I'm always open to the idea and the worst that I could say is no. If you are reading this then the gun Is still available. Price is $325 obo.Thanks for looking!"

When you want a compact pistol that will deliver this level of performance, you should look no further than this limited run Glock 19 RTF2 Gray Vickers Tactical 9mm. Chambered in 9mm and featuring all the familiar features of the Glock 19, this weapon has been refined to offer the absolute best in practical performance. The frame is treated with a rough texturized gray finish to offer a more unique look and better grip under pressure. Its factory sights are replaced with Wilson Combat sights, which use a black rear and fiber optic front. In addition to these changes, the weapon features 2 Vickers gray baseplates to attach to your magazines as well as a custom slide stop and magazine catch. This all works together to deliver a smoother, more reliable performance. If you are looking to deliver 15 rounds of 9mm from a gun you can trust, this custom Vickers Tactical G19 is the way to go.

NOT a rebarrelled gun.  Pics a poor and show worse than the actual gun.  Sorry about that.

Great bore, shoot very well.  Honest 65 years of hunting use.  Barrel has mild rust flecking in spots but should clean-up very well with a copper rod rub (i.e. copper is softer than steel and blueing and a copper/oil rub will improve most old guns greatly).

Lever and trigger were polished bright before I got her (reblue or replace would be my suggestion).  Pistol grip cap is missing and recoil pad is old and worn (replace IMHO).  Wood is very solid and honest.

FYI, recoil is mild (.308 mild), ammo is readily available and very reasonable ($23 a box).

Almost .300WM ballistics.  Almost.

• A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
• The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
• Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
• Button-Rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
• Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
• Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
• Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
• 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
• Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
• Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.
