The rifle is new and has never been fired.  Includes original box, manual, etc. Please contact me regarding any questions.  

The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x39 is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount, hand made walnut thumbhole stock. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years.

• 7.62x39.
• RPK-type receiver with extra reinforcements and a thicker receiver and barrel for superior accuracy.
• Bore is chrome-lined.
• Threaded Barrel with welded thread protector for importation (easily removed during conversion)
• Thumb hole wooden stock.
• Side rail.
• Comes with (1) 10rd and (1) 5rd mag Vepr Specific mag, will not take ak mags unless converted with bullet
guide and mag latch trimmed.
• Comes with manual and cleaning kit.
• This is an original Vepr hunting rifle.
• 16-1/2"" barrel length.
Veprs are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcement each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!
Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.
A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.
1.	Why the Vepr is better than the average AK
2.	Hammer-Forged, Russian Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel.  Most durable AK Barrels Made.
Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.
Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionality was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.
3.	Most Accurate.  Consistently better groups than other AKs.
4.	True RPK Receiver.  Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver.  Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.
5.	The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market"

Flat shooting, one of the most accurate platforms that will also stop what you're shooting at.  Very moderate recoil so it's a great rifle for the recoil sensitive shooter.  Great for deer or simply looking good at the range poking holes in paper at long distances.  You'll be amazed at what this will do out to 200+ yards-and we ARE talking 1 MOA accuracy levels.

Synthetic stock.  Rifle is ALL matching; receiver, bolt, safety, ejector, bolt shroud, etc. which is what you want in a Mauser of any sort; means you don't have to worry about head spacing.

Leupold mount AND rings.  A nice, clear Tasco 3-9 power scope makes it perfect for Wisconsin usage.  Also has a sling.  All you ""need to add"" is the ammunition.

I live in the northwest suburbs of Milwaukee and I'm willing to drive up to 30 miles to meet you in an agreed upon public place.

Price is less than I have in this build so it's more than fair, and it IS firm.  

You'll be 18 years old or more, able to legally own a firearm in Wisconsin and have cash. We'll do a bill of sale for mutual benefit.

I have a number of the FILBE USMC Main Packs for sale. These come complete with shoulder straps, frame and waist strap. Bags are in Fair condition. They are all Coyote Brown, some are dirty from being issued, some have tape on the webbing, and some have wear from being dragged.

These are excellent bags, designed in part by Mystery Ranch out of Bozeman Montana for the US military. They have an external frame system and can hold anything you could feasibly carry on your back. The top lid has several zippers that allow the user to gain access to the pouch on the underside, or direct access to the interior of the bag. There is also a large zipper that runs along the lower portion of the bag to allow easy removal of sleeping gear or access the contents of the bottom of the bag without having to go through the top. There is a zippered divider which keeps the lower section separate when zipped for organization. There are slot pockets running down the sides of the bags exterior that hold 3 liter bladder type water reservoirs, and several lashing straps to keep loads secure. The entire face of the bag is covered in MOLLE or PALS type webbing to facilitate additional pouch or compartment additions at the users discretion.

This gun cost $1648 after tax. I put in well over $1,000 to customize it and that's not even counting tax and shipping.
All in all this gun cost very close to $2,900... And that's a conservative guess.

The add ons to this gun are all quality and not everything is listed here. I have spent well over $1,000 adding to this great Colt AR-15. The gun itself cost roughly $1,500 ($1,648 after tax)
$2,250 is a very fair price for this gun with all of the quality add ons. It may not have tags on it but it has never been fired once and has been oiled, cleaned and babied with regularity.

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

The only trades i am interested in is pistols. No Sig Sauer's or Hecker & Koch's.

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:1. Manual thumb safety2. Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing3. Firing pin blockEach UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities.

Elcan SpecterDR Optical Sight model 1-4x 5.56 NATO DFOV14-T1

The ELCAN SpecterDR 1x-4x Dual Role Optical Sight is a revolution in battlefield optics. This is the world’s first dual field of view combat optical sight. The ELCAN Specter DR 1x-4x switches from 4x magnification to 1x CQB with the throw of a lever, while still providing identical eye-relief in both positions. The Specter DR Dual Role gives the user both fast target acquisition and long-range identification that no other combat optic provides.

The ELCAN SpecterDR 1x-4x offers variable sight illumination, meaning the operator can switch between fully illuminated crosshairs or just illuminated red dot. In the event of power loss, the reticles remain fully visible.
The Elcan Dual Role Optical Sight has changed the standard in battlefield optics, all other sights only perform half the job.

The rifle’s action is of the very reliable controlled round feed design, with a three position wing safety. Stainless steel barrel and action, with laminate wood stock (impervious to inclement weather). Included is an excellent first focal plane, Cabela’s Alaskan Guide Series 4.5-14x42mm scope, with  rangefinding and bullet drop compensating, etched glass reticle. The scope also has an adjustable objective to eliminate parallax and ¼ MOA repeatable click adjustments for reliably dialing in MOA adjustments for a longer shot if one chooses. The scope is mounted to the rifle using Warne Maxima, matte black, steel 1” Ruger integral rings. Everything is in excellent condition, and less than one hundred rounds have been shot through the rifle; while nearly all factory hunting loads that I have tried, have shot less than minute of angle groups, with many consistently grouping under a ½ minute of angle, even from field positions. This would make an excellent hunting setup for a left-handed shooter. The rifle alone was recently appraised by a third party and rated at 98% with a value of $475. The included first focal plane scope is easily worth $500, plus the integral stainless rings/bases.

These have been banned from import via sanctions against Russia and are becoming hard to find. I am somewhat recoil sensative after a neck injury

The pistol grip conversion was professionally done: extra reciever holes welded over and blended, original trigger guard reloacted and welded, back plate welded onto the receiver, carrier group polished and reshaped to ease inserting magazine on a closed bolt action work/polish, Tapco G2 trigger group and SAW grip, customized selector lever for use w/ left thumb, and duracoated Foliage green. 

The barrel was shortened (and re-threaded) later on a Form 1 per the National Firearms Act. I rented a guided thread die for the new muzzle threads, it indexed in the bore to ensure the threads are straight & concentric. 

Side folding AR M4 type stock w/ butt modification to allow it to fully fold w/ 20 drum inserted.

SGM tri rail hanguard, VFG, VT Flashlight mount and Surefire G2L light, SAW grip, 4 position gas regulator, Tromix Shark breacher brake, Tromix Bolt on knurled charging handle knob, couple reduced power action spring for shooting light loads. 

Gun and magazines are lightly used, just a few range trips to function test really.

One 5rd factory magazine comes w/ the gun, I have a couple 12 rd drums and 10 rd stick mags that I'll sell too w/ the gun, I sold the 20.

All NFA rules apply. (per the NFA [National Firearms Act] if you want to buy this gun as a SBS, you will have to send a ""Form 4"" along w/ $200 to the Federal Government & pass a background check. When they send the form back approved several months later, you could then take possession of the gun.) 

Or, you can put down $150, I can have the barrel pulled, then I can sell you the rest of the parts as a normal title 1 shotgun/receiver and you can submit your own form 1 (or eForm1). When you get the form one back approved you can then take possession of the barrel and take it to the smith for reinstallation.  The $150 will cover the smith to take it out & put it back in.  

Prefer to transfer direct to another FL resident who is a CCW &/or NFA Tax stamp holder, or directly to a Title II/Class 3 dealer.  Non FL residents will have to go through a dealer if it goes as an NFA item on a Form 4"

puchased at a gun show without magazine, stock was cracked and screwed back together, doesnt look to bad and shoots fine, i recently purchased the magazine for it, but have been unable to shoot it with the magazine installed, not sure how it feeds or if it even feeds at all. 

i have a partial box of bird shot, and partial box of slugs to go with gun. 

i do not have to sell this gun, so please do not offer me 50 dollars for it, i paid 45 for the magazine used alone, 100 is what i am asking, would make a good beat up gun, if noone buys it i have no problem letting it sit in the safe or cutting the barrel down and putting it in the truck."

HK VP40 .40 S&W striker fire pistol with 2 13-round steel mags.  New In Box.  3-Dot photo luminescent sights.  Also can use P30 magazines.

A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports. These are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide to provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports are slight vertical bar extensions on the slide that are intended to make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.

It has a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.  VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines.  HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels.  Smoother than a Glock trigger.

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $585 firm. No trades.

Buyer must have valid Ohio driver's license. Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun. I prefer buyer to have valid CCW license.
