This includes the complete slide, barrel, and recoil spring.  The plastic sights and the recoil spring are essentially new. The internals are the highly desired forged parts that were discontinued nearly ten years ago. The finish is NIB-X, and the serial numbers were removed before the refinishing process. This is legal since your supplied frame is the serialized part designating it as a firearm. This would be perfect for a Glock 19 owner that may like the option of shooting 40s&w since they do not have the option of conversion barrels.

This is a late 90's, Gen 3 slide that came from a police department that went to Glock 22s. They destroyed the old frames and sold off the uppers to a company that refinished them before wholesaling.

Excellent condition, purchased less than 2 months ago, roughly 50 rounds fired. Factory scope bases, Weaver Grand Slam steel rings, cheap Tasco Scope.

Rifle is zeroed, but it appears the scope may have slid ever-so-slightly in the rings during my last range session.  Scope was bought used and cheap to put on this rifle for hog/deer hunting and looked like it may been over-tightened by previous owner on whatever he/she had it mounted to, so maybe that's why it slipped, or maybe I did a poor job of mounting it.  Either way, I'd recommend re-mounting it in the the rings or putting something else on it altogether and re-zeroing the rifle before hunting.

No shipping, face-to-face in Enterprise area, cash only.

Firm on price...you can get these new at Walmart for $379, maybe a little less if you shop around locally, so I think this is a fair price for this rifle in this condition.

Any questions just let me know.  Thanks."

Up for sale is my Browning buckmark 22lr. I purchased the gun with a broken extractor, so while I was replacing that I refreshed some of the other parts as well. The new parts consist of: 

Volquartsen exact edge extractor
Browning extractor spring 
Browning extractor spring plunger 
Browning recoil spring and guide rod assembly 
Browning recoil spring buffer/pad 
Browning laminated wood grips with gold Browning emblem (originals black grips included) 


Also included is a weaver scope mount base that replaces the sight block. It changes out within minutes and makes adding an optic super easy. As well as a new brownells recoil spring/guide rod assembly.

I believe this gun had a trigger job as well, as there is absolutely no take up in the trigger. It breaks clean with no wall and feels very light. This would be a great pistol for someone who wants to get into target shooting. 

The sale includes everything listed, as well as 2 magazines, the owners manual, and a plastic case."

  I'm selling my 20 inch heavy barrel Superior Arms upper. This is an extremely accurate and very smooth shooting upper. The rifle length gas system is renowned for offering .22 LR levels of recoil, and this upper is no different. Recoil is almost nil. I've only shot about 400 rounds through this guy, so it still has tons of life left in it. The heavy profile barrel does make the gun heavier, but I've easily done 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards. A better shooter than me could do even tighter groups.

  This upper has all the goodies: Forward assist, dust cover, M4 feed ramps, 20 inch heavy barrel, rifle length gas system, Magpul MOE rifle handguard, standard M4 front sight block, and I'm including an M16/M4 carry handle rear sight as well. It adds an authentic look to the rifle and normally those alone are 80 dollars. Does not come with a bolt carrier group or charging handle, but if you have an AR, then you've already got those parts on hand.

  For this quality upper, I'm only asking 300 dollars. Most new 20 inch uppers online cost at least 450 dollars and I would wager aren't as nice as what Superior Arms produces. For more detailed pictures, please shoot me an email. Thank you for looking and have a great day."

This is one badass 1/2 MOA rifle!!! It comes with two complete uppers, one is a 16"" chambered in .308 Win Match, and the other is a 26"" chambered in .260 Rem. Both uppers are complete.

The lower is a DPMS that has a 2 stage Rock River Arms National Match trigger and a Magpul PRS butt stock.  

The 16"" turned .308 Win Match upper has a threaded muzzle of 5/8x24 for the option to mount a suppressor and has an R&D Precision brake. The hand guard is a 15.5"" from Superior Weapon Systems.

The 26"" turned .260 Rem upper has a 13.8"" Troy Battle Rail and an R&D Precision brake.  

Everything (both uppers and the lower) was cerakoted in Patriot Brown and then sent to Boyd Lemons of Hillbilly223 Urban Finishes, Inc. for the custom paint job.

Both uppers have less than 20rnds through them. I had this rifle built about 14 months ago, and i just don't have the time to shoot it. I paid a little over $5000 for the set up (minus the scope), so my loss is your gain.

The Scope is a Bushnell 3.5-21x50 and is mounted in a DTA 30MOA mount. The scope is not included in the price, but if you are interested in it we can work out a deal.

I'm knocking 100 bucks off because of that. I researched the used value of the gun and it was between 450-500. I'm asking $350 OBO.

   Looking for a reproduction musket or rifled-musket. Ideally, I'd like to get an 1861 Springfield Rifled-Musket in .58, with bayonet, but a lot of people out there seem to think this gun is worth more used than new. $700 is my upper limit on value, and while I don't have a ton of cash on hand, I DO have an absolute heaven of man-goods to trade for the gun:

-MRE's
-Tactical Gear
-Military Surplus
-Paintball Guns/Gear
-Airsoft Guns/Gear
-Crossbows/Bows/Hunting Gear
-Outdoors Gear
-Collectibles
-Warhammer
-Medieval weapons(not toys or replicas, the real deal reproduction); swords, spears, lances, axes, shields, chainmail, armor, you name it.
-SCA gear
-Black Powder Supplies
-Black Powder Firearms
-Tasers(Many types)
-Body Armor(Class I through IV)
-Helmets, Military or Airsoft
-Oakley ballistic glasses
-Ammunition, most common calibers(used up my 9mm and .22LR, sorry)




I will consider any reproduction that has a percussion or flintlock system(sorry matchlockers, one of you is plenty enough trouble for me), from any era in any caliber. Got a French musket designed 1752? Awesome, I'll check it out. Priority will be given to 1861 Springfields, but other than that it's fair game. I'd also consider modern repro's like Hawkens and the like, but I'm really looking for the military models. If it doesn't fit a bayonet, I'm probably not going to buy it.

--HAVING A BAYONET WITH YOUR GUN IS A HUGE PLUS--


I don't really need slings or frogs, etc. The rifle and a bayonet are my goals; anything beyond that is just fluff that I may or may not be interested in. A good leather sling would be nice, provided it's historically accurate.


I'm looking primarily for rust. So long as it doesn't have rust, I don't really care if you're a horrible gun owner and you've used the stock as a hammer the past six months. In fact, I'd prefer a ""beater"" simply so I don't have to buy new. The worst-case scenario here folks is; I go to Cabela's and place an order for a brand new one, at a cost of $800. I'd really rather avoid that and buy someone's unwanted gun off of them."

The basic sight system, and interchangeable barrel weights with rail that can accept an optical sight mount were retained.  The model offered is a commemorative version. Same as the other S models, but with a better finish, and gold lettering. The Morini grip is original to the gun, and has been modified slightly to correct the problems with the stock Morini grip shelf.  Mechanically PERFECT.Armslist does not always succeed inforwarding inquiries.  Please see my 208 listing, or the images of the GSP listing for other contact routes.The S model uses a trigger system modified from the older 208, but similar to the 215 and the later 208 guns. These changes were made to reduce production cost. Trigger quality was neither improved nor decreased.Like the S&W41, the 208 and the S model evolved from the Walther Olympia of the 1930s, which itself was an adaptation of the Reising Target Pistol. After an unsuccessful adaptation by Hammerli following WWII as the Hammerli Walther Olympia, the International saw the gun revised extensive with a far superior result.  The 208, and by pass-through of the inheritance, is, in essence, the ultimate S&W41 that Smith and Wesson never made.The barrel is a solid unit with the frame, with superb (close to 0.5 MOA) accuracy resulting. The trigger is excellent for consistency, and readily adjustable from about 400 gms to about 3000. In addition to having a ""fine"" adjustment, this gun offers a coarse adjustment system for rapid adjustment from heavy to light pull weights.The S model is slightly LESS accurate than the older 208 guns, but the difference is very difficult to detect, and many prefer the S due to the adjustable trigger position and 2 stage option.Gun weight can be adjusted by change in barrel weights (0-240 gm available). The original Hammerli grip is one of the best ever offered for a handgun.Additional magazines (OEM Hammerli) available, and optional weights as above.This gun is NOT a SigArms import, and has no safety.

Looking to trade for of like value, or your firearm plus cash in a COMPLETE AR platform Or a Sig P238/P938 and cash. No junk and no trade offers for anything besides an AR OR a Sig P238/P938 + cash. Anything else and your message will not be responded to. Sorry to be blunt but my inbox is full of emails about trading for garbage.

This firearm is listed new at $1250 and I barely have 3 boxes through it. I have listed it accordingly. Yes, there is MINOR holster wear on the front end, that's to be expected with any firearm that doesn't live in a safe. It doesn't affect the firearm at all. 

No hagglers or time wasters. To be honest I'm not even entirely sure I want to trade this beauty so come at me with something that is worth both our time. I've already received many offers with used guns that were under $600 new, don't be that guy.

I'll include my $200 Galco shoulder system for $125 or a Galco Kingtuk IWB holster for $40. May throw them in at that value in trade towards right package. Includes four magazines at no extra charge.

There is a Magpul fore grip installed and there are iron sights front & rear. SCAR 17's are very accurate, light weight & very very reliable due to the short stroke gas piston system. This gun will stay in my safe until I decide to sell it I am asking $2850 with the mags. MSRP on the rifle new is $3350 plus FFL fees and tax putting total for the gun around $3600.00 add the mags at $40.00 each plus tax this would be $3800.00.  I will only do a face to face transfer Cash and may consider trades for high end Kimbers, Sig Sauer and other High Quality Hand Guns & AR's not really looking for Frankenstein builds wanting FULL MSRP for crap guns.

Pattern Performance:
935 waterfowl models are equipped with three interchangeable Accu-Mag choke tubes for the ultimate in pattern performance with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads.

935 Overbore (.775) vs. Standard 12 gauge bore (.731)
For superior pattern performance and reduced felt recoil, each smooth bore 935 barrel is over-bored to 10 gauge dimensions.

For soft-shooting reliability, the self-regulating gas system vents excess gasses to aid in recoil reduction and eliminates stress on operating components. It's also one of the most reliable gas systems available, with minimal moving parts and no O-rings or manual adjustments to spoil the action.

Simplicity Equals Performance
The gas cylinder, dual gas-vent system and piston remain attached to the barrel, reducing cleaning maintenance and ensuring easy assembly/disassembly.

The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin. The new ARAK-21® upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools. The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion. The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob. The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings. Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation. The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system. Along with your new ARAK-21® upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails. Due to the unique and innovative features of the ARAK-21® upper receiver, there are very few parts that are interchangeable with a standard AR-15. The firing pin, extractor spring, and ejector spring are the only parts that are standard and interchangeable with an AR-15 upper receiver. Other features include: The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench. Long stroke variable setting gas piston system. There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow. This allows for single shot operation. There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the bolt. Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on. This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate. This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth.

It is mostly because of the super low felt recoil of it’s high polished ROTATING BARREL. This is not your grandfather’s Glock. EVERY single part is CNC machined and de-burred. NO MIM PARTS !! I am not going to write poems about it. If you do not know about this gun and the brand – it’s probably not for you. For those guys that know Grand Power and K100 MK12– well, you know what you are looking at here ;—) Tenifer slide, stainless CNC-machined body in polymer frame. This is a solid low recoil full frame pistol.

NOTE: Please note that this is not the old MK7 K100 model – it is the latest MK12 version. This video from Sooch00 will tell you how just how special this pistol is:

THIS VIDEO IS WORTH WATCHING even if you are not interested to buy ;—)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pu0Kj5Vpvk

This gun (and the 4-4.5lb TRIGGER !!) is really amazing. SUPER accurate and smooth shooting pistol. Just got it last month and the ONLY reason why I am selling it because I just bought Grand Power flagship – the K100 X-Calibur.

Comes with two 15rd magazines and the original box. Excellent – LIKE NEW condition, no scratches or dings of any kind, could EASILY pass for a NEW GUN!! Purchased only last month – less than 200 through. Also comes with 4 exchangeable back straps, fully ambidextrous, 4.5"" barrel, VERY smooth 4-4.5lbs trigger.

MSRP on this gun is $629 + tax. Internet deals are about $100 less, but by the time you pay for shipping, CC charges FFL transfer fees, you are in it for close to 6 bills.

My price is ONLY $475 !! Not interested in any trades or ‘offers’ at this time. Price is FIRM at $475, ....and no –”$450 will not take it”, so please save your or my time. Thanks for your understanding. Only ‘face-to-face cash deals anywhere in greater Tampa Bay area.

I am located in East lake / Palm Harbor / Tarpon Springs area. If seriously interested, please text or call at 727-365-22_six_six instead of using emails, because I am Cross-posting in several FB groups & Armslist. This one will NOT last long !!"
