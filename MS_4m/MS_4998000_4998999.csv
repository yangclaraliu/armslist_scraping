Took this on a trade recently because I've been interested in one of these for some time. It shoots great, reliable and accurate just like you'd expect. I've been a sig guy though and the usp isn't changing that. I've got 2 factory 10 round mags, 3 factory 13 rounders, the box it came in, and 300ish rounds of range ammo and 50 rounds of hollow points I may be able to part with too. Judging from the barrel this gun has not seen much use. It's a great pistol that doesn't take up much room in the safe so I'm not desperate to sell. For a H&K fan or someone needing an excellent bedside or defensive pistol this could be a great score. I'm open to reasonable offers: rifles, polymer pistols (especially 9 and 45), sigs, 1911's, ccw's, cash is fine too. Feel free to make an offer, I will try to politely respond as soon as I can. Any sale or trade will be done in compliance with state laws. Thanks for looking."

I know I am forgetting some stuff. There is everything you need to start making holsters or sheathes or anything you can think of. I can send pictures of stuff I made with exactly what I am selling. I have a new job and this has been sidelined, just taking up space. Larger tools are bolted down and am willing to part with the work benches for the right deal. 

I would prefer to show you everything if interested. It would take hours to list everything. This was all bought less than 2 years ago and has had little use. I am asking $ 1000 for everything except the benches. Willing to deal them in however. I have more than double that invested.

(44-40) caliber. The rifle itself comes with five special order features. (1) early style checkered stocks, (2) XXX grade fancy walnut, (3) case hardened receiver, (4) 26"" octagon barrel (24"" was standard), and (5) a Set trigger. This gun, serial number 57266 is an early 2nd Model, being manufactured in 1880 and comes with an emailed confirmation taken from the Winchester factory ledgers housed at the Cody Firearms Museum (see pic.#9). First Model 1873's were manufactured from serial number 1 to around 30,000 serial number, Second Model's were from 30,000 to 90,000, and 3rd Model's went from 90,000 to end of production (720,610). A Straight Grip Deluxe Model is much rarer than a Deluxe Model 1873 with a pistol grip stock. This Deluxe Model 1873 with a 3X grade walnut, a set trigger and an longer than standard barrel is a rare enough find. Added to that, this one comes with a ""one of a kind"" and very unique, hand made case from the period, shaped like the Model 1873. The case has been hand carved from a solid piece of wood to fit this 26"" Deluxe like a glove. It is an amazing accessory that draws the most attention on my display table at guns shows. It has all original and period correct hardware, nothing has been replaced. Pictures do not do it justice, I guarantee you will love this case. It is quite valuable on its own. As for condition of the case, it is in near perfect condition, with minor wear to the handle and exterior finish. As for the rifle, another very rare feature is the courser, early style checkering."

This rifle, serial #53011 was manufactured in 1886, has six special order features and comes with a letter taken from the factory ledgers housed at the Cody Firearms Museum showing its original configuration (see pics.#7 & 8). With the Model 1876 already having a low production of 63,871 guns, there were only 9,132 rifles manufactured in the 40-60. The 40-60 caliber had the fewest number of Deluxe guns made with only 268. The 50-95 Express rifles had the lowest production numbers of 3,281, but had 539 Deluxe models manufactured. The 45-75 had 16,617 rifles, with 802 Deluxe guns and the 45-60 had 24,176 rifles with 530 being Deluxe models. The other extremely rare features are that only a total of 76 rifles were manufactured with a 28"" half octagon/half round barrel (which many of those would have had full magazines). Shotgun butt stocks totaled 139, half magazines numbered 198 and casehardened guns saw a total of 597. Combine all of these features on one gun and it would be safe to say that less than a handful of 1876's were manufactured in this configuration, which one or more surely was ordered by Teddy Roosevelt himself. Being a Deluxe gun with special order features, the rifle was hand-fitted by workmen who applied assembly numbers to aid in the final assembly after finish. I carefully removed the buttstock to find the matching assembly numbers of ""2525"" stamped on the lower left tang of the receiver and on the inlet of the stock (see pics#114 thru 117)."

Tula Ammo is a great way to fuel long shooting sessions at a reasonable cost. This 1,000 round case of 9mm Luger cartridges does just that, firing a light 115-grain bimetal full metal jacket bullet at a muzzle velocity of 1,150 feet per second. Unlike some other Russian ammo, Tula ammo is non-corrosive. It uses economical Berdan primers and polymer coatings chosen for their non-tosicity. Although it generates slightly more fouling than some domestic competitors, Tula ammo has proven itself to be cheap, reliable, and accurate.

Founded in 1880, the Tula Cartridge Works of Tula, Russia has produced steel-cased ammunition since the 1920s, taking advantage of the country’s massive iron ore resources. Although not reloadable, steel casings have delivered reliable performance for the company’s customers in dozens of countries around the world. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Tula has established a strong following in the US and exports more than half a billion rounds to America every year."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity."

Serial Number THB9434. Date of Manufacture is 12/21/1992. This pistol is not the civilian issued model. This is a verified government issued pistol. Manufactured as a police issued pistol. Commonly referred to as the Smith & Wesson FBI 10MM 1076. Was initially issued to the Virginia State Police. Was returned to S&W for post production updates. All updates were performed by S&W technicians. Smith & Wesson has documentation of all updates on file. Has 2 dots stamped under the decocker lever. Has the latest updated trigger play spring. Has a U stamped on the bottom of trigger guard. Has an O & P stamped on the barrel. This is the latest barrel from S&W. Has a highly polished feed ramp. Has night sights. Has Palm Swell Grips. Has crosshatch checkering. Will fire with out magazine, and is labeled as such on the slide. Has the number 20543 embossed on the right side of frame grip (under the grip). Apparently placed there by the Virginia State Police. I purchased this pistol 10 to 12 years ago, to my best recollection. Pistol is super clean. Bore is excellent. Very low round count. Operates and shoots like new. No disappointments. Several have asked me if I have the letter from S&W confirming the history. All history/information I have provided about this pistol can be verified by calling Smith & Wesson, for free. 1-REDACTED Being a very limited production, government issued pistol, no doubt the value will increase. Several folks have asked me how I obtained the history of this pistol, without paying $50.00 for ""The Letter"". It was quite simple.

Brand new, never used, straight from the factory Diamondback DB9 magazine, plus a nice Sneaky Pete smooth brown leather pocket protector specially made for this magazine.  The magazine is one of the good ones made in Italy for Diamondback.  A rare instance of foreign-made being better than made-in-USA.

Anticipating my purchase of a DB9, I bought these about a month ago when I saw them online.  I knew DB9 mags were scarce so I decided to buy one to have as a spare as soon as I saw it, even before I bought the gun.  I bought the mag directly from Diamondback and the mag protector from Sneaky Pete (probably not Pete himself, but at least from his website).

…and then a Glock 43 followed me home and I decided not to purchase a DB9 after all.

I’ll sell them both together for $30 which includes priority mail shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states. Payment by PayPal is probably the easiest way to do this if you’re not close to College Station, TX.   An FFL is NOT required just to ship an empty mag through the mail.  

I paid $20 bucks apiece for each of these (total of about $40 without counting tax and shipping), and you can compare the pricing on eBay or anywhere else if you can even find the magazine.  Pricing on eBay for DB9 magazines is exorbitant these days due to scarcity and I just don’t think that’s right.  My scruples, your gain.

Price is firm since I don’t have much interest in haggling over a buck or two.  Thanks."

If you live in Toledo or nearby, we can meet face to face for cash only transaction. 
I think there are around 200 once fired cases. This is military once fired brass used by Army snipers who have recently started using the 300 win mag. Primers are lacquer sealed but not crimped. It has been cleaned and that is it. $35 per 50.

The Redding Competition Micrometer seater die is very nice and is definitely one of the best seater dies you could buy. The die quickly and easily adjusts seating depth in .001"" increments and limits runout to .001"" or less. The box doubles as a shell holder. Brownells has this die listed at $106.95  with s&h you're looking at about $116.00. Buy this one for $90 and step up your game.

The Forster Bushing bump neck sizer die is used after you have fire formed your brass. It sets the shoulder back a few thou and allows you to headspace off of the shoulder. It also neck sizes the case. In so doing, this die maximizes case life and controls neck tension. Forster has them listed for $121.00 +s&h presently. Again, one of the best resizing dies you could purchase. It's yours for $100.00

The Lee Ultimate Rifle 4 die set includes a full length resizing die, a neck sizing die, and dead length seater die, a factory crimp die, a shell holder, and a powder dipper. Lee lists their 300 Winchester Magnum Ultimate Rifle 4-Die Set for $65.00 +s&h. I will sell this set for $45.  

The case gauge is an LE Wilson adjustable case gauge. It allows you to set up your sizer die so that it sizes your cases just enough to chamber in your rifle. You stick an unsized case fired from your rifle into the case gauge and then adjust the gauge with an allen wrench (included) so the case head is flush with the lowest step on the gauge. In this way you can set up your sizing die so that the brass isn't stretched out excessively during firing. It's very simple and very useful. Sells for $33.99 at Brownells presently. Yours for $25.00"

This handgun was customized specifically for Conceal carry. 

1.) Polymer Stock Guide rod Replaced with Sure feed stainless steel Guide Rod - The original Guide rod made it difficult to drop the slide forward from slide lock. The polymer would flex as you applied pressure.

2.) 35% Shorter Stroke Trigger kit from Galloway Precision - This Trigger kit reduces the normally long pull of the Ruger LC9. Allowing you to be more combat effective and stay on target. 

3.) Grip Textures - Adding the grip textures allows the pistol to stay firm in your hand when handling under stress or in wet conditions. Allows for an easy grip when drawing from IWB. 

4.) Disabled Magazine Safety - A true conceal carry needs to be able to be used in a hostile situation. When performing a tactical reload. A magazine safety prevents you from defending yourself inbetween the magazine exchange. 


   I have put about 250 Cartridges down the barrel since I purchased it. Yet for my EDC went a different direction. The handgun is in good condition. Would be great for someones EDC (every day carry) I also have some accessories that came with it and also willing to sell the accessories I purchased for it.

I did clean this gun thoroughly after shooting, even taking apart the trigger assembly and wiping it down clean. Well oiled up and ready to go! Great gun, especially for beginners. Absolutely nothing wrong with it, I have school loans to pay off and this wasn't exactly the wisest buy for me. It will come in the original box, with the paperwork/manual, bolt-lock & key, (1) 25-round magazine and of course the gun. Great gun and fun to shoot, can only with it the best for the next owner!

PS, I will ask questions to make sure the buyer is legally responsible to own the rifle. Also, will ask for a copy of a driver's license for my own records and to cover my butt! 

Thanks for looking!"

A non-lead projectile with a Hollow Point Flat Based (HPFB) design. It's OAL is 0.955” allowing it to function properly even though it is a hollow point. Due to velocity and pressure restraints, this bullet fragments into several pieces, penetrating 9-11” of gelatin. The jacket will stay intact and its petals will expand, with approximately 50% of the core fragmenting. This allows the bullet to penetrate deep enough to stop a threat and the fragmentation that does occur will cause wound cavities of 1-3” in diameter. The DRT 380 bullet will penetrate soft barriers like sheet rock, plywood, car doors, and some windshields."

Pistol has a zev ultimate fulcrum trigger kit installed and makes it one of the best feeling triggers I've ever felt on a glock. Also has the Dawson adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight. I will also include a blackhawk holster and a lone wolf barrel for shooting lead rounds. I would be willing to take 700 for it all or trade for a glock 34 and 100 cash. Would also trade straight for a glock 34 if I keep my sights. This would be a great deal for someone looking for a glock with a great trigger. Or something more compact than the 34.
