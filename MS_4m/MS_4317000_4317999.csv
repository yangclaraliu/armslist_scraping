Item Description: For your consideration, a gently used Ed Brown Special Forces Carry 1911. This pistol is a dream to shoot and looks great. This unit has the more desirable carbon steel. No idiot mark but there is a small mark on the right side of the rear sight and a small rub mark on the front edge of the thumb safety. There are also two small nicks at the bottom of the grip from mag changes. This pistol will come with the matching Ed Brown bag, manual, and extra set of VZ style grips, and one mag: either the factory Ed Brown mag or a Wilson Combat. The night sights have a lot of life in them. I'm not the original owner and do not know the round count. I ran 50 rounds of factory ammo, cleaned it, and put it away except to show it off. I'm not looking for any trades at the moment but am not desperate for cash either. If you would like more pics please send me a PM. By contacting me you affirm that you are legally eligible to purchase & own a handgun in the state of Georgia"

Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.MODEL:    P-11TYPE:    Semi-Auto PistolACTION:    Double Action OnlyFINISH:    ParkerizedSTOCK/FRAME:   Polymer FrameSTOCK/GRIPS:    Black PolymerCALIBER/GAUGE:    9mmCAPACITY:    10+1# OF MAGS:    1MAGAZINE DESC:    One 10rdBARREL:    3.1""SIGHTS:    FixedSAFETY:    Internal SafetyCalibers:     9mm LugerWeight unloaded:     14 oz.     400gLoaded magazine:     6 oz.     159gLength:     5.6""     142mmHeight:     4.3""     109mmWidth:     1""     25mmBarrel Length:     3.1""     79mmSight radius:     4.6""     116mmMuzzle Energy Max:     400ft-lbs     540JTrigger Pull:     9 lbs     40NMSRP     $333.00Lifetime Manufacturer WarrantyBud's Gunshop price $249+$9 shipping and FFL feeThe pictures are representative of the gun and might not be the finish of this particular parkerized version."

The MTAC is an inside the waistband Kydex and leather hybrid holster designed for concealed carry. Created to be worn behind the hip at 4:00 or 5:00, this holster offers the best in comfort and speed for concealed carry use. 

The MTAC’s top grain cow hide leather backing is the most comfortable material to wear against your skin. It provides a soft flexible material that does not rub or pinch.

The Kydex body on the MTAC provides a rigid material that is custom fit to each firearm and maintains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth, low friction surface allows for a fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents.

The MTAC’s Kydex body is also interchangeable, allowing you to have one holster for all of your firearms. You can purchase spare bodies on the Spare Body page. 

The MTAC attaches to the belt by two clips mounted to leather tabs on either side of the holster. These mounting clips distribute the weight of the loaded pistol while holding securely to the belt. A shirt may be tucked in over the gun and holster complete concealment. 

Most Comp-Tac Clips offer 5 holes allowing for complete adjustment to the cant and ride depth of the holster."

It is not signed, but the knife may be a Don Hansen or a Jeff Hall creation before the diamond screws were added. I've never seen another like it. What makes this absolutely unique knife an amazing piece are the 6 diamond headed gold screws and gold diamond thumb stud; these were meticulously handmade and added by a jeweler/knife dealer as a prototype example for customizing knives and, unfortunately I acquired it quite a number of years ago at a knife show and I cannot remember the jeweler/dealer’s name. The blade is Damascus stainless anodized with dark purplish-maroon hues. The bolsters are highly blued Damascus. The scales are premium mother-of-pearl with gold pins. The blade is 3.6” and the knife is 8.5” overall. It is a liner lock. The liner and back strap are fully file worked and the spacer is anodized blue. The materials alone are worth the price.

This rifle only has approximately 400 rounds through it. It shoots great and I was getting 1.5 moa groups at 100 yards with 75gr hornady match ammo.  It is a ton of fun. The 556 is described as a hybrid of the Ar-15 and AK platform. The xi is the modular variant which is multi caliber convertible with purchase of a different caliber upper. This rifle has a 3-position adjustable gas piston operating system with a rotating locking AK style bolt. The fore end is on a quick release and disassembly of the firearm is very similar to an Ar-15 style platform. Everything on it is ambi (charging handle, safety, mag release, bolt catch). It comes with a folding side stock from the factory, which I have swapped for a DDLS adapter with a magpul CTR stock ($175 mod). Both stocks will come with the gun. It also comes with 6 magazines, 5 of which are P-mags. The original iron sights, a soft case, a set of canted iron sights and a single point harness are included. Also have original box.

599,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4317599,For Sale/Trade:  Smith S&W Colt 1911 Stainless Restoration Service,"NW Ohio, Toledo, Ohio",$ 40,"Listed On: Monday, June 1, 2015",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Stainless Refinish Service for S&W, Colt, Kimber, others.

We specialize in S&W Gen 2 and 3 stainless pistols and accurately match the factory media blasted finish.  We can also refinish Colt and other stainless firearm parts.

The price is to refinish one pistol slide which has been detailed stripped (completely disassembled) and ready for the refinishing.  The price does not include hand working for a brushed finish (as on S&W 639, 645 and others) or to eliminate cuts, scratches, agency markings or gouges.  Email and send photos for quote. Our price for a pistol frame/slide/barrel combination is $85 and includes small parts such as slide release, safety levers and other associated small stainless (only) parts.

We do not offer gunsmith or dis-assembly services, though we are familiar with Smith Gen 2 and 3 pistols and may consider a complete rebuild depending upon the model (Additional cost.  Minimum $65 for dis - re - assemble).  Support your local gunsmith (and tell them of our service please) and ask for their assistance if you are unable to detail strip your pistol.  See the many ""YouTube"" videos if you're a ""Do-It-Yourself"" person and want to save money.

Due to the low volume for our service, we only schedule one run per month.  Next run is on or about June 1.

Slides and non-FFL parts may be shipped direct.  Frames and receivers must be shipped to our FFL.

Return shipping is actual USPS postage.  Add $10 FFL handling fee when shipping needs to be done through my FFL (frames and such).  Add for insurance over the standard USPS $50.00.

We would like to work with and offer an FFL/Gunsmith discount.

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full-size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. 

Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs.

This unit is about the size of a can of beer and weighs under 12 ounces. It has 2 power zoom and white hot/black hot functions. The IR laser works great for two man teams. The person with thermal can scan an area and if they find a heat signature they can use the invisible IR laser to show a team member using night vision where the heat is located. If you ever night hog or coyote hunt, these will up your game. Or even use them to spot other game pre dawn. The tactical applications are endless.
