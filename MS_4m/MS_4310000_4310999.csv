76,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4310076,For Sale:  Nepalese Francotte Martini Henry rifle (not to shoot),"Florissant, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 175,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 12, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Have a Francotte martini rifle made in Nepal. It's mostly a wall hanger but if you really wanted to it can be fired. If you chose to do so that's at your own risk. The gun is pretty lose and would have head space issues. But you could hang it over your fireplace as a show n tell piece that ""could"" be loaded and shot 

Bought this knowing that the chances of this being a shooter were slim. It seems unsafe to shoot and the reading I've done suggests the same. That being said its not ""unable"" to shoot, but there are a few things that need to be replaced. I'll get to that later. I started with getting the action open. The firing pin was broken and stuck in the forward position. This was keep in the breach from opening. Once I got that taken care of the guts were able to fall out for service. So far all the parts that have been numbered match. Numbered parts I've found are the barrel bands, barrel, lever, trigger / breach block frame, breach block and the fore end. Matching numbers is not helping the mechanics though as the fit is pretty lose. 

Now there are 3 missing parts. The first is the screw that holds the action together in front of the trigger guard. The second is the firing pin. I still have the broken one,  it's pulled out so the action doesn't lock up again. And the last part is a captive screw on the inside. This one dose not appear to affect function, just there to keep the sear pin from falling out of the frame when removed from the receiver. The gun could be dry fired if the takedown screw and firing pin were replaced.  

Selling as a parts gun, wall hanger or just as an example of the Martini Henry that can be handled. The thing is fun to point and drop the breach on. All the internals are able to move freely. The stock is lose, but that's because I don't have a screw driver long enough to tighten it. If you replaced the missing parts maybe it could be used to touch off low powered blanks on the 4 of July or something."

This is the first generation (1 of 200) of the gun that FN made to test marketability. It is the same as current Olympic blue FN SC1's with the exception of having 28"" barrels instead of 30"" ones. 

This has all the features that hardcore clay shooters need:
-Adjustable comb can be moved up/down and left/right
-Ported barrels for reduced recoil
-Lengthened forcing cones and extended chokes for pattern density
-Fiber optic front bead and wide 10mm target rib for fast target tracking
-Adjustable blue anodized trigger

You won't find these features present on other quality O/U's without spending upwards of $2500 or even more.

The gun comes in a fitted breakdown case, and I can also give you the factory FN case but it's larger and not as handy. The gun also comes with the factory owner's manual, chamber locks, and includes (5) matched extended chokes. (2x)SK, IC, M, F, in a Briley choke case.

I bought this gun brand new from Gander Mountain for $1,299.  I've brought it to the range and shot it 4 times.  The gun is awesome and recoils like a 20 gauge!  The problem is, I planned on competing in 3 Gun, but it seems that work is too demanding and weekends are too busy.  I recently sent the gun out to C-Rums and had the lifter welded up, the loading port beveled, an out of battery mod done, the barrel throated and some trigger work done.  This gun is now the ultimate 3 Gun shotgun!  I also have a Roulette Tactical +2 Mag extension installed for a total of 10 + 1 capacity in the gun.  It also comes with 3 chokes, a cheek riser, different fiber optic front sites and a picatinny rail.  I have over $1,600 into it, but I never use it and I have an upcoming wedding to pay for.  My loss is your gain.  I'm asking $950.  

The only trades I would consider are Colt 1911 plus cash, a high end AR Pistol or a Carbine Chambered in 9mm, preferably one that takes Glock Mags."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

I have a Winchester model 71 (of course chambered in .348) for sale. It has some scratches and dings, but appears to function perfectly (I have not had a chance to fire it). Researching these online, according to the sn, it was built in 1941. It has been kept in a moisture control safe for the last several decades at least. Asking $1500, willing to negotiate, but I don't need to sell it. May consider trades (straight up or cash one way or the other) for a spike's tactical ar, an ak, or a semi-auto 20 gauge."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

They look good, they’re well constructed and well finished, and most important, they’re reliable and accurate. Here is Para’s new Expert Carry. Manufacturer and warrantor is Para USA of Charlotte, NC, formerly of Scarborough, Ontario. Photo specimen is one of fewer than a dozen pieces of sales representatives’ show guns. Surface detractions are negligible, all we see is some unevenness in the anodized finish on the frame; otherwise, no more than any brand new Para in a gun store that gets put on display: slide contact marking on the hammer face edge, bushing contact streaking on the barrel surface, and insertion and ejection marking on the magazines. This pistol and its mates come to us from Para’s distribution channels; it has never been transferred. We rate it as Near Mint in Box. Construction is black Nitide stainless slide and barrel, steel parts, and anodized lightweight alloy full length grip frame that is shortened in the front to accommodate the 3 1/8 inch Detonics MC1 style Match Grade barrel and its mated double spring guide system. Barrel rifling is six groove 1:16 Left Hand Twist. Sights are dovetailed into the slide, two dot Novak type rear, with steel housed green fiber optic high visibility sight. Trigger is .240 serrated face alloy skeleton with overtravel adjustment, with matching skeleton serrated Commander type hammer. Photo specimen gauged at 4 pounds pull with minimal felt creep. Safety system is series 80 type, with firing pin safety in addition to extended steel main safety and beaver grip safety. Slide stop is standard width serrated, and magazine release is extension steel serrated. Mainspring housing is flat C type serrated black polymer. Grip frame is smooth surfaced front, with para factory black polymer checkered grips secured with blue steel Torx head screws. Weight empty is 26 1/8 ounces, with center of gravity at the magazine release. Magazines are blue steel 8 shot factory Para with black polymer floorplates and Novak type cartridge followers. Magazines are manufactured by Check-mate for Para. Each pistol comes in its factory gray box with cable lock and instruction manual that includes Para’s statement of warranty. Replacement pricing on similar pistols from other manufacturers approaches $1500 per unit many times. We’re offering the special edition Para Expert Carry in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 489.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California. Any ammunition or personnel shown in our photos are Not included. Shipping.$15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation. Don’t let your buddies use your account, that kind of thing smells like felony level straw purchase attempt. NO AMEX NO PAYPAL.

Before they came, there was no such thing as a quality .45 Auto that would hold anywhere near 15 rounds of ammunition. Para pistols have earned their stripes with our local clientele. They look good, they’re well constructed and well finished, and most important, they’re reliable and accurate. Here is Para’s P1445, Expert variant. Manufacturer is Para USA of Charlotte, NC, formerly of Scarborough, Ontario. Photo specimen is one of fewer than 2 dozen pieces of sales representatives’ show guns. Surface detractions are negligible, no more than any brand new Para in a gun store that gets put on display: slide contact marking on the hammer face edge, bushing contact streaking on the barrel surface, and insertion and ejection marking on the magazines. This pistol and its mates come to us from Para’s distribution channels; it has never been transferred. We rate it as Near Mint in Box. Construction is steel slide, frame, and stainless barrel, with Nitride black steel bushing, spring cap, sights, slide stop, main safety, grip safety, hammer, and magazine release. Mainspring housing, grips and magazine floorplates are black polymer. Trigger is .240 serrated face black alloy skeleton with overtravel adjustment, with matching skeleton serrated steel Commander type hammer. Barrel is match grade stainless, and so marked, with six groove 1:16 Left Hand Twist rifling. Sights are dovetailed into the slide, black blade raised type rear, with steel housed green high visibility fiber optic front. Photo specimen gauged at 4 1/4 pounds trigger pull with minimal felt creep. Safety system is series 80 type, with firing pin safety in addition to extended steel main safety and beaver grip safeties. Magazine release and main safety are for right handed shooters; this pistol is not southpaw friendly. Slide stop is standard width serrated, and magazine release is extension steel serrated. Mainspring housing is flat C type serrated black polymer. Grip frame is 8 groove serrated front, with para factory black polymer checkered grips secured with blue steel Torx head screws. Weight empty is 40 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger. Magazines are matte blue steel 14 shot factory Para with black polymer floorplates and Novak type cartridge followers. Magazines were manufactured by Mec-Gar for Para. Each pistol comes in its factory Gray Box with cable lock and instruction manual that includes Para’s statement of warranty. Replacement pricing on similar pistols from other manufacturers approaches $1500 per unit many times. We’re offering the special edition Para Expert 14.45 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 519.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California. Any ammunition or personnel shown in our photos are Not included. Shipping.$15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

This pistol is a doublestack 9mm with a light rail on the full dust cover. Has a total of 3 (factory only sends 1) 17 round magazines. If you want more magazines, use the Mec-Gar mags. Has adjustable 2 white dot rear sight, and red fiber optic front, magwell, ambidextrous safety, beavertail safety, G10 grips, and flat mainspring housing. Great 3 gun pistol!

Although this is the 9mm version, my understanding is that you can buy the 22 TCM barrel, and use the normal 9mm mags, if you want to run the 22 TCM. That round is pretty amazing if you haven't checked it out. 40 gr bullet going over 2000 fps out of a pistol.

These double stack 9mm's have gotten popular for 3 gun, and it is no wonder why. It is a great pistol, but I just don't have a need for it anymore. $700 FTF until Governor Brown signs off forbidding it."

One of VLTOR’s most innovative products is the Versatile Interface Structure (VIS) upper receiver assembly. The VIS is a polylithic upper receiver assembly that ties the normally individual receiver and handguard into a single, aggregate part. This combination overcomes many problems that are associated with the traditional “two piece” design; most notably the greatly improved structural strength and repeatable accuracy. This affords the user all the benefits of a free-floating barrel and solid railed for end."

Armalite .308 High Cap Drum Magazine: Serious firepower in a small package. The X-10 is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for Armalite .308 rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semi-automatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum, and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. US sales only. PLEASE do not attempt to purchase if you live in one of the ""Constitutional Free-Zones"" such as NY, NJ, HI, CA, CT, CO, MA, Chicago, etc….

Comes with original box and paperwork, all of the original polymer furniture and gas tube. I will leave the laminate furniture, Egyptian pistol-grip and sling on the rifle as it stands now. If you don't want wood, you can always change it back.

This rifle is in excellent shape. I am only selling so that I can fund another project. (I have seven other AKs', this one is expendable.)

Asking $725.00 firm. There are no more of these being imported due to our wonderful ""King"" and his royal proclamations so this is a fair price for this firearm.

Despite not being a fan of striker fire triggers, this little thing makes me like them as it is superb. It is smooth, short, light, and has one of the best resets that I've seen or used. It has some finish wear, but is otherwise in good shape. The rear sight is cut for Glock sights, and the front is cut for Sig sights. The bore and feed ramp have been micro-polished by the factory. It is thin and about the same size as a S&W Shield, with a slightly longer grip. Comes with two 8 round factory magazines, case, and paperwork. It could come with ammo, see trade section for the details.
