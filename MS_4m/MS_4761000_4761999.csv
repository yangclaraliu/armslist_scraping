I bought this rifle off of this website about a year ago. The lower was painted blue when I bought it. Ive gotten most of the blue off of it but there is still a little on there. The rifle works perfectly fine and I have had no problems with it what so ever. I went ahead and put a quad rail on it as well rather than the stock one. The only reason this gun is so cheap is because of the little bit of blue paint left on it and I do not think it would be right to sell it for its actual value with the blue paint on the lower. I am hoping to get this off my hands sometime tonight or tomorrow because I am going on leave Saturday. Price IS negotiable.  Call or text anytime. REDACTED

This is a non suppressor Beretta 71 that was imported this summer. No need for any ATF paperwork since there is only a fake suppressor (non removable) on it.

More History:

 One of the most interesting references to the Mossad’s choice of the Beretta .22 is contained in a thesis on counter-terrorism submitted in April 1995 to the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, written by Alexander B. Calahan. It’s on the web.

Calahan’s thesis documents the Mossad assassination teams organized immediately after the terrorist massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in September 1972. In retaliation, the Mossad teams were given a specific list of terrorist targets to eliminate. Throughout the thesis there are continual references to Beretta .22’"

So $800.00 before taxes later, my loss is your gain. Less than 50 rounds (1box) put through this great little gun. Everything is there, box papers, lock etc.... This gun is literally brand new. If you don't know much about the Kahr PM series, please do some research and reviews. It is one of the most reliable concealable 45's on the market today. The all black diamond series is even more difficult to find and actually the same price as the bi-tone. Btw this is not the cheaper ""C"" series as many are shown for sale for less. 
I'll take the beating and sell it for 600.00 (firm). Seriously guys this is a new gun that I wish I could afford to just keep. I shot it a few times and realized why reviews rant about this gun."

Here's a description from them: 

These 80% AR-15 Lower receivers start as 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the US and are fully machined to mil-spec tolerances. The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and the safety selector hole. These are our Gen2 80s and have the rear lug area cut out. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done.

It is a modern special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

 This has the conventional double-action/single action trigger has a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. P30 models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. Double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger, so In case of an ammunition-related failure to fire all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. 

 A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights laser aimers or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

 During a recent endurance test a P30 test pistol fired more than 91000 rounds without any major component failures.

I also have about 500 or so rounds of varying ammunition I would include if desired on a trade or sale.

 I am just trying to reverse finance some other projects and need to thin the herd a little. If it doesn't sell or nothing peaks my interest I don't mind putting her back in the safe. I also have other firearms and miscellaneous related items I will be listing soon as well so keep your eyes open for some other cool stuff."

I am the second owner. I purchased it this past spring from an FFL in Central Illinois. I can not recall how many rounds the previous owner was said to have put through it, though it does not show excessive wear. I have only put 60 rounds through it myself. It does have a few scratches on the ejection port side, and possibly some wear marks on the left side of the slide, near the front. Not sure of the cause of any of the marks, since I have never carried this, nor holstered it. They were already present when I purchased it. I have tried to properly show the marks in the photos I have. Additional photos are available (Armslist only let me upload one)

I am looking to sell this as a package. I am not interested in trades, since the funds from the sale of this will be used to finish covering moving expenses. I will miss having it around, as it is easy to operate, very dependable, and enjoyable to shoot. I have had zero malfunctions of any sort with this firearm. I am located in Carroll County, but would be willing to travel a bit, so as long as we meet in a location that ensures our mutual safety, and allows you to inspect the firearm without causing undue alarm and concern (i.e. a shooting range, ffl dealer, etc.)

The XDs comes with the case, 1 7 round magazine with pearce base plate (allowing you to get a full grip, factory base plate also comes with), 1 9 round magazine with the mid mag extension. Extra back strap, mid mag extension, Springfield Armory plastic holster and double magazine holder, lock, and cleaning brush, and factory fired shell casing. It did not have the owners manual with it, and i haven't bothered to purchase one since I was already familiar with how to disassemble for cleaning. Reassembly is equally easy. The ammo in the magazines will not be included. 

The ammo consists of the following:

1 350 round bulk box Blazer Brass 115 grain 9mm full metal jacket. Purchased just after I purchased the XDs.

1 50 round box of Remington UMC 115 grain 9mm jacketed hollow points. Purchased last month.

 The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. Designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP for a lifetime.

 I am just trying to reverse finance some other projects and need to thin the herd a little. If it doesn't sell or nothing peaks my interest I don't mind putting her back in the safe.

The Remington® R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle is built on the proven AR-10 platform, using the direct-impingement gas system, where gas is ported down a tube into the action to cycle the rotary bolt locking mechanism. The lack of an operating rod and piston allows the barrel to be free-floated, greatly improving inherent accuracy. Movement of the bolt carrier in-line with the bore, and the recoil spring inside the stock reduces recoil and muzzle jump considerably, allowing for rapid follow up shots at multiple targets or running game. The Model R-25's operation controls, including the bolt hold open/release, mag release, and forward assist, are the same as those of AR semi-automatic rifles. The Remington R-25 has a 20"" fluted barrel that reduces weight and enhances heat dissipation. Both upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings, and a machined aluminum fore-end tube surrounds the free-floated barrel. A receiver-length Picatinny rail allows the attachment of AR tactical sights, or hunting scopes. A crisp, single-stage trigger comes from the factory set at 4-1/2 to 5 lbs. The Remington R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle comes with a 4-round magazine, and is compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win-type magazines of greater capacity. Includes front and rear sling swivels.

Also available to buyer at additional cost are a set of 6.5-06 RCBS dies and an ample supply of fireformed brass, and a partial box of Nosler 140 hunting bullets. Your buddies will drool when they see this beauty. Cash sale prefered but interesting trades always considered. Thanks for looking"

A perfect copy of the H&K guns. It's semiauto and the chambering is for .22LR. The ""GSG"" part of the name stands for German Sport Guns of Ense-Hingen, and the German craftsmanship is evident. The finish is matte black, and is very durable. On guns of this type, the ridiculous U.S. barrel-length requirements usually result in a lot of bare barrel sticking out. Not this time. It is neatly solved by the addition of a shroud-like barrel cover that looks exactly like a suppressor. All of the other features of the GSG-5 are exactly the same as those of the H&K MP-5, except, of course, there's no ""A"" position for the safety lever. There's an internal bolt hold-open after the last shot, and you can also lock open the bolt by turning the cocking handle into a recess

The Firestar pistol M-45, was designed and manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA.

All Firestars are compact, steel-framed semi-automatic pistols. Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. M-45 is a double action pistol with similar frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 6 rounds in.45acp.
Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns."

Description:
The Super Modular Rail (SMR) MK4 M-LOK™ is Geissele’s ultra-lightweight M-LOK option. These rails are purpose-built and feature integrated M1913 picatinny rail sections at the fore of the rail in the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. Maximum venting for heat dissipation also dramatically reduces the rails overall weight, while maintaining its same strong and rigid platform. Utilizing Magpul's M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, as well as the upper 45 quadrants. The SMR MK4 is both versatile and modular, allowing the user to taylor their platform to his or her unique needs. The SMR MK4 also features Geissele's proprietary 2"" long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance."

Prior to WWII it was sent back to Colt and converted to fire 38 Spcl which was very popular at the time. The conversion is still 1st Generation as it was done in the late 1930's prior to the start of WWII. This particular revolver has an interesting family history, but I am selling it due to some urgent financial needs. The condition of this Colt is very good to excellent and it should be both a fantastic shooter as well as fine collectible at a reasonable price due to the conversion. This revolver has a 5 1/2"" barrel and the bore looks great. Nice Colts like this are getting very hard to find so don't miss out. As with all older firearms this revolver must be checked out by a competent gunsmith prior to firing it. Buyer to pay actual shipping and provide copy of FFL."
