RESEARCH FROM INTERNET:serial number #32731 shows 1935 as date of manufacture.
 The Long Range Double was offered in 12-, 16-, and 20-gauges and .410-bore. The 12- and 20-gauges were all chambered for 2 3/4 inch shells. The original .410-bores were chambered for 2 1/2 inch shells and the 16-gauges for 2 9/16 inch shells. By 1934 the .410-bores got 3-inch chambers and the 16-gauges 2 3/4 inch. At various times during production, options of automatic ejectors, a single non-selective trigger, ivory sights, and a recoil pad were offered. The ejectors were not offered on the .410-bores in the 1931 price list, but this isn't mentioned in the 1933 to 1935 price lists, and the ejectors were discontinued by 1936. Production basically ended with the Ithaca factory conversion for wartime production in 1942, but a few hundred Long Range Doubles were assembled and sold in 1946. With the quality of  this gun it is my best price and a very good one. Try looking these up on gunbroker.com  I do not give a higher price and than lower it so you think you are getting a deal. You already are.
Please no counter offers    If the listing is up the gun is still available!!!! Thank you."

Barrel is threaded and appears to be just under 26"". Comes with a knurled thread protector. Can't tell for sure but I think the one piece base has some elevation in it. No clue on the round count, but it shot my first load into a nice little clover leaf off the pedestal rest-n-bag and I haven't messed with it since. Just used it for hunting last season.
The scope and bipod DO NOT come with it at this price.
As usual, FTF on the SE Corner of NC preferred, but will ship to your FFL.

Let's move it. $750 plus actual shipping cost is the number. Ships on cleared funds. Price out this level of customization and the value becomes easily apparent.

It is NOT an original German Mauser, the rifle was made on the same machines as German rifles Post WW2. After Germany was disarmed Poland received many of the machines and technicians that made the rifles. Poland continued to make them on unmarked receivers like this one. The bolt on mine is from an original German Mauser. The action and lock up are very strong and this would make an excellent starting point in a custom build.

There are no others like it, and this one can be yours.

Most likely, you've never seen an M1A SOCOM II in a wood stock with the lower rail section intact before. There are several reasons why they aren't available that way, which I'll get into in a bit.

This rifle started life as a SOCOM 16. As you may or may not know - the ONLY difference between a SOCOM 16 and a SOCOM II is the VLTOR rail system, and the etched label on the operating rod. That's it. Every single other component is the exact same between the two models. Same internals, same trigger, same muzzle brake, same gas system, same sights - same everything.

I retrofitted this rifle with a factory VLTOR SOCOM II rail system, although I did not replace the operating rod - as that's literally just a laser etched label. So yeah - this IS a SOCOM II - but the operating rod is laser etched with the 16 label. Additionally, the heel stamp and sight markings have all been color-filled in white.

But that's obviously not what makes this M1A unique. I doubt you've ever seen a SOCOM II in a wood stock with the full VLTOR rail section in person - because you just can't get them that way. In fact, you don't even really see very many in pictures - because there just really aren't but a handful in existence. If you're an M1A fan, you know that that you can take pretty much any M1A action and drop it onto pretty much any M1A stock without issue...with the single exception of the SOCOM II.

That's because the SOCOM II's VLTOR rail system has a super beefy bracket that prevents a wood stock from bedding properly. Additionally, the rivets on the upper rail hit the stock slightly, and the entire lower rail won't even mount because it hits the stock well before it seats. This means that if you want a wood stock on your SOCOM II, you've got some woodworking to do - and this is what stops most people from doing it. It's not just a couple of minutes with a Dremel...it's a job.

This stock started as a Boyd's GI profile premium walnut stock. I performed some meticulous custom inletting to allow for the VLTOR bracket, and then also relieved some material to allow for the rail system, which included significant re-profiling for the lower rail section. I then hand-sanded the entire stock, and applied several coats of Danish Oil over the course of several days. I then applied several coats of hand-rubbed satin poly to provide some protection for the finish. It's got a really nice grain pattern, and just the slightest bit of tiger stripe towards the forward end.

I finished this off with a brand new set of all metal stock components, finished in satin black. I used a new set, as I wanted to retain the completeness of the original stock as well, for ease in switching it back and forth. The original SAI synthetic black stock (in perfect condition) is also included, and you can switch it back and forth in about 30 seconds.

The end result is a truly stunning one-of-a-kind piece of art. There's just something about the juxtaposition of the modern rails on the classic wood. It gets ooh's and ahh's every time I take it to the range, and it's an absolute joy to shoot. The photos speak for themselves, and additional photos are available upon request.

Round count is around 300 - absolutely fabulous condition.

I've owned and do own many Glocks so I purchased the 43 as a backup option, and for my wife to use.
  I set it up with Truglo TFO sights, Vickers Tactical slide release, and Foxx IWB Holsters, carried it around the house a bit, then stashed it in the safe. It has never been fired.

Really amazing size and weight, I just don't think it's going to get used much and I bought a small revolver at the same time so I'm going to keep that as the backup.
I own a 26 and 30 and they see the most carry.

INCLUDES:
-Glock 43 new in box, two mags, mag loader, lock, shell casing, brush, etc
-Truglo TFO tritium/fiber optic sights installed (stock sights also included)
-Vickers Tactical extended slide release 
-Butt end grip plug
-Foxx IWB Holsters, handgun and mag (Modified slightly for better fit,  I've owned 8 of these and they are simply the best)

 $550 firm, a major price drop from what it's worth at around $700.
Can meet at FFL for transaction, buyer to pay transfer fees.

Thanks!

My price: $40 (Retail $79.99)

Slim, sharp, and simply must-have 

Even if you’ve never carried a knife with you every day, the Skyline just may convert you. Why? It’s so lightweight, slim, and comfortable to carry that it takes away any excuse for not having the right answer when someone asks, “hey, has anybody got a knife?” With the manual opening Skyline, you’ll always have the blade you need for everything from opening packages to slicing snacks.

The drop-point blade is versatile and offers good balance and a strong tip. The high-performance Sandvik 14C28N blade comes razor sharp and offers high wear and corrosion resistance. The profile of the Skyline is extra thin and it weighs in at just over two ounces making the Skyline a great choice for comfortable and discrete carry.

The textured handle scales are G-10, barely add to the Skyline’s weight, and provide for a secure grip. The handle design itself, with its deep index-finger contour, further enhances the Skyline’s very secure grip. The Skyline opens manually with a built-in flipper. Just pull back on the flipper and add a slight wrist roll for quick and easy opening with left or right hand. A liner lock keeps the blade locked open for secure use."

This is a hard to find leupold, made for the European market, it has the German #4 reticle, and was mounted in a Burris Pepr mount and shot at range once, otherwise it has sat in the safe since purchased.   Check out the specs online, but basically  it's  30mm scope without  AO, or side focus,  with a great hunting reticle.   Here's the deal, I'm looking for another decent scope, around the same magnification with a different reticle that fits my target shooting....maybe even a 3.5-10. If you have something you would like to trade, shoot me a offer as long as it's gun related I will look at it, but another scope is at the  top of my list.....No low ball offers accepted,  I can and will send it in for a reticle change  before I dump it. If you want to make a cash offer go ahead but I prefer to trade, as it seems on this site trades are easier to keep in line value wise......no, rent is not due, and I'm not desperate for a few bucks. I can send more pictures on request.  ""Do I still have it "" will be ignored."
