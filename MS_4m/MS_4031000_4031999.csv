I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age 
of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer.

This pistol was my duty weapon and has been in a holster, drawn from a holster and re holstered many, many times (practice makes perfect)...Due to this, it has quite a bit of slide wear. However; if you look at the end of the barrel, you will see it hasn't been shot all that much. Approx. 300 rds total... The pistol has been very well taken care of. It comes with original case, all paperwork, three magazines and if you are left handed, I have two Safariland Holster's (LEFT HANDED). One is an SLS duty holster that accommodates a Surefire X300U, the other a Safariland Duty Holster, ALS only, no light accommodation. 

This is priced to sell, and because of the aesthetic wear only....

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer.

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer. 
Long guns are $20
Handguns are $25

I've only ever put one 50 round box of WWB ammo through it.  It performed flawlessly for those 50 rounds.  It is unaltered and dropped right into my XDm without any work from a gunsmith.

PistolGear barrels are manufactured by Storm Lake.

From PistolGear Website:
""This barrel will convert a XD(M) 4.5 in 40S&W down to 9MM. 
For maximum reliability, we suggest the use of XD(M) 9MM magazines

The LCRx is used but in good shape with no problems to mention and comes with the factory lasermax laser module attached.  Has the same excellent double action trigger pull as the standard Lcr as well as an exposed hammer for single action fire as well.  Works well but I'm not a fan of lasers and I miss having a S&W.   I'd be interested in doing a straight trade for a Ruger SP101, or I'd be interested in most S&W J frames in .38 special, prefer models with a hammer of some sort, particularly a 637.  Might consider a standard LCR plus some cash. No Taurus or Charter please.

I have my ccl, if interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts preferred.

This is the older model with Metal trigger housing instead of plastic.
It has a 4 x 32 Tasco scope with see-through scope rings.

The stock does have a small chip shown in the one photo and an extra hole that once had a sling bolt in it. The stock is Solid, just been used.

This is a great shooting gun and accurate.

I am pretty firm on the price since I don't really need to sell it. If you don't want the scope and rings I would knock the price down a bit.

If you like the older METAL Rugers this is your chance.

Must show ID and sign bill of sale saying you can legally own in Missouri.

More Info About The Piston Operating System:
The Ruger SR-556 Employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

It was ordered in January of 64 and has pre 64 features as well as post 64. It was ordered with the following up grades from the custom shop.
1 Grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 which was standard on all Super Grades.
2 Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari Sights hand made in the custom shop.
3. Kickeez recoil pad.
The stock has fantastic color and figure and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is perfect except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore is in mint condition and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new. The rifle has been very well cared for. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. Will also come with a Browning model 1915 hand fitted Safari case that was purchased from the same dealer as the rifle. The case was purchased in the early 70s and is in mint condition and comes with everything it did when it was bought. Both locking keys instruction manual and care card. Have seen several of these sell before but not one in this condition with both keys and all paper work. Also comes with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased as the same time as the case. The sling is in excellent condition along with one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's. You will not find a nicer Model 70 Super Grade 458 African Custom Shop rifle any where. Thanks very much for looking."

As such, it features the three locking lugs and huge claw extractor that made Mauser rock-solid and reliable. The Chileans converted the rifle to shoot 7.62 NATO (and they marked accordingly it by stamping ""7.62 N"" in the receiver). Most old Mausers are long battle rifles, but this one has been professionally reduced to a barrel length of approximately 18 inches. This has the added benefit of presenting an attractive Mannlicher-style full length stock. The rifle is in wonderful condition, with a shiny bore and well-defined rifling. The gun is 100% free from rust except for a slight (barely visible) marring on the butt plate near the screw. The Chilean crest is well-defined and easily visible, and the beautiful stock has another crest and ""1912"" pressed into it. The rifle's only cosmetic flaw is on the receiver where a prior owner electro-penned ""308-W"" into the metal. It is barely visible. The gun has no import marks and the parts are non-matching."

the lower is an adams arms complete lower, it was purchased as a complete rifle, not a retrofit kit, or a complete upper and a mismatch lower. again it is a complete adams arms rifle.


i'm selling it because i'm building up an SPR, and i've already got an AR pistol, so i've got everything covered from short range to long range, no need for anything in the middle anymore.

it's a piston gun so it runs incredibly clean, my pistol uses an adams arms upper as well, i shot 300 rounds through it and cleaned the entire BCG with a quarter of a paper towel, they just work really well.  

only things i'm interested in is a partial trade for either a new geissle SSA. or a new CMC 2/2 2 stage trigger, both are worth about $230 off the cost of the gun.

or boatloads of 5.56 brass cased ammo.

The Beretta 92FS has been setting the standards for best military, police and tactical pistol for over a quarter century. The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semi-auto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards).

It has lots of blue turned plum.  The bore is bright with sharp rifling, As near as I can figure it was made in 1933.  In 1933 Winchester went to a 26 inch barrel on the Model 60.  The 60 A started in 1933.  Since it has a 23'  barrel it must have been one of first Model 60As.  It shoots S,L, & LR.  The numbers under the barrel are in the 77XXX range.  Winchester made 169XXX of these between 1931 and 39.  This not  is a serial number but an inventory number.  It falls in mid production.  I prefer F2F but will ship to an FFL or C & R.

I have a PTR-91F that I bought new. It is in like new condition and is very reliable and very accurate. It has never been rapid fired and has been detail stripped and cleaned after every trip out.
Basically I sighted it in and I would take it to the range from time to time and shoot ten to twenty rounds at 200-300 yard gongs. Factory drum sights and a hoot to shoot.
I really like this rifle but I have had two shoulder surgeries since I bought it in 2013 and am facing another soon.
I doubt that it has much over 150 rounds through it and it has run flawlessly and shoots better than you can imagine.
This rifle comes with everything that came with it new but the warranty card. Hard case, lock, cheap 30 mm scope mount.
This is not the G.I. model marketed by PTR but the model F heavy barrel target model.
It is a very nice, like new rifle, with three magazines, case, lock and manual and enough ammo to get you through a hard time or a lot of range time.
Absolutely no issues or problems.
I have sold off all my 12 ga stuff and heavy recoiling rifles. This is the last of them and as much as I hate to see it go I am unable to use it without shoulder damage or pain.
Contact me for detailed pictures or questions.
470 rounds of 1992 China sports N.A.T.O. spec ammo included. Sure fire and accurate out of this rifle. Non re-loadable.
Will ship to out of state FFL.

Chambered for the potent and accurate 7.62X39 cartridge it was used throughout the Soviet Union and all their client countries and has been shot at just about every free nation’s troops around the world (including this writer). There’s a host of aftermarket items available for it including high capacity detachable magazines, folding stocks, bull pup stocks, flash hiders, scope mounts, accessory rails and much more. It features a chromed bore, 10 round magazine, fully adjustable sights and folding blade bayonet and hardwood stock. This CAI imported example was made in the Tula arsenal and is like-new, with  cleaning rod, combination tool & brush (in butt trap), and is NOT an arsenal rebuild. All serial numbers match (receiver, bolt, cover, stock, magazine & trigger group), the build date is 1954 and you’re not likely to ever see one of these in better original condition. It retains 98+% blue while the bore is perfect (new), while the stock is completely sound with only a smattering of light handling marks. The bolt face shows no evidence of this carbine having been fired and while we’re not asserting that this is un-fired, we wouldn’t be surprised if it was. As a side note: we’ve never seen an SKS with such carful polishing of both the blued and bright metal surfaces – quite uncharacteristic for the Red’s (and there is no doubt that this is the original finish). With an abundance of very reasonably priced ammo available it’s a great carbine for plinking fun or serious defense. Or, in the case of this example, a collectable asset that’s bound to appreciate."
