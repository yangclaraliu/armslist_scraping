This gun has had a whole bunch of upgrades added on since it was new. Looking for something different and seeing what's out there. Please email offers to me cash or trade and if I am interested I will respond. Please don't email asking what I will take for the gun. That's the point of the offer. No it's not a new glock but it is one that has been upgraded almost as much as one could minus a couple things I don't want like the extended slide or mag release. Mainly wanting to trade. Just seeing if there is someone out there with a reasonable offer and we can make a trade."

AR Bolt On Flip Up Front Sight Gas Block System:
The GG&G Bolt On Flip Up Front Sight Gas Block is a top of the line, easy-to-install, flip up front sight gas block system.  The Flip Up Front Sight Gas Block is secured in place by a Tri-Point clamping system guaranteeing consistent accuracy and trouble free operation in all tactical environments.
AR Bolt On Flip Up Front Sight Gas Block System Specifications:

Designed and manufactured for rugged use.
Important: Will only fit barrels with a diameter of .750"".

As a method of standardization the M16A2 square front post is used, which is fully adjustable for elevation zero.
The clamp on front sight locking system is designed to be operated with the off-hand so that the fire control hand does not need to be removed from the weapons fire control system to deploy or lower the sight.
It comes equipped with a standard 1 1/4"", ambidextrous sling swivel that attaches to the side of the gas block.
There is an optional ambidextrous 1 1/2"" long MIL-STD-1913 dovetail rail for mounting flashlights, LAM's and other accessories onto the gas block base.
The sight will accept A1, A2 and most Tritium front sight posts.
Serrated protective ears aid in raising and lowering the sight stem.
The Flip Up Front Sight Gas Block System incorporates a sculpted finger groove design that is ergonomic and quickly deployable.
All hard edges have been deburred and softened for the shooter's safety.
Material: Manufactured from solid 4140 chrome moly billet steel with hardened wear points.
Finish: Bead blasted and manganese phosphated to provide a non-reflective, corrosion resistant matte black finish meeting Mil-Spec requirements.
Weight: With installed swivel 7 oz.
Warranty: Lifetime.

Can be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems, as a stand-alone sight or in conjunction with GG&G interface rails. The A2 Back Up Rear Sight features the standard military A2-style double peep aperture allowing for end user known point of impact. This A2 features full windage adjustment with the tactile windage knob. The A2 BUIS presents a low profile when in the down position, allowing clearance for most optics.

The initial zero is set by adjusting the weapons front sight post. The A2 Back Up Iron Sight is compatible with all GG&G Flip Up Front Sights. The GG&G A2 BUIS ordering options include requesting the XS same plane aperture as a substitute for the standard A2 aperture, or a Trijicon Green Tritium aperture.

The original finish could be gotten back by quickly sandblasting the sides which I could do if need be... but the polished sides do look nice."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Up for sale is a nice Romanian PKM kit chambered in 7.62x54R. 

Kit was manufactured in 1975. Unlike the hungarian stamped sheet metal topcovers, this kit features the unique, heavy duty Milled upper cover. A work of art! 

Quick Detach Barrel is chrome lined and with real nice rifling. Passes the bullet test with flying colors. 

Rear buttstock has been refinished a Nice Russian Red and is ready for action. 

This kit features the Russian SVD style PKM flash hider (my personal favorite). 

Kit comes complete with Stepanov ground assault/anti-aircraft tripod. 

One Russian Forstress 250 round ammo can is included with links (no ammo inlcuded). 

Kit has some finish wear, but all the metal is in excellent shape with no rust. Would look real nice after a Gunkote or Moly resin refinish. 

The kit is sold with a complete hungarian spare parts kit, which has the following: 

-broken shell extractor 
-spare firing pin 
-spare extractor 
-spare extractor spring 
-spare roll pins 
-blank firing adapter 
-adapter used to feed belted blank 7.62x54R ammo. 

This is a great looking kit and would make a wonderful Semi Auto or Post sample Machine gun. 

Vltor sells the PKM receivers and Marcolmar Firearms is taking orders for Semi-Auto builders kit. 

There is another company that is also working on a receiver and semi auto builders kit.

This handgun is different and better than 95% of other FEG firearms and here is why.
There are several Models of the FEG 380 handgun including the SMC model which is the Civilian model, the PA model which is the Polished Aluminum model (duo-tone) which can have premature wear issues and the R model which is the Police Pistol. This is an FEG Police Model .380acp semi-auto handgun Model R-61 imported by KBI Inc. in Harrisburg, PA. This is the Police model and as you can easily see by the pictures this handgun has had very little use and is in Excellent Near New Condition. This FEG is said to be a clone of the Walther PPK and some models like the R-61 are suppose to be just as dependable. This is a Double-Action .380acp pistol that comes with box, two extended round magazines, 81rds of factory ammunition, simulated alligator skin case and a pancake style holster (not pictured). The Extended Magazines are not standard and sell for $60 on Ebay.

Started off as a antitank site for German antitank weapon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PzF_44) in the 70's that was surplused out. Then became a cheaper alternative as a red dot magnifier and the base unit in the Larue Po Boy magnifier package. 

The antitank reticle was removed using the instructions here, but caused scratches on the tube. (http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_3_18/457428_.html) and the rubber eye cup removed.  Optic is clear and bright, what you would expect from a top notch optics manufacturer.  


No mount included, but Larue still makes flip to side mounts compatible or pretty much any 30mm scope ring will work. 
No longer need as I'm moving from red dots to 1-4x or higher magnified optics. 

Will be adding additional pic or email if you need pics on specific area of scope

History: Look for the finest sight ever fitted to a military rolling block  During this period of history Argentina was a developing world power (the sixth highest per capita in the world until it slid into socialism in the 1920's) strongly influenced by German developments. It's sight, ordered from Remington, is a duplicate of the Austrian Werndl sight and excellent in every respect.  The barrel is affixed with a sabre bayonet lug on the right side and held with three screw-retained barrel bands. The breech end also sports a 2.25 inch octagonal knoxform with ""Modello Argentino. 1879 E.N."" stamped on it (E.N.= Ejercito Nacional, i.e.National Army) and three line Remington patent markings on the tang.

The stock is in good shape, the bluing is pretty solid, and the bore is bright and shiny.  The only things ""wrong"" are that someone etched (and later scratched out) a license number on the bottom of the receiver.  They also etched a license number on the barrel hinge, though this is hidden from view when the action is closed.  Both etchings have been there for more than 35 years, since that's how long I've had the gun.  There is no serial number, so that puts manufacture date between 1936 and 1963.

Shoots smooth and without issues the few times I have shot it.
Selling or trading because I usually shoot other guns and do not need it sitting in the safe, want to use the money for something else or get something new.
Eotech in picture is not included, unless the deal is good, because I need to try and keep it, but I could add another red dot if the price is right.
I bought the gun after the horrible days of really high prices, but before normal prices, so I have a lot invested, esp after adding on all the extra items such as the Sig Brace etc.

Feel free to make an offer if you are interested. I have over $1350 in the gun not including the Eotech, but am willing to consider fair offers.

Shoots smooth and without issues the few times I have shot it.
Selling or trading because I usually shoot other guns and do not need it sitting in the safe, want to use the money for something else or get something new.
Eotech in picture is not included, unless the deal is good, because I need to try and keep it, but I could add another red dot if the price is right.
I bought the gun after the horrible days of really high prices, but before normal prices, so I have a lot invested, esp after adding on all the extra items such as the Sig Brace etc.

Feel free to make an offer if you are interested. I have over $1350 in the gun not including the Eotech, but am willing to consider fair offers.

Next up is a Colt Trooper MK V 357 magnum 4 in barrel, blued finish with original wood grip, stored a long time and shot very little, it doesn't show much wear at all but I guess the original owner didn't oil it before they stored it so there are a couple tiny rust pits on the right side that can be found if you shine it in the right light. looking for $650.00

Last but not least I a Glock 34 gen 4 plus 3 mags, comes with Truglo TFO fiber optic/tritium night sights.  probably has around 100 rounds through it, was going to use it for competition but decided to go with a different route, just doesn't fit me.  comes with case and all the trimmings, I can probably also find the stock adjustable sights as well if you want, $600.00 gets it.
