The rear-lugged action of the Super Match M1A™ is  glass bedded into an oversized Macmillan USMC camo stock. At the core of the Super Match M1A’s unparalleled performance is the heavy match Douglas barrel. These oversized match barrels are the heaviest possible match-legal barrels that can fit in the M1A™, and they feature a 1 in 10 twist. The Super Match M1A™ also features a National Match recoil spring guide and a match-tuned gas cylinder. Has a match tuned 4.5 – 5lb two-stage trigger, .0595” hooded rear aperture (½ MOA adjustable) and .062” front sight, and TRW bolt.This results in sub MOA accuracy. This rifle shoots sub MOA. It comes with 1- 5 round mag and 3 - 20 round mags. Make sure it is legal in your state. I will ship to your FFL or I can meet FTF if you are local. I can email more pictures if needed.

This is basically an EOTech with a Bushnell name on it. These things are crazy hard to find and when you do find them... they still sell for around $270. So the first offer gets it.

I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure I can work something out. Thanks for looking. 

For those of you who know what this is… You can skip the information below. For those of you who are not familiar with this sight… It is made by Bushnell but was made on the same line that EOTech uses and has all of the same electronics inside. Literally the only difference is that the Bushnell does not have the aluminum housing that the EOTech does. One cool option on this sight that the EOTech does not have is that it has a designated power button that remembers the last brightness setting. It has the standard 65 MOA ring and 1 MOA dot in the center. It is identical to the EOTech because… well… it is.

I bought this sight for my wife’s AR since she liked the EOTech and this was just a less expensive option. It is in NEW IN BOX condition.

The DDM4v1 LW is built with a Cold Hammer Forged 16” Lightweight Profile barrel making it approximately 5 ounces lighter than the original v1. It comes installed with our proprietary front sight base which is precision CNC machined from a solid billet of 4140 steel. This FSB features a serrated curved design to minimize glare and is salt bath nitride treated minimizing corrosion and wear. The DDM4 Rail 12.0™ FSP allows the operator to mount a weapon light or aiming device forward of the front sight for optimal ergonomics and a clear line of sight. Quick disconnect attachment points are integrated to the front and back on both sides of the rail for fully ambidextrous sling attachment.

I have had absolutely zero issues with this firearm, it has never had a malfunction and eats up any brand of ammo you throw in it. Yes it's an AK and known for its ability to fight off the elements, but I have cleaned this thing every time I fired it. It comes with the following:
-AK47
-1x 75 round Romanian drum(this thing works flawless and I only used it one time to make sure it worked)
-3x Bakelite magazines (these are nice looking magazines that are much more expensive than the steel magazines.
-2x Steel Magazines
-1x Tapco Magazine
-AK47 Sight tool, this will let you adjust the sights.

This is a great value considering all the magazines and the expensive Romanian drum magazine that can be hard to find. You can smash this rifle around and throw it in the snow and it won't let you down. Why pay for an expensive $1500 AK47 when this thing does the exact same thing and is just as reliable?

HI-POINT 4595TS .45ACP CARBINE -It came with the sling, iron sights, tactical light, foregrip and one 9rd mag. I added the Monstrum Red/Green Dot Sight, 2 Extra Mags w/Stock Mount, Muzzle Brake/Compensator and the UTG Bi-Pod. I still have the factory iron sights too. I will admit that Hi-Point handguns absolutely suck, BUT their carbine's are extremely reliable, accurate and well made. Check out the vids on youtube.

GLOCK 17C 3RD GEN -The crown jewel of the lot. This is a GEORGIA MADE Glock 17C with a ported barrel and compensated slide (The 'C' stands for compensated, not compact). It has GA proofs stamped on the frame, slide and barrel. I guarantee you will not ever see another Glock like this one. It has less than 200rds fired thru it. It came with 2 mags, and cleaning brush. I added the stainless steel extended slide release and takedown lever from Ghost, titanium pins, stainless steel guide rod w/recoil buffer, American Flag slide cover plate, and BRAND NEW 2015 TRIJICON NIGHT SITES (green/green). The trigger is completely factory, I don't believe in messing with Glock triggers. The last pic is a stock photo of night shooting with a compensated Glock. Its awesome, you never lose sight of the target :) $800/OBO

If you know your rifles you'll know what this one is. This is a rugged power house. Why lug around the really big and heavy M1As or FALs when you can slam .308 down range with this compact monster? It's an M14/M1A, but in a smaller package that makes it great for hunting/woods walking. I've never experienced a failure to fire or any other issue with this rifle. When I've seen more expensive .308's hiccup this baby cycles any type of .308 round like a champ and slings it with some amazing accuracy. There is also a front rail for mounting scout type optics. The barrel is outfitted with SA's muzzle brake that tames the recoil, when you pull the trigger this gun thunders. 

I am the first owner of this rifle and have had it for only two years. I have taken great care of this thing. There are no blemishes or scratches on the rifle. There are some brass marks on the charging handle near the ejection port, this is normal wear. I have always put a light coat of oil/solvent on this thing and babied it after every range trip. The barrel always was swabbed out and treated. This machine has been taken care of and will last longer than all of us. It will not fail you. You cannot break this thing. Why dink around with polymer wonder snowflake guns when you could throw this thing off a building and it'll keep slinging lead like nothing happened to it?

I will throw in 5 M14 magazines with this rifle. If you search the internet these magazines run around $50 a pop. I also have a bunch of other magazines we can talk about that I have accumulated over the years. These Socom models are starting at like $1500-$1600 not counting the tax you're going to pay. Hit me up with an offer. 

This gun will never let you down. It's hard for me to part with it, but I need to buy Harley parts. But I know this thing will go to a new home. 

You get in this package:
M1A Socom 16
Hard gun case
5 steel milspec M14 magazines (all are 20 rounders, none of that 10 round liberal crap)
Cleaning kit

Willing to ship this to your FFL. Email/text and we can work that out.

Will trade for a Scar 16s  with additional cash

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

I've shot about 250 rounds with it and it's very accurate with 55 and 40 grain rounds. I had a few issues with steel case rounds getting stuck. I've also had a few instances (3 times) where the extractor doesn't catch the rim of the round if I work the bolt to fast. After I got used to working the small bolt a little smoother it never happened again. 

I found the bolt to be a little too small for hands. It would make a great youth rifle and it has proven to be an excellent light hunting rifle.

863,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4191863,For Sale:  Antique Turkish Mauser Model 88/05/35 - 8mm Mauser Caliber NICE,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, June 20, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I took this rifle in trade a while back because of its overall good condition and it's antique status. However I've decided to sell it in order to pursue something a little closer to my true interests.   

It's a Turkish Model 88/05/35 long rifle chambered in 8x57 caliber (8mm Mauser). It was born as a German 1888 Commission Rifle that later went through the 1905 conversion to the 8x57 round. Then sometime between about 1916 and 1918 the Germans sold many of them to Turks who then modified them further in the 1930's and early 1940's with the final result illustrated in the rifle for sale here.   

It's in good to very good condition for it's age with about 75% - 80% of its original finish. There is no pitting on any of the metal surfaces and the wood looks good as well with no cracks or repairs. It's fully functional and actually shoots well. Perhaps the best feature is the bore which is in excellent shape. Rifling is strong and there isn't a bit of rust or darkness. In fact it's actually quite shiny. It's unusual to find a Turk rifle of this vintage with a bright and shiny bore since the ammo they used was very corrosive.   

These rifles were built then underwent two major overhauls so virtually none of them have all matching numbers. In this case the receiver numbers match all the numbers on the sights which is just about as good as it gets. Then the bolt is numbered in Turkish/Arabic which I don't read. So I'm not really sure if it's numberd to match the receiver or not. 

Rifle comes with what appears to be the correct sling for this model of rifle. Additionally there are two Turkish canvas bandoleers that are in excellent condition. Each holds 70 rounds of ammo and each comes with 14 original brass 5 round stripper clips. I shot the ammo which is why it's not included.   

Price is a firm $350 with pickup in the Brandon area. This rifle is a true antique according to ATF guidelines however since it is still fully functional buyer must be at least 18 years old.   

Thanks for looking"

So about the rifle, I was in the process of making it a range rifle it is fun and very cheap to shoot. Some mods I did are: replacing the front sight block, A2 style flash hider, tapco T6 stock, sling swivel stud, bipod, scope and scope mount, simple mods nothing crazy. Other parts and tools I have are: leather ammo pouch (hold 40 rounds), Stripper clips enough for 240 rounds, 8 tapco mags holds 20 rounds each (dbl mod), Chinese sks chest rig modified to hold the tapco dbl mag and a gun case. I also have a muzzle theater. The rifle is a work in progress but almost done all it needs is a better scope and the dbl mag adapter or you could use the stripper clips.

Seek Thermal XR - For iOS Description
The Seek XR is an extended-range version of our award-winning camera.

Specific feedback from law enforcement officers, hunters, boaters, and engineers led to the development of the Seek Thermal XR. The extended range of the Seek XR sees objects twice as far away with the same clarity and resolution as the original Seek camera, and can focus on objects as near as 8 inches for precise, close-up macro imaging.

The Seek XR allows you to literally see heat, making it possible to spot people and animals in daylight, total darkness, or in obscured visibility conditions. This true thermal imaging camera uses the data from over 32,000 thermal pixels to create a visible image on your smartphone. Prior to the Seek Thermal camera, this type of resolution was only available in cameras costing $3,000 and above.

A few common ways to use the Seek XR:
Hunting: Scout terrain, track game, and follow bloodtrails
Boating: Detect and locate harmful objects on the water at night
Safety and Security: Scan a dark parking lot or around your home for danger
Home Inspection: Reliable, non-contact testing and thermography
Electrical Engineering: Inspect components, circuit boards and assemblies.

This is the E26R-9-BSS model with SigLite Night Sights, E2 ergo grip and (2) 15 round mags with case & papers. Please see Sig Sauer's website for additional specs. I have just taken off display and packaged for relocating, while still for sale to reduce inventory.

This is also listed on GunBroker at a higher price due to their fees and policies. If a bid is placed on that site, I will legally have to make the sale, in other words ""first-come, first-serve"".

Price reflects my costs not profit -as I require fast turnover to prepare for relocating.
