In great shape with no issues.  Will come with two 7 round magazines.  Has an excellent trigger as most know and this is the Pro model so it doesn't have the hated magazine disconnect or a manual safety.  
Nothing wrong with it but I'd like to have a Walther PPS so I can have the same manual of arms as my M1 PPQ.  Might also consider an XDs 9mm, recent production Glock 42, or a S&W J frame in 38 special.  Not interested in LCR's.

Im also looking for an optic for my AR15, I'm looking for a 1-4 power scope.  Mainly looking for a Vortex Crossfire II but would consider similar models such as the Burris MTac or Tac 30, Leupold AR1 or similar.  Only other thing I would consider would be a Vortex strikefire and magnifier. Not looking for high magnification scopes.

Prefer to trade but will sell for $380 if you'd rather buy, price is pretty firm.

Taught by instructors who posses not only numerous federal, military, and corporate instructor certifications, but also hold degrees and worked in the Criminal Justice field in law enforcement. Our instructors have real-world court experience which you will benefit from. While many firearms owners have become skilled shooters, the truth is that a high degree of confusion remains as to when the use of deadly force is legally justifiable. With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why both police officers and otherwise law-abiding citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and justified. Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000. Fortunately, the professional instructors at Patriot Training and Consulting can provide you with this information in an easy to understand format. In comparison, the cost of attending either your initial Concealed Carry Handgun training or Legal Issues Refresher training through PatriotTAC is a small investment to help ensure you don’t find yourself on the wrong side of the courtroom.  Summer Special: $75(Normally $90) If you don't think you can learn a lot from a concealed carry course, than this IS the course for you!

Not  sure if this makes sense but the $700 reflects cash price . If you are going to offer me trade it must be worth the same in trade . Meaning since I'm selling it for 700$ I don't want you to try trading me a gun that costs 500$ new and some ammo. I will trade for fair offers we can do it retail to retail or used prices to used prices either way look up what your gun is going for them look up what mine is going for then we can go from there ."

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5? long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics."

CCI Speer 9mm 124 Grain +P Gold Dot Hollow Point

Speer's Gold Dot Hollow Point is one of the best self-defense rounds available today. A top choice of law enforcement agencies across the country, the Gold Dot uses a patented process that forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non-corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.

Be sure of your local laws regarding ammo purchase and possession.

I know there are alot of you that have requested information on this gun due to not being able to find out alot about it.  Some people have sent me messages saying that they want it because has a cool name and they loved Pantera growing up.  I get it... haha....SPS is a spanish (spain) company.  Some say STI copies thier style.  Kinda looks like it doesnt it. SPS pistols display all the attention to detail, precision metal-to-metal fit, high tolerances and quality craftsmanship that one would expect in a custom pistol but with a more affordable price tag than Wilson, Nighthawk, or Les Baer.  SPS are made for competition shooting in IDPA IPSC competitions.  I have never shot tigher groups than I did with this gun with my first and only 13 shots.

.45 ACP single-action, semi-auto pistol is built on a 4140 steel frame with a 4140 hammer-forged steel slide with wide front and rear serrations. Finished in a matte black chrome the SPS Pantera is an attention-getter on the range for looks and for accuracy. The fully-adjustable Bomar-type rear sight and fiber optic dovetailed front sight make sighting in second nature. The Pantera is perfectly balanced in the hand for quick and repeatable target acquisition and shot-after-shot accuracy.

I am looking to trade this gun or sell it for cash. This gun was $1,745 new. They sell for $1,400 with 3000+ rounds thru them all day. I have ONE magazine thru this gun. 13 rounds fired total. Comes with original case, 3 mags, and a tactical Wilson Combat carry bag."

For those unfamiliar with these Colt pistols-this action/lockwork became the Colt Python-they added a target trigger/hammer/barrel to it-the later Troopers have a diff lockwork. This is why these are called the Poor Mans Python. Has 4 inch barrel,adjustable sites,hogue grips and couple speed loaders. Colt quality from a time long past.
