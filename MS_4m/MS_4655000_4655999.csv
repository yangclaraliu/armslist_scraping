This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe Geissele Reaction Rod is a tool that securely holds an upper receiver assembly for maintenance and assembly work. It will make working on an AR15 or M4 carbine a dream. The removal and installation of barrels, flash hiders, gas blocks and hand guards is made much easier and simpler. The Reaction Rod is designed to be gripped in a bench vise so that the rod is either horizontal or vertical. The upper receiver is then slid onto the rod and the rod’s integral splines enter the barrel extension and secure the barrel extension from turning. This allows all the torque from barrel nut wrenches to go directly into the barrel extension. In contrast, receiver vise blocks transmit the turning force into the aluminum receiver, a good part of which passes through the small, easily distorted receiver index pin. With the Geissele Reaction Rod, marring of an upper receiver’s finish by gripping and twisting inside vise blocks is eliminated and so is the need to remove sights and mounts from the receiver’s M1913 rail. The Geissele Reaction Rod is machined at Geissele Automatics’ state of the art manufacturing facility in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The rod is cut from a solid bar of 4140 Chrome Moly steel, properly quenched/tempered and ground to an exact diameter.

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comFlashlights attached to shoulder-mounted weaponry are a necessary requirement for urban warfare. Until now, attempting to use a tactical flashlight in conjunction with a vertical foregrip resulted in three scenarios: 1. Purchase an expensive combination vertical foregrip/flashlight. 2. While trying to maintain a grip on the vertical foregrip, attempt an uncomfortable and dangerous rotation of the grip hand to try to get the thumb high enough to engage the rear of the flashlight typically mounted at the three o'clock or nine o'clock position (strong left shooter). 3. Use an expensive and somewhat messy pig tail with a pressure pad glued to the foregrip or forearm that could hang you up at a critical time. GG&G's staff has solved the problem of interfacing a vertical foregrip with a weapon-mounted flashlight by creating The Offset Tactical Flashlight Mount For Use With Vertical Foregrips. It places the tactical flashlight, offset to the right or left of the weapon's forearm at about 5 o'clock or 7 o'clock, respectively. This permits the operator to manipulate with the thumb, the illuminator's rocker switch laser button or rear pressure button of other tactical flashlights, while the support hand remains solidly on the vertical foregrip. The Offset Tactical Flashlight Mount For Use With Vertical Foregrips comes complete with both the Glock style and MIL-ST-1913 rails. The Glock style rail can be easily removed and a short section of MIL-STD-1913 rail installed for attaching a Surefire or other small flashlight by means of a standard ring. The mounting rails are fully interchangeable. It is a lightweight accessory-only 2.7 ounces. The Offset Tactical Flashlight Mount For Use With Vertical Foregrips can be mounted on the GG&G UFIR, or any of the GG&G Tactical Modular Forearms, or any other integrated rail system. This ambidextrous mount is attached by means of a squeeze rail. Manufactured from aircraft grade 6061 billet aluminum alloy, it has been Type III hard-coat anodized per mil-spec in a matte black combat finish. The Offset tactical flashlight mounts from GG&G are made in the USA at our Tucson AZ factory. When purchasing any part that mounts on to your gun you want to make sure it fits perfectly as per mil spec standards, and it isn't going to rattle or move later on. On an AR-15, M16, or M4, stealth and surprise are essential, and accuracy is paramount. Rifle light mounts from GG&G are made from top grade materials because they are used in the field by military and police units who can't compromise the tactical advantage that comes with the right equipment.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G OFFSET TACTICAL FLASHLIGHT MOUNT, INCLUDES BOTH RAILS"

I really thought I could find a right hand bolt but I'm not having much luck. The gun is awesome everything I expected it to be but shooting left handed is something I don't entirely enjoy. I'm not sure on the round count from the looks of the gun it appears to be very low. And the overall condition is in very good shape. It will come with 10 mags total, 5 10 round, 3 20 round and 2 30 round mags. It also has the msar 1.5 power scope on it which is rather impressive and it also has irons on top of the scope which is super convenient and I wouldn't of even noticed them had they not been pointed out to me. Anyways asking is 1350$ let me know if you have any questions

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.Chambering.40 S&WMagazine Capacity10Magazine TypeDouble StackFrameAluminum (7075 T6)GripsRubberTrigger MechDA/SASightsFixed Night SightsBarrelCold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length3.88 inWeight1.82 lbsOverall Length7.2 inHeight5.31 inWidth1.38 in"

If you are reading this, you are obviously looking for one badass piece of American fire power. The 1911 has been used to hunt Commies, Nazi's and terrorists since well... 1911. This particular piece has been carried, no doubt about it. I have carried this baby for a little over a year now, and put several hundred flawless rounds through it. I am not the original owner, so she has brought shooting joy to others as well. She comes with 3 mags, factory night sights (dim, but still usable), 20 flying ashtrays... I mean defense rounds (Winchester PDX1) and 70 rounds or assorted range ammo, a Blackhawk CQC holster (which stands for close quarters combat, which makes your Ops even blacker), a soft pistol case, and some houge wrap around grips. I don't really want to get rid of her, but I think she is ready to move on to a new America loving patriot."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting."

	Hey all, 
	I have for trade or sale a awesome little entry Level AR. I got this as a compact option that would shoot my reloads for my longer range AR great (same rate of twist, chambering, and maker) but something has come up so I really need to sell or trade it off for something else. This is currently unfired and is ready to make someone a great little rifle. This has a Stainless 16 inch barrel in 223 Wylde with a 1:8 twist and A2 Flash hider. It is based on an Anderson Lower and has dust cover, shell deflector, and forward assist. It has a free floated Aluminum quad rail and a 6 position mil spec Blackhawk stock. It will also come with a  set of flip up polymer sights and a Magpul Windowed Pmag and the ladder covers you can see in the pictures. For any specifics please shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in Norman on this if possible. 
	I would also consider trades, but mainly need cash so most trades would need cash on your end (unless it is something i really am interested in). I would consider trades towards 1894C in 357 magnum, SP101s, Security Sixs, GP100s, M1 Carbines, Glock 17 with Threaded Barrel, XDM 9mm with threaded barrel, Under-folder AK, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. Like i said, most trades that I am interested in will need cash on your end, but if it is something I’m heavily interested in I may consider straight trades or even add extras on my end. I also have a  fair amount of 50r Poly tip 223 ammo if you would like to purchase some as well.
