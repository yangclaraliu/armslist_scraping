Well, here is your chance.......
This Smith & Wesson SW1911, 45 ACP, full size, ALL STAINLESS, yeah ok, it's not as pretty as those other ones on Armslist, 

You know the ones,  they say it cost $1500  and that its never been shot......really?, he buys a $1500 gun and just sits around admiring it? Sure.......Right!

Well, this SW1911 has been shot, but if it's true that it takes 500 rounds to break it in....this isn't broke in yet. But, it has resided in a holster long enough to ""mark its territory"". I won't lie to you, I don't count rounds, but I know how much money I spend.

So I would like a smaller 45, so if you want a bigger one......maybe we can both get a new toy. I would place the trade value at $750, but I am not interested in selling."

This rifle literally has 60 rounds through it and it in overall excellent condition. The only reason I wish to sell it is because I bought it strictly as a fun gun but since moving to the city, don't have a good place to take it out and shoot (as evidenced by the round count). I pretty much just shoot pistols now, since thankfully there are indoor ranges around. Anyway, I figure I need the cash more than a rifle just sitting around.

With the rifle, I am selling all of its accessories plus ammo.

The ammo is 440 rds of Federal American Eagle .223 55gr FMJ. It will come in a green plastic plano ammo box - most of it in 20rd boxes with 30 or so rounds loose in the ammo box from where I had kept a loaded mag.

This is the ammo:

All the gear and the rifle are in either new or excellent condition and I have the original smith & wesson cardboard box the rifle came in with the manual.

Asking 1000 which I think for everything included is more than fair. I will hear reasonable offers and negotiate. I'm in no hurry to sell though."

Here is the story, I sent in a different Simmons scope for repair and it could not be fixed. Simmons sent this scope as a replacement because they no longer make the type scope that I had. Even though it is a very nice scope, it does not meet my intended requirements. Therefore I’m selling it. This is brand new in the box with all paperwork and it under factory warranty and has never even been mounted.
Even though this is a shotgun scope, it can be also used on rifles, but not handguns.

I've owned it for about 2 years and meant for it to be my concealed carry gun. Unfortunately, never came to be so the gun has pretty much been a safe queen. I had some trijicon HD night sights ($130 just for the sights) installed on day 1 and they look great easy to see at night and day because of the black ledge and orange front dot. The gun has seen maybe 200-300 rounds as it got quite expensive to shoot .45 for me. I cleaned it after every range visit. Gun is immaculate with all original paperwork, accesories, and case.

Star - Firestar M43 LNIB! 9mmThis Pistol is Cool!

The Star M-43 Firestar (also called the Star Firestar M-43) is a single-action semi-automatic pistol that received the 1991 Handgun of the Year Award from Guns & Ammo magazine. The Firestar was available in 9 mm Para, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP calibers. It was produced by the now defunct Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. in Eibar, Spain until 1994. The Firestar was imported into the United States by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia.

Although its external appearance resembles a compact M1911, the Firestar is different in several respects. For example, the Firestar does not have the 1911's grip safety. The Firestar's safety features include an automatic safety at the firing pin (a feature not included in the 1911's original design but often found in more modern 1911 variants). The Firestar has operating procedures analogous to those of the Colt 1911: it is single action, and meant to be carried in Condition One (cocked and locked), with a cartridge in the chamber, cocked hammer and locked manual safety.

The Firestar is a compact, reliable and accurate handgun well-suited for backup or concealed carry. Its single-stack design sacrifices the superior magazine capacity of a double-stack, but permits a slim profile prized by many for concealed carry. While heavier than more modern handguns of comparable size made with today's composite materials, many shooters find the added heft provides a more stable shooting platform that improves accuracy."

For sale/trade is a hi-point 9mm carbine with some extra doodads-

3 OEM 10 round magazines
Rail mounted pressure switch flashlight
NCstar tactical sight, which has 4 different reticle options
Stock magazine carrier
Sling swivels

Selling because I bought a new pistol caliber carbine. Condition of the rifle is very good, no excessive blue loss or scratching or anything like that. Kept in safe. I do not have the original iron sights.  I bought this awhile ago, and its a fun little blaster. Nice to take to an indoor pistol only range, as it shoots 9mm. Cheap to feed, runs fine, ect.

$240 for all of it or trade for something another firearm of similar value. These go for around $300 new. So at $240 you are getting a pretty good deal, particularly with the extra magazines and whatnot.

If interested, please call or text me at REDACTED.

Located in Norman, OK. Willing to drive a short distance for the right deal (within 15-20miles) Face to face transaction only, please. Please be of age, no felons, ect!

Springfield XDM 4.5"" Standard
4.5"" XDM 40S&W W/ OD Green Frame and Black Finish

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots.

The adjustments on the turrets are solid. The PST has high, uncapped turrets. Adjustment is made via ¼ MOA clicks. These clicks are both audible and tactilely crisp. You can feel them, even through gloves.

The warranty is fully transferable. If your scope breaks, they'll take care of it. If you buy a Vortex PST second-hand from someone and it breaks, Vortex will take care of it. If you accidentally drop your rifle while in the tree stand and your PST breaks on a rock. . . you guessed it. Vortex will take care of it. They'll repair or replace your scope.

It's about a year old. I am the original owner. I bought it QC inspected from Atlantic ($580+tax and transfer I believe) so I knew I'd get a good one as a base to make great. It's had one mag fired through it on five different occasions (so, five mags). It was broken down and cleaned thouroughly after each time it was fired. 

Here is a list of the upgrades:

-Professionally Cerakoted Gray (internal/external receiver, chamber, external barrel, and internal/external trigger for low maintenance)
-Professionally Cerakoted Black top cover
-Professionally Molecular Dry Film Lube coated bolt and carrier (for less oil needed, and ease of maintenance)
-Magpul Grip installed
-Custom ""shorty"" Magpul VFG installed 
-Custom extended FDE rail covers installed
-Custom (custom ordered directly from Midwest with custom parts) Midwest Industiries Extended rail system
-Professionaly custom fit ACE Riflestocks rear trunion adapter
-Professionally fit ACE Riflestocks ""Pig"" receiver extension adapter (any AR-15 buffer tube can be used, so any MILSPEC or Commercial AR stock can be used)
-Professionally fit (trimmed and fit so there were no gaps between the receiver and stock) BCM buffer tube
-Real (not a knock-off or fake) LMT SOPMOD Gen 1 stock
-Griffin Industries Professionally fit (so there's no rattle) Muzzle brake/Flash hider
-Professionally deburred and polished internals before coating so the action is buttery smooth
-Includes Magpul AK mag (pictured) the original steel mag, and the original TAPCO mag that came with it new. 
-Barrel is perfectly straight, no cant, no crazy front sight pushed all the way to one side. 

Comes out to be about $1K worth of fit and finish work (on top of the cost of the rifle) to get it to its fullest potential. A lot of attention to the details here. 

it's sighted in and ready to go, nice and accurate. 

Magpul mags DO NOT rock in the receiver at all (solid), lesser mags move a little bit but DO NOT affect function like some WASR's. Trigger is crisp and crazy smooth (about a 4-6lb pull, very nice break). Everything is solid and ""play"" free, except where it needs to be. 

No surprises or shortcomings, I'd take this over all of the Arsenal AK's I've seen lately. Only thing that would surpass it (base quality wise) would be a nice VEPR (twice the price if you can find one converted and threaded). Buy with confidence. 

I don't mind driving a little ways to meet up. I'm not in any hurry to sell. If you're close to me I have no problem letting you check it out before you buy (it sells itself in person).  I'm asking $750 for Christmas. I would move a little bit on the price, but please, do not contact me asking if I'll take $650....I will not.  

Please, text messages are preferred anytime between 0900-12:00am. 614-477-8four5three. I can also text more pictures if you like. 

Thank you."

Sometimes it will stove pipe, sometimes it won't extract.  To me it sounds like the gas port is undersized but I don't have the time or patience to deal with it.
