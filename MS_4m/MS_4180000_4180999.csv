This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. The shaky Spanish Economy is well publicized. As a direct result of that, here is a discovery from the reserve stock rooms of the Spanish Guardia of only a couple hundred factory Star Magazines to fit the legendary Star model B series pistols. These magazines are original Star production, and many of them are so marked on their floor plates. Manufacturer is the now defunct Star Echeverria Company of Eibar, Spain. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of their double or two piece catch floor plates to their stepped steel cartridge followers. Each magazine holds 9 rounds of standard 9mm ammunition; 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. These are manufactured for the Star Model B Pistols with slotted front grip frames like the grip frame showing in our photos from a 1953 Israeli Police issued model B. These will not fit non-slotted Model Bs, manufactured after around 1965 without modifying them by bending their floorplates. We have other magazines listed on this venue for the non-slotted B, BS, and Super B Star Pistols. This one ain’t it. These magazines are not easy to find, and this is a one-time deal. Photos show representatives from the same lot, and the buyer will receive a magazine from the exact same lot as the photo specimens. Surface detractions are minimal, only etchy toning here and there on some of the magazines surfaces, and occasionally Spanish Guardia 3 or 4 digit identification numerals. We rate all of them as Very Good, or even Excellent, finishwise. The Guardia Police Armorers wisely stored them in well-greased condition. Original period correct factory Star magazines for the slotted Star Bs are high and in short supply worldwide. Many sellers ask upwards of $75 apiece for them. We’re offering the 1940s Star B Factory magazine in the photos, or its substantially identical mates from the same lot each for only $ 45.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

This is a rare model which only comes up for sale or trade maybe once a year on eBay.  The last one sold for $799 and was not nearly in as good as shape as mine. 

I have owned the guitar since the early 90's. It is in great shape and contains all original equipment, as far as I know, pups, knobs, etc. If you have played a Vantage, you will know that this was top of the line. It is a true neck-through with walnut and ash, all hardware is solid brass. It has 24 frets with very little wear. Serial number is 10xxxx.

The pictures show minimal dings and scratches. The only piece missing is a brass plate which covers the battery box. I put a piece of plastic over it which suited my needs.

I will also include an Ibanez plush case if the trade is right, worth around $75.

Let me know if you are interested. Email only please.

Not only is Front Sight the biggest provider for high-quality firearms training with more than 28 (!) gun ranges on their grounds, but you will learn to gain more skills than most law enforcement or even some military personnel have!

That's not the greatest part about this, though! Your Diamond Membership will actually be FOR LIFE! That means that you will be able to return and take courses as often as you wish! Yes, if the classes have availability, you could stay there a full month and go through everything they offer without paying a penny more!

Beside their Defensive Handgun, Defensive Shotgun, Rifle and Submachine Gun classes, they also offer an Empty Hand Combat class and a Rappeling class or even some kids classes, with more stuff to come! Again, ALL of these classes will be open to you for $250. That is a ONE-TIME fee you will never be paying again, because you are now a preferred life-time member! When you are in, you are in!

Now, here is where it gets really exciting! I do have some BONUSES for the first 4 people ONLY!

Once you sign up and paid the $250 dollars, you will get the following!

5 Certificates good for a
Two Day Handgun, Shotgun or Rifle Course...
(Transferable to ANY of your friends or family. HECK, if you wish you can sell 'em and make your money right back!)

5 Certificates good for a Four Day Handgun,
Shotgun or Rifle Course...
(Transferable to ANY of your friends or family. Yup, this stuff as well...SELL them and make you money right back! You now got all of this for free! I have not believed it myself until I actually invested in this and went to a class.)

2 Free Gun Rental Certificates...

10 Diamond Lifetime Memberships
to sell or transfer to any non-member you wish...

So, here is the deal! If you get ONE other person to come with you to a course and they buy a Diamond membership from you! You will have made your money back and you have now basically become a life-time member for FREE! I know, it is insane! But as long as these guys are still able to offer these incredible memberships, it would be outright stupid to not take advantage of it. Considering that most single handgun trainings are already costing double of the membership price.

Like I mentioned, the first 4 will get the BONUS stuff! After that, I will still be giving out the memberships, but without the BONUS certificates, etc.

So, really....this is a no-brainer! It's $250! So, don't waste time. Send me an email and we can get you signed up today!

I will take this offer down as soon as I get word from Front Sight, because quite honestly, they will pull this very soon, since they are doing this to get the last bit of money for the resort they are currently building! Yes, you heard right! Soon you will be able to go to Front Sight, do your firearms training, walk down to the resort, jump in the pool and have a great dinner!

And in the meantime, if you are really quick, I am actually going out there with a couple of friends in April! So, you could join us for that as well!

Alright, enough said. If you don't send me an email right now and get this set up, I honestly cannot help you. You are too good at talking yourself out of a good thing!

I'll talk to you later!

Please refer to pics for overall condition of the rifle. Sale or trade. Please, no endless emails or texts. I'm not asking much in the way of cash or trade.

The wood on this gun is absolutely beautiful. You won't be disappointed with this gun. It's already sighted in and ready to go target shooting or hunting with the 5rd magazine. This gun shoots the cost effective and available 7.62x39mm ammo that will easily take down a deer or wild pig in Oklahoma. This gun will out shoot any other 7.62x39mm gun out on the market easily. Two Rivers Arms is well known for their quality and workmanship, so you know that you're getting a quality gun. If you think an AK can't shoot very well, then you'll change your mind after shooting this gun. I have put approx. 300 rounds down the barrel on this gun without any problems."

Guy's, when these deals come up you have to jump on them. Often times people low ball on these sites. Some people think they are trying to get a deal when in reality they miss out. I got a few messages from people who wanted $100 off my asking price. The gun was already priced at dealer cost, $50-$80 off retail. Even if they would have found the same gun for $50 less on the net they would have had to pay tax, brady, shipping and a transfer fee. All that adds up, keep this stuff in mind when you are looking for deals. Don't miss out by trying to be too greedy on the low balling. And if you are a seller, don't be greedy either. Do some research when buying and selling! Be fair all the way around."

This can take ANY game in North America.

Here is why it is listed as new:
It is ready to hunt! Only taken out of the box to be put together by expert hands--we have fired the bow only enough to zero it in! (4 shots) You aim somewhere, you're gonna nail that son of a gun dead on MOA @ 20, 30, 40, 50+ yards. What you're basically getting is a ready to hunt or practice crossbow that is scoped and zeroed.

I also added amazing features to make the bow even better:
* Parker silencers installed, these quiet the already silent bow more! Already professionally installed by me, these are amazing (50+ dollar value)
*Parker EZ-Cock rope roller, a high quality tool to cock your bow smoothly (-50% effort), this tool will not scratch your bow like other rope cockers, and has already been adjusted to match the bow! (50+ dollar value)

That is why this crossbow is brand new, but simply made ready. 
The value of the bow (Unzeroed, without additions, not assembled) stands at $599!
I am willing to let this package go, with original box, packaging, and handbook, go for a simple payment of $500.

Why? Wife me let it go before the first hunt, while it is still friggin' new. Act soon and I will also throw in two free tubes of parker string wax and barrel lube. Hunt today with this amazing tool that I am sad to let go. Thanks for viewing!  Will deliver when buying at asking price!"

Paint is an obvious problem, and cruise control and odometer does not work. Just looking for something a little smaller. Gets 17-19mpg.

Here's what Im looking for...
I want to buy some kind of .25 acp or .32 acp pocket pistol. Old or new it doesn't matter, I dont care if it's in perfect new-in-box condition or if it looks like you dragged it behind your truck for 10 miles. AS LONG AS IT SHOOTS (and does so fairly reliably) I want it! I'd like to have at least one magazine with it and sights on it. I am kind of on a tight budget but If I say I will buy your gun I mean it, I don't take promises lightly so I won't flake out on you as long as you don't flake on me. I have some things I can trade if you'd like, like a pretty nice wood recurve bow (no string), in great condition. Wife or GF's birthday coming up? I make jewelry. I do stippling too, so if you want to make your polymer frame gun more grippy I can do that for you too! I can send pictures of what I just mentioned if you want so don't hesitate to ask! 

Id like for the gun to be around $250. No more than $275 please. I'll pay the transfer fees of course."

Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero.

This rifle is absolutely brand new, never fired, never loaded, never chambered. There is not one single scratch anywhere on the rifle, including the internals since it's as new as you can get. The rifle comes with the box, 1 20 round mag from factory and everything from the factory. Reason for selling is I couldn't help myself and bought a Wilson Combat X-tac from Tampa's Shoot Straight, I've always had a weak spot for 1911s especially that one. Asking $2800 for the rifle, which I believe it's very reasonable since these rifles generate a lot of interest. Located in Gainesville but I travel to Orlando twice a week to attend school at UCF so I can meet anywhere in between Gainesville and Orlando.

Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot."

Official RWC Group LLC Saiga AK Upgrade! Comes from RWC with all shown upgrades!

Kalashnikov Concern’s new tricked-out Saiga

This rifle comes complete with a full compliment of premium 922(r)-compliant upgrades for the U.S. market. These rifles have been “converted” and have standard controls and a standard trigger group.

The new IZ132SM takes the popular IZ132 base rifle and builds it into a totally modern tactical rifle that’s good to go with aftermarket and surplus magazines.

Partnering with Command Arms, the IZ132SM features a rubberized pistol grip, modular railed handguard and modular telescoping buttstocks.

The handguard has two fixed rails on top and underneath and can be fit with additional rails on the sides. The design allows the handguard to be removed in the traditional way for cleaning and doesn't require disassembly like some rail systems.

The 10-position buttstock has a compartment for batteries or other small parts and comes with an extended rubber buttpad for all-day shooting and has multiple loop and quick-detach mounting points for slings.

One final nice touch is the installation of a standard muzzle device. It comes with a modern AK flash hider/brake/compensator.
