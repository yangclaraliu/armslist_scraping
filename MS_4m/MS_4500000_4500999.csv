This is 1990 HK SR9 in TC configuration. Purchased as an SR9 with a genuine HK PSG trigger, grip and stock and forestock added. As far as I know, the bipod may not be genuine HK, but is a very high quality replica. As accurate as you can get in an HK91 format without dropping $15k or more on a PSG. This has the enhanced buffer and polygonal rifling. Comes with 4 mags, the original pre-ban stock and the SWFA 10x42 mildot scope is included. What you see in the picture is exactly what you get. This is a genuine pre-ban HK, they are rare and valued continue to escalate. Extremely low round count and maintained by a military armorer. This is not your run-of-the-mill HK91, it has a precision polygonal barrel, enhanced buffer and will shoot sub MOA with match ammo and the shooter doing their part."

Action is smooth as butter.  I have the large loop lever currently installed, but I still have the regular sized lever it came with.  The large loop lever is a Henry factory accessory ($50 value) that comes in handy if you have large hands or are wearing gloves.  Both levers are included in the sale.  I have the box, papers, and everything it came with, so it will be like buying it new.

It is in excellent condition.  I have babied this gun.  The only signs of use are some light marks next to the ejection port where some ejected cases deflected on their way out.  This is inevitable and comes with use.  

Included in this deal is 100 rounds of factory new 357 Mag ammo ($50 value).  

Selling all of it for $700 cash.  Face to face sales only in NWA.  Must be an Arkansas resident of legal age to purchase this firearm and not have any legal restrictions from owning it.  I will require that you sign a bill of sale acknowledging this.  If you refuse to sign, then no sale.  This will be a deal breaker with me.

Features Buffalo horn handles and solid brass liners. This knife was purchased new by me in Tijuana, Mexico in 1989 or 1990, so it's already 25 years old. It's a real Italian made automatic, not some cheap copy.  The blade is marked ""J INOX"" and ""Made In Italy"" on the other side. I've never seen another switch marked this way and the currently made Italians don't have the ""J"".  It has never been carried or cut anything but has some corrosion on the backspring from handling it I guess. Opens fast and opens properly every time. Makes a great conversation piece or letter opener but it's a real knife, not a toy. This is pretty much the largest size one can comfortably carry. Check my other listings for similar knives. I'm new on this site but have been selling on Ebay for 12 years, I will be happy to tell buyers my user name there so they can check me out. I have about 8 Italian switchblades that I'll be selling, all very nice knives. Thanks for looking!"

The short trigger reset and tridium night sights make this a weapon of choice for personal carry. I used this as my daily carry until i received orders to move to California, which restricts this weapon.

I have maintained this firearm to perfection, I have only put 150 - 200 rounds through it. I have never had a miss-feed or failure to extract. Selling this firearm saddens me a little, it has been an amazing tool. 

I am asking full price for this weapon for several reasons, I am including 5 loaded magazines, SERPA holster, and the carrying case. I will also include 50 extra rounds, to get you going to the range. The shot groups will amaze you, i promise. 

I will send you pictures by email, all the pictures i have are too large to upload on this website."

Beretta 92 FS Centurion 9mm, Double/single action with safety and decocker. Good condition, low round count.  This model differs from the standard 92 FS, it combines the full size frame with a compact barrel and slide but still accepts the standard magazines.  These are no longer produced, this pistol was manufactured in 1996, these were only manufactured from 1992-1998.  The pistol has all metal parts unlike newer production that has some polymer parts (trigger, safety, guide rod etc).  This is Brady Ban era gun so it comes with original case and two 10 round magazines but can accept the 15 and 18 rounders currently produced.  Located in Louisville, not interested in traveling.  Must be a Ky resident over 21 with valid state issued ID."

The TalonP is NOT silenced & does not have baffles

Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.

Most dot sights have Weaver mounts. If you choose one of them, remember to pick up AirForce's 11mm-to-Weaver adapter listed in the accessories link.

The AirForce TalonP PCP pistol is heavier than most air pistols and cannot be comfortably held the way most pistols are held and still result in reliable, repeatable accuracy. A comfortable hold is with one hand on the pistol grip and the other holding the top of the scope. If you assume a sitting position, you can hold the grip with one hand and rest the gun's forearm on your off hand's forearm. These two positions will draw the pistol much closer to your eye, and you can mount a rifle scope on the TalonP air pistol. A pistol scope could also be mounted, but there are more choices among rifle scopes.

The AirForce TalonP air pistol is one of the most powerful air pistols made today. Delivering over 50 ft-lbs of energy in .25 caliber, the TalonP is the ultimate compact hunting weapon and is easily carried in the field.

Take small and medium quarry with this airgun at distances you'd never normally use with any other air pistol. However, power is nothing without accuracy, and the AirForce Lothar Walther barrels are known for being deadly accurate. The TalonP is equipped with the same 12"" Lothar Walther barrel available for their hunting rifles, so you can expect to get the same small groups. This pistol can be fitted with other AirForce barrels in .20 or .22 caliber. However, you cannot mount a .177-caliber barrel as it will cause the reservoir to exhaust all the air.

The power wheel lets you adjust your velocity for whatever distance you shoot and for the type of critter you want to hunt."

I bought this rifle at a gun show in the spring, dealer said this was the nicest Mosin in the batch by far. Patina still has a nice luster, the wood in sunshine has a nice red glow to it. Bluing on all the metal is very nice, a few small nicks and couple minor scratches in the wood, (you'll have that this thing was in WW2). 99% of the cosmoline is gone, bolt is in great shape, chamber and barrel are also in very nice shape (no rust or pitting). All the serial numbers match up, so everything is correct there. I shot about 50 rounds through it and the irons are dead nuts at about 50 yards. 

I purchased it for $260 bucks, these carbines are tougher to find and this ones in awesome condition. I hate to sell it but I need the extra cash, my loss your gain. I bought the following parts:

1) Limb saver butt pad (makes this rifle feel like a .223) - $40
2) 6 round sleeve - $15
3) original sling - $10

I don't expect to get the full $325 I have into her but $280 is more than reasonable. Call/text me at 440- nine one five - 1941, my name's Brian."

I had it listed a couple months back and had a couple offers to buy it (if you were one of them give me a call), but I just couldn't bring myself to sell it and take such a big hit-but hey,situations change. I've never even seen a P-01 with work done on by Cajun Gun Works listed here, yet alone at this price-they're not too easy to come by period. The guys at CGW know CZ's-ask most anyone.
I called Dave at CGW shortly after acquiring the pistol and was told it was originally about a $1K pistol with all the work done on it so I feel the price is very fair indeed.I traded a new/unfired pistol I had paid about $1100 for it(a Springfield EMP .40).It will come with a Fobus paddle holster, a High Noon belt slide holster and three sets of grips.
Pistol has about 350-400 rounds thru it.The previous owner bought it direct from Cajun Gun Works who worked a little of their legendary magic on it before selling it.They installed a 85C combat trigger,their race hammer, did a trigger job on it with new springs,extended firing pin,etc.A set of nice,slim composite grips were installed by previous owner that are less ""tacky"" and slimmer, but original grips will be included as well as all the stock parts.This P-01 has the decocker instead of the manual safety-which I prefer.It also has the NATO (NSN) # on the side.
WI residents ONLY,no criminal records-must have either a CCL ( I do), or a new WI DOJ background check.If the latter I will need the number they issue you when it's completed so I can verify.Also have a valid WI I.D. and sign a bill of sale.
Trades considered (9mm only)- if it also includes some cash on your end.
I'm disabled and can't drive so I can't come to you but can arrange a public meeting area.
The P-01 is listed locally and elsewhere and subject to being pulled at any time.

It has FDE Key Mod chassis system and has two caliber kits, 300 Blackout and 6.8 SPCII and has the FAST STOCK (Foldable and adjustable cheek rest).  So it is basically two rifles in one and they have about four additional caliber kits available for the XCR-L and they are simple to change out.  This is truly a modular firearm system unlike the SCAR or the Bushmaster ACR.  Also unlike the SCAR it takes AR15 magazines and the left hand charging handle does not reciprocate as the rifle fires.  

Please take a look at Robinson Armament Website to get all the details on their rifles.  This is my second rifle from them and I have had great customer service and I have never needed a part. 

This rifle retails for $2k without the extra 6.8 SPCII caliber conversion kit (call for their current pricing on rifles, conversion kits and wait times).  

This rifle is unique and is not one that you see everyday on the range or for sale.  Here is what you get:

1. XCR-L chassis system in FDE
2. 300 blackout conversion kit w bolt and 16 inch barrel
3. 6.8 SPC II conversion kit w bolt and 16 inch barrel
4. Fast Stock - 6 position adjustable with adjustable cheek rest
5. Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot scope with mount and 3x magnifier

Is used and has been carried and shot but is in great shape with a fairly low round count.  This is the M1 model with the paddle mag release which I've really come to like.  The PPQ also has arguably the best striker fired trigger on the market.  This one will come in its factory case and will come with three 15 round magazines. 

It's been one of my absolute favorite handguns but I'm getting married soon, so with my gun budget getting locked out soon I'm adjusting my priorities. I'm looking for something more compact and easier to carry.  Primarily looking for a Gen 4 Glock 26 with a matching number of mags. Would prefer the Glock but would also consider a Springfield XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm, also with a matching number of mags.  I can also include the leather/kydex iwb holster pictured for a similar holster, extra mags, or ammo.  Also have an Alien Gear Cloak Slide holster in transit for it I could work into the deal for something. 

These are the only two trades I'm really looking for right now, absolutely not interested in rifles or shotguns right now. 
I have my ccl, if interested feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853, texts preferred.

This is not the standard sps tactical with heavy bull barrel, it is also fluted which to my knowledge is harder to find. Barrel is 20"" long, comes with 1in10 twist and all the metal on this rifle is in a black matte parkerized finish. Stock is the black Hogue rubberized overmold  stock. Comes with a heavy duty solid base one piece DNZ scope mount. And it also comes with a cheaper CenterPoint scope which is a 4-16x44 optic with sun shade and flip open caps. I dedicated my good glass to other projects I have. However for a cheaper set of glass, this scope is pretty solid. It has held zero since the initial sight in of this rifle. Factory adjustable trigger. Also included is a padded sling with shell holder loops. This rifle is the short action and holds 4+1 rounds.  Comes with original box and paperwork. Very sweet shooting gun with superb accuracy for a stock shooter. It really likes 168 grain bullets the best but it will handle 150 to 180 grain bullets just fine also. It will take other weights but that is all I personally expiremented with. 250 rounds down the tube and it was properly broken in. What you see is what you get. I work Monday through Friday's on the road and will post pictures when I get home tonight. Also on that note, I am only available to show on Saturdaysand Sundays. Over $900 invested, asking $850 or best offer. Not looking for trades."

For sale today is an Egyptian Maadi AK47.  This rifle appears to have been modified for import purposes.  It has no flash hider, and the rear of the receiver was modified for the stock it presently has.

It performs flawlessly and is surprisingly accurate.  It will include a 30-round steel magazine.

Price is $500 firm.

Please note, you probably won't get another stock installed on it unless you do a little bit of work.  However, the rest of it appears to be AK standard, so if you plan to change the gas cover for one with a rail, etc., it should be the same as any other AK"

LESS THAN 100 RDS FIRED!!! GREAT CLEAN CONDITION!!!
At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

Chambered for .380 ACP, the lightweight sub-compact pistol features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, maximum corrosion resistant coated stainless steel slide and barrel. The new M&P BG380 is standard with a 2 ¾ inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 5 ¼ inches and an unloaded weight of only 11.85 ounces. Additional standard features include a rapid second-strike capability, thumb safety, take-down lever and stainless steel drift adjustable sights.

A Spanish made reproduction, Santa Barbara has been around for around 500 years and is the primary weapons maker for the Spanish military. They stopped making the Remington 1858 model about 25 years ago. It was made from the best steel and is the finest of the reproductions. It is far superior to the Italian reproductions. To put it simply they are the best you can buy.

This is a fun shooter. No issues with it, runs fast & accurate. Spits out all ammo including the aluminum case stuff. Oh it didnt like the super big hole hollow points, cant think of the brand... it would fail to feed. It shoots the Federal Hydrashoks just fine.

NO TRADES!!!!!
 I am selling my Ruger Super Redhawk 44 mag with a 9.5"" barrel. It holds 6 rounds. It also has Leupold 2X Extended Eye Relief Scope. The gun is all stainless steel and it has an adjustable rear factory sight. I have owned this gun a couple years now, but I have never shot it. To be honest I need some space in my safe and this thing takes up a lot!

 Previous owner looks like it was fired but very lightly. The gun is in excellent condition!!

 $700 FIRM NOT A PENNY LESS
 No offers please! Remember I am including a Top of the line Leupold Scope 

 I also have the Uncle Mikes over the shoulder Holster made for this monster with the scope, its made to hold this gun with a scope. This are hard to find and expensive. If you want this too, add $40 FIRM. NO I WILL NOT INCLUDE IT!

The G43 is GLOCK's new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.

Cavalry troopers were armed with the new revolvers. Lawmen and outlaws alike were quick to adopt the handy new 6-shooter which earned the nickname “Peacemaker.”The single-action Army was most widely produced with a color case-hardened frame and blued barrel. Meanwhile, a nickel-plated version was issued to Indian scouts. And a bright charcoal blue finish was available from the factory. But with years of use, the old 6-guns took on a well-handled soft gray patina. All of these classic finishes are available in the 1873 Cattleman.COME DOWN AND CHECK THIS OUT ASK FOR HEATHER AND SHE WILL ALSO GET YOU A FREE BOX OF AMMO AS WELL AS A SOFT CARRYING CASE.

8 magazines included

Tru-glo red dot sight included

Gun is for sale simply because I have acquired more than I can enjoy regularly, so I'm interested in some other toys.
Red dot site is co-witnessed with front sight for easy target acquisition.
7 of the mags are standard 10 rnd, and one is a 15 rnd.
Purchased about a year ago, gun has been fed hundreds of rounds with ZERO failures.

If you are interested in buying, we could meet at a range so you could try it out, no problem.
However please, do not contact me simply to offer up a lower price...sight unseen. I'm pricing it low enough, considering the extras that are included.

Up for sale is a new (<100 rnds.) 1911 made by RIA/Armscor. The technical designation is CS Tactical, chambered in the ever popular 9mm Parabellum cartridge. It has all the bells and whistles you would want in a carry 1911: Wilson internals (recoil spring, mainspring, sear spring, assembly pins, short pull trigger) Ed Brown ""chainlink"" mainspring housing, combat sights, beavertail high grip safety and VZ grips. This spring set up has the trigger breaking at a perfect 3.6lbs. The pistol has also been duracoated HK black. The slide to frame, mainspring to frame, and grip safety to frame fitting is all very well done... pics just don't do this piece any justice. Included with the pistol will be the original box/carry case, lock and two 8rnd mags.

If you were to build this pistol yourself you would invest well over $650; you can purchase this beauty for $500. Not looking to trade.

I'll even throw in 40 rnds of 147Gr Golden Sabre ($50 value) if you don't haggle me on this more than reasonable price.
