The CRB Enhanced is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.Technical SpecificationsOperating ActionClosed bolt, delayed-blowback patented KRISS Super V SystemCaliber.45 ACP (230g FMJ recommended)MagazineStd. 13-round Glock 21 mag.

It has a pistol grip stock and standard forearm. The furniture is black and the gun metal is the fde/coyote tan color. It is a 12 gauge chambered for 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells. With the 2 3/4"" shells it holds 7 rounds in the mag and 1 in the chamber. Adjustable rear ghost ring sight sitting on a picatinny rail and a high visibility orange dot front sight. This thing is a lot of fun on the range. It's had 200 rounds mix of buckshot and slugs down the tube. It's not even broken in yet. I have not tested any other loads in this other than the high power slugs and buckshot and it runs like a champ on them. I will say it does not like cheap crap like Perfecta buckshot. Only reason I am selling is because I want to fund another AR build. Asking $650. I work on the road all week and can only meet on the weekends. The ONLY thing I am interested in on trade is a stripped MI or PSA 5.56 or ""multi"" lower plus cash. Will come with one 25 round box of Remington 00 buck shells and a OD green MOLLE 24 round shell pouch. This listing will only be for a short time as I am visiting my parents back home and will only be available for a few days before I travel back south."

I may trade, but I cannot honestly think of one thing I need or am interested in. I know that I do not need any more hunting rifles or shotguns. I also do not need any wall hangers or odd caliber stuff. No .380 or .40 caliber guns for sure. What I am getting at is I would rather have cash unless something catches my eye. I do not want to add any cash or ammo on my end. I may take a partial trade for factory loaded 223/556 or 9mm ammo. May also take bulk buckshot. 

Must be legal to own a firearm. I reserve the right to back out of any sale at any time if I feel that your intent is not good. No BOS, just ID.

Price is firm I know this gun sell for a little cheaper online and sometimes higher depending on where you look. But their price does not include the overnight shipping charged by most internet dealers or FFL fees. Gun sells for $379 plus tax at Academy with one mag currently.

I have since decided that I'm no longer going to be deer hunting due to shoulder injury so this gun is going.  It has a scope, sling, carrying bag/case, and 40 rounds. 
This gun retails for $499 at Gander Mountain.  They sell the used ones for 400 without the scope.  I figure 400 is fair, plus you get the case and 50 bucks worth of ammo.  Gun is pristine and not even close to broken in yet.

This is a KWA M4 with a custom paint job. It seems to have lost compression. It used to shoot far, but after someone borrowed it a long while, it shoots not hard or far. It cycles fine though. I assume it is an internal compression problem. It comes with a lipo battery. When it was working correctly, it was a great gun. 

There is a store called Parafrog Airsoft in Knoxville, that deals with airsoft guns, and may be able to help. Maybe not. Put an orange tip on for safety if you intend to have this in any public site around other people, for safety and awareness sake."

I removed the contents to clean the packing oil and assemble it for the pictures. Barrel had not been touched before. Box says ""RAPTOR HP NWTF"".

I couldn't find any of these on the net for sale, not even with this walnut stock, so I called TriStar. These are not catalog guns as they are ""exclusives"" to NWFT. I was told that it was part of a special order of 200 and the gun was made in 2014. The only thing they could tell me was that they do not have MSRP's on exclusives and that the options on the gun are not like Raptors that can be bought from tristar. The stocks have a cut checkering and design that are only found on these and some special order Ducks Unlimited. They are shiny gloss finished.

The other elements of the shotgun are: 3"" gas operated system with removable choke system that uses Beretta Mobile threads. Three chokes are included (IC, M, F) with a tool in a container. Has a maunal EZ load magazine cutoff, vent rib w/matted sight plain, fiber optic sight, 5 round magazine (plug included if needed).

The barrel has a 3"" chrome lined chamber and the barrel is also chrome lined. The gun weighs just under 7 pounds unloaded.

Here is how the manual explains the action: Gas operated semi-automatic. Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber and cycling new shell from magazine in to the chamber. If operator desires to unload the chamber only, slightly push lifter (little switch on side of trigger) up and open action. This cuts the magazine off from cycling a new shell while unloading the chamber. Chamber will remain closed.

Safety: primary safety on backside of trigger guard. When engaged, blocks trigger, hammer lever and hammer.

Magazine: Tubular, bottom loading, plug is included and installs and uninstalls by unscrewing mag cap and removing or inserting plug.

This is a beautiful gun and is just as light and mobile as a Browning Light 20. I have tons of pics of unboxing it and putting it together and will either put it back in the box or whatever. Breaks down in a few seconds. Internals are very solid and either SS or alunminum. Can email more pics.

I'm not a shotgun guy and am open to trades for handguns, rifles, AR's, AK's.....$550 or best offer or trade. Thanks.

(1) Winchester Model 12 pre-war (1941) 16ga pump action shot gun,
Popularly-named the Perfect Repeater, With forged and machined steel parts, the ultimate reason for discontinuation in 1964 was that it was too expensive to produce.
This gun is in really good shape, especially for being 75 years old, retaining 90%
of its original finish on both wood & blued finish, I recently had it appraised at H&H and was told that it should go for between $700 to 1200, and in its current condition should go on the upper end of  that but I am going to ask $800.00 obo for mine and see what happens, as I just don't use it, and likely won't.
If you like the model 12's you may never find another one in this condition.

(2) New Old Stock (box says 2006) Winchester Model 9422 Tribute 22L-LR, the gun is in brand new unfired condition, it comes with the original manufacture box and box sleeve as well as owners manual paperwork and extras. this one has beautiful dark wood finish,with the straight stock and was the last of the true Winchesters made in New Haven CT. and the Final Tribute to the 9422's. The Barrel is engraved 1 of 9422 and has the horse and rider engraved on one side of the receiver and  model 9422 Tribute on the other side. I am asking $1050.00 for it"

The newer versions are being sold by Colt WITHOUT the LE901 Adapter Block Conversion Kit and they are making the kit available for purchase separately.
Be it prairie dog hunting in Texas, whitetail hunting in Maine or elk hunting in Colorado, the Colt LE901-16S™ is the rifle for the hunt. At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic."
