Originally designed and built by such famous makers as Hawken, Gemmer and Demick, Great Plains rifles were the best and most reliable designs and finest workmanship available. No other factory assembled rifle offers the authentic style and design of Lyman's Great Plains Rifle. This classic muzzleloader offers such high quality features as a 32"" barrel, double set triggers, Hawken style percussion ""snail"" with clean out screw, separate ramrod entry thimble and nose cap, and reliable coil spring lock with correct lock plate.

The Lyman Great Plains Hunter model features a fast, 1 in 32"" shallow groove rifled barrel. It's ideal for shooting the many types of modern projectiles available to today's black powder hunter, such as heavier conical bullets and sabots. The Great Plains Hunter has all of the high quality features of our Classic Great Plains rifle. It is also pre-drilled and tapped for the optional 57 GPR receiver sight for the Great Plains rifle.

Will come with box, 2 8 round mags, take down tool and everything else that came with it new. I also added luminescent sights but if that's not your thing they can easily be removed.

It will come with the Winchester home defense rounds (box of 20 not pictured) and the 10 remaining range rounds. 
2 identical IWB left had draw leather holsters. I purchased one and when I received it, the clear was defective so the company sent me a replacement.

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Im looking for an ar-10 or ar-10. Only calibers I will consider is a 6.8 spc first. I will consider a 458 socom, 450 bushmaster, 50 beuwolf, 308 win, 338 federal. There may be other calibers I'll consider but nothing smaller than the 6.8. Will also consider trading for 1911's or a high end hunting rifle. 

Only other thing I will consider trading for is a night vision scope."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.Made in U.S.A.CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE"

-460 ci motor. not quite 5000 miles on the fresh rebuild. This motor alone would cost over five thousand to buy or build.
- Auto 3 speed tranny. It's tight and shifts awesome
- Rear wheel drive
- Running gear, motor, and tranny have all been gone through
- Power disc brakes (rare in the old trucks)
- True 10,000 pound GVW truck and hard to find
- Dana 80 rear end
- Dual gas tanks
- 8' Bed (solid with only petina/surface rust)
- Doors open and shut perfectly
- I just added a heavy duty headache rack / back window guard
- Runs great on back roads or on the interstate. The truck easily does 70mph on the interstate with plenty left to pass people.

THE BAD
- Cab mounts could be replaced, but will last a long time before it's needed
- rocker corners are rusted through in the corners closest to the doors

THE GOOD
- This truck has been gone through to assure it is a daily driver. I drive it to work and to tow my boat, and it has served us well.
- This truck is a farmers dream, as I have been told. It can haul 10k pounds legitimately, and you can slide 2 pallets in the back.

I just traded my car for a newer truck, and have no need for old blue any longer. Hopefully someone out there can use and enjoy this ride back in time.

I have much more into the truck than the asking price, you wont be disappointed with this solid of an older rare ford with a Big block. It took me 6 months to find a truck like this that is this solid."

The SAM7R
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

From the website:
For: GLOCK 19, GLOCK 23, GLOCK 32, GLOCK 38 (**Will NOT fit the new Gen4 GLOCK**)

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips.

Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required. 

Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!

Its solid, ultra-dependable action makes it America’s favorite. If you could throw the lid off every duck blind, stop by every pheasant field and check out every tract of timber where deer and turkey are hunted, you’d probably see more Model 870™ Express® pumps than any other shotgun. It’s been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 50 years.
Its versatility, reliability and uncompromising quality make the Model 870 Express a shotgun you can’t afford to be without. We’re proud to make them, but even prouder of the fact you’ve made them America’s Pump Guns.

Up for sale is a really nicely done MG34 dummy gun on an actual 80% receiver (not an aluminum dummy receiver). This MG34 has waffen proofs in more places than I can count. The stock has been very nicely refinished. Included is a doppel or assault drum that has been properly affixed to the feed tray. The MG stands on top of an MG3 tripod that has a custom made MG34 adapter. All of the parts, as far as I can tell, are there except for the internal receiver parts (bolt, spring, and various receiver pins and springs. The trigger is functional. As this is a non working gun anyone and everyone is invited to inquire about purchasing this magnificent piece of history. I am willing to flex on the price, however don't get ridiculous with your offer. IMA is selling this same MG with a non-80% receiver, no tripod, and no assault drum for $3200. If interested the MG34 can be seen at FLAG MILITARY SURPLUS located on hwy 89 east of the Flagstaff Mall. For specific inquiries email or text at six0six-5nine4-eight2six3"

Most are built on the N frame, although the .357 was made on the L frame.
Calibers include .44 Magnum, .45 Colt, .45 ACP, .41 Magnum, and .357 Magnum. I think that is all ?  The .45 Colt has been made in both Stainless and Blue. I believe the rest have all been stainless. .45 Colt Mountain Gun. It is just the right combination of bore size, power, weight, and bulk to make it one of the best double-action holster guns available for the woods or big boy ccw ?  I don't think Mountain Guns were ever continuously available cataloged items. They only came out in batches, apparently when distributors ordered them. Some of the batches like the .41s, blued (   .45 colts   )  and .45 ACPs were never repeated   (    so they only exist in small numbers.   ) The only cartridge that was repeated often enough that you've just about always been able to find one is .44 magnum.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This gun is  98% like new in the factory box with paperwork, looking to get $950 or best offer cash or possible trade, call me with offers, don't be shy, REDACTED or REDACTED, if no answer leave name number and message"

The single-sided, non-extended thumb safety and short military combat trigger are true to the original 1911-A1 design. The Combat 3-Dot sights are fixed, and the ejection port is lowered and flared.

It is brand new in original box, unfired.  It has only sat in my safe for the last couple of years collecting dust.  

The M1A is the civilian version of the famous M14, which was once a standard issue US military rifle.  It is known to be very accurate and reliable.  Springfield recommends the SOCOM for military or law enforcement, but also hunting varmints. 

It has a gas-operating system, so propellant gases are captured by a tube near the muzzle, the tube connects with the bolt where a valve catches the gas, and the gas pushes the bolt back so it can eject a spent casing and chamber a fresh round.

Springfield offers eight different models of the M1A and what makes the SOCOM 16 different from the others is its short 16” barrel and Picatinny rail for easy mounting of optics.  Otherwise features of the SOCOM include a two-stage military trigger that sets off the action with a 5- to 6-pound pull.  It has military sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation.  It has a tritium dot front sight, so shooters can see it in low light and at night.  And it has a synthetic stock.
