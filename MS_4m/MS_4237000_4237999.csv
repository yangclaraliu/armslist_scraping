From manufacturer's website:
This tactical buttstock is designed and built by a USG contractor with decades of experience making components for small arms.
This buttstock integrates the materials and practices needed to satisfy the government, along with the rugged functionality demanded by tactical forces and enthusiasts. This buttstock has a contoured buttplate, made of a rubber-like material, that allows the stock to rest comfortably in any shooting position. The buttplate provides a positive, non-slip contact surface. The buttstock features a sloping cheek-weld surface that allows for greatest shooting accuracy. The stock attaches by a unique, patent-pending method that ensures smooth rattle-free action and proper fit to the receiver tubes. There are 2 water-resistant storage chambers for batteries or cleaning kit in the buttstock. There is no need to remove the buttstock to access the storage, the chambers can be opened while the stock is mounted. The release lever is shielded and the whole stock is designed to be very snag-resistant. The release lever can be operated with a single hand to adjust or remove the buttstock. The TI-7 commercial size stock also has an ambi socket for quick release sling swivels.
The materials are all MIL-SPEC and all the metallic components are stainless steel. The buttstock also has an ambi quick-release sling swivel point. NOTE on COLOR: Colors shown are an approximation. Computer monitors vary significantly making accurate color representation very difficult. Our colors are matched to FED STD 595C. Most commercial ""Flat dark Earth"" products are a shade lighter than the FED STD. Please order our Coyote Tan for best match to MAGPUL and other commercial products in Flat Dark Earth. THIS SPECIFIC MODEL WILL ONLY FIT MIL SPEC SIZE EXTENSION TUBES

Either people say they're great or complete piles. This is not a pile! This is a great shooting gun that was once all stainless. Had a matte frame and polished slide. When I got it though the finish was in pretty rough shape. No rust or anything just a lot of holster wear and the slide looked like it had been gone over with a Brillo pad. So, I had it cerakoted about 6 months ago in magpul green (slightly darker than OD) and black. Added the magpul grips to top it off. This looks really really good. All that said, it's just sitting in my safe and I'm in the mood for another project. The price isn't completely firm but in looking on armslist and other sites, the hardballers are going for between 500 and 600. Plus there's the cost of the cerakoting. I think $550 NOW $500 is pretty fair. Offers welcomed. I'll consider interesting trades. Message me your # if you want to text/talk."

Important heads up here. Some scumbag was listed a Black and OD Green Tavor for 1,050 bucks. I carefully approached this and of course like all legitimate transactions he wanted me to send him a money order for the balance right away before a darn thing gets shipped. His English was pretty bad via text and when I indicated I may be backing out he called me from REDACTED. It was a male with a heavy accent (not surprising) and he told me he could not take the firearm to an FFL to verify his possession of it per my request because it would be illegal for him to carry it into a gunshop! He ""didn't have the right permit!"" 

Please... 

He was nice enough to offer to let me pay half now, and the other half after getting the gun, which would never happen. Then he hung up after I called him out, and pulled both his adds. 

He messed with a guy who is in the investigation field as a career, so here is some info to protect potential buyers. 

He uses the email address REDACTED, which goes back to a Mr. Lammy Beck. The address he tried to use as a home address is 5617 South Spotswood Trail, Gordonsville VA with goes back to a Veronica Beck, so he at least did his homework when coming up with a fake stateside address (I will be contacting this person and letting them know someone is using their address for illegal firearm fraud) 

Be careful guys, this one is trying to be sneaky. 

On the Nigerian Scam scale, he gets a 5/10 for effort. But still obviously a cash grab scam. 

Better luck next time, loser!!!

EDIT: Heads up, guys! He put his scam add up again!

Up for sale are approximately 600 casings of 9mm Luger brass (I counted about 640 casings total, but I'm selling it as 600 to keep it simple). These are once-fired, and a mixture of several manufacturers. I did run these through an ultrasonic cleaner once, but they will need further prepping (depriming, resizing, further cleaning, etc). All are in good shape and look good for reloading.

I am asking $15 cash. Price is firm. Will meet FTF in the La Crosse area.

These parts are for a 7.62 X 51 (.308), NOT for the 5.56 NATO (.223). Up for sale/trade are a 6 position collapsible butt stock, buffer tube (see pics 2 & 3 for minor damage), castle nut, carbine buffer, carbine buffer spring and a fixed length buffer. A single stage factory trigger with trigger pins. The capture plate for the buffer tube assy.  A charging handle. The pistol grip with cap head screw. A hand guard with the delta ring, barrel nut, compression spring, retaining ring and the end piece for the hand guard to fit into, and finally the picatinny rail gas block. As you can see in the second and third photos there is minor damage to the buffer tube where the lip is that holds down the buffer retainer and spring in the receiver. Rest assured it still work perfectly and does not interfere with the normal operation of the rifle. It was damaged when I put it in originally. There are less than 250 rounds on these parts (the fixed length buffer has 0 rounds on it). All these parts, except for the fixed length buffer and capture plate, are factory Smith & Wesson parts. No International sales. No refund will be considered if you buy these parts thinking they are for a .223 as the hand guard assy. and charging handle WILL NOT fit.

It is purpose built to be as lightweight as possible. By comparison to your average AR, this thing feels like a toy. Despite it's toy-like feel this thing is quite tight. No jiggle between the upper and lower. Pretty damn solid, but don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. I think you'd be impressed.

The lower is a polymer by Frontier Arms, but with the sale I will also include what some cosider a ""real"" complete lower by Rainier Arms. The complete lower is a Zombie by RA and swapping is easy as popping two pins, swapping complete lowers and off you go. 

There are about 500 rounds down the pipe, so she's just getting warmed up.
