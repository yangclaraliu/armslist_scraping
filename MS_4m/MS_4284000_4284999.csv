Do not contact me unless you are a Missouri resident that can legally buy a firearm.  We will do a bill of sale at time of purchase and copy your drivers license.  The following information is from the company that I bought VEPR from.

Vepr Super .308 Win caliber rifle, walnut stock, 10-rd magazine

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr Super is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavy duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount (not included) can be attached to this rail system.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with two 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit."

I am willing to give you my down payment, if you are interested in purchasing the rifle from the dealer. all you have to do is show up at the gun dealer and take over my purchase, and you can keep my down payment as part of your payment. the dealer will accept cash or credit card as long as you come in person.

Just a heads up, this is a special edition rifle that was produced for shot show 2015, so it has the OD GREEN finish. you cannot get this color anymore.

The Stealth Recon Scout A1 (SRS-A1) is the most versatile Sniper Rifle system in the world. It is nearly a foot shorter than conventional sniper rifles, maintains 1/2 MOA or better accuracy with DTM Ammunition, and can be easily adapted to individual mission requirements by changing the weapon’s caliber and length. Whether a police sniper is shooting 50 yards or a military sniper is shooting a mile the SRS offers unrivaled flexibility in a package shorter than the M16 battle rifle. 

Accuracy
The SRS achieves superb accuracy in all calibers because it's built around core accuracy components:

1. Match grade (free-floated) barrels, chambers, and crowns
2. High quality match trigger
3. Solid, repeating return-to-zero barrel mounting system (the receiver securely clamps around the first six inches of barrel)

Quick Caliber Conversion
The SRS is quickly convertible between the following calibers: .308 Winchester (22"" and 26"" barrels), .260 Remington, 6.5x47 Lapua, 7mm Winchester Short Mag, .300 Winchester Magnum, .338 Norma Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum. The caliber conversion and return to zero is simple and takes less than 60 seconds.
Benefits:
1. Operators can change rifle length, penetration, and distance capabilities.
2. Snipers can shoot various ammo calibers and types depending on METT-T.
3. Snipers can progressively train on more powerful ammo.
4. Reduced training costs (train and practice with .308 WIN)
5. Reduced system down-times (the operator can change his own barrels).

Compact
The SRS is the shortest purpose-built sniper rifle in the world. The telescoping bolt and bullpup configuration make it almost a foot shorter than conventional Mauser-style turnbolt sniper rifles. The compact design shifts weight and center-of-gravity rearward, creating a perfectly balanced and relatively short sniper rifle.

Rugged
The SRS was designed to operate under the harshest conditions and abuse. It is built of high-impact polymers; aircraft grade aluminum (ANSI 7075-T6); ultra high-strength steels; and some of the most durable coatings known to man. The monolithic receiver serves as a full length mounting chassis, eliminating the need for any sort of receiver-to-stock bedding interface. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver.
The SRS maintains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments."

It is black, built with a PSA lower kit.  If you have any concern about a polymer lower, GWACS covers the lower for any damage you may do to it for $35 plus shipping.  These are the orignal polymer lower, not cheap knock offs that made their way around during the last craze. 

The mag release button has been upgraded to a Seekins Precision one. The buffer spring is a CS heavy duty with a Slash Heavy buffer. These make the gun flat shooting with very low recoil. 
The only wear on the gun is on the take down pins and the bolt release. The bolt release  is a bit discolored from some old tan paint, it is a used Wilson Combat over-sized version, but it is missing the bolt on piece to make it oversized, so it is just a normal release.  The pins have the finish worn off from taking the gun apart. 

It only has 20 rounds through it for testing. 

The Upper is a like new CMMG 18"" SPR profiled upper. It is mid-length with a 1/8 twist barrel chambered for 5.56. It has pinned and cut FSB under a YHM Rifle Length Light Weight Free Floating hand guard. The lock nut on the rail has been banged up a bit, nothing that affects its reliability, just cosmetic. The BCG is from Ares Arms, just a standard full auto mil spec BCG. The Flash Suppressor is a Rainier Arms XTC. The barrel has been painted foliage green. It has less than 100 rounds through it. 

Looking to get $750 complete

TESTIMONIALS:
“While investigating Utah Concealed Firearm Permit Courses, I heard several stories about how other instructors spent more time pontificating about themselves and their skills than covering the course material.  I was very impressed by Jake; while he obviously knows his stuff, he didn’t flaunt it.  He professionally and dynamically presented the material.  The class covers some very dry material, but, Jake kept the class lively and interactive.

“I am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.”

“I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class.  The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough.  His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole.  His own experience as an officer was tremendous.  Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part.  I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake.  I highly recommend the training he provides.
Thank you again for the class.”

The Elite Professional is the newest member of that series. It includes the best of several of our models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on our Tactical Elite. With this barrel, we have reduced the slide length by a full inch, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The frame is the comfortable full size you’re accustomed to in your traditional 1911 pistol, but with the shorter slide the result is excellent concealability. An excellent choice for daily carry, The Elite Professional provides the rapid shot-to-shot recovery and reduced recoil one would expect from a compensated pistol. You can be sure of 100% functional reliability, fast handling, rapid shot-to-shot recovery and accuracy when you need it. Call 800-8850-2001 and ask for Tyler, Tanner or Herb"

I am selling it for a friend, so I'm not sure about the background but he says a buddy of his can hit a 12"" steel plate at a 1000 yd with it. The barrel has been free-floated and the stock seems like it's been modified but my friend says that it hasn't been. He's selling it because he says it has a little too much kick for what he likes to do.

The 5.56 Carbine Base 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system.

Once placed in the up position, the sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight. The A2 BUIS can be used as a co-witness iron sight with most of the red dot sighting systems. This sight features the standard A2-style double peep aperture and has full windage adjustment. It uses the Colt-style windage knob and windage screw. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine.  When in the down position, it will clear most optics. The A2 BUIS mount body and sight stem are manufactured from 6061 T6 aluminum and black hard-coat anodized per mil spec.

****PLEAS READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE CONTACTING ME. THANKS!****


I bought this bike last year wrecked with a salvage title because of frame damage but I did a frame swap using a frame from a 2000 gsxr and completely rebuilt the bike. So because of the frame swap it is titled as a 2000 gsxr but besides the main frame its all an 03 bike. I still have the original salvage title for the bike incase you want to see. I have a rebuilt TN title now and all paper work is in my name so there wouldnt be any problem with signing title over. The engine is the original so its a 2003.
The bike overall is in really good mechanicle shape, 14xxx miles on engine (miles will increase as I ride) the right fairing was busted up and is held together with zip ties but isnt real noticeable from a distance (left fairing is good) tail has small crack on left side not bad though, nose fairing and front fender are new. Gas tank is in good shape and has no dents. Tires have ~75℅ tread remaining, all of the folliwing was done this spring 2015 - both fork oil, oil seals and dust seals replaced, engine oil, oil filter, air filter, plugs replaced, new radiator & coolant, front brake pads installed, brake lines flushed and new brake fluid installed, and new battery all less than 1000 miles ago. Bike has a 8k hid headlight kit on low beams, I replaced the stock tail light with an led cbr 954rr tail light, only has rear turn signals, I didn't hook the horn up when I was rebuilding it but I have it, I plastidiped the rims orange looks good when they're clean. also bike has a yoshi rs-3 exhaust can i shortend, sounds good. I think that's it. Bike doesn't look bad, runs strong and rides and drives as it should. If at all interested feel free to contact me with any questions. I dont have to get rid of it just want some more guns. Thanks.

I really liked the loads I can shoot with this well built gun. Any .357, .38 special, or 9mm you want to put in it, I am a simple ranger shooter and love the cowboy actions. It has a little wear in the common areas, on tip of barrel where holstered and the cylinder ring on the .357/38. I tried to get it in the pictures and can send more via text if needs be.

These designs came about in the 80s (actually in the 70s when Intratec was Interdynamics and they made open bolt semis banned in 1981) when gun designs were fun and practical. Yes, this is too large for a concealable handgun and not a target pistol and it is 22, so not the best choice for defense....though with a 50 round mag/drum holding a full box in the pistol, it would be a hell of a deterant. So what is the purpose of this one? Fun! Plinking a box of 22s at the range or outdoors if you are fortunate to have land. A threaded barrel makes attaching a registered supressor easy or one of the many attachments made for this gun like extended barrels with slotted covers that give you a grip in front. Many of these were beat up over the years and the top cover is stamped steel and the lower section polymer. This one is in excellent condition with only one cosmetic mark on the barrel from storing it in a case with those silica pacs touching the barrel. Made a lighter area half the area of a dime. The bolt/firing pin/spring is all one unit and this pin is straight and like new. Replacements are cheap as are all parts for these, but this one is tip-top shape. Comes with the original Intratec 20 round mag which fits tight and is 100% reliable (these prefer round nose to many hollow-points and high-velocity is better) though any 10-50 round Ruger 10-22 magazine which are among the most common and lowest cost mags will fit in this. Big enough that in 22 there is no rise or recoil so you can fire off 30 rounds or 50 as fast as your finger works and stay on the can bouncing along the ground. I can nail empty 12 gauge shells tossed out on the ground too. Many of these tripled during the last ""panic"" and sure to happen again. This is priced well towards the bottom of the range of all listed guns so you will ALWAYS be able to resell it for the same or more if you take care of it. I can work direct with Florida residents with a valid CWP (that ensures age and no felon status) or will ship to FFL for $35. (Handguns cost more to ship) $289 for a threaded barrel version in super condition is a great price..check all the usual sites and compare"
