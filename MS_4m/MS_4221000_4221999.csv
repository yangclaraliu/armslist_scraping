This particular rifle is stamped 1943 and is fitted with a newer reproduction PU style scope made in Canada to match the actual scopes of the era.  This was a laborious conversion that you can avoid doing yourself by simply buying this example instead of trying to do it yourself.!  The conversion consisted of cutting off a straight bolt, welding on a turned down bolt, tapping into the receiver to attach the scope mount, cutting down the wood stock for scope mount, and more headaches not listed.  One really cool thing about this design is that one can still shoot with the iron sights for closer shots or lift your view up to the scoped view.  Awesome gun comes with converted shotgun case, leather ammo pouch, cold weather hat, rubber and steel butt plates, leather scope lens covers, canvas scope cover, bayonet, gun strap and some ammo."

This caliber uses ammo that is 4 times the weight of a 5.56 for superior knock-down power.  This caliber is fast becoming the caliber of choice for Navy SEALS for close quarter action.

The upper is Olympic Arms with a 11.5"" , 1:9 twist, chrome moly barrel, TufForce quad rail system, A-2 flash hider, and Brownell's bolt carrier group and charging handle.  It has a very bright GREEN laser optic mounted on the right side rail.  The optic is currently set-up with a standard on-off push button, but comes with a remote switch you can install if you prefer.

The lower is a Delaware Machinery (made in Muncie, Indiana) receiver with dust cover and shell deflector.  Internals and grip are from Brownells.

The pistol tube and brace are the latest version of the SBX from Sig Sauer.  This differs from the earlier model by having a more comfortable, wide strapping system.  There is a letter from the ATF inside the box telling you how to use the brace and NOT have the ATF declare that the gun is a SBR.  Used properly, there is no need for paying the $200 tax stamp and registering it as a SBR.

I am including 3 boxes (60 rounds) of Remington 220gr ammo already loaded into two (2) 30 round magazines.  This beauty is ready to shoot!

I have well over $1600 invested in this set-up.  I am asking a very reasonable $1175 for it as described above with the ammo included.  

CASH ONLY, please!  The ONLY trades I would consider would be a Gen 3 Glock 19 and/or a LNIB Glock 42 as partial trade.  PLEASE don't email with other trade offers.

I will meet in the Greenwood/Franklin area FTF for the exchange.  Sorry, I simply do not have time to travel due to work and family commitments.

Please send all inquiries to me through Armslist and include your name and contact info.  I will call you to discuss a time and place to meet.

This is the Tristar Setter model in 20 gauge with the 26-3/4"" barrels (with extended chokes installed). The wood is beautiful, the scrolling on the receiver is top notch and it is a 3"" gun. It is lightweight and has great swing for those fast moving quail, dove, huns, pheasant and so on. 

It will come with the two installed Carlson extended chokes and all the OEM chokes that it came with. The manual will be included as well. No box or case however.

I bought this gun brand new Online, since it is difficult to find in local stores. I paid $673.50 for this gun, which included sales tax, shipping and FFL fee. PLUS, I paid an additional $80 for each Carlson choke so I have $750 into this setup.

The gun is in great shape, low round count, runs great like an AK should. I had a Bushnell TRS-25(not included) mounted without a riser to the TWS railed dust cover which allowed a great cheek weld. However, if you want to run a taller optic(Eotech, Aimpoint, etc) I do have a Magpul .5"" cheek riser you can have. I have the original box, manual, sling, oil tin, bayonet, 2 metal mags and cleaning rod. Also, I have the original wood furniture if you want it. I'm NOT looking for trades, I'm selling for cash to fund my 308 project. Text/call/email me if you're interested and I would be happy to answer your questions or send more pics.

SIG SAUER SIGTAC SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace
SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols
equipped with a buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the
operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A
flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features
- Fits all pistols equipped with a buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- Also Fits on all 12 ga Shotgun models that are fitted with a Shotgun shock absorbing buffer tube (example: Mesa Crosshair).
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA
- Quick and easy to install

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control."

New internal parts, every pin and spring is new. New firing pin, and spring. Sleeve over the firing pin spring, instead of the crunchy dual spring they have now.

New dura cote on the slide as well as polishing the sides of the slide and simi-chrome.

Polished chamber, barrel, safety switch and ejector. Semi-chrome  as well.

Feed ramp polished and chromed, almost  mirror finished.

Stainless steel hex head grip screws.

It still has the last round hold open but I left off the parts that keep it from shooting if there is no magazine in the gun. --- I think if during a struggle and the mag release gets hit and my mag falls out or moves the gun is useless. This way I still have one in the chamber, or in an extreme situation i can hand feed it like the old marakov pistols.

This pistol never had any issues before. I just wanted a project...

History of this gun- A couple  years old, several hundred rounds fired with no issues. Took it hunting and fishing as a a back-up protection weapon. It served its purpose. One day I decided to make it nice.  

After doing all this work to it i have put 150 to 200 rounds through it and it has been flawless. I always kept it cleaned and i would put it up against and ""hi end"" or hi dollar gun.

Comes with factory 8 rnd mad and two 10 round mags.

Used but not abused, I bought it used and have put about 500 rounds through it. After buying this gun, I've decided I'd rather go back to a 9mm DA/SA pistol for CC.  It shoots great, I have had only one stove pipe and that was with the crappy factory mag.  It has the fabled idiot mark- if you dont know what it is look it up-, yep someone is an idiot....

MSRP for this gun is $688 with 1 mag. For $400 I will include:
*4 mags- 1 factory, 1 off-brand and 2 Chip McCormick (one of the best for the 1911).
*A set of wrap around Hogue black rubber grips.
*1 vintage leather mag. belt pouch.
*.45 Bore Snake.
*Also included is a 50rd box of .45(if I don't go shooting again)

I have had this a few years, (bought new). I can never live without a Tritium illuminated watch again after this. No buttons to push to light it and it is always bright at night or dim light. It has always been very accurate and as of the first of April it has a new Lithium Energizer battery that is rated at 10 years of life in this particular watch movement. Anyone that knows watches knows that Luminox makes good stuff. If you are tired of Timex's and want a high end watch at a fraction of new price, this may be for you. 

The watch shows normal wear (I wear my watches 24/7 365 they are working machines). There are some very small blemishes in the titanium case and it has a small chip in the Sapphire Crystal at the very bottom of the 6 oclock position. I debated having a new crystal installed ( they are about $20) but it doesnt interfere with anything so I just left it alone. I still have the box (somewhere), papers and the titanium band with all links . This watch was over $600 when I purchased it new.

I bought this rifle 8 years ago still packed in cosmoline. It has been properly cleaned and shot very little. It's been a true safe queen. One unique feature the Yugo made rifles have is the ability to turn off the gas block for use with the grenade launcher but also when using live ammo can achieve higher velocities and longer range. The cleaning kit is still in the stock and includes a tapco 30 round detachable magazine. The Yugo has a much better fit and finish than the Chinese models I've come across. And in my opinion the blade bayonet looks far better than the spikes found on other models. I'm putting a price of $500 cash picked up locally. That may sound a bit high but I know you won't find a cleaner one anywhere else and the value continues to climb ever day on these. If you can find it cheaper somewhere else, go get it. Don't waste your time telling me. You might lose out on the cheaper one while your showing me you impressive array of curse words."

Nominally it had a caliber of 4 decimal lines, but the actual caliber was 4.1 Swedish decimal lines or 3.88 Norwegian decimal lines (12.17 mm), and it fired a rimfire round with a 12.615 mm (.497 in) lead bullet. The 12.17 mm caliber was chosen because the Swedish army had approximately 30,000 new muzzle loading Model 1860 and breech-loading Model 1864 rifles in 12.17 mm caliber in stock, rifles that were suitable for conversion to Model 1867 rolling block rifles. With the exception of the first 10,000 rifles and 20,000 actions (for conversions of older rifles), which were made by Remington in the US, all Model 1867 Remington rolling block rifles and carbines were made under license in Sweden and Norway, by Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag in Sweden and by Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik in Norway, with the two Swedish manufacturers producing about 80% of the weapons Birth of the M1867 In the 1860s the Swedish and Norwegian armies realized that their standard rifles, both percussion lock breech-loading rifles and muzzle loaders, were rapidly becoming obsolete in the face of the new metal cartridge combining bullet, primer and propellant load. In early October 1866, a joint Swedish-Norwegian arms commission was established in order to select a suitable cartridge and rifle for the two nations.
