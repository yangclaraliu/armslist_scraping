I recently purchased this rifle after seeing an ad in American Rifleman magazine.  I did a bunch of reseach and thought that it would be an awesome weapon to have.  An AR that shoots 7.62x39 in AK mags?!  AWESOME!!  (full disclosure - apparently not ALL AK mags work - I bought some ProMag 20 rounders that didn't quite fit... YMMV)  But alas, I only just recently learned of the 300 Blackout round (I know, I was living under a rock) - and now I'm really looking to pick one of those up instead.

Here's the details on this weapon:  I purchased it online ($1480), picked it up at my local FFL ($25 transfer fee), gave it a once over with a rag to get the new gun oils off.  Inserted the included 30 round mag a few dozen times just to get used to the nifty mag release.  I mounted one of the included (short) accessory rails to the bottom of the handguard at the muzzle.  I also mounted some backup iron sights and an EOTech red dot (not included) and thought:  ""this is great!"".  Then I started having second thoughts, and now I'm here.

The gun is in almost like new condition.  When mounting the sights, I had a few issues with getting things on snug-ly and the top rail has a few little marks through the black anodized finish.  I never even loaded rounds into the mag or into the chamber.

Included is everything it comes with from the manufacturor: - The rifle | 30 round RRA stamped Thermold magazine | Accessory rails (1 long and 2 short) w/ mounting screws | Owners Manual & some oil/cleaning freebies | RRA Hard Case

For the rifle and the FFL Fee total I paid ~$1505. I'm asking for $1300 for the the rifle, case, etc...  Will inc. shipping +ins. to your local FFL for an extra $50 outside of Tampa Bay, FL area.  For payment, I can accept: Cash, Money Order, Paypal (please add 3% for fees), or even Square Cash ( https://cash.me/about ) which is better than Paypal.  Must fill out a firearms bill of sale.  CWP buyer preferred.

I'm not really interested in any trade offers with the exception of some 300 AAC Blackout ammo as partial trade.  Mainly looking for some bulk/target FMJ rounds."

I have put exactly 110 rounds through the pistol and prefer HK pistols and would prefer to have another one instead of this sitting in the safe.  

The pistol has a Zev Trigger group in it as well as a Tungsten guide rod, extended slide and mag release.  He also had them put matching gold takedown pins and rear cover plate.  Both of the mags have the Pearce extensions on them and it has all of the original parts in the factory box. 

With the price (and wait time) for the G-code holster and mag caddy he put just under $1000 in to the pistol parts and labor.  If you are not interested in the holster that can be negotiated out of the price as they bring over $100 used on eBay all the time.

Once received double and triple check it for correct spelling of names, correct address, etc.. then print it out, take to your bank to be notarized and you are all set. You can purchase a NFA item the same day your trust is notarized. The cost is $50 (please add $5 if you would like a hard copy mailed to you). I will send you a draft to look over before you submit payment, if you are not satisified no payment is due, or submit payment and i will send over the final draft ASAP.

I am looking to trade/sell my SKS-M, which I am told is the rarest of the SKS's, having been released in the several years post California's name based ban, and get an AR upper in 300 blckout, 9mm, 45 ACP or 7.62X39. I have a ton of AK mags as well, and we can trade according to need and value. 

This gun is in great condition, and has had less than 1K through it. It was my first purchased rifle and I had a lot of fun with it. To be honest, I expected it to be in a worst condition than it is but it is really in better condition than I thought it would be. Some maring on the trigger group take down pin (to be expected) and the tech sights bolts, as they are very tight and a beyotch to take off. A little paint would fix both of those issues. Original stock included, but inletted for tech sights.

Considering the ammo, stock and sights on top of the rarity, I was looking at $700 or so in cash and a little more in trade. Not stuck on the aforementioned items and can usually be swayed towards something cool. Let me know, thanks - jr"

I hate to see this go, got it all setup perfect and really like to shoot it, but unfortunately I really need the money right now.

Immaculate SA Range Officer model 1911 .45 with factory adjustable target sights and stainless match barrel.  I have shot maybe 400 rounds out of this, all brass case, and have kept it very clean.  I am including quite a few extras (see below) including ~300 rounds of ammo.

Last year I had the frame cerakoted in olive drab and the slide and other small parts cerakoted in matte black.  The stainless steel barrel and aluminum trigger were left in the original silvery finish.  The cerakote looks a ton better than the original hideous looking parkerized finish, plus its a lot more durable/corrosion resistant.

Pistol features
- Adjustable target sights
- Beavertail safety
- Match grade stainless barrel
- Professionaly cerakoted by a local experience gunshop, not a billy bob garage job
- Pachymer wraparound grips
- Adjustable trigger
- Lifetime warranty not tied to the original purchaser

Extras Included
- Springfield armory heavy duty case
- Springfield paddle holster
- Springfield paddle magazine holder (2 mag capacity)
- Two 7-round blued magazines (came with the pistol)
- Four 7-round Springfield Armory stainless magazines
- Original SA grips
- Gun sock
- Eagle Industries ambidextrous military drop holster (not some knock off, its real army issue and unbelieveably durable).  Can be hung from a belt and strapped to your leg, attachable to any molle pals compatible system (such as a pack or load carrier) or can be carried on your waist.
- Extra leg strap for Eagle holster
- 300 rounds of .45 brass target ammo.  Mostly winchester, a few other brands as well.

Asking $980 for the whole package.  I require that the transfer be in person at my local gunshop (The Armory in TC).  Cash only, no trades.

Would only consider a trade for the right carbon fiber 54-55cm road bike (which is a longshot)"

The Mod 2’s 16” chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel is manufactured to military specifications, and features a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The Mod 2 update introduces several notable features to the SR15 IWS line: a URX4 handguard with Keymod accessory mounting points for-ancillary device attachments increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. A Mod 2 gas system with a proprietary design minimizes leakage and ensures more consistent operation in harsh conditions. A gas block secured with a locking ring instead of taper pins increases barrel rigidity and eliminates the need to custom fit the gas block to the barrel. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case. SR- 15 E3 MOD 2Barrel: 16"" 1:7 Twist, Hammer Forged, Chrome LinedCaliber: 5.56mmWeight: 6.75 lbsLength: 33.5""-36.5""E3 Enhanced BoltThe E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knight’s Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically designed for our SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs.  This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help to reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles. The E3 Bolt’s extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It’s shaped like a rounded ‘T’ and sometimes referred to as a ‘butterfly’ shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another strong feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule.  The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin. The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life. Hammer ForgingKnight’s Armament employs a hammer-forging process on a number of our barrels and chambers, which serves to increase the quality of their interior finish, as well as increasing the durability and life of the barrel. These barrels are then Chrome-lined to further the lifespan of the barrel and increase its resistance to fouling and corrosion.  The first step is to take a drilled barrel and hone the interior to a fine, clean finish. The barrel is then placed onto a mandrel with the rifling pattern ground in relief across it. This setup is then placed between opposing power hammers which literally hammer the barrel onto the pattern found on the mandrel. The barrel setup is rotated and the hammers continue to forge the barrel into its final shape. Once they complete this process, the barrels are heat treated in order to relieve the inherent stress created during this process.  The Chroming process is applied after the Hammer Forging. At this point the interior of the barrel is basically lined with a layer of chrome and bonded to the forged steel. Chrome is approximately twice as hard as standard 4150 steel and also resists the lead and powder that bare steel will normally absorb into its pores. This allows the barrel to be exposed to the higher temperatures and pressures of high firing schedules while still maintaining accuracy, durability and reliability. The end result is a denser, stronger barrel that will endure a higher round life than a Standard Stainless Steel or Chrome Moly barrel.Ambidextrous ControlsKnight’s Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon’s major controls can be accessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon’s controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system.  Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector switch on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter’s glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knight’s Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution. Two-Stage Match TriggerAll of the weapons available from Knight’s Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle.  Our 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a firer’s confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger from Knight’s Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome addition to any setup. Quick Detach CouplerThe Quick Detach Coupler (QDC) line of Sound Suppressors and Muzzle Devices are proprietary items designed for secure interoperability. The coupling device itself consists of multiple ball bearings arrayed in a circular pattern which fit into sockets specifically machined into various muzzle devices to accept the QDC. The bearings are aligned with the sockets by way of a V-shaped notch that seats the device onto an index pin. Once aligned, a simple twist of the outer retaining ring locks the device securely into place.  This system was developed to provide fast and easy operation and interoperability between weapons and suppressors. Knight's QDC line of sound suppressors all feature this method of attachment. Various muzzle devices, such as the QDC Flash Suppressors and the MAMS muzzle break, also feature the QDC pockets to accept sound suppressors equipped with this coupling device. Secure interoperability and intelligent, efficient design are the intended goals of this quick and easy technology. URX 4The URX 4 is a continuous top-rail system that utilizes the Keymod mounting brackets developed by Vltor and Noveske. This rail system is built stronger and more stable than previous designs due to the absence of a removable bottom rail. The modular layout allows an end user to fully customize exactly where to place accessories without the use of specialized tools, small parts, or additional forces applied to the barrel. The URX 4 is currently available for 5.56 rifles in 8.5”, 10”, 13”, and 14.5” lengths, and is equipped with Knight’s unique IBN mounting configuration. The idea was to create a more modular, and thus more serviceable, rail system that still maintains its strength and stiffness. Th IBN system torques the rail onto the weapon and allows the rail to act as the barrel nut. This design was developed to increase stabilization and provide a simpler solution that requires less specialized tools to install and maintain. A full array of modular accessories, iron sights, and panel kits utilizing the Keymod mounting brackets have been developed specifically to accompany this rail system. With the introduction of the URX 4, Knight’s Armament Co. demonstrates its continuing determination to intelligently design effective products."

The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.  


The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.  


The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

In addition, this rifle is basically the same as every other M4-style carbine. This means that the manual of arms, sights, operating features, and the disassembly procedure are identical.

One minor difference between the M&P 15R in 5.45x39 and an M16 rifle or M4 carbine in .223/5.56 involves the need to clean the barrel with a product like M Pro 7, soap and water, or diesel fuel when you use mildly corrosive/corrosive 5.45x39 ammunition. Once the barrel is clean and dry the final maintenance step involves applying a light film of oil or lubricant to the barrel to preserve the steel and prevent corrosion.
The M&P15R in 5.45x39 allows you to train with a rifle that is virtually identical to their M4/M16/AR-15 patrol rifles in 5.56 except 5.45x39mm ammo is at least 50 percent less expensive than 5.56.
To prove this point all you have to do is compare the price of ammunition and you will find that a case of 1,080 rounds of 5.45x39 generally has a retail price of $154 to $187, with the most expensive case of 5.45x39 ammunition costing $239.

The Weed Eater is a Ryobi Expand-it series weed eater, purchased at same time as mower, with curved arm weed eater attachment. This motor can be coupled to various attachments (i.e. longer straight armed weed eater head, edger bladed head, and even a blower attachment is available)
Both are less than a year old, been cleaned after every use (cause I'm particular like that) Ryobi needs the running card injector adjusted out by a 1/4 to a 1/2 turn counter clockwise, its very simple with the right tools (I adjusted the idle/start valve myself). Also have something close to 800 feet of Rhino tough (.095 inch)wire and the fuel/oil for the weedeater and ethanol mix for the mower. And one or two gas cans I can spare, that have some fuel for both engines already mixed properly.
Looking for best cash offer or something of decent trade value that would be relevant to this site. Serious inquiries will get respectful responses. Please don't waste your time telling me its not firearm related, I ALREADY KNOW! But I see trucks and all kinds of weird stuff listed and I saw several listings in Florida that wanted to trade their firearm related items for a lawn mower.

This is one of the most versatile guns I've ever owned being only about an inch wide with no external safety this could easily be a CCW. Also the 16+1 capacity of 9mm gives you plenty of firepower for home defense. The trigger pull is crisp and light which makes shooting that much more accurate and fun. Adjustable 3 dot sights. Loaded chamber indicator. Take down is easy, just like a Glock. The gun has only had 50 rounds through it and functions flawlessly. I'm including a hip holster and a 20 round box of Civil Defense 50 grain 2000fps +P self defense ammo. Also trigger lock and original box/paperwork.

This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
