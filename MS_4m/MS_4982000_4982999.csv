All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

A nice, albeit relatively used, Model 60 made by Glenfield (Marlin) complete with the ""squirrel stock""

Based on the serial number (20XXXXXX) and the Model 60 coding for dating production, this rifle is dated 1980.

In addition to being a tack driver, this rifle was produced before the change in tube length. Therefore this rifle has the full length tube magazine with a capacity of 17+1, a total of 18 rounds.

as for condition with rifle was used for varmint hunting as the stock has handling marks (no cracks, gouges, or defects) and the metal also has usage marks (light scratches, very minimal pitting).

However, the buffer was so old that it cracked over time and broke off the rifle the last time I went shooting. However, this part can be found for around $10 online (will deduct $20 from total price to cover it and shipping costs on your end). Trigger guard also had a cracked tang, but looks like it was fixed with some type of epoxy. Has not been a problem for me. (Will also deduct from total price)

That being said, I have kept this rifle very clean and oiled. Every time I used it, it has been cleaned and oiled afterwards.

JM stamped barrel

Bill of Sale WILL be filled out.

Would make a great first rifle for a child or a great all around plinking gun."

I am hoping to locate some .25 Rem and .30 Rem ammo to shoot in Model 14 Remington Pump Rifles. I would prefer Factory Loads, but realize that they have not been made recently. Trusted reloads are therefore a consideration. I would like to try out these ""blasts from the past"" rifles, but do not personally reload. I will reply to all contacts. Thank you."

Though it is a New Model, with transfer bar safety after 1972, it does not have the horrid liability warning on the left side of the barrel; they started that in 1980 or so. It has a 5 1/2-inch barrel and, since it has a hooked grip frame, could have been an original 7 1/2-inch. It looks to be shortened and beautifully recrowned. The finish has some slight scuffing on the cylinder and shows a bit of muzzle finish wear. Otherwise, the bore and chambers are spotless and shiny. Like a typical Ruger single-action, it is tough and accurate, and will make a perfect hunting or woods companion! Due to file size limitation, I was limited on photos; I have several more."
