This is a brand new Taurus PT92 Black DA/SA Semi Auto 9MM 17 Round Handgun with 2 Magazines and 1/2-28"" Threaded Barrel.  In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.SpecificationsItem #: 1-920151-17UPC_Code: REDACTED27Description: TAU PT92 9MM DA PST 17RD FS BManufacturer: TaurusModel #: PT92Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: BlueStock: Checkered RubberSights: FixedBarrel: 5.5 Threaded 1/2-28""Overall Length: 8.5""Weight: 34 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 17+1Action: Double Action# of Mags: 2Receiver: Picatinny RailFeatures: Ambidextrous Three Position Safety & DecockerIs this firearm legal in your state?  It is your responsibility to know your State and Local handgun laws.No Refunds Will Be Given On Any Firearm That Is Not Transferable.Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.  There is a 3% fee for credit card purchases to cover processing feesThere are no returns on firearms.  Warranty Issues Are Handled By The Manufacturer.Shipping  $28.00 If Required.   I must recieve your local dealers FFL before the item can ship.    Your dealer may email or fax his FFL.  Fax  REDACTEDLocal pickup is available by appointment.   Call REDACTED to make an appointment.You must have a pistol permit or current Concealed Carry Permit for handguns.  A NCDL or State ID is required for all firearms."

This is a brand new Taurus PT92 Black DA/SA Semi Auto 9MM 17 Round Handgun with 2 Magazines.  In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.SpecificationsItem #: 1-920151-17UPC_Code: REDACTED27Description: TAU PT92 9MM DA PST 17RD FS BManufacturer: TaurusModel #: PT92Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: BlueStock: Checkered RubberSights: FixedBarrel: 5""Overall Length: 8.5""Weight: 34 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 17+1Action: Double Action# of Mags: 2Receiver: Picatinny RailFeatures: Ambidextrous Three Position Safety & DecockerIs this firearm legal in your state?  It is your responsibility to know your State and Local handgun laws.No Refunds Will Be Given On Any Firearm That Is Not Transferable.Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.  There is a 3% fee for credit card purchases to cover processing feesThere are no returns on firearms.  Warranty Issues Are Handled By The Manufacturer.Shipping  $28.00 If Required.   I must recieve your local dealers FFL before the item can ship.    Your dealer may email or fax his FFL.  Fax  REDACTEDLocal pickup is available by appointment.   Call REDACTED to make an appointment.You must have a pistol permit or current Concealed Carry Permit for handguns.  A NCDL or State ID is required for all firearms."

It is ridiculous what some people are asking for ammo they bought when they thought the world was coming to an end, I guess.

The shooting season is starting to ramp up for the 2015 year. Every year I buy a god awful amount of ammo for the shooting sport. Last year nearly all came from local gun shops and sporting goods stores. These clowns advertising on Armslist are crazy. Here is a revelation for those advertisers, THE AMMO CRUNCH YOU CREATED LAST YEAR IS OVER!! Ever gun shop I go in has ammo in every caliber, cheaper than what is listed here.

Having Beretta USA build my dream 92 series pistol is awesome and I’m very happy that a lot of people will be able to enjoy this fine pistol model."" -Bill Wilson"

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For Sale: 1965 Marlin 39A golden takedown rifle. .22 s/l/lr, 24 inch microgroove barrel. In good condition for a 50 year old rifle, not museum quality but no major dings or scratches in the wood. Blueing is about 85% with no rust. Lever action and tubular fed, holds 19LR, 21 Long and 26 short. I replaced the Ejector assembly last year, runs flawlessly. This is a pre-safety model and uses the Half-cock position as a safety. The hammer has a detachable spur on it to manipulate the hammer when a scope is mounted. It can be changed for right or left hand shooters. This is a take-down model, remove one screw on the reciever and the stock and receiver detach from the barrel, makes it easy to transport and clean the rifle. The top of the receiver is drilled and tapped and has a rimfire rail attached to allow easy scope mount using rimfire rings. Rifle currently has a Simmons 4X32 rimfire scope mounted on it using Simmons steel rimfire rings. I have the manual to go with it also. The 39A is the longest running .22 production rifle in the U.S. This 1965 model was made when Marlin was an independent company, you can tell by the craftsmanship. The 39A is still made today but by Remington. they go for $600.00 new and according to the reviews I have read they are garbage. This rifle still has the original sling on it also.

Not interested in any trades, I am asking $600.00 cash or make me an offer but keep it real. Check on Gunbroker and Armslist, my price is in the ballpark. Buyer must be a FL resident with valid DL, willing to sign a firearms bill of sale. Must be willing to meet near Leesburg FL FTF. Serial number on this rifle is AA9887 which dates it to 1965 production year."

This is a brand new Smith & Wesson 642 Pro Series Stainless Steel 38+P With 1.85 Inch Barrel,  5 Shots, Cylinder Cut For Quick Reload Moon Rings and a Life Time Warranty.  A great home protection firearm or concealed carry Weapon.Completing the line between main production and the Performance Center, the Smith & Wesson Pro Series represents the next step from standard models. These firearms are offered with a variety of enhancements yet still remain true to ""stock."" Bringing competition specifications and features to factory models, the Pro Series offer that ready-to-go package while still maintaining production line integrity.Lightweight Personal Defense. The Smith & Wesson 642 Pro Series is a hammerless revolver that reduces weight by way of an aluminum alloy frame. Chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, it has a five shot cylinder and barrel liner that are constructed out of stainless steel. The designation ""Pro Series"" is due to the fact the cylinder is cut for moon clips to allow for faster loading and unloading. It is rated for +P ammunition, which makes it a handful when shooting more than a cylinder or two. But there’s no reason to shoot lots of hot, duty-type ammo through this small revolver. The gun's purpose is simple- it was designed to save your life in an emergency. It is specifically geared toward the concealed carry market, an area where it has served with distinction for several decades. The 642 is lightweight, compact, easy to carry, easy to draw, easy to use and enjoys an excellent power-to-weight ratio. The Smith & Wesson Airweight is celebrated for its reliability, while remaining one of the best carry revolvers ever made.Cylinder Cut for Moon Clips: (2 included)- A ""moon clip"" is a ring-shaped piece of metal designed to hold multiple cartridges together as a unit, for simultaneous insertion and extraction from a revolver cylinder.   Designed for quick reloads.Specifications SKU: 178042Model: 642Caliber: .38 S&W Special +PCapacity: 5 RoundsBarrel Length: 1.875"" / 4.7 cmFront Sight: IntegralRear Sight: FixedOverall Length: 6.3125"" / 16.0 cmAction: Double Action OnlyFrame Size: Small - Internal HammerWeight: 15 oz / 425.3 gGrip: SyntheticFrame Material: Aluminum Alloy FrameStainless Steel CylinderBarrel Material: Stainless SteelFinish: Matte SilverPurpose: Personal ProtectionProfessional / DutyIs this firearm legal in your state?  It is your responsibility to know your State and Local handgun laws.No Refunds Will Be Given On Any Firearm That Is Not Transferable.Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.  There is a 3% fee for credit card purchases to cover processing feesThere are no returns on firearms.  Warranty Issues Are Handled By The Manufacturer.Shipping  $28.00 If Required.   I must recieve your local dealers FFL before the item can ship.    Your dealer may email or fax his FFL.  Fax  REDACTEDLocal pickup is available by appointment.   Call REDACTED to make an appointment.You must have a pistol permit or current Concealed Carry Permit for handguns.  A NCDL or State ID is required for all firearms."

A TRUE COLLECTOR PIECE.

This IS NOT ONE OF THE 925 ALL STEEL SLIDE/ FRAME SMITH AND WESSON MADE FOR ONE YEAR ONLY( they bring $2000.00 all day ).
BUT IT IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST MODEL 39 NO DASH MADE WHICH, FOR ALL VISUAL APPEARANCE, IS IN MINT  ( possibly UNFIRED except at factory), WITH ORIGINAL BOX IN SAME CONDITION AND NUMBERED TO THE PISTOL'S SERIAL NUMBER.... 36 xxx. The ORIGINAL BOX HAS THE ORIGINAL WAXED PAPER,MANUAL, AND TWO ORIGINAL MODEL 39 CLIPS. IT'S TRULY DIFFICULT TO LABEL THIS MODEL 39 AS "" LIKE NEW IN THE BOX, "" WHEN IT APPEARS UNFIRED AND COULD EASILY BE LABELED NIB. HOWEVER, common sense tells me it might have had A CLIP RUN THROUGH IT, BUT NOT VISIBLE TO ME.

THE S & W MODEL 39 GREATNESS IS IN ITS FEEL WHEN IN THE HAND. THIS IS NO DOUBT DUE IN PART TO ITS "" BOB TAIL"" GRIP FRAME CURVATURE WHICH WAS ANOTHER "" FIRST IN THE USA,"" MUCH LATER SEEN IN THE DAN WESSON DESIGNED 1911 PLATFORM  DESIGN.... NOW FOLLOWED BY MANY OTHERS.

THIS SEMI- AUTO 9mm BY SMITH & WESSON WAS ALSO THE VERY FIRST SEMI AUTO PISTOL MADE IN THE USA WITH A DE-COCKER SAFETY FEATURE FOR SA OR DA FUNCTIONING ( this was somewhat of a copy of the German P-38). IT'S APPEAL TO LAWMEN AND CIVILIAN ALIKE IS LEGENDARY. IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR THE HAND, WITH A NATURAL POINTING ABILITY THAT PUTS IT ON TARGET VERY FAST. 

AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, IT WAS THE "" FIRST BOBTAIL SEMI AUTO PISTOL IN THE USA. IT'S DEPENDABILITY ON RUNNING ON ALMOST ANY 9mm AMMO IS ALSO WELL KNOWN AND ADMIRED.

THIS MODEL 39 NO DASH IS DEFINITELY OF COLLECTIBLE QUALITY. THERE IS ALSO A S. & W MODEL 39 BLACK BASKET WEAVE HOLSTER AVAILABLE BUT I'VE NEVER HOLSTERED THIS PRISTINE PISTOL. IF THE S& W MODEL 39 HOLSTER IS DESIRED, ADD $49.00 TO TOTAL, AS IT HAS COLLECTOR VALUE WITHIN ITSELF.

This pistol is a very affordable replica of the old Colt SAA .45LC.  This is the 5 1/2 inch barrel version chambered in .45 Long Colt with hard rubber grips.  Please see a review on this pistol on the Gunblast web site:  http://www.gunblast.com/USFA_Rodeo.htm

I have put 50 rounds through this pistol and aside from light turn marks on the cylinder, it looks and operates like new.  Includes the box, soft storage bag and manufacturers paperwork.  No low ball offers, I know what this pistol is worth and do not need sell.  If you are looking for a nice, well built, quality and affordable SAA in .45 Long Colt contact me.  I prefer a face to face sale.  I want you to see this pistol in person before you buy.  This pistol was purchased new from Murf's Guns in Duncan several years ago.  USFA was not listed as a manufacturer so my choice was Colt.  THIS IS NOT A COLT MADE PISTOL.  I will remove this listing when the pistol is sold."

I am selling my beautiful Smith & Wesson M&P 9 Pro handgun. This is a  9mm semi automatic handgun that has been taken care of meticulously from the day i bought it. It also comes with night sights and an extended barrel/slide from the factory. This gun is just beautiful and also comes with a trigger job straight from the factory. I purchased this from a reputable dealer in town brand new. I have honestly fired less than 200 rounds since I bought it (it was my range gun never carried it), and the gun will show that there is no wear on the pistol what so ever.

The handgun comes with the original box, magazines , manuals and everything else that comes in the box. 

I am selling this because I am in a financial bind and I need to pay some bills. I hate to see this beautiful gun go but I must due to my situation.
I am asking for 500 OBO due to the Mint Condition of the firearm.
I have been selling on Armslist/Craigslist for many years and have never had a bad transaction. I do require to meet in a safe place to meet for yours and my safety.

This is made in the USA with high quality materials and is the same stuff that many Law Enforcement Agencies use for training and practice.

Yes, it does make a difference and you should ""practice how you fight"".

Button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore's length. Every AB3 barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace. Barrel's target-type Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory. Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy. Free-floating barrel eliminates contact interference from the foreend, enabling the barrel to perform consistently and accurately to reach its full potential. Integrated trigger design delivers a crisp 3.5-lb. pull that breaks like glass. Mount your scope close to the center of the bore using the precision-machined standard-length steel action to minimize the offset between the bore centerline and optical centerline. Fast 60° bolt lift keeps your thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action. Matte electroless nickel-plated bolt body ensures smooth operation and added corrosion resistance. Use the bolt unlock button to unload the chamber with the safety in the safe position. Top-tang safety allows easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. Generous trigger guard allows easy access, even while wearing gloves. Detachable, staggered box magazine has a rugged formed steel body and feed lips for added durability. Magazine has a three-round capacity in magnum calibers and four-round capacity in standard calibers. Innovative Inflex technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from your face when firing to reduce felt recoil and flinching. Durable matte-blued steel finish on all external surfaces minimizes reflection and corrosion resistance. Rugged matte-black synthetic stock. Pre-installed steel sling swivel studs for easy mounting of your sling or bipod. Receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts, which are included!  MSRP $600.00 $450  ANIB  Price does not include scope."

Well here is a real Colt, A2 HBAR in excellent shape. I do not have a box but it came in a green box which is how a real preban came packaged. I love this rifle but I have a bad back and I just can't pack it around or even hold it up for extended periods to shoot offhand in the Highpower match. These rifles will shoot under 1in groups all day long with the right ammo. It's ready for Service Rifle just the way it is but if you free float the barrel and get a trigger job she will shoot like a dream. It has a 1/7 twist and that is the correct spec for this model. Loves the 77gr but will do very good with the 62, 63 or 75gr as well. This is further defined as a transition model because it does not have the magazine fence. This is one of the real ones and it's a Colt also. At this price this rifle is a steal and will only increase in value as the years go by. I'll include 2 30 round mags in the deal one new and another an old but functional aluminum mag."

I will not reply to time wasting offers or trades. 
The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. 6 Round Magazine.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

I have a excellent condition Soviet AK-47 made in Russia Saiga under folder, the true AK-47, everything else are copies of these, very rare, Atlantic firearms only sold these for one year, probably one the rarest Saiga AKs, this one has the rare Y mark on the receiver, and all the Russian Saiga Izmash markings that collectors want.
 I never saw another one for sale any where, online, gun auctions, gun shows, or gun shops.
 It's in perfect working condition runs like a Swiss watch and very accurate for a Ak, it has few handling marks, no nicks or dents, only thing it has a rub mark on the receiver where it's marked made in Russia where you can see on the photo, it came like that when I first got it new, it has around 300 rounds down the pipe, cleaned and always in a dehumidified gun safe, and since Saigas are banned from importation they will make a great investment compare to any other AK's on the market. Comes with a cleaning rod, manual, 3 waffle 30 round mags, and the box. Priced for a quick sale, Cash only, No trades, buyer must be over 18 and have a valid Georgia ID. Thanks for looking."

A one-piece, receiver-mounted MIL-STD 1913 optical rail comes standard, along with three rails attached to the stock’s fore-end for mounting a battery of tactical lights and lasers. The matte black synthetic pistol grip tactical stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull via interchangeable inserts, and for cast on or cast off using interchangeable shims.
