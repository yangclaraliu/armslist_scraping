This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. We began noticing the fit, finish and function of the Novak Brand Magazines for the past several years. Here are their high capacity production mates for recent production Beretta 92 and M9 series pistols. Manufacturer is ACT-Mag s.r.l. of Gardone V.T., Italy. Exclusive importer and warrantor is Fusion Firearms of Venice, FL. These are superbly finished blue steel magazines with high impact polymer cartridge followers and floorplates. Each magazine holds 15 rounds of 9mm ammunition: 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the Beretta open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time. These magazines will fit any Beretta 9mm metal frame pistol that has its magazine release beside the trigger guard, and that accommodates a double stacked magazine. That includes models 90-Two, 92SB, 92F, 92FS, and M9. They will fit 92SB and 92FS Compacts, but will protrude from their grip frame of course. They will also fit any 9mm rifles designed to accept Beretta magazine like some variants of the CX4 and Kel-Tec Sub 2000 rifles. They will not fit a Taurus 92 or 99; will not fit old model 92 or 92S Berettas made before 1984. Our single magazine price is $24.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $18 each. Own 3 for only     $ 54.00.

It replaces the original rear dust cover. I also paid a gunsmith $35 to precision fit it so it holds your optic true. A lot of people buy them and put them on and wonder why the scope won't hold true. It still has the original bayonet and cleaning rod that comes with it along with the original dust cover if you ever want to get rid of the optic mount . The guy I got it off of had a folder stock on it that I did not like so it also comes with that. $15 forward grip. It has a button on it that when you press it it shoots a bipod out the bottom that is spring loaded. Oh and a gun lock of course. Shoots great. Text or call 513-504-2511."

I just bought the case this year, maybe 3 months ago, I ended up selling my AR-15 right after buying this case.  The case is in like NEW condition.  Awesome case by the way.  36"" in the ""Green"" color, this color is tough to find.  This is a soft padded case with mega storage for mag clips, ammo, 2 handguns and 2 rifles.  I also have some .223 ammo and a couple of magazines for the AR-15 if anyone is interested in those I'm going to try and post a second ad, but just in case I mentioned it here.  The ammo and mags are ""not"" included.  Call for details.  This gun case sells for roughly $75 so this one will save you some money and as I said, it is like new and never even left my house with it.  No range nothing.  You can have everything, if your interested for $100, that's two PMAG 30 round clips and 120 various rounds ""retail"" rounds, ""not reloads"".  Or, as I said I will take $50 for the case only.  The clips are new as well, all I did was load them with rounds and it was never shot, never left the house with any of this stuff.  NO TRADES.  Sorry, cash only.  Save some money.  As I said this ad is only for the case.  If you want the ammo and clips for another $50, let me know, I am going to try and list another ad just for the ammo and clips.  thanks and Happy Holidays,  please, serious and ready to buy buyers only, it's Thanksgiving....

Here are the specs in hopes that you might be interested.

It sits in an MDT LSS Chassis which is made from 6061 aluminum with a black cerakote finish. This chassis is designed to be modular and compatible with AR-15 accessories. It accepts and will come with (1) 10 round AICS metal magazine. This chassis allows the same buttstock configurations as any AR-15. Right now it is setup with a carbine length, collapsible MFT Battlelink Utility stock and buffer tube with adjustable cheek riser, but will also come with an adaptor to allow for a fixed A1/A2 rifle stock if desired. The optic is a Weaver Kaspa Series 3-12x44 with illuminated ballistic reticles and finger adjustable turrets. It has an AR-15 style Ergo grip, a 6""-9"" Harris style bipod and a custom clamp on muzzle brake by Witt Machine. I also have a black tactical rifle bag for it. 

I have all the original packaging for the modular components as well as the unused original Rem 783 stock and hardware.

I have over $900 invested before the cost of the 783 which I purchased new. Below are some web links referencing the components of my build.

By the way...I haven't put a round through it yet.

I'm selling my Taurus PT111 MILLENNIUM G2. It's an awesome shooter, and is shockingly accurate for it's small size. I originally bought it to conceal and carry. It's 12+1 capacity is amazing for a handgun of this size. It's great on the range and has performed flawlessly - not a single hang up. I've probably shot 400 rounds through and I've always cleaned it. The gun is new - it was manufactured in March if my memory serves me correctly.

This is an awesome gun for the price. The longer I've had it the more I've realized it's awesome features. Here are some of my favorites.
- DA/SA so you can keep either a heavy double action trigger pull (some people like this for carrying) or a crisp and light single action trigger pull (which is regarded as better for target shooting).
- Nice sights, adjustable (and replaceable if you choose).
- Has a safety switch on the frame, a trigger safety (like a Glock), and a drop-safe firing pin safety.
- Stippling on the grip is excellent.
- Takedown for cleaning is very easy.
- There is a tool which can disable the whole gun for safe storage.
- Lifetime warranty.
etc.

I've got the box and the two magazines that came with the gun and everything which came originally packaged. The gun has been carried so cosmetically there is some blueing rubbed away and some other blemishes. Functionally it's perfect.

I've attached the factory photos, but I can take some pictures of my specific one if you like.

Here are some more specs from Taurus:

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

It was previously used as a hunting gun (mainly waterfowl and turkey) so it does have some cosmetic wear on it. I installed a Choate magazine extension bringing the capacity to 9 in the mag tube plus 1 in the chamber. It would make a good project gun for someone looking to build a tactical shotgun. They are $267 new from Wal-Mart and the magazine tube is $45 from Midway so I am firm on my price at $300. I am looking for a Gen 4 Glock 19 or 17.

Never before has a handgun so diminutive been built to such high standards for performance and reliability. Every feature of the RM380 has been fine-tuned to deliver unfailing function with unrivaled accuracy and control in the most extreme conditions on earth - the fight of your life. It's simply the most complete fusion of confidence and concealment to ever hit the Every Day Carry category.Serious Mettle.Crafted with a steel slide and aluminum frame, the RM380 delivers a rare breed of durability in the micro-pistol class. Its all-metal construction makes it inherently easier to control under stress.Tested and Proven.In an research and development process measured in hundreds of thousands of rounds, every facet of this handgun has been optimized to function smoothly and reliably in a wide range of conditions - from extreme cold to blistering heat, dirty or clean, whenever and wherever you need it most.Well Rounded.In conjunction with its extremely compact profile, the RM380 has been rounded and smoothed in all key areas to improve concealment, minimize print and enable a quick, clean draw. From inside your waistband or from your pocket, it's a smooth operator.Smooth, Light and Crisp.Compare its trigger to others in its class, and you'll instantly be impressed. It promotes both safety and improved accuracy with smooth, extended travel, a lighter pull weight and a crisp, consistent break.Full Control.To make pointing and shooting the RM380 as intuitive as possible, we started at the grip. The angle of its grip naturally places the barrel in close alignment with your hand so precision shot placement is second nature. The dimensions of the grip also give it the sure handling of a larger-framed pistol.Instant Accuracy Upgrade.Because the RM380 features the longest barrel in its class, it has a built-in advantage in shot-to-shot precision. This also helps achieve higher velocities, which translates to more effective bullet expansion and stopping power.Key FeaturesRugged Fixed Sights for a no snag drawPositive cocking serrationsFully Functional Slide Stop Locks open after last round Aluminum Frame for enhanced durability and product lifeLong, Smooth, Light Double Action Only Trigger for safety and shootabilityMagazine Release ambidextrous and low profileUndercut Trigger Guard allows for higher hand holdReplaceable Grip Panels for comfort and style upgradesSpecificationsModel RM380 Manufacturer Number96454Caliber.380 AutoMagazine Capacity6+1 RoundsBarrel Length2.9 Inches StainlessOverall Width.94 InchesOverall Length5.27 InchesOverall Height3.86 InchesTrigger Pull8.9 PoundsFinishSatin Black OxideSlide Stainless SteelAverage Weight Empty12.2 Ounces"

Gun is in very good condition, only has a couple tiny dings in the frame, and a tiny bit of slide wear, but still has about 98% bluing. 

Previous owner did not ever replace the guide rod and spring, I replaced them both with brand new ones, but the guide rod still sticks a bit during disassembly/assembly. This does NOT affect the way the gun shoots, it functions 100%. 

Mag disconnect has been removed from the gun, but comes with it in case you want to pop it back in. Only takes a few minutes.

Gun comes with one 13 round mag, factory grips, nice set of eagle wood grips, and a very nice set of wood grips with finger grooves. So 3 sets of grips total.

Sig Sauer:
The SIG556® HOLO features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by Swiss Arms and marries it to a CNC machined from 7075-T6 grade aluminum forged trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 HOLO features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The SIG556 HOLO has a proven two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system joined to a lightweight alloy trigger housing that accepts standard AR magazines. The vented non-slip polymer forearm has three Picatinny rails for accessory mounting. Sight options include front combat sight, flip-up rear sight, and a red dot style holographic sighting system that allows for quick target acquisition, with four illuminated reticle patterns with adjustable intensities. The SIG556 buttstock is collapsible and has a rubber butt pad and a number of sling attachment points. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds.

I have a Eddystone Model of 1917, caliber .30-06.  Sometimes known as the American Enfield, this was the main battle rifle of the American Expeditionary Force that went to France to fight in WWI.  Sargent York used one when he fought in France in his famous encounter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_C._York 
York worked his way into position to silence the German machine guns. York recalled:

And those machine guns were spitting fire and cutting down the undergrowth all around me something awful. And the Germans were yelling orders. You never heard such a racket in all of your life. I didn't have time to dodge behind a tree or dive into the brush... As soon as the machine guns opened fire on me, I began to exchange shots with them. There were over thirty of them in continuous action, and all I could do was touch the Germans off just as fast as I could. I was sharp shooting... All the time I kept yelling at them to come down. I didn't want to kill any more than I had to. But it was they or I. And I was giving them the best I had.

During the assault, six German soldiers in a trench near York charged him with fixed bayonets. York had fired all the rounds in his M1917 Enfield rifle, but drew his .45 Colt automatic pistol and shot all six soldiers before they could reach him.

This one was manufactured in 1918 and as far as I can tell is in basically original overall condition.  In other words, it has not been refurbished or rebuilt.  The finish is great with some original bluing left with the normal patina expected, no rust anywhere on the rifle.  The stock certainly looks to have been lightly sanded and varnished and is in great shape with some light cartouches still visible.  The rifling is strong, the bolt smooth and locks up perfectly, shoots excellent, no issues.  I will include a correct 1917 bayonet with the rifle (no scabbard)  I have had a lot of fun shooting it and it always attracts curiosity at the range.  I have really enjoyed letting young people shoot this piece of American Military history.  I doubt that you will ever see one like this in the store.

Now I am interested in moving on and trying other areas of my hobby. 

Sell or Trade: Cash sale $650 rifle, $150 Bayonet / offer, Trade value $800 +/- depending on what you have.  I will include some amount of .30-06 ball ammo with trade, depending.

Straight trade.  This is a C&R qualified rifle so no FFL needed to transfer, all laws apply and I will want a peek at your CO DL to prove residency, if trading I will pay my own transfer and BGC at NorCO area FFL."

But since you'll be carrying heavy gear, the vest itself is made of nylon mesh and designed to be light and cool while remaining durable. The vest is sized to ""one size fits most"" standards. Three adjustable straps on the sides allow the vest to expand to fit a 48"" chest and the waist belt expands to 40"". And what's a tactical vest without tons of storage! The TV1 features 3 double 5.56 magazine pouches and for that extra firepower there are 5 pistol magazine pockets. Don't forget your 5 shotgun shell loops just in case. And since you need something to shoot all that ammo, the vest includes an integrated draw holster with a mag pouch. For good measure, GMG threw in a pocket for a radio and another for first aid or other accessories. To prevent the vest from flopping around at the waist during activities, the integrated pistol belt fastens with a heavy duty clasp.All this is pretty much just the front of the vest! The back of the TV1 features 3 rows of ALICE webbing straps, suitable to accept MOLLE pouches. Each side has 3 adjustment straps that allow the vest to fit up to a chest size 48. The belt is adjustable up to a size 40.Available in black or digital camo."

Hello everyone,
	I have available for trade/sale a classic gun. This is a Radom PPS43C chambered in 9mm. This comes with 4 magazines, cleaning rod, magazine pouch, oil can (only one side is good), and dual point sling. This is a great little gun that you can either file for an SBR stamp, or have one of the locals make you a longer barrel in order to make the stock functional again.Or just keep it like it is! It is a blast to shoot and I wouldn’t sell it unless I had my heart set on a different model. I would keep this, but i am looking for a different type of carbine for a project I'm doing. This has the normal PPS43C feeding hiccups, etc, but could be worked out like most I imagine and it is an unreal blast to shoot! Surprisingly accurate as well. 
	I would also consider trades for certain firearm items. Mostly looking for Just Right carbines, Thureon Carbines, etc. Also would consider a Glock 17 with extras or threaded barrel. Other than that, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman. 
Thanks
