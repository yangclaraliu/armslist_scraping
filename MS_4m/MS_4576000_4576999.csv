I purchased this pistol from Earl’s Repair Service several years ago. This PPK was manufactured in ULM and has no import markings. It is unfired except for the factory testing. This gun is very unique in that not only is it a year 2000 PPK manufactured in Ulm but it also has a 5mm longer grip. According to Earl he received 30 of these PPK’s with the extended grip.
  However with this specific platform the PPK would meet all the requirements of the 1968 Gun Act which eliminated the import of the German made PPK pistols. S&W eventually got the contract and the PPK was manufactured in the U.S. from 2000 on. Regardless this is a very rare PPK, German made and German stamped. Comes with the original box, instruction booklet, test target, two magazines, the original receipt from Earls, and custom wooden grips."

Grab this quick.....it won't last long!

No lowball offers, please? The price represents a really decent value....If you disagree, please feel free to build your own, or go look elsewhere.

Here's a super-cool little utility trailer that can be pulled by any small car, wheeler or motorcycle.....it has a 1-7/8"" ball, standard four wire plug and is less than 200 pounds!
Overall length is 85 inches so it'll stand up in your garage without banging into the rafters.
Overall width is just 52"" from outsides of fenders. This will haul quite a bit more than most little MC sized trailers but doesn't weigh any more and looks cool!
AND it is loaded with features.....it started out as a 40-1/2"" x 48"" bed trailer with 4.80 x 8"" tires and I added the bumper (custom made, boards and the spare.

A rear bumper - the main purpose is so that the trailer can be upended onto the bumper and syored easily in a small space....you can store this baby in your garage ON IT'S END to save lots of space OR to do maintenance on the wheels and bearings.....a cool idea and the bumper is welded angle iron and 1"" square tubing, attached with 5/16 bolts.

Two sideboards made from clear stained pine with two coats of heavy spar urethane to protect them as well as to look good! This thing looks so cool and is pout together right. All bolts have washers and all nuts are nylon lockers so you shouldn't have problems with anything coming loose.

I bought the trailer used (barely!) in Texas from a man who put it together and used it once, not needing it anymore. I tightened all the fasteners and squared it up, adding a new spare tire/bracket.

As I said, I made the bumper and added the boards, tucking in all the wiring neatly. All lights work well, and I pulled it back from Texas with about 600 pounds in it at about 65 mph, so it has about 1400 miles on it now. I pulled it in overdrive with no temperature rise at all. I put this together right with the intention of keeping it but with another trailer, just don't have room for another trailer.....
Toolbox has been sold - trailer only for sale now.

I will sell with a bill of sale (it has a VIN but no title) so you can register it in your name when you license it (or if you plan to use it off-road it won't need a license!)

Just $225 cash.....a bargain for what this little trailer is!

Trailer alone with wood boards, bumper and spare $225.00 cash

Toolbox (aluminum treadplate) without trailer (SOLD)

I would be willing to trade for other ammo. If you have .38 special, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP, or .22LR, I’m open. If you are interested, let me know."

I have a Howa 1500 that I am looking to sell.  The gun has always treated me well.  The action is very smooth and locks up really tight.  It has a floating barrel as well for added accuracy.  I don't shoot it very often as I have quite a few other rifles chambered in .223.  This rifle has a bull barrel and Hogue OD Green furniture.  This rifle would make a great varmint or coyote gun.  It has a 4-16x50 Nikko Sterling scope on it with a mil dot reticle and exposed turrets.  Like I said, I am just looking to downsize the collection and am willing to discuss all offers and trades so long as they are reasonable.  All ATF rules apply.  Thanks, Brandon"

Up for sale is a Ruger gp100, mossberg mvp predator, mosin nagant m44 not refurbished, and a Turkish Mauser.

The Ruger gp100 is .357 mag and comes with soft holster, speed loader holster, two speed loaders, box, and over 500 rounds of ammo. 25 rounds of Remington golden saber .38spl+p, 50 rounds of Remington .38spl+p, and over 425 rounds of a mix of hornady, pmc, Remington, and Speer .357 ammo. Asking $725 but feel free to make an offer.

Next up is a Mossberg MVP varmint in 5.56/.223. With the 24 inch fluted bull barrel, ten round magazine, sling, blackhawk bipod that travels both horizontally and vertically, and a weaver kaspa 2.5-10x44mm black matte mildot scope model #849814. Asking $750 on this one.

Now an oldie but goodie, Mosin nagant M44. This one is not as common as it is in a wartime, hardwood stock, and is not refurbished. It doesn't have any matching numbers which is also indicative of being a nonrefurbed gun. Asking 250 on this one and have ammo if needed.

Lastly is a Turkish Mauser M38. It is a gun that was sold to the Turks by the Germans and you can tell this by the markings on the receiver of the original German serial number being barely visible. All numbers match except the bolt. Asking $185 on this one and it includes 34 mostly Turkish 8mm stripper clips. Also have ammo if needed.

Overall, the rifle is in pretty good condition. There is one blemish spot, which I will include a picture of. To me, it doesn't hurt the value or ""cosmetic"" look of the rifle, but I'm also the type of person that views them as tools and not safe queens. The rifle will also come with a UTG flashlight, with pressure switch cap on it. The rifle WILL NOT come with any mags. I'm going to try to price this rifle as fair as I can. I'm mostly wanting to sell it, to finish my other build, but I am open to trades, as the title says. Don't be afraid to send me an offer, the worst I can say is no. If your trade is valued less than mine, I will require some cash on top. That will all be discussed prior to trading. A bill of sale will also be signed.

Most people will throw on some AR-style accessories and call it modern, but this fundamentally changed to turn it an AK that is up-to-date.  

The original 45-degree gas block has been replaced by a 90-degree Bolton Gas Block, which brings your sight post closer to the eye.  The barrel has been shortened by a to 14"" and a Venom Tactical Muzzle Break has been pinned giving it the proper 16.5"" length required by law; this alone changes the balance and weight distribution of the gun, making for tighter control.  The moving parts of the firearm have been worked and smoothed slowly over the period of a year. 

All work requiring gunsmithing was preformed by a professional in the Central Kentucky region.

Overall, the firearm will include:
- WASR-10 AK47 SBR, 7.62x39
- Bolton Gas Block with Sight Post
- Venom Tactical Muzzle Device (welded)
- Ultimak Gas Tube, vented
- Houge rubberized hand grip and foregrip
- Magpul AFG
- Widened rear sight leaf
- Romanian gas piston, pinned to the bolt carrier
- Tapco retainer plate
- 3 30rd Magazines
- Original wooden parts for rifle and hand grip
- Some type of sling

I never got around to getting a triangle folding stock for this, which would have been my last upgrade.  I also have a red dot I could throw in for $60.  

Overall this thing shoots better than any standard AK I've ever fired.  It has less recoil, better sights, and tighter control.  Unfortunately it does not double as a truck and that's ultimately what I need more in my life at the moment.  

Serious inquires only; research Jim and his work at RD if you're unsure what the effects are of having this type of work preformed to an AK-47 rifle.

This particular one was marketed as the ""Cowboys Companion"", imported by Navy Arms Co. Ridgefield,NJ. 
 It is all original, with all the typical features unique to the CC. This site illustrates the various featurs that differentiate the Cowboys Companion verion from any others. http://chinesesks.weebly.com/navy-c-c.html
 The gun is in terrific condition, obviously not shot much, but runs reliably when it has been. Bluing is in great shape, the bore is crisp and shiny. It has the cleaning kit in the buttstock. The wood stock has a few minor dings, like every other SKS I've ever seen, and a hella lot less than most of them, it looks great.
  The receiver is machined steel, the barrel is threaded, with the short barrel lug. The serial number dates it as having a 1976 manufacture date, and all numbers are matching.
These run on the standard SKS 10-rd fixed magazine.
 As always, I have no problem with a test fire, if you have a safe and CONVENIENT place to shoot.
  That's all the relevant info that occurs to me, but I can probably answer any other questions.
All the typical legal stuff applies: any prospective buyer must be fully legal to own firearms, and must be a legal Georgia resident over age 18, and show a drivers license to verify it, and of course, I'll show my DL and Ga carry permit. 
Any response should include some details so I know you're a legit local buyer, not scammer or spam-bot, which means I'll ignore suspicious and vague messages that just say stuff like, ""do you still have it"", or, ""send me your number"", or ""I am interested in the item"".
The rifle for sale is obviously the lower one in the photo (sorry, the sling isn't included). Trades considered, but they'd have to be in my favor, and a straight cash sale is still preferred. Thanks for looking....."

100 Rounds- Winchester PDX1 Defender. These are the genuine PDX1 rounds, in ""over-run"" white boxes. Not exactly sure how that works out, with what little research I did, I found that Winchester often ends up with ""extra"" ammunition on top of batch quota's, and they load these into white 50rd boxes. Regardless, in smaller quantities these go for nearly $1 per round... I paid $40 per box.

It is black, in excellent shape because it hasn't been used much.  The stock folds to the side for cleaning so you don't have to move the cheek piece once you have it set where you want it.  It comes with one 5 round flush fit magazine and I will throw in a second 5 round flush fit magazine for the total selling price of the stock.  10 round magazines are available from several different online stores or US Tactical in Albany.   STOCK ONLY WITH 2 FIVE ROUND MAGAZINES- $850.

Only the stock is for sale for the listed price.  The stock is currently on a Remington 700 SPS AAC-SD barreled action.  If you are interested in the entire package as is, I'm willing to sell it.  The rifle is a 20"" heavy barreled (factory heavy, not like an MTU contour) 1/10 twist, 416 stainless barrel.  It is threaded and the muzzle break pictured is not for sale or included (It is a mount for my suppressor)  It has a Timney trigger set to 2 lbs, a Badger Ordnance bolt knob, a TPS 20 MOA scope base, and TPS 30mm rings.  The scope is a Vortex Viper PST FFP (first focal plane- reticle changes size with magnification so it is always correct when using it for holdovers) 4-16x50 with the MRAD- mil/mil reticle and turrets.  It has a zero stop feature, excellent glass for the money, and includes a bubble level and throw lever for the magnification ring.  

I don't NEED to sell the whole package but I'm willing to do so.  I can even take payments over a few months (I keep the rifle until paid) and then we will go through an FFL for the new background check law.  I keep the rifle and money if you don't pass.

I am a fan of Kahr pistols and have owned about twenty and currently have five.  I am offering three for sale, but I am only willing to sell two of them.  As soon as either one of the pocket sized .40 calibers sells, the other one returns to my safe.  I have several 9mm compact pistols, so I am going to sell this one.  The first gun in the picture is a CW9 9mm compact that is brand new.  The price is $380.  The second gun in the picture is a CM40 .40 caliber sub-compact that is also brand new.  The price is $400.  The third gun is a PM40 .40 caliber sub-compact that is blemish free, never been carried and shot only a handful of rounds.  They all have stainless slides, but the PM has a factory Black Diamond coating.  The two .40 caliber guns are the exact same size and all three are very slim at about 3/4"" and weigh about 15-16 ounces.  The difference in the PM vs CM are as follows:   It has a molded plastic case, a polygonal rifled match barrel to increase the muzzle velocity in a 3"" barrel to match those of a larger sized pistol.  It also comes with a spare magazine.  The PM model gets a dovetailed metal front sight and all square edges on the slide are machined smooth.  The frames and internals are the same on both guns.  Kahr just wanted to bring out a more affordable line to compete price wise with other manufacturers, so they added the ""C"" series since Kahr handguns are expensive.  All Kahrs have amazing triggers, polished feed ramps, stainless slide rails and are top shelf quality.  The price of the PM40 is $500.  ALL PRICES ARE FIRM.  I have them priced fairly and I am not willing to negotiate the prices.  I doubt I could make a trade as I have found the only way to successfully trade is to overprice my guns to allow for the unrealistic amounts people want for their trades and I didn't.  That means a trade that I take will also have to be priced right.  My PM40 retails for about $899.  I am also picky on what guns I own.  Every gun I have is new or like new in original box and I only have a handful of brands that I like.  I like Kahr, most Sigs, FNH, Springfields, most S&W, Ruger, Browning, Walther and Colt.  No long guns except maybe a Keltec KSG.  No 1911's.  I already have basically one of everything from Springfield.  POSSIBLE TRADES: A FNH FNS, a DA/SA Sig, a J frame S&W revolver, a Ruger GP101 .357, possibly a Browning or Walther and a very large DA revolver such as a Ruger .454 Casull, S&W .460 or .500, or possibly a .44 magnum.  I am in the Grassland area of Franklin and willing to meet at an agreed upon place in south Nashville, Brentwood, Franklin, Fairview, Spring Hill, or Thompson Station.  If you have a trade that might work, please send a picture and price."

Like the LC9, the LC9s is a slim, lightweight, personal protection pistol that is chambered in 9mm Luger. The LC9s features a newly designed trigger mechanism with a short, light, crisp trigger pull that improves accuracy and performance.“The Ruger LC9 set a high standard for reliable, lightweight personal protection,” said Chris Killoy, Ruger President and Chief Operating Officer. “The LC9s follows the success of the LC9, yet provides a new option for shooters who prefer the short, crisp trigger pull of a striker-fired pistol,” he added.The LC9s uses the same holsters, extended magazines, lasers and accessories as the rugged and reliable LC9 and features a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide; a purple, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame with aggressive checkering; a grip extension magazine floorplate to improve handling; and a rapid acquisition, windage adjustable, 3-dot sight system.The compact, 17.2 oz. Ruger LC9s pistol has a 3.12″ barrel, an overall length of 6″, a height of 4.5″ and a slim 0.9″ width. The compact frame and short trigger reach is designed to accommodate a wide range of hand sizes. The LC9s offers modern safety features such as an integrated trigger safety, manual safety, magazine disconnect, inert magazine for safe disassembly and a visual inspection port that allows for visual confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber. The LC9s™ ships with one 7-round magazine, a soft case and a cable locking device.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $375.

This gun is in absolute perfect condition without a nick, dent, scratch or anything to any of the finish. Upon further review and deep research about this gun I have come to find (in table 4-22 of the rifleman’s rifle book) that this rifle is 1 of 844 EVER MADE!!! Winchester Model 70's in 3006 were the most common caliber of all created, but when it comes to the Bull Target there were very few ever created as the majority of Bull Targets were chambered in 300 H&H MAG. There were a total of 2,706 Bull Gun's made including 844 chambered in 3006 and 1,862 chambered in 300 H&H MAG so these guns are very rare and hard to find in this good of condition with a serial number in the low 50 thousands. This gun weighs a ton and will most likely be a bench shooter for the rest of its life. It has never been fired and has a perfect bore. I am in no rush to sell this gun as it is not taking up much space in my gun vault so please no low ball offers and i do not want to trade unless you have an Abram Tank. I have seen 1 rifle in as good of condition as this one but it was chambered in the 300 NOT in 3006 and it went for $11,000. I am asking 10,000 OBO, if you are serious contact me and we can work something out. Also i plenty more pics and can/will provide any information that you will need just let me know."
