I highly recommend watching some YouTube videos people have posted about this rifle. Chambered for 5.56mm as well as .223 Remington. It has a 24 inch extra heavy, fluted, free floated barrel, Competition 2 stage trigger, Hogue grip and bipod. The ejector is tuned and will drop all your brass inside a 2 square foot area too!
It is zeroed for 100 yards with 5.56mm 55 grain ammo ( see orange target dot) and will shoot sub MOA groups consistently as well as hit a 1 foot steel plate at 500 meters all day long using the BDC 600 reticle. The photo looking through the scope at 500 meters is not very clear. Much better looking through it with your eye.
It has a Nikon M-223 scope mount and a Nikon M-223 4X16X42 600 BDC scope on it and it is a perfect match.
Will consider selling the rifle separately for the right money.
Comes with the scope, scope mount, bipod, all original packaging and literature, including a Bushmaster hard case.

Also must sign a bill of sale and show photo ID.

Our introduction of +P 9X18 Makarov ammunition is the result of numerous customer requests. With no high quality +P ammunition available for the millions of Makarov pistols that are now in America, the American 9X18 pistol owner has no viable/effective self defense ammo for use in these high quality pistols, until now.
I am not a fan of using expanding bullets for self defense in smaller less powerful cartridges like the 9X18 or the 380 auto, as the expansion of these light weight smaller bullets often limits the penetration required to incapacitate the threat, but there are circumstances where the use of expanding ammo is an advantage. For more information on this subject, please read our ""technical article"" on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.
This new 95gr. JHP+P, 9X18 Mak loading, (Item # 34A) is roughly 200 fps faster than normal ball 95gr. Makarov ammo. This new +P load also features flash suppressed powder as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, when the criminal element is active. This ammunition will not blind the shooter in low light situations, which is an important tactical advantage.
This ammo was reliable and quite accurate in our test guns. We noted no accelerated wear from the use of +P loads in our test pistols, although common sense suggests that any +P ammo will wear any pistol at a faster rate than weaker ammo. Please note the below real world velocities from our stock over-the-counter test guns
1.       1150 fps—East German Makarov, 4 inch barrel
2.       1192 fps—CZ 82, 4 inch barrel"

333,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4046333,"For Sale/Trade:  For TRADE - Brand new 10.5"" AR Pistol - Spikes/Rainier/Sig Brace - Top Shelf Components","Little Elm / Frisco, Dallas, Texas",$ 0,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 18, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I built two of these thinking I wanted a matched set of two, but I'd rather have something different so I'm letting this one go.

A great deal of thought and consideration was put into the design of this pistol, and all of the components selected were chosen specifically with performance and ergonomics in mind. This is NOT your neighbor's uncomfortable and clumsily slapped-together gun-show AR pistol. 

I started with a matched Spikes Tactical Jolly Roger lower and A3 upper set. This is the less common Jolly Roger with the ""Parley/Plunder/Arrr"" roll marks (color filled) - not the one with the boring bullet pictograms. The lower started off with a Spikes enhanced lower parts kit, but was upgraded further to include an improved trigger group, Wolff springs, and Strike Industries enhanced pivot/takedown pins.

The 10.5"" Rainier Arms Match .223 Wylde barrel (.223 Rem/5.56 NATO) and Daniel Defense low profile gas block fit perfectly under the 10"" full floating quad rail handguard with integrated forward QD sling point and Strike Industries Cobra forward grip.

Under the Strike Industries Ultimate Dust Cover is a Trinity Ordinance full auto nickel boron bolt carrier group for extended performance and easy cleaning. Unlike the constant problems people have with shorter pistol-length gas systems, this has a carbine-length gas system to ensure dependable operation and perfect timing. Fully headspaced with both Go and No-Go gauges.

The extended buffer tube with positive stop keeps the Sig Brace firmly in place, standing it off a bit from the back of the receiver for a very comfortable shouldered position, and won't interfere with the MagPul ASAP QD plate. That in combination with the rubberized MagPul K2+ grip which is canted forward to a more vertical angle makes this AR ""pistol"" as close to a super comfortable SBR as you can legally get without crossing into NFA regulations.

A note of clarification on recent news - the recent discussion of ""reversals"" with regard to shouldering Sig Braces is a misnomer. So far, all that has been released is an ""Opinion"" by an ATF employee - not an official ""Decision"" or ""Ruling"" by the ATF itself.


This AR pistol already HAS all of the upgrades you would have to pay extra for, when you buy a ""standard"" off the shelf or cheaply built AR pistol and realize how uncomfortable and inaccurate it is. Will NOT disappoint.


Well over $1500 invested.

Still on the fence about selling this, but a certain VZ 58 keeps calling my name. What your looking at here is a very desirable CZ 82. This gun served the Check police officers very well in the 80's and 90's. Chambered in 9x18 Makarov, it's a round in between a 380, and 9mm luger. Absolutely perfect for concealed carry, it's light weight and accuracy is ridiculously amazing. This gun is completely ambidextrous and behond perfect in its controls. I can't even begin to describe how well it preforms and how easy it is to use. Overall condition is nothing short of perfect. I personally ran 100 rounds through it without fail. I'm offering this gun up with one 14 round magazine, and 250 rounds of ammo. 150 of which are JHP defensive loads. Absolutely no disappointments with this one.  Be sure to check out my other listings. I can pair items for the right trade."

The rifle is a original Sig Sauer manufactured rifle. Sig Sauer had a batch of 250 Sig 551 lowers and mated them with Sig 556 uppers. Sig then matched the serial number, to the original number, of the demilled SIG 551 lower, and labeled them SIG 551. The rifle is a very tight fit, with no movement from the upper to lower, and is 1 out of 250.
I had a gunsmith, from West Coast Armory, install SAN/Swiss Diopter Sights and Gas Block, and a US made SIG 551 profile barrel. The rifle and associated parts were then painted with original paint, from SAN/Swiss. I also had Ident Marking Services, laster etch the matching serial numbers, onto the bolt and bolt carrier. Please, keep in mind, the barrel is parkerized and good quality, but it's not hammer forged or chrome lined.

The additional accessories available are new and includes:

1) 7 SAN/Swiss 35 round magazines 
2) SAN/Swiss Cleaning Kit 
3) SIG Sling 
4) Extema Ratio Fulcrum Tactical Bayonet 
5) Sig Tactical Case (not pictured)

I'm asking $5,000 for the complete package.

I'm willing to sell the rifle separately, or break down the accessories, for an adjusted price. Also, I'm open to reasonable, serious offers.

This is a unique rifle and a must for any Sig enthusiast. It was a pet project of mine, unfortunately, I'm in a must sell situation and I hate to see it go.

I accept Money Order, Bank Check, or Paypal (fees apply), for payment. Must be shipped to a current FFL Holder, to legal states only. Not willing to do any Trades,

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer.

The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum.

Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle chambered in .223/5.56. Wood is not perfect, as you can see in the pics, but not abused. The marks on the wood are marks, not cracks. It will come with the sling as well as 1 5rd Ruger factory mag. Gun is in great shape other than the marks on the stock, but is priced to sell. As a freebie I will include 2 30rd aftermarket mags that will not feed properly unless down loaded by a couple of rounds.
