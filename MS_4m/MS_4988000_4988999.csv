- Fiber Optic Dual Line Sight System Optimized for fast-handling balance/instinctive pointing
- Ultrareliable Inertia Driven semiautomatic bolt system
- Comes with three choke tubes and a choke-tube wrench
- 4+1 capacity for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells
- Weighs only 6.5lbs!!

The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System. The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.

Comes with all the chokes plus a Carlson's Black Cloud Duck Choke and even a very TIGHT EXTRA FULL turkey choke that sticks out the barrel 2 inches. These 2 chokes alone are worth at least $100.

Also includes a full set of custom Buttstock shims to allow adjustment in length, as well as side-to-side and Up/Down.

The Remington® VERSA MAX® Semi-Auto Shotgun uses the VersaPort™ gas operation system that vents gas from the shotgun's chamber to operate the action. It is a very simple system with few moving parts and no O-rings, gaskets, or seals to maintain. The system uses the length of the shotgun shell hull to regulate the amount of gas, allowing the gun to operate with every type of shotgun shell from light 2-3/4"" loads up to 3-1/2"" magnums without any shooter adjustments. The versatility of the rugged, value-priced VERSA MAX Sportsman makes it equally well suited for turkey and waterfowl hunting with magnum loads, as well as upland birds, and even pass shooting doves with light field loads. The VERSA MAX Sportsman semi-automatic shotgun has a weather resistant, black synthetic stock with textured panels on the fore-end and pistol grip that provide a solid hold in any environment. The barrel and receiver are finished in a non-reflective matte black that enhances concealment in most hunting environments. A molded in sling swivel stud on the butt-stock and a stud on the magazine cap allow the quick attachment of a sling. The self-cleaning, gas operation system of the Remington VERSA MAX Semi-Auto shotgun reduces recoil considerably, allowing the shooter to follow-up on missed birds or shoot multiple targets quickly. Comes with 1 Flush Mount Pro Bore™ choke tube (modified).

I've put about 100 rounds through this rifle and it is an outstanding rifle. Good smooth action. I was shooting sub MOA 3 round groups @ 100 yards at Parma Woods. It turns out that I wanted to get into more long range target shooting, so I'm selling this to put money towards a project rifle. 

I never used the scope so I can't tell you how exactly good it is, but it comes with a lifetime warranty and I still have the card. I also have an extra soft case that I can throw in (pretty much brand new). It is basically a Nikon Prostaff which has very good reviews. I used my PA 4-14x44 FFP. 

These go for about $625 new once you include taxes. Obviously i'm not going to be charging any taxes.

I'm selling everything I have in connection with my Glock 20.  I purchased this stuff for protection for hiking and off-roading in Colorado then moved and no longer do those things.  The holsters have not been used but I've put about 250 rounds through the gen 4 Glock 20.  Fifty of those rounds were the Underwood Ammo which is full strength and 200 rounds of weak-ass plinker ammo that I bought just to shoot and save the brass for reloading.  

Here is what you get:

1 year old Glock 20 gen 4 in like new condition, in the original box w/orig acc.  
Three 15 round mags included
Galco holster - never used
Double leather mag pouch - never used 
500 rounds of Underwood self defense ammo - (need I say never used?)
150 rounds of the cheap, weak, target ammo - good for brass
Hornady 10mm reloading 3 die set - used for under 100 rounds
  *My Forster rings and the shellplate shown in the picture with the dies NOT included.
A pound (more or less, probably more) of 800X powder
364 cleaned pieces of brass, all the 10 mm I have which is all once fired
60 Precision Delta .40cal/10mm 180 gr jacketed bullets 

This comprehensive super combo should be everything you need to dive right in.  The gen 4 did a great job taming the 10mm recoil and the leather I bought is damned sexy!  Now before you freak out over the price, keep in mind the ammo alone is worth close to $500.  When you add up the street prices of all of that stuff, consider shipping, taxes or FFL fee, powder, brass and dies, it's a great deal. 

No trades.  The only split I'll consider is $600 for everything but the pistol and what comes with it new.  After that stuff is sold I'll sell the pistol.  I will ship to your FFL for actual shipping cost.  Of course the ammo will need to be shipped separately.  If you're an NC resident and want to meet you will need to show me your DL and CCW and do a bill of sale with that info.  If you have a PPP you'll need to show me your DL and give me the original, current, valid pistol purchase permit to keep (private sellers are required by NC law to keep the original, just like the FFL)."

Over $3600 invested, my loss is your gain!

Up for sale from my HK collection is a nearly new HK94 built by T.P.M. Outfitters out of Carrollton, TX. Ken Clark and Matt Sidley of TPM have an outstanding reputation for being excellent HK smiths, right up there with Turner Fabrications, Investment Grade Firearms (IGF), and Parabellum Combat Systems (Ghilliebear). Don't be fooled by the cheaper, poorly built weapons like Vector, Bobcat, Coharie, Special Weapons (SW), Atlantic Arms (AA), Pakistani Ordnance Factory (POF), or MKE. The welds on this rifle are cleaner than some of my factory HK roller locking weapons (HK 91, 93, etc.). This comes with a full auto bolt carrier and was fully tested by TPM to run flawlessly in semi and full auto so it would make a perfect host for your registered auto sear or trigger pack (NFA rules apply). Less than 100 rounds have been fired with several different types of ammo fed by different stick mags and a drum and it has no had one single hiccup! Other than a couple trips to my range behind the house, this has been a safe queen since I bought it and has spent its entire life in a climate controlled environment. Condition is nothing less than flawless as the day I got it. No optics have ever been mounted so there are no claw marks from rails or scope mounts in the top of the receiver like some other MP5s out there. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one stick mag. Private sale if local, with no FFL fees or BS to deal with, or I can accept a certified check or USPS money order and shipping will be $35 to your FFL from a private individual, or an additional $25 if my FFL must ship it. Please be sure it is legal to own in your state/area. Feel free to contact me with any questions or for additional pics."

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

- Surefire X300 tactical light
- Hornady Ammo - Critical Defense, 4 boxes (these things are sick!)

Very nice condition overall and the blue finish looks great, there are a couple marks/light scratches by the cylinder release on the left side, you can see them in one or two of the pics barely, I tried to make them show up as best I could.  On the right side there are a few spots towards the end of the barrel, lock-up is great and bore looks great, don't think it was shot much.  I try to be very accurate with anything I list, so there are no disappointments, no surprises.  These have gone up quite a bit over the past few years from what I've seen and should only continue to rise in value.  I'm happy to take more pics and send to serious buyers.  Will come in an Allen suede soft case and include one speed loader.

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish a couple projects and get some new tires in the next month or so.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

One of the rifles was a Ruger 10/22. Very stock gun. One single 10 round magazine and no modifications to the gun at all. Perhaps it came with some ammo. 

I would very much like to acquire this gun. If anyone in the Rinelander area around late 2003 to perhaps early 2004 purchased a Ruger 10/22, perhaps even from Mel's is willing to sell the gun and are pretty sure they have this one I would like to hear from you. I do not have the serial number and have no idea how I would even get it. 

I recently hear from someone who told me if I knew where the gun was purchased I could track it via the guns serial number. However I don't know if the gun was purchased in Rhinelander or even Wisconsin for that matter. The only living member that might know is suffering from dementia.

Its chambered in 38 special, but handles the +P rounds great.  Fixed sights with what I believe to be ""factory"" Pachmayr Presentation grips.  4 inch heavy barrel.  Will also include a set of wood ""service"" grips that are also really nice.  From what I can tell, it has a very low round count.  I've only put about 100 rounds through it since I've had it.  Finish is what I would consider 95+%.  There is a slight amount of finish wear around the muzzle, presumably from a holster, but it is small.  There is also a very short mark in the finish behind the cylinder that is shown in the pics.  

I would like to sell outright, but I would also consider a trade for a Glock 22 or 17, or a full size Smith and Wesson M&P or Springfield XD in 9 or 40.  I consider this gun to be worth $400 when it comes to trade value, due to its condition.  The low cash price is due to needing cash to fund another purchase.  Would also consider trades of ammo toward the gun, just let me know what you have, and it must be factory loaded ammo, no reloads please."
