I bought this rifle several years ago in California since ‘assault rifles’ were banned there. I intended to get into high power shooting, but never did. It has approximately 420 rounds of Federal Gold Medal Match ammunition through it and has been sitting in the safe for many years.
I am selling this as a complete package of case, rifle, sling, magazines (29 total), spare parts, and specialty tools for cleaning and maintenance. Please see the pictures for visual representation of all pieces included. I only want cash. I am not interested in any type of trades or anything except cash.
The rifle is model SA9804.
The Super Match M1A™ rifle embodies the most sophisticated development in Gas Gun™ 
technology. Capable of sub-MOA accuracy with the proper ammunition, the Super Match is built 
for the individual who demands the very best. A truly custom gun. Springfield’s latest proprietary 
development for the Super Match is the rear lugged receiver. Additional extraordinary features 
include an ultra heavy air gauged national match barrel, custom oversized op-rod guide and 
maximum dimension match grade stocks available in American walnut and McMillan fiberglass.

Three modifications were made to the rifle: First the front sling swivel was replaced with an aftermarket part that has a sling swivel stud for the attachment of a Harris type bi-pod. Secondly, the shiny portion of the barrel between the gas system and the flash hider/suppressor was blackened to prevent reflection. Third, the bolt release was replaced with a Smith Enterprises bolt release, but the original is included in the package. Originally this weapon was purchased in California and came with a muzzle brake since flash hiders/suppressors are illegal in California. Once I moved out of California, this part was replaced with a M1A national match flash hider/suppressor. The original CA legal muzzle brake is included in the package.

There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8. The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama. This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8. The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama. This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

This was bought prior to the 1994 ban probably around 1992-1993. I believe it is called an R6700 model number.
Serial number CH007XXX if you want to track down the exact date since that is important to some people.
Used at the range and probable has around 1600-1700 rounds though it.
I stopped using it around 1998 when I joined the military.
Good condition and everything works.
I tried to take pertinent photos, but if you’d like photos of something specific, please let me know.
The hand guard was cracked many years ago so I replaced that.
The rivet pin for the front sling swivel has also been replaced.
Other than that, all parts are original.
Please let me know if you have any questions. . I will accept cash only. You must have a valid North Carolina driver’s license/state ID card or other government ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale. Only serious inquiries please.
 I only want cash. I am not interested in any type of trades or anything except cash.

Handguns which go for $1000 + but unfortunately they dont use the same quality if you were to go pick up a Kimber 1911 17mach 2 or 22 full size hand gun  for some strange reason, so heres your chance to get the Kimber quality easy change over conversion kit for hundreds of dollars less than purchasing the full handgun which is of a lesser quality 2hen buying their 22 or 17 mach 2 handgun in 1911. If you arent familiar with the 17mach 2 cal. It is Hornady's champion caliber against and beats the 22 mag, ,,,, the 17 mach 2 cal is a powerful little missle , with a much much lessser recoil than the 45cal."

I will throw in a couple magazines (uses standard AR magazines), and a hundred rounds of various reloads (for use as reloading components only, I cannot sell reloaded ammo), these include 125 grain TNT, 125 grain Nosler Ballistic Tips, and some 110 grain V-Max.

This rifle rocks! Easy to shoot, quieter than a .223 (you can load it suppressed to make it even quieter), everyone loves shooting this gun! I have two of these, and have loaded enough .300 Blackout to last me a while, and have since switched to a single-stage press. (progressive are great if you're loading a hundred or more at a time, I usually one shoot 20-40 per range session, so I have time). This rifle loves the 125 gr TNT's over 19 grains of Lil'Gun (please work up to this load, even through some are loading as hot at 21 grains), this round is very inexpensive to load for, you can catch sales on the TNT's online in several places for under $100 for 500 bullets. Powder used is magnum pistol powders, easier to find and uses 1/3 the powder of other loads, very economical to load for.

This is everything you need to start shooting .300 AA Blackout and converting your own brass and loading. Price everything out yourself, well over $2k invested. $1,500."

Aproximately 1500 rounds through this upper. (But on a CHF Daniel Defense Barrel that's still probably 95% of it's barrel life remaining.) I love it, but had to choose between this and another gun. The other gun won out. 
you'll notice that on the upper, some anodizing has worn off a bit due to optic mounting. This build has been very accurate, shooting .6"" groups with my handloads and I even got a 428 yard kill on a prairie dog with this gun using some magnified optics. Not bad at all for a fighting barrel! 

Components used in the build are as below along with estimated value new. 

* Barrel: Daniel Defense Cold Hammer Forged light-weight barrel, mid length gas system. ($289) 
* Gas Block: Daniel Defense Low Profile. ($61) 
* Gas Tube: Daniel Defense Mid Length ($12)


* Upper Receiver: VLTOR MUR-1 Billet Upper Receiver Assembly, with Forward Assist, ($189) 

* Handguard: Diamond VRS-T, 13.5"" Handguard, ($189) 
* Misc Diamondhead Picatinny Rail Sections, 2 Long, 1 Short, Shipped Loose: (About $45)

All together, that's about $785, of course street prices are a bit lower but not too much on these premium components. 

Note, does not include charging handle or Bolt Carrier Group. A2 Birdcage shown on barrel does not include a crush washer but will be shipped along with the package to protect threads/barrel crown.

 Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades. It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment .22 LR  it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.  

Practical, Safe and Reliable

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Beretta.

Grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 that was standard on Super Grades.
Winchester Custom Shop Island Express safari sights no longer made due to cost.
KickEez recoil pad.
The rifle has very minor handling marks to the wood and the bluing is mint with only a small rub on the floor plate. The rifle comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times and the bore is perfect. The rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. The rifle has been meticulously cared for by the same person since new.
Rifle will also come in a Browning hand fitted model 1915 safari case with both locking keys Browning owners manual and care card. I have seen some of these for sale before but never one in mint condition with both keys and owners manual and care card. Also included is a Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case in the early 70s from the same place. Last are two boxes of vintage Winchester Western 458 ammo one box of solids and one box of empty's. You will not find a nicer or better cared for Custom Shop Super Grade African in 458 any where else. Thanks for looking."

In addition to the box contents you also get three factory Ruger 10-round polymer magazines with dust covers and a Surefire muzzle brake that is compatible with Surefire SOCOM 7.62 suppressors. I fired this with and without the brake, the reduction in recoil is amazing!

Bought this last year and rode it all around this fall, but I start a new job in a couple of weeks and won't have the ability to ride to work like I have been.

I'm sure a lot of you, like me, learned how to ride a ""real"" motorcycle on something like this - more than a minibike, but small enough to let you get into those really far-reaching spots in the wilderness.  The bones themselves are in remarkable shape for a 40 year old motorcycle - a real survivor.  I wouldn't do anything more than putt around the yard on the current (possibly original) tires - if you're wanting to put it on the road legally (or have other needs) the headlight is not functional and will need replaced.  Past that, it's really up to you - you could mod it out, restore it, teach the kids to ride, or just go have fun! If I weren't changing jobs I wouldn't be getting rid of it, it would get the two abovementioned items and I'd be riding all over out here.. but I have to have a vehicle that can haul stuff, and this bike just isn't up to that task.

I have a clean Indiana title in my name for the motorcycle.  If there's any other questions I can answer, please let me know and I'll do my best!"

Weapons Mounted Light

150 lumens

uses one 123A type battery

""Desert Gold Limited Edition""

A friend of mine got this 2 - 3 years ago from CDNN ( same as  http://www.cdnnsports.com/150-lumen-quick-detach-led-light-full-size-pistol.html  except for the color ) and had it mounted on his AR-15.  He just isntalled Magpul  furniture on his rifle, and the mount he was using does not attach to the Magpul OEM hand guards.

Also, the light appears to be designed for use with a pistol, because the switch was not very ergonomic to use with a rifle.


FYI:  The rear plate to the battery compartment came loose, causing the light to work only intermittently.  It was a pain to troubleshoot, because I had no idea that the rear plate was removable, and thought something was broken.  I spent a lot of time cursing cheap, made-in-China products, thinking this thing was broken, until I must have had an epiphany and screwed the rear plate tight (using needle nose pliers).  See attached picture.  Since then, it has worked fine, although you may want to loc-tite the threads to prevent the plate from coming loose under the force of recoil in the future.  Or at least be aware that the rear plate may unscrew itself loose -- knowing this will save you a lot of frustration."
