All original gun except the barrel was relined by TheLugerMan. The good news is that it was kept in the original 7.63 and not converted to 9mm like many people do when relining. No I don't have the attachable Broomhandle extension stock. All numbers match. Overall I'm going to estimate the gun is in 70-80% condition. Some light reblueing was done at some point to the muzzle. The grips are original but a bit worn. After all the gun is over 100 years old! It does have the lanyard ring but it's a bit bent. It is very hard to decide what that is gun is worth. The 2015 gun bluebook steps the value up in several hundred dollar increments per 10% of its condition. So this could be worth thousands or slightly less. I'm pricing it on the very low conservative side in hopes of making a sale to get something else I've got my eye on. And the stripper clips and box of ammo are included. This pistol is in very nice shape for its age. Comparison pricing isn't easy on these, but there are two down at Bob's gun shop in Norfolk in much worse shape than mine without the external stock selling for 2K a piece.  Obviously this gun is not in 5.56. They just don't have a drop-down menu for 7.63 Mauser below.

As such, it was one of the powders that became almost impossible to find.  I have used it in shotgun shells to move a heavy shot load at high speed without overpressurizing the chamber.  I have a co-worker who swears by it for pistol loading.  I have another friend who particularly favors it for loading pistol caliber carbine rounds.

I believe it is a much later build date by the serial (possibly 1980 or newer) from factory 636. Has original shoulder strap and cleaning rod, but no bayonet or cleaning kit in the stock's ""trap door"".

It has a cracked upper handguard. I am including a replacement original handguard that will have to be hand-fitted and refinished to match the rifle (the replacement is lighter in color).

Have for Sale-Same as new (fired) one time at range- less than 50 rounds-

Springfield Armory has introduced a new version of its XD Mod. 2 chambered in .45 ACP at the 2015 SHOT Show.  

The new Springfield XD Mod. 2 in .45 ACP shares many of the same features as the XD Mod. 2s in 9mm and .40 S&W, but it utilizes a captive recoil spring with a full-length guide rod instead of the dual spring to accommodate the bigger cartridge. The .45 ACP XD Mod. 2 also sports a slightly longer 3.3-inch hammer forged barrel, resulting in a 6.5-inch overall length. The grip width is a touch wider at 1.20 inches, while the height remains the same at 4.75 inches with the standard magazine and 5.5 inches with the X-Tension extended magazine.

As with previous XD Mod. 2 pistols, this version incorporates the same innovative and ergonomic “Grip Zone” technology, in which three different textures are molded into the grip where slip resistance is most important. Critical gripping points receive a more heavily textured pattern while other areas have a smoother feel.

The Springfield XD Mod. 2 features posi-wedge slide serrations that aids the user in racking the slide, especially useful given the .45′s captive recoil spring. The XD Mod.2 in .45 ACP also utilizes the same low-profile rear combat sight and fiber optic front sight.

FWIW, POF 12"" rifles chrono in the low 2300s with either 168g FGGM or 178 Hornaday Amax factory loads. LINK Guys hit gongs out to 600 yards easy. Keeps your Suppressed OAL & balance manageable. 

Listing the completel upper, but I can sell this to you as a complete rifle if it is as a tranfer on a Form 4 per the National Firearms Act.  If doing a F1 or F4 tranfer, I could give you the lower then give you the upper when your stamp comes in.  You cannot legally possess th upper unless you own either a new stripped lower that you can build out as a pistol, or a SBR'd lower per the NFA.  A stripped lower for this can be had for $228 if you wanted to do a pistol build and maybe SBR it in a Form 1 later. Even before the sig brace, recoil on this is negligible, honestly does not hurt the shoulder w/o a stock. I originally built as a pistol then SBR'd it on a F1.  The lower half is for sale and can be sold by itteslf to anyone as a regular rifle. 

I'll throw in a front sight rail and three 2"" accessory rails, an Armalite A2 style AR10 carry handle and two sling studs. 

The barrel was made from a brand new Armalite chrome lined 20"" Hbar that I had cut, contoured, drilled & threaded by Adco to use Noveskie's Leonidas Gas tube. The barrel is .750"" from chamber to journal, then ca .740 to the muzzle shoulder, w/ standard 5/8"" threads. I had this made b/c I wanted something lighter than the noveskie upper, and with a more durable chrome bore, and that I could put a heat sink on so that the barrel would hopefully never have to be changed. 

Upper is standard Armalite w/ regular chaging handle & BCG w/ recent version extractor & spring. Lookign at it, it has some scuffs from rubbing on uther guns in the safe, but not too bad. 

Gas block is a Palladin Machine three position: unrestricted, suppressed & off. A narrow flat head screwdriver easily fits in the handguard slot to adjust. Originally, the harmonics were shedding the split rings that retain the rotating pin. I had him make a new pin that is secured to the block by a tiny roll pin and no problems since. The gast tube is modified to work w/ this block, but new tubes are availible if you want to use a different gas block. 

Handguard is JP rifle Modular 12.5"" system shortened to 11.5"" so that the muzzle threads are accessible.  The handguard is slightly shorter now than in the picutre. 

Will ship w/ an A2 type flash hider.

I put 678 rounds through it in the nearly 5 yrs since I put it together, mostly functional testing, setting up the adj gas block for the suppressor and sighting it in. Never had any unsuppresed stoppages at all or suppressed stoppages after I got the gas block tuned.  Ejects strong and consistent w/ or w/o the suppressor.  One day I shot it from a rest one day @ 200 yards w/ a 3x9 and it did 3/4 MOA: 

W/ slash buffer, commercial AR15 M4 stock assembly (w/o saddle), the 2.8oz muzzle device, a couple sling studs it weigs 7.71 lbs, w/o sights. Loose the heat sink and it comes down to about 7.5lbs, less w/ a shorter hand guard.

I also have a bunch of new 20 & 25 rd Gen 2 steel mags I'll sell; let me know. $25 for the 20's and $35 for the 25s, a few are in the wrapper. 

Extra 2"" accessory rail sections and 4"" accessory rail sections, top rail & sling studs included w/ the gun or upper.

Cash F2F, UPSP MO, Well's Fargo or B of A Cashier's cheque, or equvalent in Bitcoin. Shipping extra. 

We can meet at a range in FL if you want to shoot it to verify its function and accuracy.

Price listed is for the upper.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol."

798,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4091798,For Sale:  Bulk Ammo - Most Common Calibers - 100-Round 'Brick' Deals,"NE, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 35,"Listed On: Monday, March 2, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Greetings Armslisters,




I have just opened the doors to Vexxer Munitions(metaphorically; we don't actually have doors), and to celebrate I am posting the current stock of ammunition on Armslist, three weeks before our scheduled 'opening' ceremony, here in lovely Portland, OR. I should note right off the bat that this is an online-only store; we do not have a physical office address for one to come pick up ammunition, at least not yet.


All ammunition is priced and sold in sets of 100 rounds, at $35 per 'brick' of 100 rounds. Shipping will be determined based on location and amount of rounds you want; buying more will end up saving you money, as I can pack them all into a single box, instead of 100 rounds per small box.

I also offer a 'penny-round' discount for orders of 1,000 rounds or more. At the 1,000 round mark, I take off a penny per round. It's not a massive discount, granted, but if you are planning on shooting a lot anyways, it will save you a fair bit of cash. Because it makes my end logistically easier, and cheaper, the savings fall directly to the consumer. You are free to mix-and-match, the discount applies when you reach a total of 1,000 rounds or above.


While I do not yet have ALL calibers yet, I do have the most commonly shot rounds in America. I chose to maintain healthy stockpiles of common calibers, rather than create a single brick per caliber, and have to fight to keep them stocked.


I currently have stocked:


-Tula .45ACP


-Wolf 7.62x39mm


-Silver Bear .223/5.56 NATO


-Winchester Super-X 12GA, Buck-shot


-Bulgarian 7.62x54R, Silver-Tipped [CORROSIVE]


[A quick word on the corrosive ammunition; I am a huge Mosin fan, if you need any advice or assistance in keeping your Mosin pristine(the secret is boiling water), don't hestitate to send me an email]


I will be taking special notice of obtaining 9mm especially, as well as .22LR, .308, 10GA rounds as soon as possible, I know that I am missing these very common calibers. I wanted to maintain an inventory rather than sell out too quickly of a given item, so more calibers will arrive soon.



PROCESS:


To order(while our website is being constructed, at least) is very simple; email me with how many rounds you would like, of what caliber. I will require a state or military-issued ID as proof of age. From there, I will send you a shipping quote, NOT an estimate. There is an important distinction there; estimates can change, quotes will not. Most ammunition companies use an estimator, and charge you the final price halfway through the process, whether or not the estimate was correct. I do not use this system; if I make a mistake, I will eat the cost; what I quote is what you pay, no exceptions. I'd rather lose money and keep a customer.

Once we have the final cost, I will send you an invoice via Paypal. After payment is received, you will receive an email from Paypal with the tracking number, as well as your order's current status. Unfortunately, as many of you are no doubt aware, munitions by law MUST travel via ground. Factor in at least a week for shipping. That being said, I will ship the same day generally that your order is placed. Please note I discount Sunday completely as a 'shipping' day, as no shipping company works on Sundays.


[For the unfamiliar: Paypal is an escrow service that watches over the transaction, protecting both you and I in exchange for a small fee from me. It is a completely free service for you, and takes about 5 minutes to create an account.]


From that point, all you have to do is wait. Your package will arrive(please notify me if something is amiss; if there's any sort of problem, I want to know about it), and then all you need to do is go out and have a blast!



Building A Better Business:


Before I wrap up this ad, a word on pricing. I am fully aware that the prices are high, and I am working on it. The bottleneck at this moment is waiting for the various munition factories and distributors to analyze and accept my business identification. Prices and ammunition availability are different for licensed businesses and private citizens. Expect to see prices drop slightly within a month, and drop significantly within 7 months.


Feel free to email me with any questions, comments or concerns you might have. I hope to have a long business career supplying Americans with all their favorite calibers. 


And, as a squeaky-clean, brand-new company, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not ask the customer; if you have any ideas or thoughts on how to cut down on shipping time, make the overall process easier for the customer, etc, please, my email is always open. I would also love to hear your opinions on the 'brick' system, as well as my 'can' system that will go into effect next month. If I may tug on your ear a moment longer:

-I plan to have two basic types of product; bricks of 100 rounds, and ammo cans(with number of rounds dependent on caliber). So for example, 300 7.62x54R rounds fit perfectly into a .30 caliber ammunition can, and pricing would be based on how many rounds are included(the cans are free, a thank you for your business). In that specific case, one 'can' of 7.62x54R would be $105. The cans are all brand-new, un-stenciled; I chose this method to allow you to use them for other rounds and not have confusing stenciling on each box(claiming your ammo can full of 9mm is in fact 40mm explosive rounds, for example). When ordered, the caliber inside will be listed via a sticky-note tacked to the hinge, easily removable once you've shot the ammunition, and want to re-purpose it for another use.


If you have any comments on those two products, or if you have an idea that's even better, please email me. I am always open to customer suggestion. I hope to implement a quasi-forum on the store website for just this purpose, but for now emails will suffice.




Cheers Armslist, and happy hunting!

All the other items were bought but never taken out to the range.
I just copied and pasted my notes that I had so it goes color / MSRP / what I would like to get.
If you want any of the items just send me a message and we can make a deal.
I didn't even post any prices for the 5.11 stuff I know they aren't very expensive so if they interest you just send me an offer.

It was first used in combat in World War I, and continued in service with a number of armed forces through to the end of the Korean War. It is visually distinctive because of a wide tubular cooling shroud around the barrel — often omitted in World War I when used on aircraft — and a top-mounted drum-pan magazine.

Its in great shape and comes with everything in the picture, including whatever ammo I have left in the magazines. 

There's a lot of info out on the VZ2008 (which is a parts kit clone of the Czech Military's VZ58) so I won't reiterate too much except to say that it's a fantastic piece of kit. The common misperception about this rifle is that its an AK clone. It shares a few characteristics (sights, piston driven) but its really a fundamentally different rifle. Milled receiver, striker firing mechanism, last round hold open, a more ergonomic safety, accepts stripper clips... and the list goes on. In some ways, its like a combination between the best of a SKS and an AK, though that still doesn't really cover it. its really a fine rifle if you're looking for a semi-auto in 7.62x39. The cleaning kit is particularly good and comes in handier than I'd have thought. I've done no modifications but aftermarket stocks, rails, and optic mounts are all available. The CZ Forum has a special section dedicated entirely to VZ and has a wealth of information on specs and mods.

I had planned to use this as my brush gun, but I've got a .460 Rowland pistol in the works and that's gonna serve my purposes, so the VZ needs a new home.

 It's given me three inch groups at 100 yards, with iron sights and cheap ammo, so I imagine its capable of much more with optics and better loads. 

We'll do a face to face deal within 15 miles of Chapel Hill. I""m not interested in trades as I've got a strict one gun in, one gun out rule right now... and one just came in, so this is going out. I'll need to see an NC ID. I might be willing to ship if you don't mind handling and paying for the FFL logistics."
