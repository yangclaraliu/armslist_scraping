It includes the original case, paperwork, factory test-casing, cleaning kit, lock, and both original factory 15-rd magazines. ( I completely forgot the paperwork and lock when taking the photo).
It also includes a spare 17-rd and a 33-rd magazine, both also being Glock factory mags.

Prospective buyers must be legal to own firearms, and be a Georgia resident that is over 21, and be able to prove it with valid ID.
I'm a long-time Armslister, with my Ga. carry permit, so I got all my ducks in a row.
Please reply with some details that let me know you're not just another scammer. If you're someplace like Atlanta,or Alaska, then you have to come to ME, not the other way around. No shipping,cash only. I'm willing to meet in very north Columbus, or southern Harris County, like the Chevron on exit 19.

This is a round butt, 6-shot K-frame with rosewood S&W medalion grips and an HKS speed loader.  If you'd prefer the factory wood stocks that's fine, but I'll need to keep one pair for my other revolver.  This is a good gun for carry, bedside duty or as a glove box gun.  This gun has a good amount of finish wear, so I'm not expecting showroom pieces in trade.  Guns with finish wear are fine, but no rusting or pitting please.  Thanks for looking!

It shoots great and has one of the best triggers of any pistol I've ever fired but I just acquired a Beretta 96 and I have too many 40 S&Ws as it is so this one needs a good home. The barrel and bore look pretty good and don't appear to have much wear. Except for some holster wear this gun's in really good cosmetic condition.  This Sig does not have a factory safety and comes equipped with the DAK night sights which still appear to have quite a bit of life left in them.  Case and manual included as well.

With FFL fees and shipping I spent over $450 as well as an extra $70 on two brand new factory magazines that I bought for it on Ebay so I have well over $500 invested in this pitstol.  My asking price is $400 which I think is quite reasonable for a Sig 226 with 3 magazines but I will entertain reasonable offers.  I know what these pistols cost new and what used ones go for so please don't shoot me a lowball offer. I'm already losing money on this gun as it is.  I will consider trades for other firearms, particularly for shotguns,  but would prefer a straight cash sale. Buyers must comply with all applicable laws (that means photo ID and purchase permit or CCW license).

This is the new version with beefed up design.
The main difference between this and the launchers currently on the market is that this is much closer in appearance to a M203 than the Spike/Havoc launchers. They're used in quite a lot of action movies too.

It can be fired standalone without a rifle if you have or build a standalone mount. It DOES NOT come with any mount. I used a scope mount to mount work on my rifle after seeing someone do the same on a youtube video. It works well and it's very solid. But if you're looking for a better solution Cobray still has the mounts in stock. Just give them a call/email and they can hook you up.

This is NOT a firearm, so no paperwork/background check is required. It can even be shipped and I will ship for an additional $20.

Magazine Disconnect Bushing for easy use, disassembling, and cleaning.

This gun has been lightly used and cleaned after every use.  I still have original case and all original parts (grips, sights, magazine disconnect, etc.). The magazine disconnect bushing is a aftermarket replacement part that let's the magazine fall freely from gun. Stock disconnects bind up the mag when released as well as make the disassembling process a pain. This replacement bushing fixes all that. The mags also have spring loaded bumpers for quicker reloads. These guns are marked at $400+ alone! Lot of extras! Sights were $50, Magazine Bumpers $30, Disconnect Bushing $20, and the grips were each $20. This is a very accurate little pistol and it's a blast to shoot. Very clean!

Cons: 
Wipers Need Fixed, They Don't Always Engage.
Everything is original, including the Becker tape deck which doesn't work.
On the Becker audio site there is a factory upgrade CD player. It was my intent to replace the factory unit with that factory Mercedes upgrade.
High Miles, 237,000 (very maintained) Like I said, its my daily driver.
Drinks Power Steering Fluid Faster Than Most Cars (not too bad, simple, cheap) That Kinda Comes With The Territory Of Having The Extra Body Armor. I daily drive the car and top of the fluid about every couple months.
Looks Better When She's Waxed.
The passenger head light got nicked with a rock, does not affect function but should be noted.
The rear door ash trays don't like to stay in place
*side note, from what I can tell the car has never been smoked in. Also it has the cabin air filter.

Our ATN Night Storm HPT Night Vision Monocular, Gen 2+ HPT
Image Intensifier Tube Type: High Performance Generation 2 
Image Tube Summary: A High Performance Generation 2 Image Tube is the best Gen 2 image tube available. It gives vastly superior performance than the lessor Gen 2 CGT or Gen 2+ image tubes. The performance is very close to Gen 3.

Product Info:
The ATN Night Storm HPT Black Monocular is the latest in technology and the newest addition to the ATN line of Night Vision products. Strict standards and precision manufacturing have brought to you a rugged, yet lightweight, waterproof Night Vision Device, which provides superior optical calibration at an economical cost. Revolutionizing the Night Vision market was one of our top priorities. We accomplished our goal by combining a 6-element, F1.2, 50mm, heavy-coated glass lens with the ability to be submersed under water. We also were able to include a number of other options to make this unit even more superior than it was already. The sleek body, with contoured finger rests, houses a powerful high-resolution HPT generation intensifier tube which allow a 35,000 max light amplification. Once you enter a completely dark where no ambient light is to be found, you can take advantage of our built-in Total Darkness Technology which our Infrared Illuminator will provide. The unit also has an optional camera adapter, which will allows you to turn a regular household camera into a Night Vision camera.
If optimal picture is what you are in the market for, the ATN Night Storm HPT Black will satisfy your needs. The unit's diopter adjustment of +/- 5 and 1 m to infinity range of focus will allow you to focus in on any object in range. The ATN Night Storm HPT Black is one of the most accurate imaging devices on the market at a reasonable price.

I'm helping my friend sell his Desert Eagle because of major health issues. He bought it new over a year ago it was born a 44mag and sent it to Magnum Research to install new barrel and bolt assembly where the 357 barrel has stayed thinking it would have less recoil. This firearm has not been fired and it looks it. Both barrels have had a red dot optic attached and there are very light blemishes on the rail. Comes with a 100% money back guarantee if you disagree.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

Let me know if you have one. I have many hunting and fishing items to trade or I will purchase from you for a resonable price. Thanks"
