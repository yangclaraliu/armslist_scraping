This is the predecessor to the Camdex and Ammoload machines. The machine runs between 3,600 to 4,400 pieces per hour and is shipped ready to run.
The machine has 5 stations:
1.	Decapping/Sizing
2.	Priming
3.	Powder Drop
4.	Bullet Seat
5.	Bullet Crimp / Eject
This machine was built in the 1970’s and has ran several 100k’s rounds without problem. We are selling this machine as we are upgrading our manufacturing line to machines built in house with PLC controls.
The machine is listed at $18,500 and is sold without the collating feeders shown in the picture, but we can order those in directly from MA-Systems for whatever 45 caliber casing + bullet you decide to use. The machine is ready to ship the day we get your payment.
Machine ships in a solid crate directly to your door, either by FedEx ground or freight. Buyer pays freight which should be less than $200 in mainland USA.
Please see the video of the machine running here, pictures and text cannot describe how good a deal this machine is:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bp1vr7qy0xbeqp/DSCN1045.MOV
This is a fraction of the cost of a Camdex or Ammoload loader which run between $42,000 to $60,0000+. Perfect for indoor ranges or smaller manufacturers looking for a good return on investment.
The current manufacturer will provide support via phone, and training if you drive to his location. Spare parts are also available.
Machines are also available in other calibers.

. AT THE REQUEST OF THE GERMAN MILITARY, who wanted a smaller pistol than the Astra 400 in 9X19, Astra designed their Model 600 in 1943. Between the 16th of May & 16th of July, 1944, 10,540 Astra 600 pistols were delivered to the German military across the Spanish/French border. Another 28,000 had been purchased but the allied advance in France prevented their delivery. Only the first 10,540 have German acceptance stamps. This particular example is a post-war West German police issue. Only up to serial number 10,500 made it into the Nazi hands, the rest of the Astra 600 contract sat in a Spanish arsenal until the early 1950s when they were sold to the West German police. I've always liked the Astra 600s unique looks. The quality of manufacture is high, as the Spanish were out to impress the German military. The German military were already satisfied customers of Astra, having used the compact model 300, the larger model 400. The Model 600/43 has a tublar design that makes it look like a squirt gun! The Model 600 is the ultimate of the Astra tube design, it started in 1912 with the Campo Giro. The Model 600 is the apex of fit, finish and reliability for Astra pistols. Shooting one is not an experience one soon forgets. All prices firm!

I sell on here quite often. It seems like we have a great group of people. However, the group is specific so it is pretty small. Only us gun zealots seem to come on here. Because of it we are limited in exposure to sell our items. There are millions of people on facebook that would love to buy what we are selling, but they aren't thinking about it because they don't see it, so they don't look on Armslist.

I have started a group on Facebook called "" West Michigan - Buy, Sell, Trade, Barter "" Please join it and ask your friends to. Because it is not specifically a ""gun"" group, but is for anyone to sell locally, in the future we will gain quite a bit larger of an audience. 

It is a public group. The only rules to the group are that no one complains about an item or price on a post. No one is rude, and what you are selling can be legally sold.

VG+ condition, would almost say Like New
Only 250 rounds downrange, only two trips to the range, and cleaned thoroughly after every use.
Absolutely no issues whatsoever. I'm just a smaller guy, and it doesn't fit my hands as well as most of my thinner-handled firearms do.
Shoots accurate. I'd say it shoots better than I do.
The trigger is amazing. It's got a nice ""click"" to it and requires very little pressure. It's like pushing a button. You could easily spend twice this much to get a pistol with a trigger like this.
Even when using a decently strong load, the kick isn't any worse than .38+P. The steel body and slide give the gun the perfect amount of weight to counteract the high-energy 10mm round.
Other features include a rail, skeletonized trigger, decocker... this is a lot of gun for the money!
Don't just take my word for it though. Check out the stellar ratings at online shops and forums.
Includes original manual, cleaning kit, case with combination lock, and everything else you would get with a brand new weapon.

A new one is going for $700 online - and that's if you can find one! 

Asking $550, but open to other reasonable offers. I am also open to trades, as you can see below."

It has an all stainless lower with a blued upper. As well as rosewood grips. Round count is around 300. This model features a tip up barrel design which allows the user to load the magazine full then tip the barrel up with a trip lever on the side to add a round into the breech then fire to cycle the magazine. Perfect for those who have a hard time racking a slide. This weapon can also be chambered by pulling the slide like a typical semi auto. This weapon is VERY accurate for such a compact design. Last but not least it is warranted by Taurus for the life time of the weapon regardless if your the original owner or the 50th owner. Hoping to sale or trade. Weapon has minor finish wear on the slide. Text 417 733 1512 or email me at uzidoesit1985@gmail.com.

(The US Navy had a bad habit of sinking their supply ships!) 

For the collectors out there, here are the details: It's an 8th Series Nagoya with defaced mum and excellent condition wood with original urushi oil finish.  Excellent chrome bore with no rust anywhere.  The receiver and bolt serial numbers match, while the firing pin and safety do not.  The extractor has what appears to be a number, but I can't make it out.  It has the late war wood buttplate with three nails.  I've been making and selling custom reproduction Japanese slings for many years, and the one in the photo (a $45 value) is included as a  bonus!

The price is $260 cash face-to-face in the Jacksonville, FL area only.  Sorry, no shipping or trades as this time as I need the cash to pay for another rifle.  The bayonet in the photos is not included in that price, however I will include it in the deal for an extra $40.  (Go price Japanese bayonets on eBay to find out what a great deal THAT is!)  I have a C&R license so I'll need a copy of the buyer's C&R or FL driver's License info. 

All of these items purchased separately would easily be around $400, so don't miss out on this great deal on a beautiful piece of WW2 history!
