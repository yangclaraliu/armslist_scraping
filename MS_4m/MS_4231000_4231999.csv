It is a Mustang XSP purchased brand new by me last month and has only had 100 rounds through it (with 0 malfunctions). It comes with original Colt case, paperwork, lock, and two Colt OEM magazines. 
I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
Therefore, I am looking to make a trade for a Sig Sauer P938 in new or like new condition. I have a quantity of .380 ACP ammo, additional magazines, and/or cash that I can add to make up any price difference. Finish is not a huge deal, but I would prefer a model with wood grips, and would be particularly interested in a SAS model.
I am primarily looking to make a trade, but might also consider a reasonable cash offer.
The best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. I have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. FTF Wichita area only."

Blank rounds are used in movies/tv/etc and ""simulated"" live fire training which is basically the look, feel and sound of a real round except a projectile ejecting from the barrel. These bullets are as loud and in some case as dangerous so you still should follow all safety precautions as if these were live rounds. 

Besides films, blanks are also used by some home owners as an alternative to deadly force as these can be fired in a attempt to frighten and scare of potential intruders. Blanks also produce the same exact muzzle flash a regular live round would; once again the only difference is there isn't a bullet that fires out of the barrel.

Comes with 3 genuine Sig 15 round mags and factory installed night sites (which are still very bright). Also, has the Department of Defense UID (Unique Identification) and the engraved Navy anchor.

The M78 was made by Radom Arsenal as evidenced by the Circle 11 stamp on top of the barrel. It is a licensed copy of the HK P2A1. 

I've laid this pistol next to a P2A1 that I own and they appear identical except for the stampings on the frame and barrel. Although I haven't tried it appears that many if not all parts would interchange.

I can only describe this pistol as excellent with 98% of it's original finish. Mechanical function is perfect and bore looks great.

 It comes with a  green rope lanyard, a military flap style holster with shoulder strap that is in very good shape which is made of a a weatherproof woven vinyl in an OD green color. The holster has room for the pistol, a supply of flare cartridges and miscellaneous items. Holster is in good but well used condition.

Also included is a set of chamber adapters. The first allows you to fire any .22LR, Long or Short ammunition. The other is for firing .410 shotgun shells or .45 Long Colt ammo. The adapters are a simple drop in installation and they have rifled barrels making them legal to use anywhere a real handgun is alllowed. Bottom line is that these turn this flare pistol into an excellent emergency self defense/survival tool for your ""bug out"" bag.

Finally there is a complete cleaning kit that has a stiff nylon brush for normal cleaning. A brass bristle brush for really heavy duty cleaning and a felt tipped rod that fits the bore snuggly eliminating the need for cleaning patches.

$250. Pickup in the Brandon area or I can ship to places where legal at buyers expense. Must be at least 21 to purchase.

All you OU and OSU fans that like to tailgate you will be the envy of all when you have music going big screen TVs hooked up and food cooking. These units are made of aluminum and stainless steel so everything is light weight when constructing it. 

For all you hunters out there this unit could easily be used as a blind that can be brought to your hunting camp and left for either cooking or using it as a blind. They have adjustable leveling on all four corners and aluminum stairs that come with them.

Our government spends over a 100k on each one of these units so the price I'm selling them at is a fraction of what they are worth. If you are the type that likes to have what no one else has and likes to cook or hunt then this is it!! 

I have 4 MKT90 Field Kitchen trailers for sale. Each one is priced differently and negotiable on prices pending on what comes with each unit. I can add things to each unit or take away to help the price. Either way these units are used units from our great military and could be used for multiple purposes. If your interested in having a food trailer this is probably your cheapest way to start out. Any more questions feel free to contact me.

What I am offering up for sale is a '70 Series 1911A1 United States Marine Corps Commemorative Colt in .45 automatic.  This Colt is in new, mint and unfired condition.  This Colt factory photoengraved special edition is from the Colt Custom Shop on Automatic Pistols.  This particular pistol was built 09/08/1979 and is #374 of 500. The firearm has the following special features: Both rear sides of the slide have, in gold, Marine Corps emblem.  Center of the slide has the famed pictorial of Marines raising the flag on Mt. Suribachi during World War II flanked by scroll work on the left and right side an inscription that reads ""United States Marine Corp, Limited Edition"".  These are far different than most commemoratives that you see today as they were built by Colt and not a 3rd party.  These were limited to only 500 units total production.  The Presentation case has a brass plaque that reads ""United States Marine Corp, Limited Edition"".  The box is in excellent condition with the key still in the original white envelope.  Also included with this pistol is the original Colt cardboard box with all paperwork and yellow/green Colt Custom Shop end label.  Asking $2800 for this rear and fine collector piece.  I will consider Collector Colt or Collector Smith & Wesson Trades.  I have ZERO interest in plastic guns, used electronics, custom wheels, tattoos or anything else that is not Collector revolver/Pistol related.  If you have a high quality custom built bench-rest bolt action rifle I’ll listen.  I am willing to ship to an FFL out of state.  Out of state trades will be very difficult to do so I’m most likely not interest in those but will listen if the trade gets my attention.  Please email me though this sight and include your name and contact information.  No name and no contact information may not get a reply from me.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*529I"

Since then the gun was sent to Ford Guns in Florida where they dehorned all the sharp edges and radius the corners and polished all stainless to a mirror finish. There is not a machine mark on the pistol and the finish looks better than any bright stainless or nickel you have ever seen. Grant Cunningham did the trigger work. If you know anything about revolvers you know who this is. The single action pull is SCARY and breaks at less than a pound. The double action feels like its on ice. Its as smooth or smoother than any Colt Python out there. The pistol comes with Hogue Rosewood grips and Hi Viz sights. The white pipe and red pipe have never been used. Also comes with the original Ruger Grips. The pistol will cut the same hole at 15 yards freehanded all day long. Mainly looking to trade but will accept offers as long as they are reasonable. Make sure you know the cost to duplicate this pistol before you make an offer. PISTOL HAS HAD LESS THAN 400 ROUNDS THRU IT SINCE NEW. WILL ONLY TRADE FOR ITEMS LISTED BELOW. Thanks for looking.

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm or a Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs. Maybe a Glock 26

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $500.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

How to tell if the Glock magazines are pre-ban...
""GLOCK’s original (pre-ban) magazines were NFML (non-full metal lined). They were designed to stick in the magazine well if the magazines had ammunition in them and the magazine catch was inadvertently pushed. These magazines had no inserts and the floor plates didn’t have the hole in them as the future varieties have. You can tell these magazines easily by the distinctive “U-shaped” notch.

Both have stainless steel Pacnor barrels on them capable of heavy hitting smokeless loads. Both shoot great, have low round counts, and I am having a hard time parting with either one, but they are fun to build too, and I don't need 3 of them. 

#1 is SS with Boyd's pepper grey thumbhole stock. the stock has been professionally bedded and free floated. I will sell it with Talley light weight medium height base/rings. 

#2 has SS barrel but receiver and barrel done in Black Ice. I really like the maintenance free black ice appearance. It is sitting on a Mossy Oak Brush stock, or I could put it on a Hogue gillie green stock that is piller bedded. This one will come with one piece Weaver picitanny 20MOA scope base.

Price asked does not include scopes, but I do have a few great options that I will consider negotiating, if you want one of them too. 

Asking price is below my cost and very fair, but OBO. I am not looking to make money on them, but I am not desperate and can keep them if there is no interest in them. Serious inquiries, please ask for more details or photos.
