The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOILâ¢ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.The CCPâs SOFTCOILâ¢ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Manufacturer: Walther Arms IncModel #: CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol)Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Stainless SteelStock: Black Polymer, Non-Slip Hi-Grip TextureSights: FT: Interchangeable RR: AdjustableBarrel Length: 3.54Overall Length: 6.5Weight: 22.33 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 8+1Action: Single Action# of Mags: 2Receiver: Black Polymer, Equiptment RailFeatures: SoftCoil Delayed Gas Blowback SystemLoaded Chamber Indicator, Reversible Mag ReleaseSee an ad here"

The gun has had the trigger reworked and is excellent. The entire rifle is Teflon Coated (Bear Coat by Rocky Mountain Arms). The scope is a Weaver Grand Slam 3-10x40. $1600 was invested when this rifle was built. 
This is an great gun for elk hunting. I have taken one elk with it and several mule deer...all one shot kills. The Teflon is scratched and nicked here and there. The paint on the stock is chipped in a few spots. Its a hunting gun, not a safe queen. This is a good shooter...Federal 225 grain Trophy Bonded ammo routinely groups from 3/4"" to 7/8"" for three shots at an average of 2693fps. It also likes 225 grain reloads a great deal. I was getting 2800fps with 225 grain Nosler BT and Reloader 15 powder. Included are 17 reloads with 200gr Remington bullets, 8 reloads with 225 gr Nosler BT bullets, and a box and a half of Federal Premium 225 gr TBBC factory ammo. This is a very nice big game rifle.

This is an Israeli police trade in pistol and although it has fairly significant holster wear as seen in the pictures the internals are in very good condition and it shoots great.

This is what is considered a ""Pre-B"" due to the old style safety with detent hole, rounded hammer and trigger guard and was manufactured before firing pin blocks were required on pistols and therefore does not have one.  The lack of a firing pin block makes for a very smooth and light single action trigger pull, arguably one of the best you can find in a CZ75.

I have replaced both the hammer spring and recoil spring for good measure with replacements from Cajun Gun Works.

Comes with one magazine.  9MM ammo available as well if interested.

Buyer must have CPL or Pistol Purchase Permit and valid Michigan ID, face to face transaction only.  

Open to trades for other 9mm pistols, preferably Sig P320, HK VP9, or FNS9 but I will consider offers.

The SKS is flawless and has an excellent bolt/action. The rifle will take tapco magazines in addition to AK magazines with minimal modifications. 5 minuets of light filing on a magazine will allow it to feed reliably to the SKS. I will include a modified ak magazine so you can see where you need to file to make it fit into the sks. I am not picky on the AK platform as long as it functions good. I have multiple sks's and would like to get a true AK platform. Send me an email and lets trade :)

It's a waterfowl/turkey gun for use with 3"" and 3.5"" shells.  It will shoot 2 3/4 inch shells, but doesn't usually cycle them, especially lighter loads.  This isn't a problem with the gun, just the way Mossberg designed it.

Used but in great condition.  Well maintained, kept cleaned, and stored dry.  Kills birds.   Comes with an extended and ported modified choke for waterfowl hunting.   Also have an extended turkey choke and the factory full choke.  Still looking for the factory M and IC chokes, if I find them I'll include them too.     Avery camo sling included.

 First up is a Ruger MKII Competition/Target stainless with slab side bull barrel, target crowned, wood target grips, Millett red dot scope with sun shade, Ruger stainless rings, three Ruger magazines, and the original box and paperwork. These are the best of the MK series pistols and are becoming very hard to find. The last one I saw for sale in a gun store was going for $650 for just the pistol and one mag. I'm setting my trade value for $650 for everything. I know ammo can be difficult to obtain still so if you need some in the trade I will include a brick of CCI target for an additional $50 trade value. I payed $60 for it at Dicks so I don't want to hear any shit about price gouging.
 Second is a Smith&Wesson Shield 9mm with manual saftey. It come with both factory mags and box and papers. Has S&W blue color fill and polished feed ramp. Has under 100 rods thru it. I bought it for my wife and she won't carry it because she doesn't like the grip. Go figure. Have a 100rds FMJ to go with it. Trade value $400."

I have a Mossberg 810a bolt action in 30.06 for sale. The rifle was made in the 70's. The rifle is in good condition. Minor blemishes and wear from normal use. This is quite an accurate rifle for what it is. Action works perfect. Comes with an adjustable trigger stock from the factory. I have the trigger set pretty lite at the moment, but can be set to your liking. 

The scope is included. It is a Tasco. It holds zero with 30.06 and has worked well on the rifle.

100% US Made this is a very nicely built rifle. Clean crisp trigger with a nice break, and it is a double hook. Typically single hooks have better pulls because there is less surface area but this is a trigger than needs no work. Impressive, with the added bonus of double hook. Should one hook break (unlikely), you still have a backup and trigger group still functions flawlessly.

I fired about 100 rounds through it. 
Comes with a 30rnd Magpul PMag which fits tightly into the magwell; no wobble.
This rifle is known to be very accurate; 1 M.O.A. which is exceptional for the AK platform. Especially in a stock rifle. 
Black nitride finish is very tough. Dust cover is solid, no rattle. Wider T-bar mag release. 
Black nitrided barrel rivals chrome lined barrels in longevity.
Side rail scope mount. 
Accepts standard AK furniture if you wanted to change it out. 
I Adjusted the safety so it is nice and smooth. Easy to slide on and off with positive detent positions. It won't move unintentionally.
Stamped receiver with perfectly seated rivets; not crushed in and not standing too high.
Its a nice shooter but I just find myself more comfortable with the AR platform with 5.56. 


Note: picture shows aftermarket muzzle break and grip which are not included. I already sold those to a buddy with an AK. It will come with the standard slant break and century grip."

Very good condition. 125 rounds fired. I bought this back in July on a whim and I really don't have a use for it. It comes stock but includes an extra wolff 20lb recoil spring with matching firing pin spring and an oversized EGW firing pin stop which has already been fitted to the gun but is not installed. Again, gun is as it came from factory but includes these additional parts. Comes with one 8 rnd ACT mag.
It might be hard to see in the picture but some of the finish on the right side of the slide has worn from the dust cover. 
Safery has been lightly de-horned for more comfortable shooting grip. Feed ramp has been polished. Internal moving parts have been lightly polished to further smooth the action. 
The slide to rail fit is very tight. Impressive build quality on this gun.

This gun is a great plinker and also great for getting the feel of a 1911 because even though it's in .22 it is still full size.
I bought it new at a gun show 2 years ago and have taken very good care of it. I'd estimate about 500 rounds through it and I always clean and oil my firearms after an outing. I am selling this only because I need the money. Serious inquiries only please and no trades. I paid $440 after taxes so please no low balls on offers. It will come with the original case, one magazine and I'll throw on 2 - 100 round boxes of .22LR CCI ammo. Text REDACTED for questions or offers. Will be in Lawrence during week days and Shawnee during nights. Thanks for looking."

A high quality Spikes Tactical lower parts kit is included and so is a BCM receiver extension kit so whatever you choose to build will have a top of the line foundation. 

Don't miss out on your chance to have your bases covered before prices skyrocket again!

The Little Badger isnât like most survival rifles. It takes minimalism and weight reduction to a level only seen inside the custom gun world. It is a single-shot folding rifle, with a wire stock and accessory rails. Since itâs a survival rifle, you may as well throw a flashlight on it, and a mini red dot sight. One thing that makes the Little Badger so appealing is that itâs got nice adjustable sights on it. A single-shot rifle, itâs break-action and uses an extractor. It has five sections of rail, a short quad rail that doubles as your handguard and a smaller section behind the trigger that gives you a little traction. It has a plastic-capped wire stock and thatâs it. The stock carries a handful of cartridges in a nylon sleeve, and comes with a matching nylon carry bag. The end result is a gun that folds down to just 16.5 inches long and weighs just over 3 pounds.Includes the carrying bag shown in the pictures. Â  VeryÂ few in stock.

Pietta's 1858 Army Blued Engraved .44-Cal. Black-Powder Revolver will find you with history right in your hands. Laser engravings depict intricate patterns of the mid-1800s. Sleek European-walnut grips give this revolver an opulent look. It was one of the most powerful revolvers in the world at the time it was introduced and it debuted a number of design features that carried forward into the eventual development of centerfire designs. One of its most popular features was how fast the gun could be reloaded. Remington's cylinder-swapping system was extremely fast by standards of the time. Steel construction. Nickel-plated brass trigger guard.
