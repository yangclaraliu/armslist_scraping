This P938 is the most accurate of all the small CCW 9mms I tried (I tried them all before buying) and is a joy to shoot with the Hogue sport grips that came on this Sport model.
I love these sights so much I immediately went out and bought them for all my other guns.

This ultra-compact, dual-output feat of engineering boasts a proprietary faceted reflector that shapes the light from its high-performance LED into a broad, smooth MaxVision Beam™ at both 125 and 15 lumens—astounding levels for a finger-sized light. The beam is perfectly balanced and better preserves your dark-adapted vision since it doesn’t have an intense hot spot. And its wide beam pattern was designed to fit your field of view. Because of all these factors, it better maintains your overall situational awareness, crucial for safely navigating in the dark.  The small but potent Titan was designed to always be with you and, to that end, comes with a stainless steel split ring that securely attaches to your keys—ensuring it’ll never be out of reach. To activate Titan, simply rotate its head counterclockwise (with head pointing away from you) for low output. Return to off by rotating clockwise, then rotate counterclockwise again, within one second, to unleash all 125 room-filling lumens from Titan’s high-performance LED. Powered by its included AAA NiMH rechargeable battery (charger not included), Titan can generate useful light output for up to 8.5 hours on a single charge, thanks to its sophisticated microprocessor that continuously manages the flow of power. This versatile keychain light can also run off of a readily available AAA alkaline battery for up to 13 hours.  AAA lithium batteries offer increased runtimes on low-output setting—up to 17 hours.    Titan’s durable yet elegant body is precision machined from strong, lightweight aerospace aluminum and further protected by a hard-anodized finish that meets high military specifications. And its head is topped off by a coated, virtually indestructible polycarbonate window that also optimizes light output. The rugged, one-of-a-kind Titan was built to take on the elements and the rigors of modern-day life. It may just be the last keychain light you’ll ever own.

I am the original owner and I can tell you that this 1911 is a great shooter! I have shot close to 2 boxes of ammo thru it and it has never failed one time and shoots to point of aim. I usually had around 2 1/2 inches at 20 yards, which is awesome for a production gun. The gun shoots far better than I can shoot it. I have only had it about 2 years and upgraded it to Trijicon ""figure 8"" night sights. I also added the very hard to find Taurus ""Bull"" wood grips (which really set it off). I am only selling it because I rarely have time to shoot it anymore. This 1911 is in great shape with everything that it came from the factory with including an extra mag. Thanks for looking!"

Look at the pictures closely. What you see is what you get. The only sign of wear is on the finish of the left forward frame. You can see where the black has come off. This is nothing uncommon and is why Kimber does not guarantee the finish on their guns.

The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine. The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately. Made in U.S.A."

This is a steal of a deal, I'm only selling because I 've decided to switch to an HK P30 for my main handgun.

The Heckler & Koch P2000 is a German semi-automatic pistol introduced late in 2001 and intended primarily for law enforcement, paramilitary, and commercial markets. It is based on the USP Compact pistol. The P2000 was designed specifically with improved ergonomic characteristics; it has features that reduce handling related stresses, while at the same time increasing user handling and comfort.

The P2000 is a short recoil-operated locked breech pistol with a modified Browning-type linkless cam action with a vertically tilting barrel also employed in the USP series of self-loading pistols, as well as most modern linkless semi autos.

The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol design, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs.

As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover in front of the trigger guard that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol.

The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous slide lock and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard.

If we could work some combination for a deal,  let me know. 

People keep asking so... $290 for the keltec with 90 rounds and 2 mags... This is the hard chrome version so it won't rust in your pocket (and it's not ugly like the black and blue one) ... It cost more.   32acp ammo isn't cheap,  50 rounds is $22.  The extra mag is also around $22.   Add it all up,  $280 (gun) + $40 (ammo)  + $22 (extra mag)  = $342.  Mine is tried and true and the break in is done. $290 is a smoking deal. 

$275 for the Ruger.  It has a scratch but functions flawlessly. Best 22lr semiautomatic hand gun you can get. I'll throw 1 brick of 525 golden bullet in for old fashioned price of $25 (only if the gun is purchased). 

FFL of your choice in my area. The cost is yours but we can meet up ahead of time for you to check it out and see if you like it first.

CVA's proprietary breech plug is easier to operate. The rifle's scope is attached with a Dura Sight Dead-On Z2 alloy integral scope rail base/ring system. Blued steel barrel. Reversible hammer spur.

Austrian M1854 ""Lorenz"" Rifle Musket with original bayonet and an original US made scabbard. Musket is in good condition with a nice stock with crisp edges. Some bumps and bruises due to long and hard use, but much nicer than many. 
The metal has deep chocolate brown patina, but is arsenal bright where covered by barrel bands. Some light pinpricking around the breech and bolster area. The lock is unmarked and there is no visible makers stamp on the barrel. The bore is .57 caliber and has very strong rifling. $1,150

Pedimontese M1844/60 .69 caliber rifle musket with original bayonet. Very nice condition musket made by F&T (Falisse and Trapmann) of Liege, Belgium in 1861 as evident by the lock stampings. Barrel has several Belgian proofmarks. 
The stock is in very good shape with minimal wear. The bayonet is in good condition, with some old pitting and is developing a nice mottled patina. It is a very tight fit for the gun and is missing the locking ring. $950

Percussion converted Smith Cogswell M1808 .69 caliber musket. A very cool old percussion altered M1808 musket. This gun was originally built as a flintlock for the State of New York, as evident by the ownership marks on the barrel, and was converted to percussion using the French, or drum method. Where this one differs is that the original flint cock was retained and a crude, abet functional striker was brazed onto the face of the cock to allow it to operate correctly.
The barrel appears to have been cleaned at some point. The stock has a break through the wrist that was repaired. The repair is visible, but very solid. I think the the mainspring is broken, but have not removed the lock to see. There is tension enough for the hammer to operate, but there may not be enough force to break a percussion cap.
The stock has an interesting modification removing the middle barrel band and thinning the stock to remove the band step. The front sight/barrel band has been filed flat across the top and the bayonet lug has been modified into a new front sight. $800
