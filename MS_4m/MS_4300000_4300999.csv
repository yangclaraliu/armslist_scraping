Manufacturer's description:
Engineered for superior accuracy
Ergonomic stock enhances tack-driving results
Superior recoil pad minimizes flinch for fast follow-up
Adjustable trigger for customized trigger pull
The Remington Model 700™ Special Purpose Synthetic Tactical rifle delivers everything shooters love about the legendary Model 700 at an affordable price. From the rock-solid receiver’s ""three rings of steel"" configuration to exceptional right-out-of-the-box accuracy, the 700 SPS™ has all you’d expect from America’s most popular bolt-action centerfire rifle. Its improved all-weather synthetic stock is more ergonomic for better handling and has sling swivel studs. The carbon steel barrel comes clean without sights and is drilled and tapped to accept scope mounts. All exterior metal features a matte blued finish. 
The SPS™ Tactical version adds features to deliver even more incredible tack-driving, game-dropping accuracy. Its X-Mark Pro® trigger is externally adjustable so you can customize the trigger pull. A SuperCell™ recoil pad minimizes kick for fast follow-up shots. The 20"" heavy-contour barrel teams with dual-point pillar bedding to enhance accuracy. The ergonomic black synthetic stock has Hogue® overmoldings for a sure grip in any weather, and a semi-beavertail forend aids stable shooting off a rest."

Thank You

This FAQ is intended and written for PA residents only.

If you reside in another state, please consult a legal representative in your own state to explain your states laws to you.

Federal law:
Most questions on Federal Firearms Law can be answered by the ATFs FAQ on the subject, the FAQ covers sales, dealing, and many other subjects:

http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/

to put it simple, heres some guidelines to follow to keep your butt out of lockup. these are NOT all the laws, if you are unfamiliar with Firearms laws, it's suggested that you do some research before proceeding.

Pertinent Federal Law:

1. Interstate sales of ANY firearm (handgun or longarm) MUST involve a FFL on the buyers end. It is a felony under Federal law to sell to residents of another state FTF or by mail/shipping without involving a FFL on the buyers end.

2. Longarms can generally be purchased from a FFL in any state, or from a resident of your own state. 

3. Handguns can only be purchased from/through a FFL in your state of residence.

4. Federal law allows persons 18 years and older to purchase longarms from an FFL.

5. Federal Law allows persons 21 years and older to purchase Handguns from an FFL.


Pertinent Pennsylvania Law:

1. 1. Face To Face transfers/sales of longarms (shotgun or rifle) are legal in Pennsylvania, between PA residents. There is no requirement to use a FFL for a transfer of a longarm in PA, as long as neither person is a ""prohibited person"" (legally unable to purchase a firearm ) and both are legal aged(18 or older) residents of Pennsylvania. It's SUGGESTED that you provide a Bill of Sale and check ID on purchasers.

2. Concealable weapons (Handguns, rifles/MGs with a barrel less than 16"", shotguns with a barrel less than 18"", and AOWs) MUST be transferred through a FFL (Or Sheriffs Dept), and the PICS must be performed on the buyer before sale is completed. Age for transfer of the above weapons at an FFL is 21.

3. Handguns may be legally transferred without FFL or Sheriffs Dept approval between Married Spouses, Parents and children, and Grandparent to grandchild, provided that the recipient is at least 18 years of age, and not a prohibited person.

4. You cannot sell ANY firearm of any type to a Prohibited Person, this INCLUDES BLACK POWDER FIREARMS.


STRAWMAN SALES WARNING:

Since its obvious that the BATFE finds it easier to go after ordinary gunowners who make mistakes, than to go after violent felons, be very careful to follow the law. 

Be SURE the person you are selling your firearm to is the actual buyer.
A strawman sale is when you sell your firearm to a person who is purchasing it FOR another person, who may or may not be prohibited.

Again, its suggested that you get/provide a copy of a bill of sale, and check the buyers ID when selling FTF. 

Ignore any offers to avoid or evade the above law requirements, reporting users to staff that attempt this is requested, illegal activity on these forums is PROHIBITED."

It has the original Swiss style hand guards, but you can add a rail to them very easily. This rifle is piston operated, and combines AR accuracy and ammo with AK operation and reliability. These are not in production by Sig, but still under warranty from the factory. Breaking down the rifle for cleaning is very AR like, with quick break down and easy cleaning thanks to gas not being blown back into the bolt. The safety is ambidextrous on the rifle, and it has a side folding stock that is also adjustable for length of pull. The rifle takes AR magazines, and I've only had the opportunity to put about 120 rounds through it. If you purchase the optics with the rifle, it is currently sighted in at 50 yards which should put the point of impact right in the center at 100 yards or so. The barrel is the quality you would expect from Sig, and has a 1 in 7 twist. The gas system on the rifle is also adjustable. The rifle is also equipped with a lower rail on the Swiss style hand guards, and a Sig 2/3 point adjustable sling is also included. Below are the details of the rifle package:

$925 Sig Sauer SIG556 Patrol Rifle w/folding and adjustable stock and one 30 round Pmag.

Optics:
$249 Vortex Crossfire II 1-4x24 with V-Brite Reticle
$185 American Defense Recon-H Quick-Release mount with 30mm rings
$360 only for the set.

$1250 Total if you want the whole package, or we can discuss what you'd like to add or subtract.

Sig Sauer MK25 Navy in 9mm. $700. The pistol has had 150 rounds through it and comes with 3 15 round Sig factory mags and the original box from the factory. The Navy model sports a salt water resistant coating on the exterior and interior, has a lighter slight and over all feel, and an accessory rail. The pistol is in good condition as you can see in the pictures, with standard wear from use. I can be reached by email or by text at REDACTED. Please no calls during the day because I will be at work. Thanks."

Up for sale or trade is my super-concealable Ruger LCP .380 with Crimson Trace red laser and modified Hogue grip (the grip normally does NOT accommodate the laser). 

I have put less than 100 rounds down the pipe on this one, but it has functioned flawlessly with both ball and Hydra-Shok hollows. This is the first gen with the rather diminutive sights. Great for holster insertion/drawing... not so much for target acquisition. I painted the sights white and it definitely helped. Can get all 7 shots in the 10-ring at 10 yards with practice and trigger discipline. 

I want to sell (or more preferably trade) this only because the trigger is different from all my other pistols and I like uniformity across my platforms. Also, I don't care for finding .380 ammo at a deal... would like to consolidate my caliber choices. 

Comes with boxes for both the pistol and the laser, paperwork for both, original factory spent case, 1 6-shot mag with pinky floorplate, 1 20rd box of Federal Low Recoil (As if you'd need a low recoil .380, right?) Hydra-Shok defense hollows, and I'll even throw in a pair of Duck Commander photo chromatic ballistic shooting glasses (a $100 value alone on Amazon). 

All trade offers will be entertained, but I have a sweet spot for .357 revolvers (snubbies, 6""ers, whatever), milsurp, steel-framed .40's, etc. Run it by me... Worst I can do is say no then taunt your family background!

I bought a new LCP when Ruger was giving away an extra mag and a box of ammo with the purchase. I decided the gun wasn't for me and sold it before this arrived (ammo is gone, sorry). So, this is a brand new never used mag - it just doesn't have the factory packaging normally provided. Sorry for the stock photo - my pic is missing at the moment for some reason. 

Looking over LCP mag prices online I'd say $20 is a fair price for this. Or I'd trade for factory boxed 9mm ammo or a LC9 mag. I'm not going to travel all over creation for this given the dollar value involved. I'm from Argos and can travel as far south as Peru, north to US 6, east to Bourbon, and west to Grovertown.

1. Early model RL-550 set up for 45ACP, well used. Cleaned up the linkages & lubed it. Never used it though. Didn't even come with pins for the tool head so I made a couple out of nails. Has large primer slide ONLY. Will come with finished cartridge chute & an AKRO bin, & a large primer pickup tube. Want other stuff, it'll cost more. $300 as described

2. Earlier RL-450 press, like a 550 but doesn't have a removable tool head. Conversions are interchangeable between the two. Auto nada. All manual priming & powder dumping. Comes with kinda funky primer pickup tubes, large & small primer magazines, large & small priming punches but only one slide. Will have a conversion of your choice, AKRO bin & spent primer catcher too. $250

3. Another early model RL-550, my personal one that I've loaded a few thousands rounds on. Has Strong Mount, wrench set, aluminum bullet tray, aluminum roller handle too. Conversion [u]& dies[/u] of your choice (if I have them) plus large & small priming stuff. $575  (If you want Plain Jane or not as many accessories I can do that for less, just figured I'd keep it as is for now)
