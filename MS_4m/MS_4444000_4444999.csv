I have included a write-up of the model 65-3. 

The Smith and Wesson model 65 revolver was introduced in 1973. It was one of several .357 magnum variations of the extremely popular model 10. It is built on the medium sized K frame, making it one of Smith and Wesson's medium-weight models. 

The model 65 was produced from 1973 to 1999, then some minor changes were made. It continued to be produced until 2004. 

The model 65 was always a popular gun with law enforcement officers, as it could handle full-power .357 magnum or .38 +P loads without a problem, and had very good balance and handling characteristics.

The model 65 is no longer produced, While it's not a collectors item (yet), it is a very desirable revolver.

Shoots perfectly! It was originally sold as a tool and lacks serial numbers. With sub-sonic rounds this gun is silent! I'm just looking to sell it because I have no use for it. This gun would make a great father's day special gift to bring back memories of times gone by. Also a perfect gun for the beginning shooter (teens) or even hunting/trapping. This gun is very durable and cheap to shoot if you find the right ammo supplier.

Piston technology is nothing new for us here at Colt. In fact, it was our company that was the first to put a piston system into an AR platform in the late 1960’s to meet a US Army request. The Colt Model 703 was born. Again, Colt was the first to produce this new wave of AR piston systems over 40 years ago…and we’re doing it even better now.

This ammo (except for the 90 rounds of Russian) was all classified as armor piercing and banned from import over 20 years ago. Sealed 550 round spam cans of Chinese steel core 7.62x39 sell for $350-$400 all by themselves and small amounts go for .80 to $1 per round, all on Gunbroker.com. I know what this ammo is worth so please don't waste my time. I KNOW you can buy Tula ammo at Walmart for .30/rnd. This is not Walmart ammo! For the people that say this ammo is not armor piercing, why do ranges like Red Castle prohibit its use on their plate steel targets? Because it punches holes straight through them!

H&K P30S 9 mm (V3) DA/SA, ambidextrous safety lever/rear decocking button, with two 15 round magazines
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.  Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame.  A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.  Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.  During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories

This system will work with .223/5.56 x 45 mm NATO.

Kit includes:
•Patented One-Piece Bolt Carrier
•.750"" Picatinny Gas Block with 3 settings (full gas for standard fire, half gas for suppressed, no gas for single shot)
•Gas Plug
•Upper Receiver Bushing
•Bushing Installation Rod
•Bolt Spring
•Drive Rod with Bushing and Spring
•M4 Style Modified Handguards
•Modified Handguard Cap
•Installation DVD

The Adams Arms Piston System:
•A short stroke free floating piston system.
•Is Self-Cleaning.
•Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator.
•Corrosive resistant coating processes.
•Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel.
•Adjustable gas settings for various applications.
•Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire.

This system requires a carbine gas length (7.866"" from barrel extension to shoulder) and a .750"" gas seat.

We recommend using a standard barrel nut or barrel nut with similar measurements for proper fit and function of the kit. Many aftermarket proprietary barrel nuts do not offer the clearance for the drive rod or proper seating of the spring and bushing."

The P-Series are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. It utilizes a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel.

It has an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released the firing pin springs back to the normal position. It features an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.

Constructed of investment cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel; while the slide and ejector are carbon steel.

I am open to negotiation and can add or take away items to get the deal right. I have many firearms accessories and ammunition so if there's something you'd like to have added or taken out of the deal we can discuss how that will effect the price.

Wylde chamber info:
.223 Wylde is a hybrid .223/5.56 chamber designed by Bill Wylde to yield the accuracy advantages of the match .223 Remington commercial chambering but without pressure or reliability failures when using high velocity 5.56 NATO spec ammunition. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56 but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same."

An absolutely Beautiful rifle by a Master Rifle builder. The rifle is in magnificent condition and has been fired very little. I have owned it for over 25 years and have only fired it twice, I have fired about 100 rounds of ammunition through it. The bore is about mirror bright and very nice. The stock is just gorgeous with beautiful figure and cross grain, real exhibition quality wood. I was told that it is not walnut but is Myrtle wood. This may be the most beautiful rifle ever made by Mr. Dunlop. I know that I have never seen a picture of a more beautiful rifle made by him. There are no cracks or repairs of any kind and only a very few light handling marks and dings. It is equipped with the original Roy F. Dunlop Sure-Grip White Line butt pad and is so marked. The metal retains about 99 plus percent of the original blue and shows little if any wear. The barrel is 28 inches long. The chamber end measures 1.150 inches and the muzzle is .880 inches. It has a 1 in 12 inch twist rate and is 6 groove. It is equipped with a Redfield Palma rear Micrometer sight and a Redfield International Match front globe sight. The rifle weights 13 lbs. 6 oz. with the sights mounted. For those of you that don't know anything about Roy Dunlop I found the following on a website. ""Roy Dunlap, arguably, was one of the greatest gunsmiths of the 20 century. Roy Dunlap learned gunsmithing as an individual machinist and during World War II he was a sergeant and field armorer for the ordnance department. Shortly after the war he wrote his first book entitled Ordnance Went Up Front. However, he is most famous for his 714 page book ""Gunsmithing"" which was first published in 1950 and has been republished a dozen times or more since. Gunsmithing, a highly rated piece of gunning literature, praised as a well written with an abundance of information of great detail. It has been long considered a must for the experienced gunsmith and small arms designer. Roy Dunlap custom rifles are extremely scarce and are rarely offered for sale, so don’t miss out on your chance to own this beautiful rifle by one of America’s premier gunsmiths."" I took loads of pictures for you to look at. If you have any additional questions please feel free to email me. This may well be the nicest looking Roy Dunlop rifle you will ever see or have an opportunity to own. So if you are looking for a real rare, collectable rifle that should make for a nice investment here ya go. I hope one of you can use it. Good Luck bidding. The buyer will need to supply me with a signed and dated copy of your FFL or C&R. Payment must be by certified check or USPS money order. Buyer will have three days from receiving rifle for inspection, pays any return shipping cost. BUT no disassembly and of course No Trading Parts, which I have been told occasionally happens. It has never happened to me but I guess there are some 'Bad Guys' out there. Buyer pays actual shipping costs for USPS Priority Mail and that will be pretty expensive. The rifle weights 13 lbs. 6 oz. and the heavy padded cardboard shipping box weights another 4 lbs. So the total shipping weight will be just under 18 lbs. and will be 50 inches long, 10 inches wide and 5 inches thick. It will require an 'Adult Signature"" that will cost a few extra dollars and any insurance you request. It will be shipped using Priority or Priority Express mail with the USPS. So with that information you should be able to get a pretty exact shipping estimate from the USPS website. It will be shipped from 95667 zip code to your FFL or C&R address. I will include a copy of my FFL C&R for your records. I have not sold or bought much on Gun Broker, so only have a little over 400 feedbacks. But I have sold a great deal on eBay and have in excess of 2200 positive feedbacks. My seller ID is 1903shooter and you are welcome to check my feedback on eBay if you have any concerns. I have been collecting 1903 Springfield rifles, for over 30 years and have a very large number of parts, barrels, receivers, bolts, scopes, complete rifles etc. that I will be selling on gun broker as time allows me to list them. I also have a fairly large number of Winchester 52's, Remington model 37's & 40X's and parts, along with Unertl, Lyman and Fecker scopes. So please watch for my listings. If you would like to see additional pictures or if you have any questions or need any further information please feel free to email me or call my home telephone number 530-622-2387. If you have a slow internet connection it will take a long time for all the pictures to download. Sorry, but I like to provide a lot of pictures so that there is nothing hidden and there are no unwelcome “Surprises” when the winning bidder receives it. Also, please be aware that I use the ‘Flash’ on the camera when taking the pictures. The flash makes the finish look a lot lighter then it really is in normal light but the flash gives the pictures better detail and makes it easier to see any flaws or damage.

I was looking for a set of parts (minus frame and barrel) for a different build, and I happened to come across a very good deal on a new, complete pistol, so I bought the pistol because it was somewhat cheaper than buying all the parts separately.

I test fired the new pistol by putting about 50 rounds downrange, and then disassembled it and used most of the parts for the other build.

I estimate that it would cost between $200 to $300 to buy the parts necessary to recreate a functioning pistol. (The frame could also be used to build a .45 caliber pistol, but the ejector will need to be changed and a new barrel and magazine would be needed)/

I'm told the pistol frame must be transferred through an FFL."

It was made in 1964. It has some exterior wear but functions great. All the internals are only a couple years old because it was sent in to Ruger to have it switched it to the transfer bar system like the modern Ruger SA's. This was a free service Ruger offers to update revolvers for safety.  I do still have all the original parts though if one would like to revert it back to its original configuration. Easy to switch it back. Bore is brite and shinny with good rifling. Comes with holster seen here and original parts. 

  Thanks for looking. Montana, face to face only please."
