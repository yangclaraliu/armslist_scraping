I love this weapon, but with a new baby we are downsizing and I just don't make it to the range much anymore. I have the original case, moon clips, and third-party holster. 

If you haven't shot this ""upsidedown"" revolver, you should try it. Because of the lower barrel firing out of the 6 o'clock position - .357 buffalo load ammunition feels like a .38S in any other revolver. The aggressive forward-leaning grip puts the entire recoil into your palm, no wrist strain at the end of the day. Even with a heavy double-action trigger pull, the low recoil lets me put all six shots in a tight grouping in only a few seconds. 

Some people call it ugly, but I disagree. The design is impressive. This futuristic revolver can be seen in the recent movies Total Recall and Divergent."

Serial number is 3510181. The barrel four-grove barrel is marked RA 3-43 with a flaming bomb (Rifle and barrel manufactured in March 1943).

Remington Bolt Marked R with a 9 or 6 within a box. All other parts appear to be Remington manufacture and correct for rifle.

The oil-finished walnut Remington “S” Stock (without Grasping Groves) has a non-serif proof P inside in a half circle (indicating initial test shot) with the number 4 underneath. It is unclear as to what the number 4 below the P indicates. There is a very faint FJA stamped in block letters on the left side above the trigger indicating Lt. Col. Frank J. Atwood oversaw the original Remington Arms Company inspection at Rochester, New York. There are sub assembly stamps by the front of the trigger guard. The stock has two pins below the receiver. (Remington used pins until about July 1943, when they started using bolts. The left rear side of the stock has O.G. stamped within a box indicating the gun was inspected and may have been rebuilt at the end of World War II at the Ogden Arsenal at Hill Air Force Base (HAFB originally called Hill Field) near Ogden, Utah. (A second “P’ would indicate the rifle was rebuilt.) 

The rifle appears to have the original finish which is a parkerized barrel/receiver with most other parts blue/black.

It has been nickeled long ago and shows wear and discoloration with thin surface corrosion in some areas on the slide. See photos. These could likely be removed with fine emery cloth. All Waffenamp marks are present as well as all Nazi acceptance marks of WaA 140 which are correct for this gun made at Fabrique Nationale, Herstal, Belguim. It has pearlite grips in excellent condition. It exhibits the usual characteristics of machining marks in most areas, as the Nazis were far more interested in rapid production during 1944, and not in commercial finishes. The gun's serial number is marked on the frame as 983b, as is the barrel, but the slide has the numbers 47 slightly offset ahead of the 983b. In the mad rush of production at the time, the gun left the factory this way. The holster is original and is in exceptionally sound condition with no rot nor tears nor excessive wear. The holster has the original cleaning rod and provision for a spare magazine. Something was written across the top of the flap, but it has been rubbed off long ago. The holster is made for belt use but also has fittings so idit could be used in a shoulder rig. There is one 13 round magazine which exhibits late war manufacturing characteristics and has an aluminum follower. It is unmarked. An interesting and nice package at an exceptional price. The holster alone is a $250 collector's item. Priority Mail shipping and is $13.00. Insurance, signature, and other postal services are additional cost at the buyer's election. Face to face in Toledo, Ohio, or ship to FFL."

It is a complete ready to range rifle.  This sale my ATI with a polymer lower. Right off the bat you are going to find a lot good and bad reviews on this rifle. It is full mil-spec and works flawlessly. This rifle cost me the following: $477 rifle w/ one magpul pmag $40 aftermarket quad rail to replace the smooth grips $20 magpul vertical foregrip $100 gunsmith service - cleaned, lubed, tested and preped the weapon and PORTED the gas system for more reliable performance.  $637. The result is a really fun rifle. With the PMag it works flawlessly with PMS or Federal .223 rounds. I have run exactly 1 magazine through since the gunsmith finished breathing on it. I like it. My son however - who cut his teeth on an SKS - does not like it and wants an AK47 like you cannot imagine. This is every bit as reliable and fun as any other AR15 - he just doesnt like the AR15. So, I will trade this with 300 rounds of 223 for an AK47 of pretty much any design. For sale $490 price is firm. You cannot bet a rifle to replace this for anywhere near this money with less than 30 rounds through it. IF you can - I don't want you to call me and tell me how you can. Please, buy it before its gone ;) You can buy the base rifle for $450 plus tax and replace the quad rail and add the foregrip and add the MBUS flip up sites (oops almost forgot those) yes MBUS flip up sites. The rear site is od green and it is basically costing you nothing to be ready to range. You will have to: 1) Have valid Florida ID 2) Come to my home - no longer will I sell guns in a parking lot - that is just too dangerous.  3) Sign a bill of sale If you are not prepared to do these three things that I believe are safety and honesty related then I wont sell this rifle to you.


No, I will not take $300 or $400 so you can buy it today.  Please dont even waste our time.  You cannot buy anything in this price range that is as good as this.  My gunsmith completely went through it along with porting the gas system for reliability - it is a good rifle.


The brand has mixed reviews online and this rifle is a nice one.


It is an excellent deal - I will even give you an extra $40 off for reading to the end of the add and not trying to lowball me - that's $450 if you dont offer me something lower.

For those of you not familiar with this model, it is not your standard 870. This is a single shot gun, purpose built for the game of trap. The magazine tube contains a gas operated recoil reducing piston that works much like an 1100 auto would. It came like this from the factory and it works well. The gun is a pump action gun.

Very nice wood on this one, fixed full choke barrel, Morgan pad. This gun could easily put you on the 27.

Description: Walther PPQ M1 chambered in 9mm, Limited model in LNIB condition. This firearm was acquired in mid 2014 and has been a safe queen. It saw one range trip and functioned perfectly (< 50 rds fired). If you are unfamiliar with the PPQ, this one of the finest striker fire guns ever created. Walther did a limited run of M1 models in 2014 for us Walther enthusiasts. They are no longer making this specific firearm. The M1 model is fully ambidextrous. It will also function with P99 magazines. If you've never shot a PPQ, let me put it this way: the trigger craps all over the competition...it's that good.

Accessories: Original box, backstraps, etc. Also included are three 10 round mec gar magazines in LNIB condition. These magazines are unquestionably MA-legal (they aren't a fudged 15 round mag; they're actually OEM 10 round). These mags cost over $40 each + shipping online

Price: $800 for pistol, 3 mags, backstraps, tupperware. The 3 mags alone cost over $120.
Also will trade for a LNIB Gen 4 Glock 21. this is a pretty good offer seeing as the G21's are available and the PPQ is near impossible to find.

Personal circumstances have created the need for me to sell this weapon. It's been a pet-project, but as one of a handful of modern sporting rifles I have remaining, I decided it's time to put this into the hands of someone who might actually use it. 

This Tavor has never been fired in its original .556 and 223 caliber configuration, and only a few times with the 9mm Kit. The protective factory grease used for packaging still protects the 556 Interchangeable Barrel, and with all original packaging. I purchased the optional 9mm kit last year, and that allowed me to visit my local indoor range, and zero the optics. The Tavor's only seen the outside of my safe four times, and I never fired more rounds than could fit in the five pre-loaded 30 round 9mm magazines that come with the gun. (There's only so much you can do with a rifle an indoor range with s 25 yard target max.). 
The New condition of this MSR BP is obvious, and guaranteed as a condition of sale, and it comes loaded to the hilt with high end options. 

There are too many add-on performance upgrades and feature enhancements to highlight them all here, and I'll try to bullet point the rest further below. I've saved almost all of the receipts, and I'll be happy to share that information. 

Major Upgrades and Add-Ons 
 1. This system includes an IWI 9mm Conversion Kit. The conversion requires a simple plug and play like swap of the action and barrel/:gas system. It's a five minute swap back to .556. The IWI Tavor Carrying Pack (new, and also included) has a compartment specifically designated to carry the conversion kit. Purchase includes 5-9mm 30 round magazines by IWI, and >5 .556 with 20-40 round cap. 
Kit Cost: $800

  2. I replaced the stock IWI trigger with a new **Timney Tavor Trigger Pack**, and the results were phenomenal! The trigger improved from a long 9-11lb pull, with a spongy and weak reset, to a short and smooth take-up to 3.5-4.5lb glass like break with a quick and crisp reset. Cost: $349

  3. I purchased two aftermarket ForeGrip and Flash Light Kits from Manticore Arms and **Midwest Industries** (in that order). Both are included, and the MW Indistires Kit is installed with an enclosed **SureFire Scout light** (with remote pressure switch, accessories, and the new box). 
Cost for both kits $745. 
Cost for M600 LED Scout $350

  4. **Eotech HHS ll (EXPS2-2 with G33 3x Magnifier)**
This is a new in the box unit. I purchased and installed the Midwest Industries Top Rail, and it's the best optic configuration I've found for the Tavor (read opinions about this online. Initially I had the standard Meprolight 21 with magnifier, but the washout was an issue. 
Cost: $1235.00

TAVOR Assault Rifles
Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field stripping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.

The 3.5"" barrel is about as short as the barrel can be while still allowing a full-length ejector rod, which allows the cylinder to be emptied quickly. It has a ""pinned"" barrel - a cross-pin in the frame that goes through the barrel threads to secure the barrel in place. It also has ""recessed"" chambers - chamber mouths that are recessed to encompass the cartridge heads when loaded.

It does not have the original wood grip.

I inherited this from my father when he passed away in 2007 and have no additional knowledge about when or where he purchased it."

It is an early gun with the last patent date of July, 22 1913 & there is no chamber length stamping. 12 gauge, 2 ¾” chamber, Nickel Steel 30” full choke barrel & is numbers matching, the serial number found on both halves. This is a nice looking honest gun with no extra proofs & all stampings are clear, crisp & 100% legible. There is lots & lots of bluing remaining with no dings, dents, rust or pitting. The blue is mostly limited to the high spots, the bottom from carry & from the travel of the action. Minor handling marks & some freckles are found upon up-close inspection, very nice for a shotgun made before the Great Depression. The stocks are walnut with straight grain & a nice finish. There are no cracks or repairs just minor handling marks & the wood fits proud to the receiver. It has a corn cob pump handle, the butt stock is fluted with a pistol grip, the LOP is just under 14”. Mechanically sound with a smooth crisp action. The bore is bright & shiny, it functions correctly & safely, the take-down feature works properly, the arrows line up & is tight at the halves. 1928 Nickel Steel Winchester Model 12; 87 years old – ready to go needs nothing!"

I did some trading and got a gun with this barrel in it, I’m going to get rid of the barrel and slide.  Nothing wrong with it, I already have a 45 that I’m very satisfied with.  So I’d like to offer this for sale or trade, but mainly looking to trade. I’m in West Tulsa, but am willing to travel for the right deal.  

Barrel

Les Baer site has them brand new from the factory for $170.00 I’d like to trade this barrel for another caliber 9, .40, .357 sig.  IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE TRADE OPTION, I’m going to ask $150.00 for the barrel.  Barrel still has nice sharp rifling’s and has lots of life left in it. 

Slide

Next is the unmarked 45acp 5”slide, cut for target sights. The front sight is a fiber optic sight (missing fiber).  Rear sight is missing, but I have a set of Dawson Black Adjustable Rear Sights, I could throw in for the right deal too. Cash price on the slide, again to encourage a trade, is going to be $125.00."

I am looking for a Kahr T9 in Matte stainless steel with Hogue wood grips, preferably in its original box with all the manuals and magazines.
My father got his car broken into in 2013 and the thief took his T9.  He has been reminiscing since.  He is also getting old and when the time comes, I hopefully will inherit this gun back.
If you have a new or lightly used Kahr T9 (see my definition of lightly used, it has to fall in Grade A, B, C, or D)

Please email me and I will make you a favorable offer for your pistol.  Thanks for reading.
