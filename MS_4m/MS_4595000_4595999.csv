This model features the B barrel and has an early 1890s receiver. If you are knowledgeable of these types of firearms then you know the Hex models are desirable. I'm open to reasonable offers. The worst I can say is no thanks. In terms of a trade, I'm only interested in revolvers chambered in .357. I would prefer a snub nose up to a 3-inch barrel. The Mosin Nagant itself is in great condition. Smooth barrel with no rust or corrosion that I can see. The stock is also in great condition. The bolt does have a mismatched serial number, though this is not uncommon with these rifles. Overall, this is a very nice firearm. It'll also come with a green sling (which I was told was authentic), 2 boxes of ammo (1 of which is surplus), and a black carry bag. I hate to get rid of it but at this time I would rather have a .357 or the money to possibly invest in one. Pictures available upon request. If interested, shoot me an email.

Gun is in mint condition thru and thru without a scratch on it.  Comes with the original hard case, all original accessories and booklets, the 2 included 19 round factory mags, and one additional 20 round mecgar.  Also has factory night sights.  I will also toss in an unused Fobus OWB paddle holster.  The light attachment is NOT INCLUDED.  This is the thumb safety version, not the de-cocker version.  This gun is as clean and close to new as it gets.  I bought it early last year and it's been exclusively a night stand gun that has only made a couple of trips to the range.  I have had zero malfunctions in the few times this gun has been shot.  This is also by a long shot the softest recoiling 9mm I've ever shot.  Very low bore axis, excellent ergonomics, and the highest capacity available for a duty gun is what makes these highly sought after for IDPA, USPSA, and other shooting competitions.  Price listed is cash out the door.

I actually bought this gun last year with the intent on shooting it in shooting competitions, but I haven't done one since, and don't think I am going to have time in the near future either.  So I'd like to trade this for another carry gun.  Looking for a BNIB Gen 4 Glock 19 or 23, or a lightly used Glock 19 or 23 gen 4 plus cash.  Also open to commander or officer sized 1911s or a Springfield XD Mod 2.  Otherwise cash is king.  More pics available upon request."

The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.Specificationscaliber: 9mmcapacity: 6 + 1 ength: 6.26 inchesheight: 4.25 icheswidth: 1.07 incheslength between sights: 5.20 inchesbarrel length: 3.39 inchesunloaded weigh: 17.95 ouncesloaded weigh: 22.36 ouncestrigger pull: 5.5 lbs.trigger travel: 0.49 inchesrifling: right, hexagonalrifling twist: 9.84 inchesThe above price is a cash price discounted by 3%.

The 1887 was one of John Moses Browningâs signature developments. Folk often called it the Rosebox shotgun. Here is a well executed, very slick copy of the 1887 Winchester Lever Action 12 gauge. It retains the look and feel of the Old West Cowboy shotgun while constructed with modern high-tensile steel. Manufacturer is Zong Zhou Machine Works of the Peopleâs Republic of China. Importer and warrantor is Century Arms in the former Republic of Vermont. Type is falling breech, tube fed lever action shotgun. Construction is entirely steel metal, with dark stained hardwood buttstock and forend panels. Barrel is 20 inch plain bead sight with .722 cylinder bore muzzle. This is Not a back bored shotgun. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch shells only, and the barrel is clearly stamped, Lead Shot Only. Magazine Capacity is 4 + 1. Weight empty is 7 pounds 12 ounces, with center of gravity at the breech face. Ignition is hammer fired; trigger is a thin .150 smooth face, and the photo specimen pulled at 7 1/2 pounds with moderate felt creep. We estimate the cocking motion requires 20 pounds or so of pressure. This shotgun is not designed for operators with diminished hand strength. Safety system is lever safety, akin to Browningâs other designs. Hammer is low profile short serrated spur .365 width. Buttstock length of pull is 13 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1/2 inch black polymer buttplate. Stock drop is 2 1/2 inches at the comb and 3 inches at the butt, with a 3/4 inch right hand cant. It is otherwise southpaw friendly. Each PW87 comes in its factory box with protective foam, gun lock, advertising cards, and instruction manual that contains Century Armsâs One Year service warranty statement. Replacement pricing on an original Winchester will be in the 4 figure range. We're offering the 87W in the photos, however, or one of its identical matesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  eachÂ Â Â Â  for onlyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  $ 339.00.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Shipping:$20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.

I figured it may be easier to post a WTB so sellers already know my situation. I am fairly young but have a lot of range experience as well as training in hostile situations. I've owned a total of 11 guns since I began shooting 3 years ago. I am currently in the middle of a military move to Florida. The issue I've been having with buyers is I lost my Va drivers license about a week ago and do not have a CCL because I don't carry. Being the age and race that I am, and looking at how the police force operates, I prefer not to carry as it will likely complicate things. However I do have my military Id and a voters registration card for two forms of id. I am also ok with  a bill of sale being produced. Enough of the backround info. My budget is about 450 and I'm open to all pistol offers, just email me with some pictures and I will get back to you shortly

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no Gunsmithing. Easy to Conceal. Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. Personal Protection Made Easy. The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. Easy to Use and Maintain. The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no Gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger Systemâ¢ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package.

It is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and comes with a Picatinny rail system.

Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCMÂ®
Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.
As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.
Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFHâ¢ series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)
M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for todayâs infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.
T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for itsâ superior ballistics.
Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets itsâ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960âs was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

The 10x50 Rebel Binocular from Redfield has the build quality and optical performance to make this set of glasses a go-to optic for budget-conscious naturalists and hunters. This durable binocular has a nitrogen-filled, rubber-armored polycarbonate housing that provides weather-resistant performance while remaining lightweight and easy to handle. Rubber gripping ridges on the center focus wheel are deeply knurled and enable precise focusing in wet or cold conditionsâeven while wearing gloves. Further enhancing the user-friendly features of the Rebel binocular is a comfortable 16mm eye relief and twist-up eyecups that are especially accommodating for eyeglass wearers.

Aside from the construction and handling features that Redfield packs into their binoculars, the 10x50 Rebel boasts a fully multicoated optical path that has BaK-4 prism glass. The resulting images are transmitted with enhanced sharpness and contrast, allowing the viewer to appreciate a fine degree of detail and color saturation. Their 50mm objective lenses allow this 10x configuration to render luminous images even while viewing under heavy cloud cover or during twilight hours; an noteworthy 54Â° apparent viewing angle can make the observer feel transported into the field of view.

Redfield backs their entire lineup of sporting optics with a ""No Excuses"" Lifetime Warranty, which protects the optic against manufacturing and material defects for the life of their original owner. Consistently delivering quality, reliability and affordability is what Redfield strives to do best.
