Because it needs it.Dead Air Armament is new, and better!It was founded by Mike Pappas, and if that name rings a bell, it’s because Mike co-founded another silencer company back in 2008. Among others, Mike is also teamed up with silencer designer Todd Magee. Mike and Todd have set out to build the best suppressors on the market! There is no substitute for experience.It’s in the Design!Look at any Dead Air Armament product and you’ll see attention to detail and aesthetic choices driven solely by engineering performance. No gimmicks or short cuts – just pure performance. As Mike puts it: “I’m finally building the no compromise suppressors that I’ve always wanted to make. No corporate bottom lines. The only thing that matters to me is how it sounds; and the Sandman sounds awesome…”The Materials!There is no substitute for materials and no shortcuts with Dead Air. Every Sandman baffle is 100% Stellite. They cost three times more than stainless steel and they work better than Inconel under the hardest use and conditions. As for the tubes, Dead Air Armament could have used the material that most of their competitors use, but instead Dead Air Armament went with high-performance precipitation hardened stainless steel because lightweight strength does not come cheap. Only with the Sandman Ti, Dead Air Armament forgo’s the use of high-performance stainless steel and that’s because they use Grade #9 titanium. Why does Dead Air Armament do it? Because their precision rifle direct thread suppressor is designed for professional Law Enforcement applications. The old adage “close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades” could not be truer when a professional has to make an accurate shot in difficult conditions.It’s in the Manufacturing!Design and materials are part of the equation, but there is no substitute for thirty years of manufacturing excellence and that’s what BPI brings to the product. Every Dead Air suppressor is manufactured in Lawrenceville, Georgia by highly trained Americans intent on manufacturing the best suppressor on the market. Dead Air Armament standards are simple, “good isn’t good enough” and if a product comes off the line not up to par, then the can gets canned. It’s that simple.7.62 Sandman-LFor those demanding absolute performance in a suppressor the “L”, or long version, delivers. Made and constructed from the materials used in the “S” version, the “L” is only 8.9 inches in length, but offers a true sound reduction of 31dB firing standard 7.62 ammunition. In short, it is the best performing and quietest 7.62 suppressor on the market. Just like the “S”, the long version uses our industry best QD system for fool-proof quick one handed mounting. No seizing and minimal point of impact shirts with this design. The mount features Nitride finished 17-4 stainless steel construction for the ultimate in durability.  The Stellite baffles form a solid welded core with a detachable front cap featuring an integrated flash hider. The whole suppressor gets a Cerakote finish for ultimate corrosion protection as well. For a tactical bolt rifle or .308 AR there isn’t a better can in the Sandman-L class. SpecificationsLength8.9 inches Weight23.4 ounces Diameter1.5 inches Rating Up to .300 Win Mag FinishCerakote body, Nitrided Muzzle DeviceMSRP$1199.00"

Since the scope was mounted, it impacts the value.  The price I'm selling for is what the gunsmith recommended I set it for, which he said is a very fair price.  The scope is a Universal 4x32; the optics seem fine."

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.Caliber: .380 ACPCapacity: 6+1Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnectBarrel: 2.58"", Conventional Rifling, 1 - 16 right-hand twistLength O/A: 4.96""Height: 3.9""Slide Width: .75""Weight: Pistol 10.2 ounces (w/o magazine) Grips: Textured polymerSights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sightFinish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slideMagazine: 1 - 6 rd, Stainless"

Sound Suppression System. This suppressor features 300 Series Stainless Steel and Inconel 718 construction for increased strength, superior durability, and amazing weight savings. The proven performance of YHM’s Phantom Flash Hider eliminates 99% of muzzle flash while the Sound Technologies baffle design reduces muzzle noise by up to 39 dB. The fast attach design allows you to permanently install the Phantom Flash Hider and then install the Sound Suppressor without the use of tools when sound suppression is desired. Our Phantom Flash Hider system holds the sound suppressor firmly in place by hand tightening and allows the sound suppressor to be removed by hand when no longer needed. A gas seal keeps the threads clean so the suppressor will not bind, making removal a breeze. The Phantom Flash hider supports the sound suppressor in two places making misalignment nearly impossible, even if the sound suppressor is not fully tightened. This sound suppressor is designed so that it can be used with a Phantom 5.56mm flash hider on a 5.56mm rifle. This allows users to purchase one sound suppressor and use it on .30 Caliber and 5.56mm rifles. As a measure of safety the 5.56 sound suppressor will not fit onto a .30 Cal flash hider.WarrantyYHM offers a lifetime warranty and will repair or replace, free of charge, any sound suppressor manufactured by YHM. This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor and / or host firearm resulting in whole or in part from criminal or negligent use, improper or careless handling, modifications, defective, improper hand-loaded, or reloaded ammunition, or neglect. This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor or host firearm due to improper installation of the sound suppressor, or an improperly threaded barrel. The minimum barrel length for which the suppressor is warranted is 10.5 inches with the exception of a system chambered in .300 Black which is warranted to a minimum barrel length of 8 inches.

If you see this gun please contact the Laurinburg PD at REDACTED.

A word of warning: Theft of a firearm is a state felony in NC.  Also, theft of a firearm from an FFL is also a federal felony punishable by 10 years in federal prison (no parole in federal prison system), as is knowing possession of a stolen firearm.

The only flaw if you could call it that is the stock has been cut down about an inch as the original length of pull was way too long for my arms. Adding something like a Pachmayr recoil pad brings it back to original length, and believe me it needs it the plastic stock was painful. Works flawlessly with full power loads, fires 9 rounds in less than 6 seconds. Less than full power and it gets finicky depending brand of ammo.

Okay getting a lot of questions from tire kickers on why it's so cheap and if it is busted,etc. No it is not busted or broken. I'm just trying to clear out my closet and nobody was biting at 300 so I lowered the price as gun is only worth what someone is willing to pay. I must assume there is not too much interest for lightly used 30 year old shotguns that work. I was trying to sell it quick and whole instead of parting out on gunbroker, I don't like parting out working guns but if doesn't sell well look on gunbroker soon if you need a part. the crossbolt safety fits the spas and sas and is a direct drop in."

Featuring an innovative “support sandwich” – a layer of memory foam encased by durable nylon -- the NRA Crossfire Holsters are the first synthetic holsters that will mold to your firearm like leather. They're capable of “re-setting” their molds to different guns if given sufficient time. This pancake-style design fits naturally and comfortable on your waist – plus, it’s engineered to prevent collapse, making re-holstering a cinch. The Rocket features a special elastic Speed-Retainer that secures your handgun more snugly than a leather thumb breaks, yet provides a quick, quiet and easy draw"

The Safariland Model 6378 Holster is a concealment version of the Automatic Locking System (ALS®) series holsters. Once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" into place, providing an extra measure of security from standard open top holsters. A simple straight up draw is possible once the ALS® is de-activated by the thumb while obtaining a shooting grip. IDPA approved. The Model 6378 holster features an all-new injection molded paddle design that is highly concealable and rides close to body with a slightly forward weapon cant. It also comes standard with the 567BL belt loop, fitting 1.5"" to 1.75"" belt widths. Additionally, it features suede lining to help protect the gun's sights and finish, and its SafariLaminate™ structure with wraparound design provides the strongest design combination available.

straight from the pages of history comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exact specifications of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction rifle comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge. Used by offcers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the “United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1”, its official military designation.

This rifle is in excellent condition for its age and was manufactured in 1948. It came from the estate of a WWII LT where it looks like it spent most of its time safe and dry at the estate. I’ve fired the rifle only a handful of times at the range and it’s everything a Pre-64 M70 should be, reliable and accurate. The scope is a Leupold Vari-X II 2x7 and the glass is crystal clear, I have the original scope box and foam insert, but the bottom half of the box was missing when purchased. The scope is mounted with vintage Leupold Detacho-mount rings and hardware (original box, papers, and additional shims/screws included) which were on the rifle when I acquired it. I also have the original peep sight that would have been on the rifle from the factory. The rifle comes with a vintage leather and brass sling which is still supple and strong. This is an excellent complete package for someone who wants the entire vintage setup.
