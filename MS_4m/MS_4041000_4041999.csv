Please Read

Who Am I:
My names Chris. I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many others including AR-15's and other weapons aswell, I do other guns as well. I am legally allowed to possess a Handgun, I can show you my CCP and Mil ID so you know I'm not a felon. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price, you can pay over $100 for a polish job at gunshops! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks and many others, just shoot me a message with what gun you have.
 -------------------------------------------------
Why Polish Internals?:
Polishing is like waxing a floor. Less friction equals smoother surface, which in our case equals a physically smoother operating gun and a smoother feel to the user. Glocks come stock with a 5lb trigger pull which in reality is closer to 6lb, sometimes slightly more, due to all the friction from factory coated parts. Polishing will bring it to where it should be with stock parts which is roughly 4.5lbs-5lbs, thus making the trigger pull feel lighter then your used to. I also offer two parts to further reduce trigger pull and enhance smoothness, that when coupled with the polish job will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make the trigger pull break like glass every time....Pull the trigger on one of my glocks before you commit and see for yourself!
 -------------------------------------------------
What I offer:
I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun(bore at your request), polish all friction prone internals, oil and reassemble. Can also polish Barrel Feed Ramp at your request with no additional Fee.
Price $25

I will Remove the Factory 5lb Connector and replace it with a POLISHED 3.5lb connector. This reduces the trigger pull to roughly 3lbs-3.5lbs.
Price $15

I will Remove the Factory 5lb Trigger Spring and Replace it with a 6lb Trigger Spring. Why heavier here? The Trigger Spring actually assists the Trigger in Pull/Reset, a Heavier one will make for a Smoother pull and Smoother Reset.
Price $5

I will refinish your scratched/worn barrel by slightly sanding, degreasing and applying an even coat of Black DuraCoat DuraBake which is a heat treated form of Duracoat making it hard as nails once its heated.
 $15
 -------------------------------------------------
Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.

 Feel free to contact me to setup a time, thanks.

  My Cub Cadet is in all around great shape, I'm the original owner and now it's just time to go, as I really don't need the Thrower anymore and I had a lot of great years with it. I've had it serviced every year since I purchased it in 2008 and it's always been stored in my Shed or Garage while not in use. This year/season I did not bring my cub cadet in for servicing as I got myself a brand New ATV with a winch and plow setup as I have a very long and somewhat curvy driveway and I'm not getting any younger and in the past two years I've had a lot of medical issues regarding my back and syadic nerve and Lumber region on my spine/back. I have a few hernated discs and couple compressed discs and pinched nerves and etc. I've had multiple surgery's and so on but really I still have multiple problems with my back, and it's another reason why It's time for me to somewhat relax while dealing with all the snow. I have the Cub Cadet Owner Manual to go with the all power/electric start Thrower and I might be able to dig up all the receipts from me having my blower serviced yearly except for last season. I have personally not even tried to start my blower this season because I suspect it needs a new Spark plug and  it's Carb needs to be Cleaned out. Also every time I've used my cub cadet I've used the electric start, instead of the pull start and that's also partly why I'm almost sure a new plug and a quick carb cleaning and she's almost as good as New. Since my blower is in all around great shape and is just about ready for snow conditions, I was looking for a value of around 500$ give or take more or less, for my Nice Cub cadet blower and the original owner manual and if I can dig all the receipts from it being serviced over the years. I'm a valid Mass LTC holder and Life time NRA member and would gladly take a look at trade offers listed below instead of cash in my hand, but would prefer to sell. Also I'm willing to haul my blower to you for a little bit extra on my part or you can contact for pickup. Thanks guys and Girls and for Any Interest or ?s or Concerns Please feel free to Email. Sincerely, Jake"

What I have for sale is a Franchi SPAS-12 Shotgun
AI Stamped (at front of feed ramp on bottom of receiver) - 1982 Date of Manufacture
Semi-Auto AND Pump Action (I hope I don't NEED to say that)
Great Condition - Minimal finish wear on pump action under hand guard, minor blemishes
Stored in safe with dehumidifier 
Original hook
Original configuration safety (if you think the newer cross bolt safety is 100%, please do your research, no SPAS-12 safety should be trusted. Only use the auto-safety lever adjacent to the trigger guard.. oh and common sense)
Full 8+1 internal magazine (Pre Ban)
Comes with new O-Rings 
Shoots and functions flawlessly on pump and semi auto modes 
         (you should know better than to expect 100% reliability if you plan to run the cheapest cheap cheap ass ammo you can find at Walmart, these guns are large, heavy, clunky and though I can say it will eat it, I don't want a buyer saying it stove pipes every round while i try to fire it straight out from my body with one hand like the Terminator while I shoot $20/100 Winchester shells that I found in the bed of my buddy's pickup)

Has new ""Old Style"" SPAS-12 Project polyurethane recoil buffer (see orange in pic below)
Old recoil buffer removed and receiver inspected, no cracks were observed. *Read Below*
         **Buyer beware, I know I said you should do your own research, but I must stress the importance of replacing an old, deteriorating recoil buffer. When the original buffer gets old (they all are...they stopped importing these in '94 remember) they crumble and disintegrate leaving the rear of the receiver vulnerable to abuse from the action striking the rear of the receiver. Prolonged abuse can lead to a cracked receiver. IF you can find a receiver they are extremely costly, that is IF you can find one in the first place. Do your research before buying these firearms and be sure that the seller has inspected and replaced the recoil buffer as needed, do not just assume. Most new buffers are bright colors to make it more visible for inspection without disassembling the firearm.** 

More specific pictures available upon request for *interested* buyers.

Cash face to face or a USPS Money Order accepted. Willing to meet in the central lower Michigan area. Willing to ship insured via FEDEX at buyer's expense to FFL that can receive shipments from individuals (*PLEASE CHECK*) Actual shipping charges will apply. 

OBO - Prefer a cash sale. Willing to consider cash,trade, and trade+cash offers if kept reasonable and respectful. Does not necessarily have to be a firearm for trade as long as value favors me. Any questions, feel free to ask.

The barrel channel keeps wood away from the barrel, making the rifle entirely free floating. This rifle does what it’s intended to do very well, and for the price it's is an absolute steal.

Magazine disconnect is currently removed but can be reinstalled in under 1 minute.  Factory guide rod and indicator included, along with an spare extractor, new from Ruger.

Includes 4 magazines, 3 15 round magazines with custom fitted, rubberized grip extensions, and 1 9 round magazine.

My reason for posting this for trade, is that I really don't care for polymer firearms.  I bought this off a friend back in 2012 as a favor to help him out with money for car repairs.  This pistol functions so well it's boring. 

I'm not really interested in cash sale but rock bottom cash price would be $425.  Close to $100 in upgrade parts, and another $80 in magazines.

I have a good amount of 40 S&W ammo, fmj as well as hp, that can be added to the package or sold on the side, I'll have to do an inventory check.

The only thing I would automatically decline, is anything from Taurus, however, pre-Taurus Rossi revolvers with hammer mounted firing pins are welcome."
