http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=502592166

Now I know that taxes and shipping cost money, but if you want to pay what a BNIB Beretta costs, why not buy it from a dealer, with a receipt and factory warranty and such? (not to mention without ANY wear and tear AT ALL, which is the DIFFERENCE between BNIB and USED, a difference which most SANE prices should reflect.)

They got BNIB ones starting for less then $500 over there.

http://www.gunbroker.com/Semi-Auto-Pistols/BI.aspx?Keywords=Beretta+92fs&BuyNowOnly=1&Condition=1&Sort=4&Tab=2

$500 bucks and taxes, shipping, etc- you get a gun which you are the original owner of with a guarantee and a receipt, or, you can pay about the same price for a USED gun which the seller CLAIMS has only had ""just a few rounds down the pipe I promise"" and with no guarantee whatsoever.

Your choice lol.

Come down on those premiums for your USED, (likely) non-warrantied anymore guns guys.

Seriously. What makes -any- USED handgun, with possibly no remaining factory warranty coverage and with no guarantee on the sale whatsoever, worth a BNIB one from a dealer?"

Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable"

Took it on a road trip and it died on the way back. The transmission is fine but the motor made a loud sound driving and will not start. The engine cranks so it's not seized and the motor might be salvageable. It's a 5.4L Triton with an Automatic transmission with the tow package, I don't really want to mess with it and put more money into it so my bad luck is your gain. I would like to just sell it or trade it to someone who knows how to fix it. It has some rust under the driver side door but other than that the body has no rust. The interior is tan with leader seats and has a working factory 6 CD changer. The truck is also a crew cab and everything works except the back door locks sometimes.

For a background, these rifles were made with forged receivers and are regarded to be tougher receivers than modern Springfield Inc. M1A's but had soft bolts which caused issues later down the line. This one has had the bolt swapped and now it is a fantastic rifle and a great shooter. Comes with one 10 round magazine.

all numbers are matching down to the retention screws.
This is not a wartime reconditioned gun. It retains its original barrel and hardwood stock along with its early flat buttplate.

I replaced the firing pin spring with a spring from Wolff, but I kept the old spring in case you want to keep it with the rifle. I think it was a 15$ ""upgrade""

The rifle also comes with a period correct wood handled bayonet made in 1937, as well as a very nice leather sling made by ""At the front"" These 2 items alone cost nearly 150 dollars.

This rifle has many upgrades and is a fine piece of equipment, rifle started as an older 700P with a glass and aluminum bedded HS Precision stock. I upgraded to the KRG chassis to give it a little more weight and adjustability. Rifle shoots 1 MOA all day long. Bore is clean and has plenty of life, do not know the shot count but .308 barrels are generally good for around 3,500-5,000 rounds. I doubt it even close to that based on the tight groups achieved with the rifle. The action itself shows (little) pitting from the previous owners neglect but it's really not noticeable. The shot cycle is VERY manageable nothing comparable to a .308 deer rifle. The muzzlebrake makes this a sweet shooter.
      I have shot multiple loads through this gun and all perform very well. Inc. hornaday whitetail classic, fusion, S&B, Remington, and hand loads. I did notice some pressure issues when shooting 200grn projectiles. Bolt got a little sticky on cycling but everything under 175gr runs flawlessly. Trigger is stock never changed it because I never thought it needed a new one. Once again this is a serious built precision rifle and anyone who wishes to own it will have no doubts. Message me for any pics or questions.

429,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4634429,For Sale:  This is XD-S pistol slimmer single stack,"Oklahoma, Oklahoma, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 25, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The XD-S® model features a slimmer, single stack
frame though it still has the firepower of a .45
caliber. This slim design makes it perfect for
those looking for a concealed carry pistol. Like
the whole XD® line of pistols, the XD-S® offers
an ergonomic design that makes it easier to point
and shoot. The design offers a single-position
Picatinny rail, making this one of the only pistols
of its size that can be accessorized with lights
and lasers. The low profile sight also makes this
firearm more holster-friendly.
In addition to the slim contour frame, the XD-S®
pistol has many features that make it more
comfortable and easy to shoot. Two
interchangeable backstraps allow you to
customize your grip. The modified contour of the
grip also makes it possible for nearly any size
hand to release the magazine without twisting or
moving from your firing grasp.
The XD-S® has many of the safety features found
in other XD® models, such as Ultra Safety
Assurance (USA) Trigger System™, loaded
chamber indicator, and grip safety. The XD-S®
also has an enhanced secure grip texture.
Combined, all of these features come together to
create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find
slim designs in other guns, the XD-S® provides
the power of a .45 in a comparatively small
package. The comfortable and ergonomic point
and shoot design also allows you to shoot
naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist
to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was
designed to be an extension of your body, which
naturally helps you shoot your best."

Pistol is an awesome shooter. Single action, single stack magazine. Very thin, easy to conceal. To me, it feels a lot like a 1911. From ""THE TRUTH ABOUT GUNS"": The Russian Tokarev was a military service pistol produced in Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, North Korea, Egypt and China. The Tokarev typically chambers the powerful 7.62x25mm bottleneck cartridge. The Chinese made a unique variant chambered in 9mm—the Norinco 213— for the civilian market. The State Factory 66-manufactured all-steel 213 is nearly identical to the Russian TT-33 Tokarev with one key difference: an additional frame mounted safety. (Given the similarities. some gun guys speculate that the Hungarian Tokagypt 9mm pistol inspired the 213.) The 213 is pleasant to shoot, remarkably accurate and reliable. They are no longer imported into the U.S. These Norincos are getting harder and harder to find. Thanks for looking. The price is $325.00 cash. Serious inquiries only. Please don't waste my time or yours."

That means I'm putting up my F T/R.  I bought the gun new in April of 2014 and I have 897 documented rounds through it. Shooting Berger 185 Match VLDs with Varget gave me groups in the high .2s.

I'm currently shooting the 155 TMK over IMR 4166 at about .5""

It has the factory, 30 inch barrel.  Rifle has the Anschutz rail on the front of the stock.

I was having issues with primary extraction, and I have installed the two set screws in the rear baffle.  This has fixed that problem. 

Below is what I want to sell with the rifle.  Dies and Bullets will go to buyer first.  If buyer doesn't want them, I will sell only after the rifle sells.  This is the only picture available to me now.  I can send more pictures when I get home tonight.  I will post them tomorrow.

All my load data will be included with the rifle.

I currently have about 75 rounds of loaded 155 TMKs that I will pull apart and ship if the buyer wants the components. 

I may be forgetting some things.  I have over $2200 in everything and I am asking $1800 for everything shipped to your door.  I will accept a USPS money order.  PayPal will require a 3% charge and buyer will be responsible for it.  Or cash face to face.  Rifle is cross posted."

12 Gauge, Remington Buckhammer Slug, 2 3/4"", 1 1/4 Ounce Lead Slug, 5 Round Box.

When it comes to delivering devastating knockdown power and superior accuracy, no other lead slug offers a more lethal combination than the Remington BuckHammer. Specifically designed for rifled barrels and rifled choke tubes, these high performance slugs are capable of producing 3 inch or better groups at 100 yards with nearly 100% weight retention and controlled expansion to nearly one inch in diameter.

Unlike traditional sabot slugs, the BuckHammer’s unique attached stabilizer allows for a full bore diameter lead slug that delivers devastating terminal performance with unsurpassed accuracy. Now available in 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch magnum loads in both 12 and 20 gauge the awe inspiring BuckHammer is the hardest hitting, most accurate, highest energy family of lead slugs available.

Manufacturer is Chiappa Firearms Ltd. / Kimar Plant in Brescia, Italy. Importer and Warrantor is Chiappa Firearms of Dayton, OH. Service address 6785 West Third Street, Zip 45417, and that address is on the back of the instruction manual. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic rifle. Construction is a two piece sleeved steel 18 inch 1:16 rifling barrel; steel bolt and hammer and springs; polymer receiver; polymer operating handle and trigger group; polymer rear aperture sight with steel screws for windage and elevation adjustmet; polymer collar type post front sight; polymer magazines; polymer barrel band and bayonet lug; zinc alloy trigger; and dark stained Italian hardwood stock that holds a steel butt plate. This rifle is cosmetically faithful to the U.S. Carbine. Its only departure that is readily conspicuous is the grooved receiver that is capable of holding 3/8 base scope mounts, and that is an advantage. Overall length is 35 inches, with a 13 1/8 length of pull on the Buttstock. Weight empty is 4 pounds 8 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine. Magazines hold 10 rounds of .22 Long Rifle caliber ammunition, and each M1-22 comes with a total of two magazines. This little rifle exceeds its Erma ancestors for looks and balance, and it matches them on performance. We test fired the photo specimen, and got up to 3 consecutive shots on Remington Golden Bullet High Velocity ammunition, and up to 7 consecutive shots on Winchester Super X Copper Coated. That is on a par with the Ermas, from our poor memory. If a person wants better feeding than that, the best thing for a new owner to do, is to get a return authorization and send it to Dayton, perhaps a time or two. This is a looker, after all. If a person wants a shooter, best to stick with the most prolific product from a different factory on Sunapee Street in Newport, New Hampshire. Each Chiappa comes in its factory box with protective padding, instruction manual that includes warranty statement, and total of two magazines.

These are 1 oz, .999 Pure Copper, Bright and Shiny.  They will remain bright/shiny if kept in their protective sleeves (included).  I carry mine so they have a great looking patina to them.  Great conversation starters as well.

Step 1.
Take a look at our product line of the finest, fastest and easiest weapons cleaning products available today.

Step 2.
Decide which of our product(s) would best benefit you or which you would get the greatest use from.

Step 3.  
Submit an order for any three (3) 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' and 1 (one) 'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner', make your selection of which 'Challenge Coin' you would like.

Your ""Challenge Coin"" will accompany your order.  As simple as can be.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' utilize 2015 technologies and materials.  All are  AMERICAN MADE, from raw material to the finished product and developed and produced right here in the USA. 
(As a Disabled Veteran, I am glad to see a company that is American Owned, Veteran Owned/Veteran Run.)

Our product line was designed to be vastly improved (2015 technology vs. 1995 technology) over our competitors products or anything previously available.

Our primary product is a hand sewn, Kevlar 'sleeve'. This sleeve encases a sturdy, non-absorbent and nonporous foam element. The foam inner element of our product is slightly over sized thereby allowing it to exert uniform, 360 degree, pressure within the barrel of the weapon.

In a rifled barrel the foam inner element acts to push the Kevlar and cleaner solution into the rifling. Pressing the Kevlar into the rifling, allows it to 'cut into' and remove burnt powder, spent nitrates and the fouling associated with our sport.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' contains NO METAL BRUSHES, BRISTLES OR EXPOSED METAL.  Because our 'Bore Scrubbers' were designed to be ‘reversed’, while still inside the barrel, the cleaning motion effectively ""scrubs"" the barrel bore.

This simple action greatly aids, and speeds, the cleaning process, without damaging the weapon or the product itself. We do not recommend you try this with any competitor product, you may damage the weapon, you WILL destroy their product.

In smooth bore (shotgun) barrels the 'carrier' liquid also acts upon the tiny bits and pieces of melted plastic, softening the remnants of the wadding and plastic shell cases associated with shotgun shooting. At the same time, the Kevlar and cleaner solution work in unison to remove carbon, burnt nitrates and powder residues.

Users are able to very quickly clean, and protect, valuable firearms from corrosion, rust and internal damage by utilizing our 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' and combining our proprietary blend of cleaner, lubricant and protectant, the ‘Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner’.

Metal parts, brushes and bristles of our competitors, or the pieces of a traditional cleaning rod, are very prone to damaging the internals of a barrel by adding needless scratches and ‘micro-abrasions’. These damaging ‘micro-abrasions’ may greatly effect accuracy and consistency during shooting. Also, accidentally dragging or dropping our competitor or a traditional rod onto a weapon may result in damage to the finish or bluing. That scenario is completely impossible with our product.

As well as the foam core, the Kevlar is also nonabsorbent and serves to 'wick' the cleaning solution along the working length of the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubber'. In doing so it greatly reduces the amount of cleaning product needed and helps prevent waste. This allows our product to be more cost effective for users.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' is our proprietary cleaner using a liquid base serving as the 'carrier' for the actual cleaning product (detergents) and lubricant/protectant. The 'carrier' evaporates very quickly and leaves behind a protective, moisture repellant allowing for long term storage without the need for additional oil patches in the barrel or a second protective product to be applied.

Because 'Dragon Tail' products utilize 2015 Technologies taken from the Aerospace, Aircraft, Automotive Engineering as well as Weapons/Arms/Armor industries, when used properly, a weapon cleaned with 'Dragon Tail' products may be immediately stored for several years, then reloaded and fired, without fear of damage.

By using modern technology we absolutely destroy the 'generations old' methods of our competitors’ products.  Additionally, our products do not have a 'build up' (either sticky or gooey, or hardened and flakey) that may be observed after use of our competitors products.  Remember, our products utilize modern, scientific, Aerospace and Weapons Manufacturing industry materials, elements and technologies.  An added accidental bonus comes in the form of the anti-fingerprint property of our protective finish.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' may be used over the entire weapon. It will not harm the finish, stocks, grips or synthetics of modern firearms. The same long lasting, moisture repelling properties are then transferred to the exterior of a weapon and allow a single product to thoroughly clean and protect virtually all or your firearm collection possessions.

* Care should be exercised in the cleaning of wooden, varnished portions of “high value” weapons (for instance a $35,000 Merkel Shotgun) as the varnished finish may be susceptible to damage without proper care. The metal interior and exterior surfaces, however, will only benefit from maintenance and cleaning using our products.

Our Bore Scrubbers, unlike our competitors, may often be used for many, many different calibers or weapons rather than just a single caliber.

For example, I have cleaned my .45 ACP pistol then used the same Bore Scrubber to clean my 9mm without damage to the weapon or the Bore Scrubber...  I then decided to demonstrate to a client that I was able to do the same thing with my 12 Ga Bore Scrubber and used it to clean a 16 Ga shotgun.  Although this is NOT recommended and did take a bit of pulling to clear the 9mm and 16 Ga barrels both the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' performed flawlessly, without damage to themselves or the weapons in question.
(Don't try that with our competitors products... metal bristled Bore Snakes, Hoppes Brushes, or Otis cleaners.  You will destroy their product, and very possibly, damage your weapon.)
