This gun has a rough finish but is rock solid 110% reliable and accurate just like a brand new Sig. I have replaced all the springs etc as needed over the time I have owned it! Sig fans/owners know how awesome the 228's are. Throw some Cerakote or send it to Sig Sauer for 100$ and have them Re finish it if you want it to look brand new.

4 mags, (3 are basically brand new)(over 100$ in mags alone)
Milt Sparks Versa Max leather IWB holster (150$ holster)
50 jhps, 200 rounds of FMJ (250 rounds of 9mm total) (80$)

This reproduction is true to the original measurements, with a 42"" barrel and a total length of 58 inches. The Model 1847 was notable in several respects, chiefly that is was the last .69 caliber musket. Additionally, it was the first weapon made at both the Harpers Ferry and Springfield Armory with completely interchangeable parts. Harpers Ferry produced 103,000 while Springfield produced 172,000 for a total production surpassing a quarter of a million arms. Many of these arms had been delivered to militias in the late 1850s and saw service in the early years of the Great Conflict. This reproduction is nicely marked. The lockplate is stamped with Federal eagle in front of the hammer and vertically marked ""Spring-field"" in two lines behind the hammer. The lock and tang are dated 1847. The barrel is stamped with the correct style V.P. and eagle head proof marks are on the breech. The buttplate is marked U.S. The sling swivels are riveted as per the original. One piece American walnut oil finished stock. Weight 9.75 Lbs .Barrel length 42"", 57 3/4"" overall.

It was made by Marlin during the 50s and it has the microgroove rifling.  It's a great shooter.  I was going to do some work to it (drill and tap it for a red dot), but I decided that I would pass it on to a new owner that appreciates a high quality survival rifle.  As for the action, I think that it is very smooth.  The stock is in great shape and there isn't any rust or any issues with bluing.  It's a nice gun and it would be a nice addition to anyone's survival setup.

Also selling it with a break open 12 gauge made by Stoeger."

	Hey All, 
	I have another really great entry level AR for sale/trade. This is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S AR15 chambered in 5.56/223 REM. This will come with the gun, Ambi single point sling adapter, 4 Used Metal Surplus Mags, Quick Release NC Star Holographic multi reticle sight with blue illumination, forward assist, and dust cover.. This is a 6 inch barrel with 1:9 twist and a standard Bird Cage flash hider installed. This is a awesome little starter gun that I would keep, but i don’t need another AR at the moment. This is in used shape and shows some signs of use, but still feels fine and tight. 
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357 etc., PLR-16, CMR30, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, Black Powder Revolvers, Redhawks, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

The high performance Nikon Monarch 4-16x42 rifle scope is perfect for all round hunting. You get clear and sharp picture with the Ultra ClearCoat optical system in this Nikon rifle scope that allows maximum light transmission. The magnification of 4x-16x in this Nikon pistol scope provides you with focused and detailed image. The Nikon Monarch 4-16x42 scope has a tube diameter of 1-inch that gives you bright images, as it allows excess light to pass through it. The Monarch Eye Box technology of this Nikon rifle scope delivers high-resolution picture. The eye relief of 3.7-4-inch in this Nikon pistol scope lets you conveniently and safely aim your target.

This scope is about a year old and was only used a handful of times. It's an excellent optic for short, medium, and extended range situations. I've shot it right beside my Nightforce $1,500 dollar scope and it holds sub MOA groups at range. It has a small ding on the front of the black metal which does not effect performance whatsoever and it's barley noticeable. I am discounting it for the blemish $100 versus comparable used scopes with the same model etc. A little black touch up paint and you saved yourself a Benjamin. (Free Shipping)!
