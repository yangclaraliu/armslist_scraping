Purchased new in the early 80's and never fired until 2 years ago. Approximately 50 rounds through it (most on a range experimenting with optics). Japan made (which many consider to be the best Mark V's ever made). Recently upgraded with a 2014 Accubrake Muzzle Brake at the Weatherby Custom Shop in Paso Robles. Shot sub MOA on their factory range. The Accubrake system took off 45% in felt recoil. Brake is removable and includes thread protector. After installation, it feels like a .308. 3.5 LB trigger pull. Shoots as flat as a frozen lake. 

Rifle is very clean with black furniture. Used on 2 hunts. One plains game hunt in South Africa. One pig hunt here in Southern California. Includes scope rings. Can include an older Leupold 3x9 for an additional $200

The reason for selling is that I'm left handed and just got a custom shop left handed version of the same gun, but with oil finished walnut.

* The ""C-Lect-Choke"" allows one to select ""Full"" or ""Modified"" or ""Improved Cylinder"" by merely rotating the Choke Sleeve on the outside of the end of the barrel.

* The magazine is released from the bottom of the shotgun (for safe unloading of live rounds).  

* Comes with a rubber stock bottom /butt and installed metal sling hardware in both the front and back of the stock.

* The front sight bead was painted orange but most of the orange paint has rubbed off.

* This 12 Gauge shotgun has some rust on it.  The stock has some scrathes on it and a bit of a small chip in the wood at the top of the stock where it slopes up.

* Unfortunately somebody wanted their shotgun to look more ""streamlined"" so they sawed off the integral (cast) rear sight thus disrupting the line of sight for proper aiming.  To ""repair"" this hasty mistake they just used electrical tape to secure some bent sheet metal with a notch filed into it.   This restores the proper ""line of sight"" for aiming but just does not look that great.  A more professional repair could be easily done by a gunsmith or hobbyist.  This fix works well and has held up well.

* Great gun for protection in places where it may have a higher risk of getting stolen or for teaching a beginner / youngster about shotgun use.  Should it get stolen, since it did not cost all that much, it should not be as big of a deal losing it.   A youngster roughing it up in the field while hunting with an adult should also not be such a big concern given the ""low purchase price"".

** SALE TERMS: Would require a Face-to-Face (FTF) meeting for a cash sale.  I would need to see a VA Driver's license and a utility bill with a matching name and address on it.  also a Bill of Sale would need to be signed with a legible signature and a statement which states that you are legally allowed to own and possess a firearm (as a minimum).   (No plans on shipping it at this time).

With that in mind, I am making available EVERYTHING you need to get into black powder cartridge rifle (BPCR) shooting. The rifle is a Browning BPCR 1885 Highwall in 45-70 caliber. I was told by the original owner he had the trigger worked by Lee Shaver. It is smooth with a pleasant pull and breaks cleanly. Included is a Vernier rear sight and globe front sight with level. I am not sure of the round count by the original owner, but I doubt it was many as he bought it for his son who never got into the BPCR game. I have owned the rifle for three years and have fired 12 rounds. There are a few tiny marks on the cheek-piece and one near the butt plat at the top of the comb. There is one tiny blemish on the barrel. I tried to capture these flaws in photos. They are essentially unnoticeable unless you are looking closely for them. I have the original rifle box.

I purchased two of these units after buying standard and ported models of the new S&W M&P C.O.R.E. semi-autos in January (only just weeks ago). Only four MRDS units are compatible without modification, and tis one allows you to co-witness with your iron sights. The II Plus is also compatible with the FNX-45 and almost any handgun that accepts this type of sight. I sold one of the M&Ps before I found time to mount the sight. That's why it's for sale (most buyers want to know). 
The II-Plus Model is preferred by most American Shooters for it's durability and glass (or image). I purchased both from an acquaintance who owns DOCTER USA. He strongly recommended the II Plus model, and in fact it's the only one he'll sell. I opted to add a specialized feature called ""Bullet-Proofing"" or ""Waterproof and Ruggedization"" on both units (BF). See more below:

The Docter SightII-Plus | Welcome to the original
Whether in the classical sense or during sport hunting according to points — with a DOCTER®sight, success is virtually certain. DOCTER®sights embody the features ""small, light, precise and fast"". Mounted a thousand fold, they have guaranteed their users a taste of success in hunting and sports during the last 10 years. This success story will continue to be written with the next generation of the DOCTER®sight.

Automatic Brightness Adjustment
An integrated brightness sensor automatically adjusts the illumination of the aiming Dot to the environment. The sensor automatically adjusts the intensity of the sight's Dot so that the Dot does not flare in the darkness and, is at the perfect illumination level in darkness, in low light, in daylight and in bright sunshine.

Separate Windage and Elevation Sight Adjustments
Windage and elevation adjustments are made through the use of two unobtrusive screws located on the frame of the sight. The settings then are locked solidly in place with two set screws, assuring that they do not ""shoot loose"" during recoil of even the largest handgun calibers. This is further reinforced by the BF option included with this sight.

Designed for Law Enforcement and Military applications as a primary CQB sight, and an excellent performer in competion shooting.

I could primarily use the money, but trades will be considered. Bought this brand new about 3 or 4 years ago, and only put 25 rounds of .357 through it. It had been my first time shooting this caliber and I must say, it packed more of a punch than I was expecting haha. I had plans to bring it back and put more down, I just never got around to it. Since then I got the Hogue grip to help ease the felt recoil, but never got to test it out. Long story short, it's in excellent condition with barely, if any at all, powder residue on the cylinder. I made sure I cleaned it as soon as I got back from the range because I know it can stain quite easily. I have 2 holsters for it, but never carried it. The speed loader is not mine, just borrowed for the picture. I also have 25 rounds of Hornady 125gr FTX JHP. So in short, it basically turned into a bedside gun. Comes with everything from factory including the case. Now brass tax, this pistol retailes for about $650 on any given day, and I listed the MSRP below for reference, I UNDERSTAND I WILL NOT GET THAT KIND OF OFFER, that simply means don't expect me to jump on an offer that is $300 or equivalent in a trade. Simply won't happen. Thanks for looking at take care.

 these large store chains have hundreds of thousands

a sales rep who does inventory for the big five and they
 have so much in stock they barely order any. what kind of store holds ammo instead of selling it for profit. the answer one running the msrp up to double their profit. call the 800 numbers to the ammo companies they will tell you there is pallets in storage and plenty of it. so stop buying anything from these big chains until they come to their senses. the government has nothing to do with it so stop placing blame on them and take a stand against the true culprits, brokers have a large amount of control over who gets ammo as well because mom and pop outfits can't buy direct. and check your sales on line they are brokers that should be distributing to stores but chose to sell for more on line."

P.S. That asshole that wants to buy one and claims they sell for 399$ is just a bitter person. This is a factory package from Century Arms; the only item missing is the cleaning kit. It is still to this moment 599.99$, from the FACTORY. The Solid buttstock was an additional 75$ from the factory. You can debate this until your blue in the face, its not going to change anything. I really wish people would do thier homework instead of looking like a fool. Ive got the factory packaging from VT, not an online store! Thanks. I will not sell you my brand new rifle for 200$ less because you suck at life. I will post your name and email on Armslist if you harass me again. This guy already tried to scam me, under multiple emails too.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced.

It has some holster wear because it is originally an old Spanish (I think) Police Carry.

I have 2 magazines for it as well.

When I got it the hammer had been ground on. It now has a new hammer and spring. It fires perfect everytime. I just don't shoot it much and I don't enjoy carrying t like I do some of my other pistols. It is a great learning/teaching handgun (decently accurate, light recoil due to being 9mm and being a heavy gun).

Mil-Spec Plus : Our industry-leading quality assurance standards and materials go above and beyond the militarys essential technical requirements, ensuring our customers get rifles that will faithfully serve them for years to come.CHF: Cold Hammer Forging is a barrel making process that produces the strongest, longest lasting, and most accurate barrels. Daniel Defense takes this process one step further by simultaneously forging the chamber and bore, resulting in perfect alignment and barrels that are smoother and free of defects.Flash Suppressor: Our Flash Suppressor is designed to virtually eliminate muzzle flash, featuring compact size and lifetime durability. Manufactured from aerospace 17-4 stainless steel and salt bath nitride finished. Available in standard or extended length and "" x 28 TPI or 5/8"" x 24 TPI.Freefloat Rail: A freefloat rail mounts to the rifle via the barrel nut, eliminating any contact with the barrel. This ensures the harmonics of the barrel are not influenced by the weight of mounted accessories or the pressure from slings or shooting positions. This provides the M4/AR15 platform huge improvements in terms of repeatable accuracy and reduction in ""wandering"" point of impact.Flared Magwell: Our widened and beveled magwell funnels magazines into place for the fastest, most secure reloads possible.Buttstock: DD's custom designed buttstock is precision-molded from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. It features soft-touch rubber overmolding for comfort, and ambidextrous limited-rotation QD attachment points. It comes complete with two buttpads to customize fit any shooter.QD Points: Integrated Quick Disconnect Points for the attachment of slings.BCG: We build our Bolt Carrier Groups with the attention to detail that sets our rifles apart. Carrier: M16 profile, full auto capable, chrome-lined gas key bolted on with properly-staked Grade 8 fasteners. Bolt: Carpenter 158 steel, Shot Peened, with 5 coil extractor spring and extractor booster. Every one is High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure it is free of defects.Pistol Grip: Our grip is made from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. Comfort is assured by the soft-touch rubber overmolding combined with a more natural angle. The integrated flared trigger guard covers the gap between grip and lower receiver and easily accommodates a gloved hand.Cut and Polished Feedramps: Our M4-profile feed ramps are precisely cut and polished for smooth, snag-free feeding of cartridges, ensuring reliability in both semi-automatic and fully-automatic fire.

The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 Lightweight is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15 DDM4 quad rail over a 16 cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado Cerakote.

If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

No i dont need a flag man to warn me about all the scams out there.
So let me think for myself for once, dont guide me through like a lost puppy...

Wait a minute... the gun with 3 mags and cleaning kit... he is right, that costs $380..
plus shipping at $35
and the transfer at $30
do i need the $15 bayonet?
2 more mags is $30
hope i dont need those things shipped too... 
that wood stock looks much nicer to shoot then the iron rod that kicks you in the face so ill pay the $75 for that, maybe it will come with free shipping.
where is Flagman to add those numbers up, i dont know how to..

gosh i should ditch the cleaning kit and pick it up today for $595 on armslist. 
wish i knew how to barter..

They appear to have been manufactured between 1909 and 1939. Serial numbers are mixed with other models and are found in the 9,000 to the high 59,000 range. A few were made with an ""R"" prefix in the R10,000 - R13,000 serial range. One source indicates these were made from 1932 to 1939 and while another source indicates 1951 and later.

I'm selling this pistol used but its brand new with all original packaging....3 15 round mags....interchangeable grips....cleaning rod...never fired other than original manufacturer test fire.  I'm also throwing in a 33 round Glock magazine...also brand new never used.  This special limited edition Lipseys FDE is absolutely beautiful in both look and feel.  Once you grip this pistol you will fall in love with it! I'm a collector downsizing a little for an upcoming anniversary so your gain! This will make a nice cc gun as well as a showpiece.  The Carakote finish slide comes factory finished....try getting a slide custom carakoted....its 150 to 300 bucks for that alone.  This will immediately become your favorite gun!  Call or Text anytime....ask for J.B.  REDACTED

Copy and paste the link below to see my add for 33 round magazines.  I have a ton hoarded up and the wife says the Zombies are not coming so your gain.  Price is 3 mags for 75 plus 5 bucks shipping if needed.  I also have a few glow in the dark mags for 35 each or 3 for 99.  Enjoy!

Leupold Scope is not included in the trade/offering. I'm moving that to another weapon. The ladder rail covers can go with this upper.

I have been shooting my lighter weight rifles and just sucked it up when it comes to the cleaning. This is a 100% functional EXCELLENT condition upper. It comes with a 3 chamber stainless brake, but I'll include the original A2 flash hider in case you dislike the shiny tip. The upper is pictured without a charging handle, but it will include one."

Overview:

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories.
