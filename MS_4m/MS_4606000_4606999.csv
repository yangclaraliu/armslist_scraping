And an ammo can with 1500 rounds of ammo. Its a mix of FMJ hollow points and home/carry ammo. It is all labeled so you know what is what.  Also all the boxes and paperwork from Beretta and Wilson combat. 

Just so you know it took 5 months to get this beauty back from Wilson. The gun only has 150 rounds fired through it. It has also been treated with Froglube  so cleaning is a breeze. I am asking $1500 for the package. Buyer must have PTP or CCW. Email me with any questions and thank you for your time."

I do realize it is no longer new, hints the price drop. $825.00 is a very fair deal, probably too fair, but that is my bottom dollar cash price.

As far as long guns that I'm interested in trading for, I'd love to add another M1A or M14 to the collection, or possibly another AR platform, but I don't want your Custom pieced together AR, only stock models will be considered.

This is a Russian SKS, built between 1952-1954. In the late 50s, the Russians sent their surplus SKS's to aid the Chinese. The Chinese would remove the receiver cover (the main part identifying the gun as Russian), and put on one of their Chinese SKS receiver covers. At another point in time, the Chinese sent a bunch of SKS's to aid Albania, which would be a mix of Chinese guns and some of these Russian guns. The Albanians made their own replacement stocks for the SKS which are unique. Fast forward to 2010 and 2012... the last two major shipments of Chinese guns imported into the US came out of Albania. Russian guns, which had long been banned from import to the US, were mixed in with these Chinese guns and import stamped Chinese, and brought into the US. We call them sneaks, because they ""snuck"" into the country mixed with Chinese guns.

My particular Russian fits right into that known scenario. It is all numbers matching except for the Chinese receiver cover, and Albanian stock. What's nice about Russian sneaks, is that they are not refurbished like 95% of all other Russian SKS's were.

The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A™ SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the M1A™ SOCOM 16's unique design.
The M1A™ Socom 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the M1A™ SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.
If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the M1A™ SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™."

The new AR-30A1 is the sought after target version and a standard version chambered in .300 Win Mag. On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use. Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1: Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor. The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability. A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness. The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear. This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself. The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions. The cheekpiece supports contain integral cleaning rod guides that prevent damage to the bore due to inadequate cleaning rod control. Multiple sling installation locations allow simultaneous use of a sling and a bipod. And the rear sling swivel can be moved to either the left or right side. To provide very compact transportation, the entire buttstock assembly can be quickly and easily removed with only one allen wrench. Military grade anodizing and phosphating finishes enhance durability and corrosion resistance. AR-30A1 Target version incudes: A top 20 MOA Picatinny rail that is 18 inches long over the receiver and barrel will support any scope and accessory devices such as night vision devices. Picatinny rails on both sides of the forearm allow installation of other devices. The cheekpiece is vertically adjustable for 1 inch of adjustment without the use of tools so that each shooter, regardless of their facial features, can obtain an optimum cheek weld while still achieving a clear sight picture. The buttstock can be adjusted without tools for lengths of pull from 13.6” to 15.6.” This makes the AR-30A1 ergonomically correct for shooters from the 5% female to 95% male. Shooters can also quickly adjust length of pull to accommodate changes in clothing or shooting position. In addition, with a single allen wrench, the buttpad is adjustable for height. A 1913 accessory rail at the bottom of the buttstock allows for installation of additional accessories such as sling swivels or monopods. Performance characteristics of the AR-30A1: ArmaLite’s testing has proven the muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both reducing recoil and increasing accuracy. This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter. The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve. The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding. The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding. It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service. The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well. This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver. The deep magazine well under the receiver makes magazine insertion fast and easy, while holding the magazine in exactly the correct position for reliable feeding. An ambidextrous magazine catch is centrally located so that the shooter can release the magazine and catch it with the same hand. Reloading is fast, and the expended magazine won’t be dropped to be lost, damaged or muddied. The powerful ejection system and generous ejection port eject even loaded .300 Win Mag. cartridges rapidly and reliably. The large ejection port also makes single loading of cartridges through it easy and fast. The ergonomically improved bolt handle design and “competition grade” dimensions and tolerances in the receiver allow lightning-fast, butter-smooth reloading."

For sale is a Ruger 77/22. This was my wife's competition gun until she got a CZ and decided she liked it better. The gun is in excellent condition or better; you have to look really hard for any signs of use, but I wanted to be conservative in my grading. 

The trigger has had extensive work: factory sear has been replaced with Timney sear, sear and trigger have been shimmed and all mating surfaces polished. It breaks at a crisp 2.25 lbs. 

Accuracy is excellent. FWIW, my wife's last season shooting this gun, she was 0.1 pts from making Master class in NRA Light Rifle. 

If you're not in my area, you would have to pay actual shipping to an FFL of their choice. Scope pictured is NOT included."

This is the heavy barreled version (designated as ""HBAR"" on the barrel) of the venerable Colt 6920.  The other difference between the 6721 and the 6920 lies in the barrel twist rate which is 1/9, vs. the 1/7 twist rate of the Colt 6920.  1/9 twist is optimal for bullet weights up to 69 grains (which is the vast majority of bullet weights commercially available).  These rifles are renowned for their superb accuracy and combat reliability.  

This carbine is chambered in 5.56/.223, and is outfitted with a Troy Industries quad rail (which allows for attachment of tactical lights, fore grips, etc.), Rock River Arms Dominator rear sight/EOTech mount (instead of the plastic Magpul rear sight), and Knights Armament vertical fore grip.  The quad rail is outfitted with Magpul rail covers that can be easily removed.  The rifle and everything on it are in excellent condition.  Rifle has had LESS than 50 rounds fired through it for zeroing and function checking purposes.  It was then PROPERLY cleaned, lubricated, and put in a safe where it has stayed since then.  

If you've researched the AR-15 platform at all, then you know Colt is the gold standard of AR-15s.  If you want something to just plink at the range with, then to to Wal Mart and buy the cheapest AR you can find.  If you a rifle that is built for combat and reliability, buy a Colt, and you will not find a Colt AR-15 with these options and in this condition for a better price.  Sale of this rifle will include several boxes of match grade .223 ammo.

Built with versatility, style and performance in mind, these rifles meet the challenges of hunters throughout the world.

In addition, these bolt-action rifles contain all the value-added characteristics of yesterday’s Ruger rifles: positive floor plate latch, integral scope mounts, three-position safety, hammer-forged barrels, and of course, they’re made in America. All of these innovations, combined with legendary Ruger reliability, are features that big game hunters from Africa to Alaska can feel. Chambered in calibers from the varmint shooting 204 Ruger to the big bore 416 Ruger, there is an M77 Hawkeye for every game animal, on every continent, in any weather."

It is the original generation P-32 and it functioned well.

I disliked the blue grip so I ordered a new black grip, though I'm including both in the sale (although in my opinion it's a bad idea to make firearms in bright colors so that they can be mistaken as toys).

I took this gun apart intending to cold-blue it. The barrel and slide especially have very thin blueing and in places no blueing. However, due to laziness I never went any further with this project. Today, several years later, and having become even lazier, I have little interest in figuring out how to re-assemble the pistol.

As far as I know, all the parts are there for building a complete P-32; HOWEVER, I cannot guarantee this. It would not surprise me at all if a pin, screw, or spring were missing. These can be ordered through Kel-Tec if need be. I'm sure no major part is missing.

The picture shows what I'm selling. In addition to the parts, there is one magazine and 29 rounds of Winchester white box 32 ACP ammo.

I want $80 (eighty dollars) in cash. The price is firm. $79.99 will not buy it.

PLEASE NOTE: I'm being as clear as I can about what you would be buying, so please commit to buy before we meet. I'm moving overseas next week (Aug 23) so I am extremely busy right now. I don't have time to run all over. You would have to come to at least within a couple of miles of the intersection of North Beach and Golden Triangle, just west of Keller.

I must be certain that you're legally entitled to purchase a handgun in the State of Texas. Please bring a driver's license or state ID. Please don't attempt to buy this pistol if you are prohibited from buying it.

1943 dated, matching frame, barrel, and magazine serial #s.  The magazine has the original number struck out, and the same original number restruck at rebuild, so yes, it's the original mag, that's just the way the rebuild factory did it.

Iznevsk arsenal (arrow in a triangle) marked.

This Tok has NO ADDED SAFETY.  Most of these in the US had an added safety to meet import requirements, originals like this without the safety are hard to find.
The hammer has a half cock position, which is the original safety feature of this gun.

Original  Soviet bakelite grips marked with a star, surrounded by ""CCCP"", which I believer are initials for the Cyrillic spelling of Sojúz Sovétskix Socialistíceskix Respúblik.

Rearsenal marked (square with a slash through it).

Import marked ""TG IMP WPG FLA"" on underside of the frame.

The TT-33, developed by Feodor V. Tokarev, an improvement over his previous TT30, was based on John Browning's pistol designs.  Firing the 7.62X25 bottleneck cartridge, this Red Army pistol replaced the Soviet's Nagant M1895 revolver series.  It was replaced by the Makarov pistol around 1952.


TT's saw extensive combat service in World War 2 (including the Russo-Finnish War), the Korean War, the Chinese Civil War and the Vietnam War, and undoubtedly others as well.  

This short recoil actuated, locked breech, single action Tok weighs about 30 ounces unloaded, overall length is about 7.6 inches, with a 4.6 inch barrel.

This is a nice little beauty, great CCW weapon.

For FTF PPT sale at a local FFL in the South Bay L.A. area.

Frame and slide are stamped matching, the two 8 round mags are electropencil matching.


The Makarov was developed by Soviets from German technology, in this case the Walther PP/PPK. 


While the PM resembles the Walther PP and has a similar operating system, there are some notable differences, especially in the safety. The Walther employs a hammer-drop safety that may be set before the slide is operated to allow the hammer to ride forward as the slide returns to the closed position, or it may be operated after a round is chambered. 

The Makarov safety/hammer drop operates in reverse of that of the Walther. While the safety is pressed downward to drop the hammer on a Walther, on the Makarov it is pressed upward. Also, when the Makarov safety is in the up position, it locks the action. In order to enable the double action of the Makarov, the safety must be returned to the down position after using it to drop the hammer.

It's still in almost new shape and runs like a dream. These shotguns are made in the same factories as the Benellis (Franchi is a subsidiary of Benelli) and it's even stamped Benelli on the receiver. Would make a great semi-auto bird gun for anybody. The finish on it is very tough as well. Two of my hunting partners have Versa Maxs and the barrels are both worn where they lay them on the blinds, but mine still looks great. It's been recently cleaned and has Hornady HD Extreme dry lube all through the internals for protection against extreme conditions. Comes with the three stock chokes as well as a Carlson's Black Cloud Mid-range choke and a gun sock. Also has the factory magazine block, which can be easily removed. I can throw in my old brown soft carry case as well if you want it. Seriously won't find a better semi-auto shotgun for he price. Best way to get in touch with me is through text at REDACTED or through email in the link attached to the ad.

Both are in very nice, if not pristine condition. The 1100 Skeet B (Fixed Skeet choke of course) 12 Gauge dates to 1991 and is vent/ribbed and the 1100 LT-20 dates to 1992(fixed Imp Cyl choke) and Both have outstanding bluing and bore. The wood on both is fantastic. I have about 3 too many shotguns, so these are the 2 I am choosing to part with. I believe both are 26"" barrels, but I will check and make sure. I'm looking to trade for handguns, mostly S&W revolvers in 357 or larger calibers, but will consider all reasonable handgun offers. Or I will just sell out right. I would like to move the 2 as a pair, but will consider breakin them up on a case by case basis. This is a perfect combo for a husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. All low ball offers will be ignored. I feel $950.00 cash for the 2 or $1100.00 trade value for the 2 1100's is a very fair price and I am pretty firm. I will include 2 soft cases as well. More pictures and information is available, so just shoot me a text at 903-2seven2-0514 with questions and offers. Thanks for looking and God bless."
