It is all in excellent condition. I will consider sell/trading separately. I purchased to start a lawn care business but ended up having a change of heart. This would be great for personal use or business.

1) 2014 Husqvarna MZT 54"" commercial ZT. This thing is a tank. I have owned Exmark and Kubota and this is my all around favorite. It has a 26hp commercial Briggs engine, 54"" deck, roll bar and all of the upgrades. I used it to cut my personal 3/4 acre yard 6-8 times. It is under warranty for another year through Husqvarna. $5500 obo

2) Husqvarna 323L gas string trimmer. I used it one time for maybe 10 min and it also looks new. This is arguably the best trimmer on the market.  $250 obo

3) Husqvarna 350BT back pack blower. Not much to say, same story as the trimmer. $275

4) 6.4ftx12ft dovetail trailer. It has spring assist extended gate, trimmer racks and some compartments I built to store things I would have needed (can easily be removed, zip tied... Not drilled). It has seen 50 miles at best as you can see by the tires. $1300

This is an excellent setup at an excellent price whether your looking to pickup some side work or have a great personal setup!! You would be ready to go for $7200 (about the price of the mower). I am open to multiple gun trades, car, truck, motorcycle, quads, dirt bikes... Etc. I will consider any reasonable offer. Not in a hurry to sell so do not low ball. 
Feel free to text any questions 6one5-99nine-3362 I will gladly send more photos and if your interested you can test all equipment on my yard."
310,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4470310,For Sale:  Pre WWI Model 1903 Springfield 30.06 Rifle,"Cary, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 850,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 16, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1908 production, serial number 325xxx.  The metal and stock are in very good condition. The barrel is almost new reading less than .001 of wear on my muzzle gauge. Shoots great and is very accurate.  August, 1944 barrel date, so it went back through the arsenal at that time and was used during WWII as well as WWI.  High number bolt.  RA-P arsenal stamp which I believe was the Raritan Arsenal.  I have 3 of these and am running out of space, so this is up for sale.

This is an early number receiver and users are cautioned not to shoot them as they were only single heat treated and a very small number of them cracked during use.  They were taken out of service after WWI and many, this one included were put back into service during WWII.  If I recall my research correctly, there is no record of one of these receivers having cracked in use since about 1928.  Shooting it is, of course, at your own risk.  The rifle was used during WWII without a problem, and I have shot it many times, so, for me at least, the rifle is fine to shoot.  If you don't want to shoot it, the rifle is a great collector's piece.  

I might consider interesting trades."

Looking to sell or trade my rock crawler / trail truck. Looking for guns, a road bike like a harley etc, or maybe a couple dirt bikes or atvs. 
Would also consider other cars / trucks, land, boats, tools or other stuff of value.
Just dropped the price by $5000 From $13k down to only $8k.
THIS IS A STEAL. TONS of high quality parts went into this build. There is over $20,000 invested in just parts alone. Not including countless hours of labor. I just need to put some cash together.
Theres not many places where this truck won't go! Works great for climbing trails, rock crawling, snow crawling in the winter, hunting rig, etc. With the dual transfer cases and 4.88 gears you have a low enough gear ratio to climb almost anything.

And I'm sure I'm missing a few things!!
Has a clean title, notarized and ready to sign over.
This thing will do more than most people have the balls to even try. It will climb just about anything you could imagine. And it's even street legal so you don't have to trailer it to the trails! It was built off an 85 chevy truck frame/cab and is registered as such. Has fenders / panels that just pin on to it so you can drive it on the street legally.
Just send me details on what you have to trade or make me a cash offer. I'm open to either a straight across trade or part trade / part cash depending on what you have.
Truck is located in Bozeman, MT.

I figure I have right around 480$ in the gun. I am certain it will run fine for years to come or I wouldn't sell it. It would have ended up in the same garbage can a cheap ass Chinese kit I took a chance on once did.

Great for the budget guy or first timer. You can add a match trigger down the road or magpul furniture....you know, whatever. Skies the limit.

Just want my money back. So 480$ , no trades and not travelling far at all at this price. I also need to see a cpl or cop/fire badge. I know it's not a pistol, just a personal rule so I know the person who gets it is a good guy.
