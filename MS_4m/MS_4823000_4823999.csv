Hornady's Critical DUTY ammunition is designed for reliability under harsh conditions, and for controlled expansion through barriers. The flexlock bullet design incorporates the flextip hollow point and interlock core retention band to produce a high mass retention bullet controlled expansion through barriers, without clogging the hollow point.

Flexlock bullet incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock band that locks the jacket and core together.

Cannelured bullet with crimped case ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

InterLock band works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.

Core is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.

Nickel plated cases resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

Critical DUTY Law enforcement and tactical professionals now have a truly advanced, 21st century handgun ammunition solution that delivers the most consistent and reliable urban barrier performance ever created! The proven Flex Tip design of the new FlexLock bullet eliminates clogging and aids bullet expansion. Its large mechanical jacket-to-core InterLock band works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers."

She likes the gun, bought because of its beauty and the way it fits her hand, but she feels like it's a little too much gun for her, and wants to sell to get a small concealable 9mm. I'm kind of the gun guy in the family, very familiar with Armslist and private gun sales (done many, bought and sold) and what not so she's asked me to sell it for her. It's a great gun, I'd honestly like to keep it for myself if I had the money but just don't right now and I'd rather sell so she can get something to carry sooner. It's been shot around 300 times. It's got wear marks on the top of the barrel/chamber which is unavoidable when the gun is cycling, a couple marks here and there from being pulled in and out of the drawer but otherwise it's in great shape, never been carried. Comes with everything from factory. The two 7rd Ruger mags it came with, two 8rd colt mags and one 10rd pro mag magazine. Asking $600 obo. $600 is a pretty fair price. 

I know it's not required by law, but I'd like to peek at a license and permit to purchase/carry. I'll also be filling out a bill of sale which I'll provide with both of us keeping identical copies. I'm not concerned with getting addresses on bill of sale, I don't need to know where your house is, I just put name, cities we live in, date, firearm serial number and signatures. Thanks."

very presentable spreewerk manufactured p38 9mm pistol . ""cyq"" as can be seen on the left side of the frame indicates this P.38 was manufactured at Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin, Germany. CYQ was simply the code the Germans used for that factory so that Allies could not target specific small arm factories (similar to ""ac"" for Walther and ""byf"" for Mauser)
all matching with original magazine, serial numbers on frame, barrel, slide, & locking block match correctly' this is not a russian capture frankenstein pistol', rather being an original wartime nazi issued pistol possibly being used for post war police/military having replaced walnut grips. Minimal internal wear, shiny bore with strong grooves. decocker works fine as well as loaded chamber indicator, crisp break on the trigger, all in all a rock solid piece!
holster reads wunderlich berlin 1963. only issue being import marked very discreetly on the backstrap under the beavertail. 'very minute you wouldn't even notice' 


orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.

The gun features a flared magwell, ambi thumb safety, large extended mag release. 3 sets of extra grips plus the black Wilson G10 Starburst Grips in black (Extra grips include Wilson Cocobolo Starburst, Wilson Full Checkered Cocobolo, and LOK grips in black/Tan), three Wilson Combat Legendary 8-rd. mags, a Wilson gun bag, Wilson gun cloth, and all original paperwork including build list, upgrade list, and test target.  This is an amazing gun that is loaded with extras and upgrades so don't miss this opportunity as it is certainly priced to sell.  The gun origionally cost $3,600 and with additional parts, upgrades, and labor that I've added and am passing on to you, the gun could easily sell for $4,000 to $5,000.  Examples of these additional parts, upgrades, and services that I had performed to improve this gun include a trigger job by Wilson Combat, the Flush cut and reverse crowning of both the standard barrel and the bull barrel, the inclusion of both barrels, two gull length guide rods (one with a standard bushing and one with a reverse plug with barrel support), and more.  Please let me know if you have questions.  I also have many more pictures as the three here don't do it justice."

I am the second owner, all told I would say there have been less than 100 rounds put through this handgun. The previous owner purchased it, and quickly traded it to me because ""there was too much kick"". I obtained it and put it in the safe.

Asking $1250.00. I've outgrown my current gun-safe and this is funding the replacement. These are great handguns, and retail at over 1500.00 bucks before tax. This one is lightly used and frankly 1250.00 is priced to sell.

Included will be two Kimber Magazines, a Blackhawk SERPA holster, the original grips, and the pictured magpul grips in FDE to match the gun. 

Cash preferred, face to face. Be 21 years old at least, and please be prepared to sign a bill of sale.

I've gotten a lot of emails on trades, I'll consider the following list of items. Add cash to get to my value, or we can discuss getting up there in value by combining some items. 

Your used glock is not worth retail. I don't care if you stippled it in your garage. If your glock 19 with miles on it is worth over 500 bucks, then my kimber is worth 1500 without all the stuff I'm selling it with. Please bare my philosophy in mind when trying to trade.

The gun's trigger breaks at a clean 3 lbs. with zero creep or over travel. It also has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel that is highlighted in the pictures. This gives the gun a really nice look particularly with the barrel supporting reverse plug.  The pictures also show the gun with both black and black/grey G10 Starburst grips in addition to showing the gun with both black and stainless trigger, ambi-thumb safety, and slide stop. The gun comes with all the goodies from Wilson that come with these beauties. This gun may come in full black or in black with stainless accents, just let me know what you prefer and please request additional pics if you're unsure.   It has a 4"" barrel that remains in perfect shape and though I had assumed that my father may have shot it a few times while I was in school or traveling, he assured me he did not even know where it was so the round count is actually far less than I had prevously thought as I've only shot this gun at the reange twice for a total number of shots fired being well less than 50, (2-3 mags if I recall).  As this was a collection piece of mine, I provide it with an exaustive cleaning regularly.

Less than one year old. Black synthetic factory stock. It has had (40 + or -)  rounds put through it to site it in, thats it. Its sighted in for the scope that is on it for 100yd. Millet DMS 1-4x .  Tactical 6 screw HD rings. 4 point scope mount is solid and  is a see through in order to use iron sights. Also sighted in. This version comes with the forward scout top rail pre installed from Springfield should you want to use scout scope or red dot etc. The Scout Squad has a nice muzzle brake from factory. 18.5"" barrel, perfect size. Much more accuate than the SOCOM 16.5"".
This firearm is very very accurate. For hunting it loves  Federal Vital- Shok .308 ,165 grain Sierra Game King boat tails . nickel plated brass. But also shoots the federal military 7.62 bulk ammo. I am certain there are many other ammo manfacturers that offer even better ammo that would improve it even more. It shoots minute of angle at 100 yards with only 4x scope! If I had a bit more powerful scope I am sure it would have sighted in at sub minute of angle. I had proffesioanlly added on three picatinny rail sections on stock, one on each side up front (for lasers or IR illuminators etc and one mid way of bottom of forearm for angle grip or ""Grip-pod"". etc. or  for what ever you want to add on. I also changed out the sling swivel with a VERSA-POD very expensive 80.00 + sling picatinny combo after market metal attachment. That sling swivel has a rail which the Atlas bipod in picture is attached to. (Bipod is NOT included) it goes on my M4, just used it for pictures to hold rifle up. The Mountain sling goes with rifle too.  The rifle comes with Paperwork and box etc.  No issues at all! Please know You need good ID for private sale to NH residents and we meet at my local sport shop down the road from my residense.  (Disregard the 90 mph OD tape on the stock, my home made cheek rest with some mottos written in. I'll take it off) . Buyer will not be sorry. You will love this version of the M14. Such an awesome rifle.  Need to down size. Should you decide to have my gun shop guy do the transfer you pay the  25.00 + or - fee, but since I know him maybe he will do it for nothing. I do much business with them. IF THIS SELLS BY DEC 12TH, I'LL INCLUDE ONE 20 RD MAG. WITH THE 10 RD MAG THAT CAME WITH THE RIFLE.

This is my 3rd attempt at an AK. I tried a WASR. I tried a 5.45x39 Sellers custom. Then I tried this rifle. I am just not an AK rifleman. I fired 20 rounds of brass cased Winchester through the rifle. The box was mangled during shipping. I have two 30 round magazines that will come with the rifle. One magazine is steel and one PMAG. I paid more for the rifle than asking price plus the cost for the magazines. I am not really interested in trades. Only trades I might consider are Tier One Mid-Length Uppers in 5.56 in 99% condition. Price is $950.00 with the 3 magazines (Two 30 round and one 5 round).  I also have 1000 rounds of Golden Tiger I can discount for anyone who purchases the rifle. I will add the ammo for an additional $240.00 I will not separate the ammo from the rifle until the rifle sells first providing the opportunity for the purchaser to buy ammo. I will sell the ammo separate if rifle sells for $260.00 Thanks for looking. All laws apply. Bill of sell. Must have FL ID. Prefer CWP holder.

Finally has just over 200 rounds through it to complete the recommended break-in period, and it has performed flawlessly from the first shot to the last.  This gun has largely been a safe queen, never carried, and meticulously cleaned and properly lubed after each range visit.

This is a “blem” model, which means there is a very subtle imperfection on the finish that I never found, and is priced accordingly.  Also has a partial “idiot” mark under the slide stop.

This is my first 1911, but the platform just isn’t for me (thus the low round count in 8 months of owning it).  In my opinion, Dan Wesson firearms are as close to being a “custom” 1911 as you can get for the price of a production gun.  Fit/finish is impeccable, every single line is a perfect surface match.  And holy wow, is it accurate.  If you do your job, it’s hard to miss exactly what you’re aiming at.

Comes with everything it did new – DW factory box, papers, lock, two magazines, and barrel bushing wrench.  Serious inquiries only, not interested in trades at this time, lowball offers will be respectfully ignored.  Must meet in the Noblesville/Fishers area, and provide valid DL/LTCH proof that you are one of the good guys."

I have moved to a smaller place so I'm in the process of down sizing, so these guys have to go.

Order is from the bottom to top, all rifles have been checked with the proper head spacing gauges and the three complete rifles have been test fired and function well.

First is a 1945 Izzy M44. The bore is great, in a synthetic Monte Carlo stock, ATI bent bolt (installed properly and feels great), rear sight scope mount, front sight has been removed for scope, bolt doesn't match and it has sling mounts. The stock has a few small scuffs on the butt and the bluing is nice. $180

Second, is a 1942 Izzy 91/30. Bore is great, wood sporter stock, rear sight is a peep sight, bolt does not match, stock has a few dings but is nice and light. $165

Third, is a 1943 Izzy 91/30. Bore is like the others and is in great shape. It sits in a ugly cut down factory stock with metal butt plate, it's missing its front sight but I think I have a spare someplace. If so it'll just need to be pressed or punched in. It is also mismatched. This would be a great ""truck gun"" $140.

Forth, is a 1943 Izzy 91/30 barrel receiver. I have checked the head spacing and it cleared but I have not fired it. The bore is in excellent condition. It is missing both the front and rear sights. This would be great for an Archangle stock build. It is mismatched as well. $110

Fifth, is a 1977 M69 Romanian Trainer barreled receiver. Stock broke so just the barrel and receiver are left. It is complete with magazine. All you need is a stock. I was planning on building one from scratch but I no longer have time. $65

Ammo, I have several hundred rounds of UAR (United Arab Republic) 7.62x54r. I believe this is the 182gr heavy ball that they used for PKMS and is ammo that you don't see this ammo very often but it is tarnished and may have some very slight corrosion. This ammo isn't known to be the most reliable in the world and I fired some this morning and there was two hang fires and some duds. So I want this to be made clear!! There maybe quite a few duds or hang fires!! I have it priced accordingly. $37 per 200rds, that's only 18.5 cents a round. The ammo will only be available to someone buying a rifle or barreled receiver! I will not sell them without the purchase of a file unless they are all sold first, $37 per 200rds"

""Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip.

open to quality trades. just let me know what you may have 

very presentable spreewerk manufactured p38 9mm pistol . ""cyq"" as can be seen on the left side of the frame indicates this P.38 was manufactured at Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin, Germany. CYQ was simply the code the Germans used for that factory so that Allies could not target specific small arm factories (similar to ""ac"" for Walther and ""byf"" for Mauser)
all matching with original magazine, serial numbers on frame, barrel, slide, & locking block match correctly' this is not a russian capture frankenstein pistol', rather being an original wartime nazi issued pistol possibly being used for post war police/military having replaced walnut grips. Minimal internal wear, shiny bore with strong grooves. decocker works fine as well as loaded chamber indicator, crisp break on the trigger, all in all a rock solid piece!
holster reads wunderlich berlin 1963. only issue being import marked very discreetly on the backstrap under the beavertail. 'very minute you wouldn't even notice' 


orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.
