""The Rossi Model 25 is a copy of the third model Smith & Wesson ""Ladysmith,"" an M-frame revolver manufactured during the first two decades of the 20th century. The M-frame was the smallest hand-ejector frame made, and was used for the .22 Long, and was discontinued in the early 1920s. Rossi, a Brazilian gun manufacturer (now a member of the Taurus family of firearms companies), resurrected this revolver concept, manufacturing the Model 25 for 28 years from the 50s through the mid-80s, with nearly a million of the little revolvers sold. However, because of U.S. gun laws, primarily the 1968 Gun Control Act, relatively few Model 25s were imported into this country, all of them between the years 1965 through 1969. It is getting more difficult to find these guns, especially in good condition."" quoted from guntotingvigilante.

Reminder, firing lead projectiles into this thing indoors will almost certainly cause lead dust to be sprayed into your indoor atmosphere. For steel BBs it wouldn’t be a problem but for anything containing lead, better for outdoor use.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

This thing was an impulse purchase. It was on sale at a local gun shop for 10% off. The MSRP was $550 so not a bad discount. The kicker was that stainless slide. I was seduced by the stainless... I swear it wasn't my fault!

I normally carry a pocket .380 and was thinking about something with a little more power. I didn't do any research- I just got suckered by that pretty stainless slide. Well, the Taurus PT 24/7 G2 is a full size frame and I have kind of a thin build. I wanted a handgun to carry and realistically, this thing is just too big for me to do that.

It has that nice striker fire trigger, an ambidextrous safety, ambidextrous magazine release, white dot sights, and a picatinny style accessory rail.

It's not really brand new because I ran two flawless magazines worth of rounds out of it.

The gun includes everything it came with when it was new:
The handgun
Two 17 Round magazines
3 different backstraps
Mag loader
Cleaning brush
Keys for security and safety

Factory description...The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™"

This is a rare firearm that was made for police departments to give them more fire power than the criminals. The gun shoots great, and is a blast to shoot. It accepts standard AR15 magazines and it comes with one 30 rd mag. It is in good shape except for some of the black paint is missing around the edge of the magazine well. 

The following is from the American Rifleman Magazine.

Remington 7615P Pump-Action Rifle

 Although offering fast operation and simplicity of use, slide- or pump-action center-fire rifles are not nearly as common as their shotgun brethren. Within this niche market, however, the Remington 7600 series of center-fire rifles has proven to be one of the more popular because of its combination of user-friendliness and affordability. Recognizing the strengths of this rifle design, Remington’s Law Enforcement Division is offering two Duty/Patrol variants of the 7600 rifle: the 7600P in .308 Win. and the 7615P in .223 Rem., tested here. The 7615P is available through any distributor that carries Remington’s law enforcement line.

The 7615P offers similar operation to a standard Remington Model 870 with the same slide-action operation, cross-bolt safety at the rear of the trigger guard and slide action release at the front of the trigger guard. According to Remington, these similarities have made for significantly easier transitioning from the 870 for officers who may not have had much prior experience with rifles. Apparently, the .223 Rem. chambering has also made it popular with smaller-statured officers who are uncomfortable with the recoil of a 12-ga. Model 870.

The basic 7600 series of rifles—although similar to the Model 870 in appearance and use—differs significantly in design, utilizing a rotating bolt that locks into a barrel extension. The 7600’s barrel, fitted through a barrel bracket at the front of the rifle’s steel receiver, screws into a barrel extension that houses the recesses for the locking lugs.

The 7615P is a variant of the standard Remington Model 7600, however, it offers some distinct changes from the standard rifle. First and foremost of these—as well as being the most obvious—is the extended magazine-well adapter forward of the trigger guard. The standard 7600 series of rifles is designed to accept detachable, proprietary magazines whose limited-capacity may make them less than ideal for law enforcement or self-defense. The 7615P features a synthetic adapter factory fitted into the magazine well of the rifle that allows the use of AR-15/M16 magazines.

Although it appears to be oversize, the outside width of the adapter is the same size as a standard, Remington 7600 proprietary magazine. This means that basically the only modification required for the receiver was a hole on its right side to accept a screw that holds in the adapter.

Although not immediately obvious, the second significant alteration is the number of locking lugs on the 7615P’s bolt. While a standard 7600 has four locking lugs, this rifle has only three. The absence of the fourth lug, normally positioned at the lowest position when the action is open, allows clearance for the magazine-well adapter and magazine system. Remington assured us that this does not in any way reduce or compromise the strength of the locked action, and in our tests, we did not have any problems.

Other qualities, such as its Parkerized finish and synthetic stock and foreend, bring the rifle more in line with the rest of Remington’s law enforcement products. The 7615P is offered with a standard set of rifle sights, with both the front and rear sight mounted on the barrel. There is also a Wilson Combat ghost-ring-sight model that has the rear sight mounted on the receiver. We received the latter model for testing. Additionally, the receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount, and Leupold offers a Picatinny rail for the receiver.

The rifle itself is extremely handy with a short but stout 16 ½-inch barrel that measures 1.17 inches in diameter just forward of the receiver. The finish on the rifle was evenly applied and attractively flat. For accuracy testing, we mounted a Trijicon TriPower low over the receiver, which allowed for a comfortable cheek weld.

The rifle was pleasant to shoot due to its .223 Rem. chambering and 7-pound weight, andit functioned perfectly in both accuracy testing and rapid-fire strings.

Althoughthe 7615P is offered as part of Remington’s law enforcement product line, it will likely appeal to civilian shooters as it is ideal as a handy, portable ranch-type long arm that utilizes a commonly available magazine.

There is a slight drag line around the cylinder and some very small scratches on the ejector rod.  This gun is in excellent condition but, unlike lots of sellers, I cannot in good conscience call it LNIB.  It is just a very nice, lightly used gun that happens to come with its original box.

So what we here is an oldie and a goodie. 

 This is a 1927 Browning A5 12 gauge made in Belgium. Gun is in pretty good shape but does show some signs of its age as it should! Has a cuts compensator installed but is installed over 18"" so could be removed if wished. Gun is tight and operates just perfect. Finish is fair with most areas having a nice patina on them but bluing is wore in some areas. Cant say for sure but lets say 70% remains and gun still looks good. Gun locks up tight and functions well. Have ran light loads through it no problem and cycled fine, have not tried any high brass but see no reason it shouldn't function fine when set for them. Bore is nice and shiny.

 Stock is worn but appears to be all original with rounded grip. Does have repair screw in by the grip which is in the pictures but feels tight and solid. Also does have original butt plate. Forearm is cracked but also does appear to be original.

 Awesome old gun that would be great for a collector or hunter

 I live in Winder and Work in Norcross and don't mind driving for a meet.

 Would prefer a straight up trade for one of the items listed but can add a little cash or ammo if yours is nicer than mine. Feel free to ask for any more information or if you would like more pictures.

Sure Shot Targets are routinely featured on the TV show ""Sons Of Guns"" and are now available for personal use by the general public! Inside every target are a double sealed amount of pre-weighed catalyst, instructions insert and a sealed bag of base chemical. The bag doubles as a mixing container to expedite preparation. You can have a target ready to shoot in 60 seconds or less! To detonate a set-up target, it must be shot with a rifle projectile traveling faster than 2200 FPS. 
Sure Shot Targets is one of only a select few binary target manufacturers in the United States licensed by the BATFE! A manufacturer must hold and maintain a special license to handle and use the explosive-grade chemicals found in Sure Shot Targets. These targets do not contain inferior components such as fertilizer or other second-hand chemicals! This is the real deal!

Inside every target are a double sealed amount of pre-weighed catalyst, instructions insert and a sealed bag of base chemical. The bag doubles as a mixing container to expedite preparation.
