This is New Old Stock that was MADE IN THE USA. It is not PMC Gold Starfire which currently comes from South Korea. This is Eldorado. This is the one everybody compared to Winchester Black Talon back when it was being pulled off the shelves. The buzz was that Eldorado Starfire was a hollow point bullet with expansion characteristics similar to Black Talon. That and the fact it was designed by the same guy who designed the Federal Hydra-Shok might have had something to do with it.

Rounds are headstamped E L D  45 AUTO with 230gr JHP projectiles in non-corrosive and boxer primed reloadable brass casings.
20rds/box. 40 rounds total. Both boxes $40.

Boxes still in very good condition and marked on the sides as follows:
ELDORADO
Statfire
45 AUTO
230 GRAIN	NO. C45SFA
STARFIRE	JACKETED HP

The following bullet performance data was provided by PMC El Dorado Cartridge Corp., Boulder City, NV.

According to PMC, these bullets expand up to 1.5x their unfired diameter. The deepest penetration will be obtained when fired from compact handguns. The shorter the barrel length, the lesser the muzzle velocity. Less velocity usually produces less bullet expansion, which in turn increases bullet penetration. Compact handguns with barrel lengths less than 4-inches will probably produce the deepest penetration. Handguns with barrel lengths of 5- to 6-inches will probably produce the least amount of penetration. Handguns with barrel lengths in between these two extremes will probably fall somewhere in the middle in terms of penetration. During testing the .45 ACP 230gr JHP penetrated on average 10-12 inches.

I bought this ammunition about 16-18 years ago and stored it in a USGI ammunition can ever since. It's still in like NEW condition and don't forget, they don't make it in Boulder City, Nevada anymore.

CASH only please.
Will meet for Local Pick-up in Alabaster and surrounding area.
Thank you for looking."

Barrel is new and unfired.  It is chrome lined 1/9 twist advertised by RRA as their CAR Lightweight barrel.  Does not have M4 ramps and is 4140 barrel steel.  It did have a lo-pro gas block so there are 2 set screw marks on the underside.

Upper is RRA with laser etched logo on top.  It is an older version, however there is only a hint of wear from a BCG.  It does have the port door and forward assist.

Lower is RRA and was color filled (not by me).  There are no gouges or messed up threads, shows some very minor use.

No more of this ammo will come into this country. This is real Chinese surplus military grade ammo. All Chinese ammo has been banned from import since the 1990's, and when offered it is always 65 cents to 90 cents a round, and mine is under 42 cents per round, no shipping, local only, plus I am throwing in $50.00 worth of free extras, 80 rounds of current Tula ammo and a steel 30 round AK mag. If you are a true Ak or Type 56 SKS collector, these will enhance a collection. 
I had intended to keep it for collector reasons, but changed plans, and I went all 5.56/223, and no longer have any AK's or SKS's, so am throwing in the AK mag and current ammo.

It will be only in person, with no shipping. You must be legal age to buy.

I will reduce more to sell in a package deal with other ammo or other items.

TITANIUM: Stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. The overall condition is excellent. No scratches dents or dings. This gun weights only 28 oz's as compared to a Smith & Wesson model 686 at 52 oz's. 6 1/2"" barrel, 7 shot. Prices on ""All Titanium"" guns have spiraled these past years since they have been discontinued about year 2001, due to world wide titanium prices also spiraling up as military contractors all over the world have bought up nearly all on the commodities market. If made at today's Titanium prices this long barrel gun would have to retail at about $4000. A great investment gun. The most collectible of all Taurus Ti guns is the 627 seven shot with the light color Ti finish and 6 1/2"" barrel. This is it. Very hard to find.

I stored it in a silicon gunsock for the last few years. It is missing the rod that was used for cleaning. It has some pits but that is expected from a gun from this error. This is great for anyone that is into war collectables. The model 1973 gun was used by the United States in the following wars: Great Sioux War, Indian Wars, Spanish–American War, and Philippine–American War. It uses a .45-70-405 cartridge.  I am only looking to get what I have in the gun. This is a piece of history that would look great in anyones den. I have heard about people actually firing them but I have not done so. I am not for sure but I dont think I have to ship it to a ffl dealer. I will check on this before shipping. I would be happy to answer any questions. Customer pays for shipping."

Features:
Compact, lightweight holographic weapon sight with 1x magnification
Uses laser light to illuminate holographic red reticle projected on target plane
Improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control
Leaves rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools
Requires 123 lithium battery; measures 3.5 x 2.4 x 2 inches (W x H x D)
Product Description
This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot.

Editorial Review
Smaller and lighter than other holographic weapon sights, the EOTech XPS2-0 is an ideal compact option for your weapon platform. The XPS2-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. 

The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing. Note that the XPS2 is not night vision compatible.

   About 4 months ago I posted an advertisement were I gave away my .22 caliber rifles to any enlisted man with children (let them learn to shoot with the guns)  Several people have sent me emails asking what happened, do you still have the rifles, etc? Well, the answer is this:
1) One .22 rifle went to a young man that is disabled from an RPG blast. He was in his mid 20's but he walked in pain. Not really a kid but he sure deserved that.
2) One .22 rifle went to an Army mother with a 12 year old boy... 
3) I had an extra 20 GA bolt action shotgun. I gave that one to a SPC that had a 6 year old boy (grow into the gun later). His wife meet me at a local gun store. I paid the $40 transfer fees for all guns and they are gone.  The lord has blessed me with enough wealth (not super rich, just well-to-do) so I decided to give back to those that I truly admire and respect. As for the older shooters, pass it on. Why hold onto an older gun? Soldiers don't get paid all that much and to give a rifle to a young man has a price, it is priceless! For you the common foot soldier, you are far a better man than I could ever be. All that I asked of each child (and one soldier) was to try to always be a polite, safe and respectful shooter. Seems like I got the better part of the deal. Go in peace my friends... 

ORIGINAL ADVERTISEMENT:
Guys, I am might grateful for the men and women that serve. We are a military family ourselves. I got asthmas so I could not serve. Well, I have two older .22 rifles. They are older but they still shoot when you pull the trigger. I want to give them away to a soldier. Any Army PVT to SSG is welcome. I will take care of all the transfer fees and stuff. If you have a kid that is at least 10 years old, I will give you a preference. Yes, one of them was my childhood rifle but, I would much rather see that passed onto the next generation. Just drop me an email and we can meet at a gun store for the transfer. I am not sure if I give the gun for free or if I have to sell it to you for one U.S. cent? If anyone knows the law, please let me know? Can I give a gun away in Colorado? As for the Soldier, you have done more than enough. I don't want anything from you except a good safe shooting attitude."

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.
The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.
 The 9mm SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226.
The .40 SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22, GLK23, BERETTA96, S&W4006, SIG226.

-ABSOLUTELY MINT CONDITION***** If it was in a gun show case at a shop you'd swear on your grandmas china collection that it was NEW, no scratches, chips, marks, etc etc.
-Every inside of the gun is polished
-Gun was meticulously broken in over 50rds and cleaned 5x in the process, all serfaces are mated perfectly with zero slop. (if you dont believe in barrel break in, either you dont shoot very far or tight to notice a difference, sorry...)
-Gun ran with a mix of wilson combat lubes and synthetic greases that I will tell you what, how and how frequently to preform to keep it running on the level it is for me.
-Triggerjob to an absolutely BUTTER smooth pull and crisp as cracking an alaskian snow crab leg open, weight is 4.7-4.9lbs vs 7ish stock
-Custom tuned recoil spring that shoots a softer and flatter recoil impulse
-Not a single failure to feed fire eject, accuracy issue or anything NOT ONCE
-Every item that comes with the box, manuals mags etc
-Comes with 300rds of 147gr flat nose AE that it LOVES. Accuracy pic is 10mph wind shot with that ammo iron sights at 125yrds (notice the minimal horizontal spread!!!!)
-I also have 1000rds of its other favorite ammo available ONLY to the buyer of the gun for $260 shipped
-I have just concluded testing with the ""ATOMIC 124 +P bonded match hp"" and it passed my tests for long range accuracy and had no feed isues in 150rds of testing, I have a remaining 35rds or so I can sell with it for 20$ extra if your interested.

I tried to put together a good package deal with ammo.  So here it is again a little clearer…

For sale is a lightly used Pre-64 Winchester Model 94 lever action rifle in 30-30 Winchester caliber with a 20” barrel.  If you look at the successful bids on Gunbroker.com, a rifle in this nice of condition would typically sell for $700, plus.  But I prefer to sell it to someone in the area.

The Serial No. is 223XXXX, which means it was manufactured in 1956. It is one of the nicest original Pre-64 Model 94’s that you will ever find and it functions perfectly. It is rust free and has nearly 100% of the original bluing. It does not have any touch-up bluing- it is all original. The stock, which has never been sanded or refinished, has only some faint scratches and dents. All I have ever done to the stock is wipe on a little oil finish, as they can dry out over time. The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on February 19, 2015.

The rifle has a Redfield peep sight and sling swivels. In addition, I installed a new magazine tube follower for the Hornady LeveRevolution bullets. The original follower is included. 

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA for $469.00.  For an additional $60.00, I will meet you at a gun shop in either Spokane, Wenatchee or Ellensburg to perform the transfer. 

In addition, I have three 20-round boxes of hard-to-find Hornady LeveRevolution 30-30 ammo that I will sell for an additional $60.00.

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at most gun shops for a reasonable fee, payable by the buyer.  If we meet in Kennewick, I prefer the Hole in the Wall gun shop on Deschutes.  Their fee is $25.00.  There is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the actual transfer occurs at a gun store.

Give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or if you would like to arrange to purchase the rifle.  

I will not respond to ""lowball"" offers and I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

Thanks for looking!

Tonight I am offering up my Trijicon RMR 07.  It's the adjustable 6.5 MOA version.  I've had the optic for about 4.5 months.  It had been used on a couple of different hand guns and has seen a little over 1000 rounds.  The sight has some very minor blemishes from where it was fitted onto the slide of my Glock 19.  I have decided to replace it with a different model RMR and I don't have a use for this one anymore.  

I am looking for the best deal I can get.  Whether it's cash or trade or a combo of both.  I am fair and reasonable as long as you are."

The hardware is bronzed and these knives are one of a kind custom made to my specifications in ELMAX steel. Microtech couldn't fix my Nemesis so I had them make these 2 instead. They are dubbed the ""Travelers set"" because depending on legalities of witch state you visit you can always have a DOC on your person. As far as I know these are the only DOC set like this ANYWHERE!!! They are a compilation of Anthony Marfione and Mick Strider. They feature a black anodized 6061-T6 aluminum handles with traction inserts, bronzed titanium backstraps, and stainless steel pocket clips. The spear point blades are compound ground, which puts more steel at the tip. If I can't sell them here, than a custom knife sight said they'd consign them for $1000 instead. I'd rather skip the middle man. These are perfect for any knife collector!!"

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. 

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

 The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. 

 Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

 Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

 The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

 Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

If you have a 9mm Glock, and are thinking you would rather have 40sw... Or maybe you have a g17, and think the compact would be better... Then maybe we can make a deal.
