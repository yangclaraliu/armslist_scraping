12,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4291012,For Sale:  Rare Type I Arisaka (also known as the Carcano Arisaka),"Conway, Little Rock, Arkansas",$ 325,"Listed On: Monday, May 18, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I never thought I'd get my hands on another one of these but, surprise, I did! This is yet another Type I Arisaka, also known as the Carcano Arisaka. This was made for the Japanese Imperial Navy by Italy so it has many Carcano features as well as Arisaka features. This one is in near new shape with a shiny bore and strong rifling.  There is one part missing, the barrel band spring, otherwise it's in near perfect condition.  There were only 60,000 of these made! The sling is original to this rifle and has writing on the back. No import marks on this one!
The sling in itself is worth quite a bit of money because of the writing on the back. I had a local professor of Modern Japanese History translate this (thank you UCA and Dr. John Schneiderwind!) and this is what he said:

""The top writing is actually katakana, which is one of Japan's phonetical alphabets. It says ""Kira"" 3499. That may refer to the batallion name and number the soldier was in, or something else, but I'm not familiar enough with how the imperial forces marked their various equipment to be sure. Kira is also used as both a first name (usually female) and family name. Since it's written in Katakana, I can't tell you more about the meaning of the name since Katakana, unlike Kanji, doesn't hold any intrinsic meaning in the characters. They are solely phonetic."

I bought this new in the fall and have only shot 40 rounds through it. All ammo shot through it was Federal Gold Medal Match 168grain SMK's.

Accuracy was very good. At the time I was shooting with the stock trigger, which was standard mil-spec. I have since put a Rock River 2 stage National Match trigger in it, but have not taken it to the range since. It is a great trigger, and should tighten up groups nicely. The pic of the two groups was 100 yards, BEFORE the new trigger. This is a very nice rifle.

Quick note - you can run this in DA/SA SSP Division, or with a quick part swap (parts included), you can run this in SA mode with a manual safety for ESP Division.  

Round count is low - 500 round range or less.  Only used for IDPA a few times, great shooter, I just have more than enough competition pistols, so this one isn't seeing much range time.  

Comes with the original box and eight 19-round magazine kits (pistol came with two magazines, pic shows four, I have eight total).  Includes a SHTF Holster (IWB) as well.  This pistol has the Omega trigger, you can run it double action/single action, or with a quick change, you can run it single action only (like a 1911).  The Cajun Gun Works trigger mods give the DA pull a smooth, light pull, and the SA pull is out of this world (with a reset like the SIG SRT).

It is a semiautomatic, 16 inch barreled version of the famous British Sterling submachinegun which started production in the 1950s to replace the equally famous STEN submachinegun. In addition it is the same variety of gun used to make the E-11 blaster rifle of the Stormtroopers from Star Wars. These bad boys have been out of production for a good few years now though the manufacturer still carries replacement parts on their website and places like ApexGunParts.com also carry parts. 

This rifle has recently had its firing pin and its springs replaced and comes with 5 military 34 round Sterling SMG magazines. Surprisingly it is pretty accurate, I've nailed little ammo boxes at 110 yards with the thing. The stock is an underfolder and the rifle can be fired while the stock is folded. Take down is a breeze.

NEVER send money to anyone you DON'T KNOW.  ALWAYS google the seller's phone number and email.  Most of the time but not always, the seller won't give you his phone number and prefer to use emails only.  Try speaking with the seller on the phone, usually a scammer doesn't speak English well at all, but sometimes they do.  NEVER click on any links emailed to you, there are tons of ways he can cause damage to your computer and steal your personal information.   Google ""types of scam"" and see if the deal you working on is matching the description of a scam.
