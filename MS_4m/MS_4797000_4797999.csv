The .221 Remington Fireball is a centerfire cartridge created by Remington Arms Company in 1963 as a special round for use in their experimental single-shot bolt-action pistol, the XP-100. Based on a shortened version of the .222 Remington, it is popular as a varmint and small predator round while also finding increasing use among target shooters. 


Despite its smaller size, the .221 Fireball is capable of velocities nearly equal to that of the .222 Remington due to its higher SAAMI pressure. The maximum SAAMI pressure level for the .221 Fireball is 52,000 C.U.P. as compared to 46,000 C.U.P. for the .222 Remington.

The 10/22 Carbine features a rugged, single-piece synthetic stock that is impervious to harsh weather. The stock has textured surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end to provide a solid hold in harsh weather—ideally suited for rugged outdoor use and survival situations. The barrel is blued black, and the receiver finished in satin black. The 10/22 utilizes a blowback semi-auto action, and a 10-shot rotary magazine, both of which are legendary for reliability. The hammer-forged barrel locks into the receiver by a unique 2-screw, V-block system that provides unsurpassed accuracy for mass-produced rimfire rifles. The Carbine model comes with a fine, gold bead front sight dovetailed into a barrel band, and an adjustable, folding rear sight. The included scope base screws onto the drilled and tapped receiver, and is compatible with both Weaver®-style and 3/8"" tip-off scope rings. An extended magazine release allows for rapid reloading. The short and light 10/22 Carbine handles incredibly well by adult and youth shooters alike. The popularity of the Ruger 10/22 has led to a myriad of after-market 10/22 accessories, making it one of the most customizable firearms ever made. The Ruger 10/22 Carbine with synthetic stock is an indispensible, go-to firearm for any American serious about preparedness, self-defense, or hunting. Made in USA."

Selling my like new ULTIMATE ACCURACY ARMS 5100 (RAP) in .50 BMG. I bought this rifle new in the early 90's and put a total of 9 rounds through it. The only reason I am selling this rifle, is to fund a new, custom .50 BMG that I want which is nearly double the price I'm asking on this one. A little about the rifle: This rifle was originally designed by a team, led by D. Haskins of Research Armaments Prototypes (RAP), a small company then located in Jacksonville, Arkansas (where this rifle was made). These rifles were developed at the request of U.S. Armed Forces during 1981-1982. The U.S. military purchased small quantities of this rifle in 1983 (about 125 rifles delivered) where they saw service in Grenada, Beruit, Panama, Iraq and several other locales. This model rifle paved the way into military service for numerous other .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles such as the various Barrett models. This rifle features a removeable ""shell holder"" rotating bolt with 3 lugs. For each shot the bolt was rotated and removed from the receiver, then the cartridge was inserted into the bolt face, and then the bolt with cartridge were inserted back into the receiver and locked. Very simple, fast and efficient design. Fully adjustable trigger and adjustable buttstock allows for some ""personalization"" of the rifle. The rifle was never intended to be fired from offhand, and thus had no forearm. Instead, each rifle was issued with a folding bipod. For carry, the rifle is easily disassembled into several major parts. The rifles never featured open sights, only telescope sights are used. This rifle comes with a NEW, now, discontinued SPRINGFIELD ARMORY 6-20X56 Mil-Dot Government Model Scope with Illuminated Reticle with Flip-Up Lens covers. This scope features an internal BUBBLE LEVEL and Unlimited Range Finding Capability. Instant ON-OFF mount (with rings) allows for removal and or re-attachment of the scope while maintaining zero. The mount has a small lug that mates up with a groove on top of the receiver of the rifle for consistent removal and/or attachment. The rifle sports an unique muzzle break that vents rearward at 45 degrees on either side to dissipate concussion and offset kick-back effect. This rifle recoils midly, much like a 3"" 12 guage. The weight of the rifle (approx. 34 lbs without scope, mount or rings) absorbs a lot of the recoil also, combined with the fact that you are shooting from the bipod (bench or prone). Barrel length is 36"" including the 7"" muzzle break. Barrel twist is 1-15"" Trigger pull is Crisp 3 - 8 lbs. Length of pull is 13.75"" to 15.5"" Drop at Heel is 1.25"" Comb is fully adjustable to +1/5"" Overall length is 51.5"" Also included is a BROWNING Waterproof Travel Vault that has the foam cut to custom fit the rifle components and scope. Also included is a MIL-DOT MASTER Slide rule and instruction book on utilizing the Mil-Dot reticles. No ammo included at the $5,750 price. If you want the 150 rounds of ammo with can, the price is $6,150. TRADES: I'm looking for the following items and can take these items in as partial trade towards the rifle. I need 2 HENRY H003T pump Rifles .22 (S,L,LR). I need 1 HENRY H003TM pump Rifle .22Mag I need a SPRINGFIELD or PARA 1911 (A1), .45 ACP pistols (STAINLESS STEEL preferred). Standard or Loaded models on the Springfield and Expert, Expert SS, 1911 SSP, LTD, Nite-Tac, etc… on the Para's. Most any of the Para Single stack full-sized 1911's. I need cases of 5.56, 7.62 x 51 (.308), and .38 spl/.357 mag., possibly some .45 ACP and finally some .22 Magnum. Asking $6,150 for the Rifle and all ammo and accessories described and in the photographs, OR $5,750 without the can of ammo. Again, I can do SOME trades, but primarily need the cash to put towards the purchase of the other rifle I have in mind as it is quite expensive. NO SHIPPING!!!! This rifle, case & accessories combined weigh alot + I don't want the hassle of trying to box it all, find a carrier, FFL, etc…, etc…, FTF only. I am in WEST CENTRAL GEORGIA (Warm Springs, Pine Mtn, Manchester area), but do get ocassionaly down to the Columbus, Georgia area (and all towns, cities between).

Up for consideration I have an AR-15 pistol. The upper has seen only 180rds fired so far and is from the Bravo Company USA factory. It has the 11.5"" BFH barrel with a carbine length gas system, 1/7 twist rate, BCM full auto BCG, BCM mod4 charging handle and chambered for 5.56Nato. It will come with the standard dual heat shield carbine handguards from the factory and a firefield carbine quad rail which is currently on the weapon. Also included will be the BCM vertical grip on the rail in the picture and a angled grip attachment from BCM that is not pictured as well. 

The lower receiver is marked ""pistol only"" and made by Superior Arms. I can't honestly tell you how many rds the receiver itself has fired but the lower parts kit, Phase 5 Hex 2 buffer tube, Heavy Carbine buffer, buffer spring and all that was put together brand new for the upper and so they too have seen the same 180rds fired. With the lower I will include both the foam pad and Shockwave Blade Pistol Stabilizer for the Buffer tube. 

The only item which I may hang on to is the red dot sight. But for the right deal it could be included as well. It's a Holosun HS403C which is practically brand new and is covered with a lifetime warranty from Holosun. It's mounted but has not yet been fired. It can run on solar power or battery power and would come with the box, both a high and low mount, the receipt, and anything else it came with new.

I will trade the whole setup or just the upper w/ or w/o the red dot. Either way is fine. However I would rather not trade just the lower by itself as long as I still have the upper. I just want to keep my ass covered in the event that some Beauracrat tries to claim that he knows what  my ""intent"" is for the upper. 

I'm open to all firearm or firearm +/- cash offers. So if you have an offer let me know what it is. I'm pretty reasonable and the worst I will do is say no thanks."

Made by FN of Belgium! Which is the best part of any winchester or browning gun.

This is one sweet shooter and has been discontinued in 2007 when they switched to the M101 (same action).

Ported barrels, gold trigger, pro skeet & Trap chokes, and the breakdown case that it came with.

There is one small imperfection on the bottom of the receiver from use. Everything else is like new. I've only shot a few rounds with it. I'd consider this an easy 90% condition/quality.

Need cash to help pay for our daughters first car. (yikes)

Feel free to do some research on these guns. They have been proven for 10's of thousands of rounds, and hold up to any mid grade browning.

For the reasons above, Im pretty firm on the price."

Automatic Modified Paratrooper [weapon]) is a Hungarian-manufactured licensed variant of the venerable AKM rifle for use by that nation's armored infantry and paratrooper (""descent"") units. The rifle's design is suited for outdoor use as an infantry rifle but can also be used from within the confines of an armored vehicle as a fire support weapon. This is possible due to the side-folding stock of shaft design that makes it more compact. The 12.6-inch barrel is also relatively short for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. The operating mechanism does not require a gas expansion chamber at the muzzle as in the AKS-74U to ensure reliable functioning, but does use a specially designed muzzle brake, which reduces muzzle flash."

This is a super accurate and reliable pistol. The only reason I'm parting with it is because I picked up another USP recently, and I'd rather have some variation in my collection.

This comes with 2- 13rd mags, and 1-16round jet funnel mag ($60 value), and the jet funnel (not installed, needs mounting hardware) This also has the Tactical recoil spring assembly instead of the standard recoil assembly, making the kick of the .40 more like that of a 9mm. Making shot-to-shot recovery quick and easy. Compared to a Glock 22, I'd say this is the much better shooter, and doesn't make your wrist hurt. This also has Tru-Dot night sights installed. (Yellow rear, green front) and they still have a little glow left in them.

I'd rate it 9/10 condition. Does have some very light holster wear at the muzzle, but its barely noticeable.

Comes with 124 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 180gr FMJ ammo.

I also have a bunch of .40 brass I can throw into the deal if you reload.

That doesn't mean Im in a hurry to sell this so don't message me explaining how ""dude turners has ar-15 on sale for $800""... I am fully aware of the ranges of rifles and their prices. A $800 rifle could look almost identical to a $2000 rifle, but that doesn't mean they're the same... You are getting a top tear rifle fully loaded so I'm pretty firm on the price. That being said here's a little bit about my baby... These are off the top of my head so i will update this ad with additional info when I get home. I will also post more images (these are the only ones I have available right now)The upper reciever is 14.5"" cold hammer forged barrel made by Daniel Defense but branded for Rifle Gear.

Hands down the best muzzle break. ZERO muzzle rise. It is tapped and welded since the barrel is 14.5""Sig Sauer Red Dot Sight. This sight very good quality. I would say the only noticable difference between it and the Aimpoint is the battery life.The rifle is Krylon painted NOT dura coated. I went with Krylon because unless you baby your rifle to death and keep it wrapped in foam while you're shooting you will always scratch it. So instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a paint job that im just going to scratch just didnt make sense. Plus any big scratch or wear spots can be patch. or if you want to change the color all together it can easily be stripped and re pained. this is why all Mil Krylon their rifles. it's cheap, easy and effective...Rifle comes with the case, cleaning kit and (2) 10rd 30 body Magpul PMag's."

If I recall I paid over $1000 plus tax in 2008.

These are capable of using much higher pressure rounds than 45-70 levers...in fact
when used with Garrett's 540-grain Hammerheads, or others, they are serious ""Dangerous Game"" capable.
