The 7.5 X 55 cartridge produces a very flat trajectory with approx.. 15-20% more muzzle energy than the standard 308 / 7.62 X 51 cartridge.  There at least four sources for this cartridge.

  If you are a collector of military firearms or a hunter looking for rifle that will take almost any North American game, the K31 would be an excellent choice for your collection.

The rifle shown below is the most accurate rifle I have ever owned.  The K31 in original condition is inherently accurate but this rifle has also been pillar bedded and receiver bedded making it capable of even tighter shot groups.  It will consistently shoot 1 MOA with Swiss GP11 surplus ammo (I have some of this for sale).

This rifle was purchased from the importer as “Excellent” grade.  It has 90%+ bluing, a bright shiny bore, a 6 round detachable magazine, and an incredibly smooth 3 ½ to 4 # trigger.

As shown, the rifle is fitted with an easily removable, no mar bipod mount and scope mount made by Swiss St. Marie, and a Bushnell 3-9 scope.  These items will be priced separately.  Please ask for prices if you are interested.

The beech stock has been respectively and lightly sanded to preserve all of the original contours and historical markings.  It has 7 coats of hand rubbed Tung Oil giving it a beautiful and tough finish.

I am asking $385 for the rifle stand alone.  I will give a package price with the items listed above if you are interested.

From CZ:

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Starfire sells  this particular sword for $325. I  am asking $100 for mine. Sword has no physical damage but has some light tarnishing. I  would be happy to send more pictures upon request. No shipping, local cash dealings only."

Note that this one has the original high gloss rust blue (like a nice luger), and a very nice and real set of STAG grips!  They appear to be the same vintage as the pistol itself!
    I recall reading one time many years ago, that these were noted for their reliability.    The blueing is the the original rust blue, as nice as any Luger that I have seen.  The slide says: ""Fegyvergyar-Budapest-Frommer-Pat. Liliput Cal.6.35 mm (.25) on the first line, and on the second line it says: ""U.S.A. Pats a.f.   Made in Hungary
serial # 418xxx
on the bottom of the magazine it says: ""6.35 Frommer
Other than a couple of proof marks, no other writing.
The blueing on the first side is near perfect, and on the other side it is almost as good, with the exception of the holster wear on the slide, which looks a lot better than the given pictures.  The real thing looks a lot better than these pictures.  This is a very nice, high quality piece.
And, it's teensey.  The gun measures 4&1/4 x 3""

319,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4585319,For Sale/Trade:  L3 M6X LED Tactical Laser Illuminator Pistol Laser Light for Glock,"Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",$ 0,"Listed On: Saturday, September 5, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Please message with any questions. This model is for the Glock line of pistols. These usually sell for around $250+ This one is brand new in box and is one bad ass light, it's made by L3 that makes Eotechs. Please message with any questions. 




The M6X Tactical Laser Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M6X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.

The M6X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today’s tactical loads. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M6X has a run time of one (1) hour.

The M6X utilizes a red, class III visible laser with a range of 200 meters. The laser is adjustable for elevation and windage (using the supplied tool) allowing the user to zero in the laser.

The M6X features a 4 position selector switch in conjunction with an ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate. The selector switch turns to Lock-Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6X is activated by using the rocker arm toggling down for Momentary On or locking up for Constant On. The rocker backplate on the M6X is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M3X or M6X models, giving you greater versatility of application.

L-3 Insight Technology Incorporated offers three options for mounting the M6X to your firearm. The patented Slide-Lock® system allows for instant tool-free mounting and removal by simply sliding the unit onto the rail and locking it into place with the spring-loaded latchbar. The Universal Slide-Lock mount fits most pistols and comes with two latchbars to insure the proper fit, while the 1913 Slide-Lock mount is designed specifically for the true M1913 Mil-Spec Picatinny rail and also comes with two latchbars to insure proper fit.

The Rail-Grabber™ mount fits most rail configurations whether for a pistol, rifle or shotgun. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms."

This thing has no cycling issues. You take it to the range or have to defend your home from a burglar and pull the trigger and it will go bang. I find it shocking that this thing works as perfectly because every dealer was telling me that about 70% of them need a gas plug mod so I was worried, but shes perfect."

The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.Features:Caliber: 22Stock: Wood stockMagazines: 2 magsAction: Semi-AutomaticCaliber: 22 Long RifleBarrel Length: 16.5""33.5"" overall barrel length Capacity: 24+1Trigger: StandardSafety: LeverStock Style: WoodMetal Finish: MatteWooden furniture Hand weathered finishTape and bandana added Gun Weight: 6.75 lbs"

This is some of the finest quality ammunition ever produced. Extremely accurate, reliable and non-corrosive. Mostly made in 1982, but possibility of other years of production.

This is some of the finest quality ammunition ever produced. Extremely accurate, reliable and non-corrosive. Mostly made in 1982, but possibility of other years of production. Comes 10 rounds per box, 6 boxes per brick 8 bricks per case. The Cartridge features a brass case and Berdan primers and Cupronickel jacketed bullets with lead core. Cupronickel is an alloy of copper that contains nickel and strengthening elements, such as iron and manganese and is magnetic so a magnet does stick to the bullet. Bullet weight per the importer is 174 grain.

The 174 grain Full Metal Jacket GP 11 spitzer bullet offered good aerodynamic efficiency and ballistic performance with a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of 0.505 to 0.514 (ballistic coefficients are somewhat debatable). At 2560 ft/s muzzle velocity the standard GP 11 ball bullet retained supersonic velocity up to 875 yards.  Even by contemporary (2007) standards 875 yards typical effective range is quite remarkable for a standard military rifle round.[2]

GP 11 is regarded as highly accurate and well-manufactured ammunition. 

I have at least two 480 round cases and several individual 60 round packages available.

I'm asking $326.00(.68/rd) for each 480 round case.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe EMOD is based on the same rugged and practical design as the original Vltor Modstock - with specific features designed from lessons taken from the modern battlefield. The EMOD Combo Kit comes with the regular EMOD Stock, and a Vltor RE-1 Receiver Extension Tube, Carbine Buffer & Spring Set, and Receiver Endplate & Locknut. The EMOD is about one inch longer than the original Modstock and with the rubber butt plate installed, is about a quarter of an inch longer than the CRANE SCB. The increased length of the EMOD is a major benefit when used on scoped rifles (SPR/DMR), as it increases the available comb for any given length of pull. The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The toe of the buttplate is rolled under; giving the EMOD a superior feel when the weapon is held in the ""out of pocket"" heads up hold. The buttplate is covered with a removable rubber buttpad that is molded over a metal strike plate. The shape of the buttplate and the rubber buttpad give a solid stock purchase in all situations. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This is a match pistol ( I think a Hardball gun ), built at the unit level to shoot Bullseye matches. As near as I can tell, it was made up of Military National Match parts. The Slide, Barrel, and barrel Bushing are all marked with National Match numbers. The internals are assumed to be Colt, since Colt was the one supplying parts to the Government in the 1960s .  As was often customary at the unit level, the pistol was built on an Essex frame. The two "" upsides "" of the Essex frame were that the steel was of a lot better quality than a pistol built in 1945 or earlier, AND the shooter could take the pistol with him to his next duty station. ( he owned the frame, and not the Government ). This pistol is in excellent plus condition. VERY tight frame to slide fit , excellent trigger ( about 3 1/2 pounds).  This pistol was built for accuracy.  Military manual included.  Please feel free to ask questions. FTF in OK.   FFL outside OK"

This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3"" barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XDs, the Mod.2 Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.

Purchased from Kesselrings, I have all original papers, box, lock and recipts from purchase.  Bought this and i have now decided i would rather put this money towards a hunting rifle. Hate to sell it as it was my first 1911 however i do not ever shoot it. I have put less than 200 rounds through this gun and it shows. Appears brand new. I have the original gun tag and everything. When i say like new i really mean that. Cleaned each time this gun was used. Never carried or holstered so there are no wear marks from a holster on the gun. 

Asking 1200.00
I will take trades but i am looking for specific items for a custom rifle. (defiance Actions long action, benchmark barrel...) 
Will also trade for High quality spotting scope (Swaro, Zeiss, Razor, Meopta, Kowa)"

Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.

He asked me to get everything arranged with his FFL and he would send payment, then backed out. Wasted several days of emailing on his ass. Everyone worries about the seller being legit but half the time the buyer backs out and has no courtesy or respect to be honest about it! So please, if you want this rifle, then let's make a deal. If you don't, then don't contact me and make arrangements! 

Brand new never fired, never even racked the bolt, never even moved the safety, Arsenal SLR-104UR Bulgarian Krinkov! I purchased this rifle from KVAR when they had them, and it has sat in my safe this entire time. I wanted to SBR it, but just don't have the funds or time to complete the project. Needs money for family now so this rifle is leaving the safe. I assure you not a single round has been fired, and if you're local you can swing by to see for yourself. One look and you will agree that it is brand new. 

The rifle will come with the original box, Manual/papers.
Original oil can, cleaning rid, cleaning kit, and sling
Everything is still in original plastic, never opened!
Comes with one 30 round brand new magazine, circle 10

I am also including a brand new ALG Defense AKT Trigger still in package for you!!!

I am selling the rifle at the cost I paid, I still have the receipt to show you. If you check Arsenal's website they state these rifles are no longer being imported for an undetermined amount of time due to military focus and filling military contracts. 

I don't want any trades due to needing the money. The asking price is what I paid, the trigger is on the house! I will ship where legal on your dime. Pick up is preferred.

Please READ: I am active duty Marine Coros stationed on Quantico, VA. The rifle is with me here in VA. I am listing this in NC because I own a house in New Bern and MIGHT be able to meet halfway. If not, I can ship to your FFL, guerrilla armament store or any other you pick!"

The 7.5 X 55 cartridge produces a very flat trajectory with approx.. 15-20% more muzzle energy than the standard 308 / 7.62 X 51 cartridge. There at least four sources for this cartridge.

 If you are a collector of military firearms or a hunter looking for rifle that will take almost any North American game, the K31 would be an excellent choice for your collection.

 The rifle shown below is the most accurate rifle I have ever owned. The K31 in original condition is inherently accurate but this rifle has also been pillar bedded and receiver bedded making it capable of even tighter shot groups. It will consistently shoot 1 MOA with Swiss GP11 surplus ammo (I have some of this for sale).

 This rifle was purchased from the importer as “Excellent” grade. It has 90%+ bluing, a bright shiny bore, a 6 round detachable magazine, and an incredibly smooth 3 ½ to 4 # trigger.

 As shown, the rifle is fitted with an easily removable, no mar bipod mount and scope mount made by Swiss St. Marie, and a Bushnell 3-9 scope. These items will be priced separately. Please ask for prices if you are interested.

 The beech stock has been respectively and lightly sanded to preserve all of the original contours and historical markings. It has 7 coats of hand rubbed Tung Oil giving it a beautiful and tough finish.

 I am asking $385 for the rifle stand alone. I will give a package price with the items listed above if you are interested.

 To see this rifle, or for more information, please contact Jim at 218-370-9258 or email mcginnis@boreal.org .

 Thanks for your interest."
