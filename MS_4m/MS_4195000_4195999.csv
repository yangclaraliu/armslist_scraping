Description: Up for auction is a Factory New Chiappa M9-22 .22lr Semi auto Pistol. The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre and is available in two versions, the Standard model featuring ﬁxed front sight and windage adjustable rear sight, and the Tactical model with novak style ﬁber optic sights. The standard model is available with black plastic or wooden grips; the tactical model is supplied with black plastic grips."

Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®
Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty.
These are stripped 11.5"" carbine gas Standard 11595E barrels with gas ports installed and dimpled for a strong gas block installation.
M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM barrels.
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.
Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments

Please understand before you send me anything that I will need you to text me or call. DO NOT EMAIL!! I WILL NOT REPLY TO YOUR EMAILS BECAUSE TOO MUCH SPAM!!! Also understand that my .380 is modified. The barrel has been sanded and polished and the grip has been stippled. I added a green sleeve over the lower of the firearm so that the little gun could sit in my hand better. Like I said the gun has been modified. I have not shot even 100 rounds through it. I also have ocd so it stays perfectly oiled an maintained which means that when I did shoot it I went straight home and cleaned it! One last thing, I have a brand new laser that comes with it. I removed it from the inside of the lower because I didn't want to damage the device or get it dirty. The handgun new was $390.00+tax. With my modifications I estimate the value as around $200.00-$250.00. The only reason I am getting rid of it is because my ex bought it for me and..well...fuck her. I hope to do some business.

The total Hartford, Connecticut made series was 340,000. By the end of the Civil War in December 1865, production had reached 280,000. The 1849 Pocket was the successor to the Baby Dragoon, and the pre-version of the 1851 Navy Revolver. More 1849 Pocket’s were produced by Colt than any other of their percussion handguns. Many variations of the model were manufactured. A complete collection of Pocket’s would include 200 various revolvers. During the Civil War, the revolver was designed to be primarily used by Union officers for up-close personal protection. All 1849 Pocket’s were .31 caliber with 5 or 6 shot cylinders with attached loading levers. All barrels were octagonal with 3, 4, 5, or 6 inch lengths (no barrels were half octagon and half round). The common, standard barrel lengths were 4, 5 or 6 inch (the 6 inch bringing more money). The grips were one piece walnut. The trigger guards were small oval. The grip straps were silver plated brass. The markings include COLTS/PATENT on the left side of the frame, a stagecoach “hold up” scene on the cylinder, .31 cal. on the left side trigger guard frame and address on the top of the barrel. Three basic address barrel markings were used. This particular 1849 Pocket is a  Civil War revolver with a  5” barrel and 6 capacity and has the “one line New York“ address: ADDRESS COL.

More info: Licensed copies of the G3 and HK-91 were produced in Greece by Hellenic Arms Industry or ""EBO"", using factory tooling purchased from Heckler & Koch. A small number of these HK-91 clones, which are functionally and aesthetically identical to the German-made rifles, were imported into America by Springfield Armory, Inc. and sold under the designation SAR-8. These rifles, which ceased being imported in 1994, are not to be confused with later Springfield-made SAR-8 model rifles which feature cast aluminum receivers and are considered of markedly lower quality, being valued at far less than the original Greek models.
