Looking to Sell or Trade my S&W 5903 pistol.  Looking to trade one of my 5903 Smith & Wesson 9mm pistols. This is a non Police agency marked alloy frame stainless slide 9mm pistol with Novack Combat Night Sights (dim). Comes with one LE Marked Factory 15-rd stainless magazine.  Overall it is in Good condition and functions well with 115 and 124 grain ammo. I don't shoot 147 grain bullets, so I have not tested this one for the heavier projectiles. It has the arched grip profile and is very comfortable to carry and shoot. It is a back-up to my primary carry 5903 and it has served that role well, but I really want a Beretta Storm .45 Carbine or a Ruger M77/7.62x39mm rifle, so I am putting this one up for sale or trade. 
********************************************
Looking to sell or trade one of my personal firearms  Trade interests are:  Beretta Storm Carbine in .45 ACP Ruger M77 Mark II All Weather in 7.62x39mm Mossberg MVP Patrol Rifle in 5.56mm Sig Sauer 556 Series Rifles and Pistols  Naturally cash +/- depending on the deal.   This is in my personal collection and as such, I am able to sell via a FTF sale/trade in the Fridley or Burnsville Areas.  I will need to see MN ID and PTC/PTP and will need a signed bill of sale on any firearm transaction, no exceptions."

Brad Southard is an amazingly talented custom knifemaker who specializes in high-performance folder designs. His first collaboration with Spyderco features a ""flipper""--a novel blade-opening device that was pioneered by custom knifemaker Kit Carson. A Carson Flipper consists of a small lever that extends from the base of the Southard's CTS 204P hollow-ground blade and protrudes from the back of the knife's handle when closed. Pulling on it with your index finger creates a tension against the detent mechanism that holds the blade closed. When the detent is overcome, the blade rotates on a special captive ball-bearing pivot system and snaps authoritatively into the open position.

The Southard's handle combines a textured Earth-brown G-10 scale and thick titanium liner on one side with a solid titanium scale on the other. The titanium scale forms the foundation of the knife's sturdy Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism and features a small inlaid G-10 panel that acts as an overtravel stop when releasing the lock mechanism. It is also home to the knife's matching stainless steel clip, which supports right-side tip-up carry.

Offering an amazing synthesis of ergonomics, functionality, and state-of-the-art materials, the Southard is one of the most advanced Spyderco folders ever produced."

It has walnut or rosewood grips with a polished brass trigger guard and a shiny polished stainless steel finish on the rest of the gun which resembles 19th century nickel plating.

You can use Pyrodex pellets or pourable powder in this gun with a powder measure. The cylinder is designed to be easily removed from the gun so multiple cylinders can be used to reload the gun quicker.

Comes with around 100 rounds of SP, 40 rounds of TulAmmo FMJ, 3 mags and knurled compensator. Has some dings on sides of front sight post but I sighted it in to make sure they didn't effect anything and it shoots true and is very accurate. The .357 don't fit my needs right now in terms of a backup gun and the vz2008 I don't really need. No AR's, AK's, hunting rifles, revolvers, 22's, hi-points, lorcin's, bersa's. Really want a HK45c or HK USP45 compact with LEM trigger. Will consider other trades in .45 compact (not subcompact) night sights are also a plus. No 1911s unless it's somewhat compact or something like the sig scorpion carry with the accessory rail. Will consider multi pistol trades as well. Just shoot me an offer, you may have something I haven't thought of that catches my eye! Will need to see a permit and your license to make sure you can legally own a firearm. Will also need to sign a bill of trade so I'll be covered on my end. Unsure of trade value so I'll just throw $1200-$1300 out there. Thanks!"

	Hey everyone, 
	I have a good and probably easy project for you today. This is a Sterling model 400 380 pistol, She has seen much better days and needs some tinkering and a deep cleaning. Usually I would keep this myself, fix it up, and then list it on here for 300-400, but i simply don’t have the time at the moment. I got this in trade a bit back and all it has done is sit on the desk waiting to be brought back to life. It needs some internal tweaking to get it all around working better. It needs some work, but i “believe” it would be an easy fix. However, I have not looked into it very much. Currently it is non-functional. 
	This comes with two mags, two sets of grips, and the gun itself. Need to meet up in norman on this one if possible. I am not firm on the price, but be reasonable with your offers. This is probably and easy fix and would sell for double what I’m asking once polished up and set back “right”. I would also trade it for  certain other pistols as well. 
	Shoot me a text at REDACTED for better pictures or for any questions.
Thanks for looking and have a great day,

I am located in Northwest Indiana and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility regarding potentially traveling 'half-way' to meet up.  If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way if further out, depending on quantity purchased vs the cost and time required in traveling.

As of initial posting, there are QTY 10x battle packs available for sale.  I will certainly entertain offers and/or negotiate a price break in the event buyer is interested in purchase of QTY 4x (or more).

I am asking $120 per 200 round sealed battle pack- this is some of the nicer surplus ammo that can be had (if you can find it at all, given current demand/availability).

Specifics on surplus German NATO 7.62x51 (.308) ammunition:

+ Manufactured in 1990’s

+ Packed 20rds in a box, 200rds (10 boxes) in a sealed waterproof PVC battlepack

I am located in Northwest Indiana and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility regarding potentially traveling 'half-way' to meet up. If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way if further out, depending on quantity purchased vs the cost and time required in traveling.

As of initial posting, there are QTY 7x battle packs available for sale. I will certainly entertain offers and/or negotiate a price break in the event buyer is interested in purchase of QTY 4x (or more).

Thank you for your time in looking as well as your consideration. Happy shooting- Cheers!"

I have a super hard to find Glock model 27. It's a Gen 3 in black with 2 mags and an Uncle Mike's Holster. These Glocks are getting really scarce. It's got a super low round count. I will throw in 16 rounds for the right deal. Only asking $995 cash, will consider trading for a perfect original Colt Delta Elite 10mm plus cash on your end. Will post pics later.

Must have copies of SS card, 3 pieces of picture ID, CPP, and birth cert. for my personal records. You must meet me at an FFL and pay for both transaction fees and my gas."

My max is $500
I would rather not buy a revolver, but I will buy if the price is fair enough.

I am 19 years old and I would like to purchase a firearm.
I have a complete understanding on how to correctly use a firearm.
The reasoning I would like to buy is because I am moving in with my divorced sister and her two children. Her baby sitter is having medical problems and she needs someone to take care of the kids while she is at work and he recovers, if he recovers at all. 

She lives in a rather shady area and I would feel a lot more comfortable if I had some home defense. 

I hope you are willing to sell your handgun to me despite my age. 

I would like to buy this tomorrow ( 3/21/15 ) if possible.
Call or text me at REDACTED if you need to discuss at all.

This rifle, with serial number 111400, was manufactured in 1901, the last year for the case-hardened receiver. The serial number only appears on the lower tang, which is correct for this rifle. It has a 24 inch octagon barrel. Although most of the case-hardening has worn off the receiver, there are still traces of it in protected areas, as around the take-down screw. The finish on the rest of the rifle is blue, fading to a brown patina. It has a good clean bore, with well-defined lands and grooves; although the bore is fairly bright, there appear to be some areas of very light roughness or pitting. The lettering is sharp and easily readable. The wood shows normal dings, dents, and scratches from use, but is not cracked or broken. The wood is proud to the metal and has a fair amount of original finish. There is one very small and old chip off the bottom of one of the rings on the slide handle. Although the front sight appears original, the rear sight was replaced with a King sight. One small screw on top the bolt is missing. The mechanics seem fine, but I have not fired this rifle.

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

Prior to Sabre top brass getting in hot water they were one of a few suppliers to the United States government. If you see U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world using a Browning M2 machine gun, 7.62 mm mini-gun or M16 rifle, chances are very good you’re seeing Sabre products in action. Sabre maintained very high standards allowing them to retain ISO 9001-2008 certification, a rarity in the industry.

Overall it is in pretty nice condition & good shooting rifle. It still has the rifle sights which most are removed when scoping them. The scope & rings are being put onto another gun. The stock has some ink on it & I cannot figure out what he was trying to do. I have tried to remove it but I have not tried any solvents because it might damage finish. The stock appears to be a bit oversized at the frame. Length of pull with pad is about 13.25 to 13.5. This is a great deer gun for both walking & stand hunting. I can ship it insured for $35 from me or $45 from a FFL. It is listed for a fair price & no I will not take the standard low ball offers as I do not have to sell it. I have been thinning the herd over the last couple months.

I bought this rifle in November one week before deer season and shot my first deer with it. I purchased it at Village Tactical in Oklahoma City.  This is an EXCELLENT rifle for the price. I have shot a 1.5"" group with a Vortex  Scope (not included) at 100 yards. 

I put the original scope it came with from the factory and sighted it at 25 yards. Its a 3-9x40. I looked it up and I think it is a Bushnell although it has no markings on it.

I had the bolt buffed to smooth out the action. It shoots great. If you want a hard case and a shoulder strap I will sell it all for $300.

Everything is brand new & never used.  I thought a few years back I would like to get back into playing paintball but my injuries (5 ruptured disc in my lower back) are such that it just is never going to happen now so my loss is your gain.  I spent dozens & dozens of hours researching & searching for the items listed here.

This would be a ‘perfect’ complete kit for someone who wanted to try Paintball out & get hooked.  It has nearly everything.  Adding up my costs I have slightly over $1550 invested in just parts alone not counting labor.

I’m of a mindset not to be running all around but to camouflage myself & pick off the enemy paintball team from a distance where their paintball markers don’t have the same accurate range as mine!  To that ideology I have built this kit.

I do have a few extra pictures I can provide if needed.

Sorry but I can’t answer any questions about this gear.  Everything I know I’ve listed.  Will not separate.  Local sales & cash only & sold as-is & not interested in any trades.

Made by Armi Sport of Italy
Serial Number S133XX
The model 1861 Springfield rifled musket was the principal firearm of the Civil War. By the end of 1863, most Federal infantrymen were armed with either this musket or the Enfield. This piece features a one-piece forged barrel; military style sights; steel butt plate, trigger guard and barrel bands; and a swelled ramrod like the original muskets. The lock is marked ""1861 Springfield"" with an eagle. ONE PIECE AMERICAN WALNUT OIL FINISHED STOCK.
I have had this rifle musket for a few years and it has fought a great many battles but is in overall excellent condition. I take good care of my weapons, cleaned after every use every day and when I mean cleaned…taken apart and cleaned each time.  So many folks ruin a gun by just washing out the barrel.
I have never had any issues with not firing.  Keeping one clean helps prevent misfires.  It comes with a good leather sling and canvas cover.

Designed by Swedes for Egyptian Military back
in 60's, before they went to the Maadi AK47.  Extreme Swedish tolerances/accuracy.  Removable 10rd clip (can order
20rd clip for it).  Supremely accurate MOA rifle in a cartridge that has severe knockdown power.  In Colorado with this rifle I dropped a mature bull Elk at 300m Known as Egypt's M14.  Comes with forward mounted scout base.
Expensive Remington Corelokt 170gr 8mm hunting ammo . Surplus ammo for it comes to 40 cents/rd.   Also gave it a snow camo stock finish.  Very functional and
sharp looking stock flash suppressor/muzzle break.  Adj. Gas System (have tool). This rifle at 100m
holds MOA, at 300m holds 4 MOA Now that's Swedish all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!  Alot of gunsmiths feel this is actually built better than the Springfield M14.  Let me tell you, anything
designed by the famous Carl Gustufson's Rifle Factory in Sweden is serious.
Century Arms brought some of these rare rifles in but they are HARD to come by because real gun enthusiasts know their quality/accuracy.  Century kept their
paws off of them and the Hakim is 100% original Swedish parts.  (920) 918-2154 or
(920) 458-1305.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!1"
