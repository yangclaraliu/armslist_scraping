5,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4379005,For Sale:  Forehand & Wadsworth .32 Hammerless Top-Break Revolver - Antique for Display or Restoration,"Eastside/Taylors, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 55,"Listed On: Thursday, July 9, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a non-functioning antique revolver!

Forehand & Wadsworth .32 (S&W Black Powder-Only) Hammerless Top-Break Revolver

This revolver was made sometime between 1888 and 1890. The model was introduced in 1888, the company name changed sometime in 1890 to ""Forehand Arms Co."" after which the brand marking on the firearms changed to match. This allows for narrowing down the manufacture date to a short period. 
The matching ""1926"" stamping viewable on both the cylinder and bottom of the frame/handle of this revolver is the serial number, not a manufacturing date, for those curious. And here again, the S/N is a fairly low number.

As-is this gun would make a nice display piece or wall hanger. It's got the surface wear to show it was a well used gun in its' day. This is a steel gun with nickel plate finnish and an after-market stained wood hand grip of unknown age and origin. All of the rusty areas of the gun are purely from the nickel having been worn off from handling over the last one hundred and twenty-five years.

Worth Noting:
- This is a non-functioning revolver!
- If in working condition, which it isn't, this would only fire gun powder based .32 cartridges. The ""grain"" combustible in modern ammunition creates a great deal more pressure than gun powder and could damage the revolver and cause injury to the user.

Built around Beretta® PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm Semi-Auto Pistol delivers firepower that can be customized for different shooters. Utilizing Beretta's strongest pistol action, the PX4 Storm's unique rotating barrel and locking system reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. Beretta keeps the PX4 Storm light with a corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target."

I would rather trade than sell... but if I cant find what i want to trade; then I will sell.  

---Please read bottom list of Items NOT wanted for Trade---

1. SAIGA   (ak variant) .223 in Kushnapup stock with 16"" barrel.  $1,000

It is   not   altered or converted accept for the muzzle break (threaded in 14/1 LH ""standard ak47"").  The Kushnapup stock calls for the butt stock tangs to be hack sawed off, I instead; added a 1'' spacer ( from original Saiga stock) to keep them intact in case I wanted to put stock back on or have it converted for pistol grip.  so... the Length Of Pull is about 16''.  I am only 5'8"" and is comfortable.

SAIGA Items that are included... 2 - 30 round pro mags and 4 - 20 round SGM Tactical mags.  6 slot (ar style) muzzle break and a $48 multiple (red/green) reticle sight.  I can also Include misc. original factory accessories that came to me with the saiga... forgrip, ect.

The 30 round pro mags are a pain to insert due to the kushnapup grip, the 20's load perfectly and leave bolt open when empty.

Rifle is worth about $600 and depending on where you go kushnapup stock about $275, promag 30's $10 each, sgm 20's about $30 each. reticule at $48, muzzle break at $25.

I also still have the thread die and thread guide if you want too... (1/2'' 14/1 LH, about $50? value (from CNC warrior).

2. Walther 22lr UZI ... Factory new, un altered and unfired!!!  I havent had the time to hit the range and in all honesty; i'm not that excited to shoot it?!  I bought it thinking my son would love it but... lol he asked wheres the CZ? $300 comes with 1 - 20 round mag and hard case.

3. Hi-point 995 (9mm) in ATI stock . $300

Bought it in the ugly old ""planet of the apes stock"". put it in the ATI stock and added the Hi-point (clamp on) muzzle break and another $48 red/green multiple reticle.  also added some picatinny rails to forend and breach roof.  I still have the original rear iron sight and Planet of the apes stock to include, also have 1 - 10 round mag and 2 - 15  round mags.

Will add or subtract cash or ammo if needed/wanted and the non specific items I can keep if you don't want... Red dot reticles."

This Advanced Armament Corp. AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly in 300 AAC Blackout is a pin-on, ready-to-shoot top end for use with any standard AR-15 lower receiver. The Mil-Spec 4150 chrome moly vanadium steel barrel comes equipped with 1 in 7"" twist rifling, M4 feed ramps, a low profile steel gas block, and is finished inside and out with a protective black nitride treatment for superior durability and corrosion resistance. The muzzle is threaded with a 5/8""-24 pitch for easy installation of a silencer, and is topped off with an effective AAC 51T Blackout flash hider. 

The upper features a forged M4-Style flat-top receiver onto which a Knight's Armament free floating URX 3.1 Quad Rail System is rigidly attached. The heat-treated, full auto bolt carrier is finished in a slick Nickel Boron coating, and comes equipped with a properly-staked gas key and Carpenter 158 steel bolt assembly.

This 16"" 300 Blackout upper utilizes the versatile carbine length gas system, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure.

The SIG 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol.  Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.
Without a doubt the best fitting, most accurate and reliable 1911 platform that you can buy for my price of $875. Need BOS and a FTF tranaction to AL resident of legal age."

I'd like to dabble with another M&P, but am specifically looking for a long slide (9L, PRO series, M&P45).

The G17 in question sports factory sights, and is no safe sloth. The slide has a fair amount of cosmetic wear from its time as a duty gun. Since then, I've been using it for USPSA and 3Gun matches. It's currently sporting a laser-cut skateboard tape jacket on the grip, but I can obviously remove that at your request. It's a Glock 17, it's ugly, and it shoots well. I think that really just about covers it all.

To sweeten the pot, I will include my Safariland competition holster, as well as a plain old Fobus GL2. Willing to add in some cash, if it's a decent offer on a trade. 

Must go through FFL, per State and site regulations. I'll pay my BGC, you pay yours in the event of any prospective sales/trades. Simple enough. I'm in WR, willing to meet anywhere between Thornton/Northglenn and Lakewood. Golden to Denver."

If you didn't already know, this rifle is manufactured with ""RF85"" in the metal and does not require lubrication when operating. I still oil the bolt just out of habit and extreme care for my firearms but it has always been run indoors so there is no worry about sand and dirt damaging any internals.

I believe this bayonet to be an early example of a P14 bayonet, which means that it would also fit the American P17 and all models of trench shotgun from that era. The bayonet is in very good condition, as it still exhibits much of the original bluing, has the original grips and all original hardware. It has not been refinished or cleaned up, and has not been sharpened. The bayonet has the Broad Arrow Marking (British Manufacture), Crown over 33 over Large ""A"" (acceptance), and 1913 over 10-16 over Large ""W"" (manufacture date). See pictures for condition and proof marks. I am not an expert on this item, so if you happen to know more than me please feel free to share. I personally imported this bayonet, hand carried back from the middle east. More pictures on request, I am selling the other two bayonets separately.

PC4 Carbine and P94 Pistol with interchangeable magazines

Includes:
2 Original Ruger 12 Rd Mags
6 Original Ruger 20 Rd Mags

The PC4 Carbine:
MSRP: $749
The PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol (see internal ballistics). The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol.

The Carbine has some unique design features. The action is a simple blowback design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of 9mm and .40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well. Another unique feature is the bolt lock. Since blowback guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt so that it can move for firing or clearing the action.

The P94 Pistol:
The Ruger P94 Series is a Double Action and Single Action pistol that shoots .40 S&W ammunition.

Very nice 1911 with classic styling. Includes factory case and two factory magazines. $549 The Para USA 1911 GI Expert Wild Bunch is a semi-automatic large-framed pistol chambered in .45 ACP. The GI Expert Wild Bunch was designed to meet the requirements for use in the Single Action Shooting Society’s “Wild Bunch Action Shooting” competitions, which mandates that guns used to compete are as historically accurate as possible. As such, the Wild Bunch features a traditional spur hammer, a solid trigger, a barrel with no integral ramp, and no internal guide rod. In addition,  the two 7-round magazines with provided with the pistol have flat, welded floor plates.The GI Expert Wild Bunch uses a simple and effective recoil-driven action where the expanding gas produced from burning gunpowder is used to drive the slide back in turn eject the spent casing and load a fresh round on the return. It has a grip safety, which deactivates when a shooter wraps their hand around it, a manual safety, and a metal frame, which helps reduce recoil.Para USA recommends the Wild Bunch for use in SASS “Wild Bunch Action Shooting” competitions.Caliber:           .45 ACPGrip:    Checkered woodCapacity:         7Sights:            3-dot fixed sightsFeatures:        ""Wild Bunch"" engraved on slideAction:            Semi-autoMaterial/Finish:        Steel/matte blackSize:    LargeTrigger:           Single-actionWeight:           2.4 poundsBarrel Length:           5""Length:           8.5""Height:           5.75""MSRP $789.00The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.comNote: We DO NOT accept checks or money orders.

I’ve shoot about 700 rounds through the gun and it is good and broke in. I used this gun for long range, hate to get rid of it, but looking to maybe go a different direction. I used this gun when taking a long range class and could bang steel MOA targets consistently out to 800 yards. When we chrono’d the gun with Dallas Reloads 168gr AMax bulk loads we were getting an average of 2510 FPS out of 10 shots. Not bad for a shorty 16” barrel. All of my dope data will be included with the gun from 200 out to 800 yards for what MIL holds to use. It is also taped on the stock. Everything in pictures will be included in sale except bipod, suppressor, and suppressor mount. The suppressor mount will be replaced with a competition muzzle brake. I have changed the stock Magpul ACS-L stock to a long range fully adjustable Luth-AR MBA stock. It is adjustable for length of pull and comb. The gun comes with the rifle buffer tube, spring and buffer installed with the Luth-AR stock, but will also come with the carbine buffer tube, spring and buffer so you can switch it to a collapsible stock if you want. Any AR15 milspec butt stock will work.

Below is a breakdown of what is included in sale. I need to get $2350 out of the gun in order to build what I’m wanting. Only partial trade I’ll consider is a Mossberg MVP LR in 308 plus cash.

If you have any questions feel free to call us, shoot us an email, or stop in and check out our large selection of NEW & USED firearms! The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 WinchesterBarrel Length: 16.1"", 20""Weight (unloaded): 9.5lbs (16.1""), 11.25lbs (20"")Length (overall): 40.8"" (16.1""), 41.5""(20"")Rate of Fire: 55 RPM (Sustained ROF)Rifling: 1/10"" RH; 1/11.25"" RH (Optional)Stock/Pistol Grip: 16"" B5 Systems SOPMOD, 20"" Magpul PRS/Magpul MIADSights: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and RearMagazine: Magpul 20 rd.

The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights. The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm. Comes with two 18 round magazines, poly holster, paddle attachment, belt attachment, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty.

This case is molded from ultra-high density molecular weight polyethylene (the material specified by the U.S. military for cases and containers) and was designed to carry four rifles with SKB's trademarked ""bunk-bed"" padding and divider protection system. The 2SKB-5014 features SKB's unique Perfect Match Valance Bending System for a perfect seal. This case is weather resistant, stackable, and features bumper protected hardware and solid die case zinc locks, built-in Polymer wheels, and both carry and tow handles for easy transport. 

I bought this several years ago because it was the ONLY case I could find that would REALLY carry 4 scoped rifles. The divider foam SKB provided was very thick and made it a little difficult to close so I cut a second piece of thinner foam which is included along with the original. One one occasion I think I actually managed to get 5 long guns, a handgun or two, and some other stuff in this beast. 

This is a BIG case. Approximately 54.5 x 19 (including handle) x 8.5 (including wheels). Dimensions on Amazon are NOT correct. 

I used it maybe 10 times and it has just been sitting here gathering dust for several years. There are some scuffs and scrapes on the outside and a couple VERY small divots in the foam. Overall 9.5/10 condition.

I DO NOT HAVE THE KEY!!!!!!!!! Lost it a long time ago and never pursued trying to get another one because the thing was more or less never out of my sight unless it was locked in the truck. I'm pretty sure you can get one from SKB.
