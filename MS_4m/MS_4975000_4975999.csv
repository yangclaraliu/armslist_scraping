The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. The all steel Witness can be converted to .22, 9mm, .357 Sig, or .40 S&W by the purchase of the conversion kit. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling.
The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

Nearly all components are interchangeable with CZ.

The Tanfolio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfolio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling.
The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfolio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

I would consider trades for the 11K value with preferences toward snake guns.  Most people have the 6"" Kodiak and the 6"" Grizzly, however, very few have this gem.

Aimpoint sights are designed for the ”two eyes open” method of sighting, which greatly enhances situational awareness and target acquisition speed. Thanks to the parallax-free design, the dot follows the movement of the user’s eye while remaining fixed on the target, eliminating any need for centering. Further, the sight allows for unlimited eye-relief.
The CompM3 is compatible with 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation night vision devices, while the other sights are optimized for applications, which do not require night vision compatibility."

I got this a few months ago and have used it on clays for a box full and took it hunting twice. Maybe fired total of 30 times. Never a hiccup and very nice fast and smooth action. Fiber optic end sight really catches the light and your eye. Box says ""RAPTOR HP NWTF"".

I couldn't find any of these on the net for sale, not even with this walnut stock, so I called TriStar. These are not catalog guns as they are ""exclusives"" to NWFT. I was told that it was part of a special order of 200 and the gun was made in 2014. The only thing they could tell me was that they do not have MSRP's on exclusives and that the options on the gun are not like Raptors that can be bought from tristar. The stocks have a cut checkering and design that are only found on these and some special order Ducks Unlimited. They are shiny gloss finished.

The other elements of the shotgun are: 3"" gas operated system with removable choke system that uses Beretta Mobile threads. Three chokes are included (IC, M, F) with a tool in a container. Has a maunal EZ load magazine cutoff, vent rib w/matted sight plain, fiber optic sight, 5 round magazine (plug included if needed).

The barrel has a 3"" chrome lined chamber and the barrel is also chrome lined. The gun weighs just under 7 pounds unloaded.

Here is how the manual explains the action: Gas operated semi-automatic. Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber and cycling new shell from magazine in to the chamber. If operator desires to unload the chamber only, slightly push lifter (little switch on side of trigger) up and open action. This cuts the magazine off from cycling a new shell while unloading the chamber. Chamber will remain closed.

Safety: primary safety on backside of trigger guard. When engaged, blocks trigger, hammer lever and hammer.

Magazine: Tubular, bottom loading, plug is included and installs and uninstalls by unscrewing mag cap and removing or inserting plug.

This is a beautiful gun and is just as light and mobile as a Browning Light 20. I have tons of pics of unboxing it and putting it together and will either put it back in the box or whatever. Breaks down in a few seconds. Internals are very solid and either SS or alunminum. Can email more pics.

I just received an early Christmas present which is also a 12 and a family heirloom that I will be using for birds like I did as a kid, so don't need this gun. It is beautiful and built really well. The internals are as solid and nice as a Browning Gold Hunter I had years ago.
