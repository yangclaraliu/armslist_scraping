The PMAG D-60 is a durable, lightweight, highly reliable 60-round 5.56x45 NATO/.223 Remington polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. With a larger capacity than previous PMAGs, the PMAG D-60 gives the shooter 60 rounds of ammunition, effectively allowing the same round count as two standard capacity 30-round magazines without requiring a critical reload. The unique drum configuration keeps the height of the magazine manageable as well, allowing prone firing and easier storage. Features a paint pen dot matrix for easy marking and the MagLevel system for instant capacity indication. Compatible with a wide range of NATO firearms such as the M4, M16, SCAR MK16/16S, HK416, MR556, M27 IAR, and others."

This Glock 17 RTF2 FDE Vickers Tactical. This was a collaborative work with combat veteran and face of the tactical firearms industry Larry Vickers. Keeping the tactical shooter in mind, he designed this pistol with everything it would need to take it from “pretty good” to become “the best.” After taking the basic 3rd generation Glock chambered in 9mm, this weapon received Wilson Combat VT sights to ensure shooters would have perfect accuracy when it matters most. Next, Vickers slapped on an exclusive slide stop and magazine release. This gun has had less than 300 rounds put through it. It is a safe queen and in excellent condition. I have two mags with the floor plates and the case. I do not have the Wilson combat or the vickers stickers any more sorry, but do have everything else that it came with. I paid $750 over the summer and I bought it new I am asking Reduced $650 or best offer. I am not in a rush. The picture is a stock pic. I can send you actual pics if you would like.

I know that's hard to believe but it's the truth. The finish on the barrel hood will bear that out. The finish on this pistol is the older type of tennifer that is much more durable than the finish on recently produced Glocks. I had intended to keep it but I found something that I would rather have. Earlier today I installed a brand new set of TruGlo TFX sights. I also installed a Glock OEM 3.5 lb connector, Glock OEM extended slide stop and mag release, and a longer takedown lever. I also have a stainless guide rod and steel pins on the way that should be delivered in the next day or two. The gun comes with everything that it originally came with including a 3rd factory magazine. I'm located in Orland Park and the price is $525.00 for the complete package."

Now I know what you are thinking, this is a Taurus AND a .40. And I hear ya, however these were made on surplus Beretta machines. I'm a gun snob myself so I usually turn my nose up at Taurus, but I've found they make 3 decent guns: their revolvers, their 1911, and their M9 clones. As far as it being a .40, I'm a 9mm guy myself but during the last panic you could not find a box of 9mm to save your life, while .40 was stacked high at every walmart, so it makes sense to diversify your holdings with a cheap .40 S&W so you can at least hit the range the next time the democrats decide to attempt to infringe on our rights. Now that I'm done being a used car salesman, this comes with everything you see.  Really nice trigger, every bit as crisp as my Beretta 92FS and only about a pound heavier when they are both in single action mode. Double action feels nearly identical."

I am left handed and and it kicks the first round of every clip in to my forehead, leaving a nice deep cut.  I have fired 3 clips off and it has happened 3 times.  24 rounds have been fired through it with no issues other than me being repeatedly pinged with brass.  Its really discouraging because i have wanted this rifle for years.. Got it, and spent another several months treating the stock wIth linseed oil.  The stock looks amazing and the rifle cycles perfectly.  If you check the cmp website, you can get additional info.  It has a new criterion barrel and all the parts are original but have been repakerized.  It has the hra action in the middle 5 million which puts it around the 1950s.  Internals are a mix of springfield and hra.

I am very firm on the price since thats what i paid from the cmp, plus 50$ shipping, and a 6 month wait.  I have some 147 grain .308 ammo i can include wIth it for an additional cost.

Comes wIth case, rifle, 3 enbloc clips, gi sling, and cmp certificate

You could always order your own from the cmp, but there are a lot of requirements to be able to order through them, as well as shipping.  With this one, you get it immediately although it has had 24 entire rounds through it, plus two extra enbloc clips ( not expensive) and the momths of work that went in to the new stock to make it look right instead of pale brown.  I can send more pictures by request, but it would be much better to meet in person and let you see it.  I have heard about putting tape and foam around the deflector to stop brass from hitting in the face, but theres no way im going to bubba a garand.  Nor am i going to let a rifle sit in the safe and not get used.

It is a 4+1 capacity semi-automatic with fixed modified choke. Stocks are original American walnut and in good condition, and bluing on steel parts is in good condition as well.  These guns improved on the original Remington model 11 (based on the Browning A-5). This is not a ""collector"" quality piece, but if you are looking for a shotgun that cycles everything and goes bang every time for hunting or busting clays, this is your gun. Butt-stock pad might need replacement soon, but that is the only thing ""wrong"" with this shotgun. Functions flawlessly.

$580 firm in cash just for the scope or higher in trade, not worth selling for any less.  The mount and rings are NOT included.  I also have a set of like new Leupold Alumina lens caps(very nice) that fit this scope I will sell for $80 more($100 new) or I'll keep them as I'm sure I will be getting another 50mm Leupold in the future.  If someone wants the M1A Bassett low mount, I will sell it for $110 shipped, it sells for $160 new.  Keeping the rings.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland/Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

$1,300 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  Will also sell just the rifle for $1,100, the scope for $150 and I'll keep the mount.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

$480 firm in cash or higher in trade.  I also have a Fobus Evolution paddle OWB holster and a Kydex IWB holster I can add for more $$$ or if you have something of higher value you want to offer.  I also have a little .45LC and .410 ammo I can add as well, depending on what you have, just be specific on what you want to do.  If you don't mention any of the extras then I will assume you only want the Judge.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

It has an equally vintage red field 3-9x40 scope with German post reticle and a red field dove tail scope mount. The gun is an 8/10. I purchased it from the original owner who had hunted with it a little and said that he had probly only fired the gun 20-30 times. I shot it 5 times myself and his story holds true. You really don't need to shoot this gun unless you're sighting in the scope or shooting it at an animal. Your shoulder couldn't take much abuse from this mammoth! The gun shoots perfectly and has no feed issues. I have over $350 in ammo that I've collected/reloaded that will be included as well as a set of rcbs reloading dies. The ammo is of mixed variety. I have some factory ammo and some reloaded. The reloaded ammo is 180gr nosler hunting ballistic tip(green tips). Factory ammo I have Barnes 180gr tsx, weatherby 180gr partition. Total of 95rds. Probly more than you'd ever shoot in your lifetime. Ammo is in an mtm case gard also. I'm not looking for trades just selling outright. Only reason I'm selling is because I have a savage 300wsm and I really don't need 2 big magnum .30's. Don't have to sell so don't lowball me.

Above link is completely informative( please remember it was written several years go)
This is an SN Romarm AK 74 with a post 4x24 optic.  This is chambered in 5.56 X 45 and was issued to the Romanian Army for joint NATO maneuvers . The scope is based on the  Soviet Dragunov set-up and the weapon looks like the bad guys sniper rifle in American Sniper.  The optics are back lit but I have never installed a battery and do not know if they function.  This is a great collectible, conversation starter, and survival rifle.  It functions and shoots flawlessly.  4 mags. It is 75 to 85 % condition due to military use.  Scratches etc but nothing is cracked or broken.  Please no dreamers. Over 21, ID, ccl or FFL transfer.

$1,200 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  This set-up runs around $1,400 at places that have them in stock right now, plus any fees, so that's $200 off a like new scope and rifle set-up.  Not really wanting to split up right now, but may consider it, depending on what you are offering, so please be specific on what you are wanting to do.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less interested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland/Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

The Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.

I also have 20 boxes of quality ammo, 6 boxes(110rds. to be exact) of Remington 140gr. Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded PSP and 14 boxes(270rds. to be exact) of Federal 140gr. Vital Shock Nosler Accubond.  Can't find this 140gr. ammo in stock anywhere right now, so this may be it??, but when it was available the Remington sold for around $30ea. and the Federal was $35+ea.  Thought this would be the perfect caliber for a bolt-action, but have not done anything with it yet, just prefer my semi-autos.

$1,200 in cash for everything or will consider trades.  The above would run $1,400-$1,500 if purchased new before any tax, shipping and/or FFL fees.  Prefer to sell as a package, but I will also consider selling the rifle by itself or the rifle and some of the ammo, just be specific on what you are wanting to do.  Not really wanting to sell just the ammo before the rifle sells, but may consider it, depending on what you are offering, so again, please be specific.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

$450 firm or a little higher in trade. 

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

So as you can see the gun used to have stippling which was terrible from the prior owner and I removed it as best as I could. I’ve adjusted the price to reflect this cosmetic issue. If you don’t like the appearance just remember; it’s a carry piece, nobody’s going to see it. If you believe in function over form then it’s certainly not a bad setup.

So we have here the M&P 40c (valued $550 new), installed APEX trigger (valued $230 with service), two spare mags in addition to the two that are included with the kit for a total of four mags (valued $41 each new), CrossBreed IWB Holster (valued $60 new), BlackHawk! SERPA holster and double mag holster (valued $45 new), and a leather OWB holster (valued $20 new)

So total this is valued at $987 new, give or take. Obviously this is used, and as mentioned the exterior of the gun leaves a lot to be desired.

Asking for $650 for the whole kit or a trade. All State and Federal laws will be followed. Buyer/trader must have valid LTC and we will be doing a background check. Thank you!"

These bullets have never been offered by Remington as a separate component and are the same high-quality frangible bullets that are used in Remington's popular CTF lead free range ammo. MidwayUSA is excited to offer this Exclusive, One Time Buy to our customers at a fraction of the cost of other lead free frangible bullets on the market.
Remington CTF Bullets are an excellent lead free bullet choice for target shooting at both indoor and outdoor ranges. CTF bullets are jacketless copper tin frangible bullets that disintegrate into powder fragments upon impact with hard targets without splash back, thus dramatically reducing the hazard to bystanders. They are formed from copper and tin blended powder using a compaction and sintering process that eliminates the need for a jacket or plating on the outside of the bullet. This design prolongs the life of backstops and target traps."

Like new. Very few rounds put through it. Making room, needs to go. Comes with everything you see, including holster.

From the manufacturer:
Wilson Combat®’s Professional series of pistols are some of the most popular we build. The Elite Professional is the newest member of that series. It includes the best of several of our models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on our Tactical Elite. With this barrel, we have reduced the slide length by a full inch, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The frame is the comfortable full size you’re accustomed to in your traditional 1911 pistol, but with the shorter slide the result is excellent concealability. An excellent choice for daily carry, The Elite Professional provides the rapid shot-to-shot recovery and reduced recoil one would expect from a compensated pistol. You can be sure of 100% functional reliability, fast handling, rapid shot-to-shot recovery and accuracy when you need it.

When Bass Pro Shop will charge you $20 to have someone with no experience run your blade through an electric sharpener and take years of metal off your blade, why not have someone who has several years of hand sharpening experience and an intense attention to detail to handle your blades? Not only will you pay about the same, but your blades will be exponentially sharper (scary sharp), will look very aesthetically pleasing, and all with as little metal removal as possible. I'm an engineer in my day job and am naturally OCD about things, including my and your blades so I highly recommend not leaving your good knives with someone with a powered sharpener at the gun show or flea market.

I take all folding and fixed blade knives to a 30,000 grit, mirror-polished finish that is beyond the definition of scary sharp---hair-whittling actually. Kitchen knives are finished at 1000 grit for a toothier edge better suited for cutting food. (Some professional chefs do prefer a finer edge and can be done by request) 

Folding and fixed blade knives:
5"" and under - $25
Over 5"" - $35

Kitchen knives:
Standard 1000 grit - $2 per inch
""The Works"" 30k grit - $5 per inch

Tanto blades or odd, double bevel knives:
$10 adder per blade

Yes, I do sharpen serrated blades. Things I do not sharpen include hair cutting shears and woodworking tools since I'm frequently asked about those. 

Rates above can vary on a per case basis based on if the blade is very damaged or if there are special requests. 

Similar mail-in services online can cost over $50 for one knife plus the cost of shipping and days or weeks being without your knives. I'm centrally located in the Hoover area and can arrange drop-off and pickup of your knives, always in a timely fashion and with the utmost care. Feel free to email me with any questions, and if you don't live locally, ask about sharpening by mail."

Hello all, 
	I have a used but decent shape great little carry pistol for sale/trade. This is a Kel Tec PF9. It comes with the factory case, the users manual, the gun itself, one mag, flush fit magazine base, finger extension magazine base, rubber slip over grip, a pocket holster, and a magazine worth of Speer Personal Defense Rounds. This is in used shape and shows normal carry signs of wear, and the sights appear to have had red dot paint applied to them, but they work. This would be a great starter gun or small gun for potent self defense. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 
	Would also consider trades for certain full size/double stack 9mm pistols, cheaper 1911s in 45 ACP, possibly others. May be willing to add cash/extras for the right trade. Honestly, shoot me  text at REDACTED and we can go from there. No black powder or 40s unless heavily in my favor. No Bows. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,
