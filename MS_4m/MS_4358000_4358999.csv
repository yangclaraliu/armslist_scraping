Key Features:
•	BDC 600 Reticle: Developed specifically for the trajectory of the 0.223 Rem 5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet, the new BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards.
•	Ultra ClearCoat Optical System: Bright, sharp, incredibly flat sight picture and light transmission up to 92 percent.
•	Eye Box technology: Impressive four-times zoom range and four inches of constant, non-critical eye relief. A large ocular lens delivers a bright, high-resolution sight picture.
•	Zero-Reset Turrets: Simplify field adjustments--simply sight in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your ""zero"", and re-engage.
•	Smooth Zoom Control: Magnification reference numbers are viewable from the shooters position.
•	Side Focus Parallax Adjustment
•	Quick Focus Eyepiece: This allows the shooter to bring the reticle into sharp focus quickly.
•	1/4 MOA Reticle Adjustments with easy-to use positive click adjustments to get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting even with recoil.
•	One-piece Main Body Tube: This tube construction reduces weight while maximizing strength and durability.
•	Enhanced Mount Ring Spacing: With enhanced ring mount spacing--hunters can mount the scope on virtually any rifle action regardless of caliber--including magnum-length actions.
•	M-223 Mount: Fits Picatinny rails found on most flattop ARs. Lightweight alloy construction with built-in 20-MOA incline to maximize elevation for extreme long range shooting.
•	ARD Removable Anti-Reflective Device: Eliminates objective lens glare.

I'm only listing it for sale/Trade because I found a couple glock I'm interested otherwise I would prefer to trade.

The 43 has 63 flawless rounds fired 50 fmj and 13 jhp, there are a couple marks on top of the chamber from the slide, other than that it's like new. I picked up a Gen 4 26 last week and I prefer it to the 43,  there is nothing wrong with the 43, the 26 just fits my hand better. The 43 also fits well I my Don Hume IWB Holster. I have owned or handled pf9, CM 9, pm 9, xds 9,  shield  and a few other comparable single stack 9mm and the 43 fits my hands best. Just my opinion. 

Cash price $550 or best reasonable offer. 

Straight trade for Gen 4 26, 19, 23 with all that they come with from the factory,  I'll add cash or something else if it comes with caliber conversion barrels. Gen 4 32 if it comes with either a 9mm or 40s&w conversion barrel, if it comes with both I'll add some cash or something else. 

The only reason I'm interested in the next two is because I already have a 9mm conversion barrel otherwise I'm not a big fan of the 40s&w

The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jammingand stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. Beretta's exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish, and the reversible magazine release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. The 92 FS pistol is themost tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy.             SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num:       JS92F300M   Category:           PISTOLS                       Type                :PistolAction              :Single/DoubleCaliber             :9mmBarrel Length       :4.9""Capacity            :15+1Safety              :Ambidextrous Manual, Firing PinGrips               :Black SyntheticSights              :3-Dot WhiteWeight              :33.4 ozFrame Finish        :BlackFrame Material      :Aluminum AlloyBarrel Type         :Chrome-LinedSlide Description   :BlackCase Type           :HardBarrel Length Range :4.00"" to 4.99""Weight Range        :32.00 oz to 47.99 oz"

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. Comes with factory holster.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5-Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened  recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.             SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num:       XDM95259BHCCategory:           PISTOLS                       Type                :PistolAction              :DoubleCaliber             :9mmBarrel Length       :5.3""Capacity            :19+1Safety              :GripGrips               :Black PolymerSights              :Fiber Optic Front, Adjustable RearWeight              :29 ozFrame Finish        :BlackFrame Material      :PolymerBarrel Type         :RampedSlide Description   :BlackCase Type           :Hard PlasticBarrel Length Range :5.00"" to 5.99""Weight Range        :16.00 oz to 31.99 oz"

THE GUN: (MA COMPLIANT) Selling for $10,500 (gun only) (Paid $13,500)

A WHOLE NEW LEGEND.
It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor (MA Compliant), this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor (MA Compliant).

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

THE REC-7 Gun and Soft Sided Tactical Case only ($2,000) 

ELIMINATE ALL DOUBT.
Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

The ACOGs are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with
Tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.
Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using
fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional,
precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

The Silver Pigeon III over-under hunting shotgun is the mid-level offering of the Beretta Silver Pigeon line. It has all the benefits of the Silver Pigeon I plus more extensive game engraving and a stock oval for the owner’s initials, while not featuring the gold inlays of the Silver Pigeon V. Weighing only about 7 lbs, it handles wonderfully as a game gun while not being too light for a long session at the clay range. It is available in 12 and 20 gauge, or in 28 gauge with a petite scaled frame.



Natural Pointability, Swing

The Silver Pigeon is built on the legendary 687 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand, resulting in a considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination.



Tough, Accurate Barrels

Available with 26” or 28” barrels, the Silver Pigeon III is a shotgun designed to last several lifetimes in spite of its lightness and fast handling. The chrome-moly cold-hammer forged barrels of the Silver Pigeon III are designed to take the punishment of heavy hunting loads without compromising in shot pattern and durability. Also, the forcing cone is elongated to provide less shot deformation and recoil, while the MobilChoke system is further designed to resist stress and ensure durability.


 Great Looks, Finish

Something that never fails to impress about the Silver Pigeon III are its premium looks. The game scene on the receiver is rich and full of artistic details, while the trigger guard and top lever are embellished with a tasteful scroll. The select walnut stock features a super-crisp checkering pattern that affords a positive grip while further enhancing the elegance of this shotgun. And the perfect proportions and unmistakable Beretta lines won’t fail to turn heads at the range, even from a distance."
