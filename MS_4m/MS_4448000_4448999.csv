This pistol was imported by Century Arms (stamped).  PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - first Croatian pistol) is a somewhat strange weapon which was developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s. Production of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP VM 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by the more modern HS 2000 pistol.

By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges.

After purchase, I put about 100 rounds through the pistol and it shoots decent.

The pistol comes in a carrying case (worth about $50), cleaning kit (pictured) and the original manual.  Since this pistol is a bit of an oddity and some even collect these, I'm asking $450 cash for everything.  Bill of Sale."

Note:  I have had feeding problems with .40 ammo and haven't figured out the problem.  My guess is that it has to do with feeding .40 ammo out of 10mm mags and is an OAL issue.  I simply don't feel like trying to figure it out and have decided to go in a different direction.

Price for everything is $1650.  I am willing to break it up and I will even take the gun completely back to stock if a buyer so desires.  Email me and we can figure everything out.  I'm not willing to sell any individual parts until the gun is sold.

All parts are new. Rifle has never been fired. Headspace has been verified.

Upper and lower fit tightly with no wobble or rattle. In fact, the take down pin is a little stiff to use.

If you tilt the upper on the pivot pin the handguard will hit the ears on the lower receiver keeping it from opening as far as most of them tilt open. It will open enough to field strip but I usually just pull both pins and separate the halves. I think it might have something to do with the handguard as I have two others like it and they hit the lower receiver when opening as well. 

Transfer will go through Ark Tactical in Lakewood where I will cover the fees.

Looking for magnification around the 4-20 or 5-25 range, with no less than 42mm bell.  MIL/MIL or moa/moa, doesn't matter.  

The KSG is less than one year old, with approximately 100 shells through it.  I have the original box in my storage unit. It has the standard KSG rail with a flip-up front sight, rear combat sight with 4 different adjustable-brightness reticles, and laser sight if that's what you're into.

Has a Remington tactical breacher attachment and choke package. Upgraded springs and stainless followers, extended tube selector (some call it a mag selector). Both the pistol grip and Magpul 'shorty' foregrrip have grip enhancements, and I've installed Keltec OEM ambi sling attachments.

It has the same appetite as my youngest son. It'll eat anything you feed it. Short shells, mini-bucks, 2-3/4"" and even 3"" shells.

Comes with about 155 various shells, since I won't have any more shotguns once I sell this guy.  Also will come with a laser bore sight, a 12ga snap cap, mini-shells, slugs, 00 buck, low velocity buck, less-lethals, and some really ""fun"" shells, some super penetrators (engine block killers) and dragons breath shells.  Y'know, just in case you need to take out a horde of zombies.  Also comes with non-descript soft-sided carrying case

If you are a seller:

1) You are correct in assuming that you are the superior being in the transaction.  You are doing your fellow man a service and favor by offering your personal belongings up for sale.  Sellers should feel lucky to even receive a return email from you, much less actually engage in negotiations or transactions.

2) Because you are selling an item or items, you are also correct in assuming that the value of said item far exceeds the value that would be assigned in a retail store, pawn shop, or any other public or private market.  Its not ultra-valuable because of what it is, it is ultra-valuable because you’re selling it and you want the most money you can get for it.

3) Even if you have no intention of selling your item or items, and your Blue Book of Gun Values is more than four or five feet away from you, feel free to list your item anyway, making sure to indicate “make offer,” and/or “I’m just seeing what’s out there.”
(This reinforces the superiority of the seller as indicated in Rule #1.  It lets would be buyers know that you do not value money, or time, as you clearly have an abundance of both.)

4)  Referencing Rule #3, you can surely use the “make offer” price to see what people will pay for an item you actually want to sell.  Upon using this feature, feel free to respond to reasonable and low ball offers by becoming “butt hurt,” as you did not indicate the ballpark of what you might want to get out of the item.

5)  Upon becoming “butt hurt,” feel free to employ one of the following methods to cope with the emotional trauma of being so utterly disrespected:

A. Completely ignore the offer, and do not, under any circumstances counter-offer.  This 	may lead to price negotiations. 

B.  If you find yourself in the terrifying grips of negotiations somehow, reply with one or 	two word email/text responses, or more verbose, vague responses.  Be rude.  “Nope,” 	“Looking for more,” and “I’m not sure how much I’d like to sell it for” are all acceptable 	and recommended responses.  

These methods, if properly employed will achieve your ultimate goal of preventing a sale.
Remember, if you sell something, you may then take that money and spend it—This could possibly stimulate the economy:  Something which cannot happen, as Barack Obama will take credit for it.

6)  In the event you do sell something, don’t take your listing down.  In fact, bump the listing as much as you can.  This creates the confusion and frustration that Armslist is all about.

If you are a buyer:  

1)  Remember, Armslist is just like Walmart: you can browse, go to the bathroom, and complain about the ever rising costs of things.  

2)  You should email buyers in one of several ways.  Use whichever is most convenient:
	A.  “I only have 60% of your asking price.  Is that ok?”
	B. “ Will you take (insert lowball offer equivalent to half of what a pawn shop would 	give)?”
	C.  “Do you still have it?” (This is potentially ok, referencing Rule 6 under sellers)
	D.  “I live two and a half hours away—you think you can drive to me?”
*Combining 2A and 2D is particularly effective—however it takes a master negotiator to pull this off.

3)  If the seller messes up and actually responds to your email with something resembling actual negotiation, you should under no circumstances respond in any meaningful way.  At best, you can ignore him/her completely.  If this is impossible, simply use the “buyer communication methods” found under Rule 5, Section B.  However, employing Rule 5, Section B is undesirable, as you may accidently find yourself successfully negotiating.  

4)  Just like Walmart, you can commit to buying things, and then just leave your cart at checkout.  This is achieved in the armslist world by somehow getting a seller to negotiate and agree on a price, only to be saved from a sale by you not showing up.  While the buyer knows he is the superior being, you “stick it to him and show him who’s boss” by not meeting or showing up at a prescribed time and place.

*Remember, as a buyer it is not your job to buy anything, only to waste the time of the seller and annoy him.  This is the male version of “retail therapy” that many women enjoy as they run salespeople around, only to say they’ll “think about it” and not buy anything.  

If you are a trader, things become more difficult.  You must use the rules of both the buyer and seller while avoiding a successful transaction at all costs.  For the novice trader, keep in mind that even if you and the other trader have comparable items, your items are far superior and higher in value, while his trading items must be regarded as having the same value as petting zoo feces.  I hope this helps."

The tilt-breech system works to dissipate the recoil in the web of the hand and reduce muzzle rise. The PX4 Sub-Compact semi-automatic pistol shoots in either double or single action mode, and is equally suited for concealed carry, home defense, and recreational shooting. The Sub-Compact PX4 Storm features a lightweight, corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser sights. Interchange backstraps allow a perfect fit to any sized hand; the PX4 Storm has an ambidextrous slide lock and safety, and the magazine release is reversible. The slide has a durable Bruniton™ non-reflective black finish that provides superior corrosion resistance, ideal for concealed carry use where the firearm can be exposed to perspiration on a daily basis. The gun's stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. 3-dot sights provide quick target acquisition, and both front and rear sights are dovetailed into the slide, allowing user to easily change them with after market night sights. The Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol uses a double-stacked magazine with a hinged baseplate for the pinky, if needed. Full-sized PX4 Storm magazines can also be used with the sub-compact model. Comes with 2 magazines."

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.
The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

I have only owned this for about 6 months or less. It remained unfired until about 2 months ago I was up north and put half a box through it. Excellent condition. Has match grade barrel, Trijicon night sights, aggresive front and rear stippling, G10 grips, Trijicon Night Sights, Ed Brown Magwell, ambidextrous safety, Flared ejection port, 2 Eight round mags, where else do you get that much gun for this price in new condition? Oh and it is the satin stainless to top it off!

The company Para Ordnance has just recently been bought by Remington.  So I believe the quality and reputation of Para's is headed downhill.  Para's used to all be hand made in North Carolina.  I just read an article saying that Remington is moving the manufacturing plant to Alabama right now.
So these Para's will get scarce and go up in value no doubt!

I just checked GunBroker and these guns are   about $1000 thru $1200 and their is only 16 results and of those 16 only about 5 are stainless, most are black.
