The A400 Xplor Unico shoots 2.75"", 3"", and 3.5"" shells interchangeably without having to make adjustments, making it an extremely versatile hunting shotgun. The A400 functions equally well for upland bird hunting, duck hunting, sporting clays, or any type of shotgun shooting that involves speed and reliability. To aid hunters in shooting quick flying, multiple targets, the A400 semi-automatic shotgun has an action that cycles super fast—capable of shooting 4 shots in less than one second. The Beretta A400 Xplor Unico features very aesthetically pleasing lines with a classic, checkered walnut buttstock and forend, and a blued barrel with a contrasting-color receiver. The A400's action features a rotating bolt, and a self-cleaning piston to ensure the shotgun operates in all conditions and is low in maintenance. Under field conditions, the A400 easily disassembles with no tools in a matter of seconds. The crossbolt safety is positioned at the front of the trigger guard, where the hunter can find it instantaneously. The A400 comes with sling swivel studs and 3 Optima-Bore HP interchangeable, screw-in chokes.

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal, I will politely pass. Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR's, AK's), but will consider others.  Again, if it's not a good trade offer and your value is not there, please do not offer it, just trying to save everyone some time. About the only want now is an AR-10 like the DPMS Recon G2 or similar and I can add cash or? I would even consider the cheap Sportical model, but would need $100 on top since they are $700 new, unless you have added a nice rail, stock, have ammo and/or mags etc. to add to the deal.

The HK45 is legendary for its reliabliity and its accuracy.  With input from experts such as Larry Vickers and Ken Hackathorn, the HK45 was designed to give people everything they need for a full size fighting pistol.  In late 2012, HK showed us the new Flat Dark Earth and OD green colored frame models they were bringing out.  After handling the guns, it was noted that the only thing that would make them better was to have a matching slide color.  With our past success with Flat Dark Earth colored guns, we asked if we could do a full FDE HK45.  After HK's extensive testing of various finishes, Cerakote was chosen after passing all of their rigid requirements. For those not familiar with Cerakote, it is a ceramic based finish that is extremely durable and corrosion resistant.  It has quickly become the go-to finish for hard use guns.  This version is the standard model and features a standard non threaded barrel and Luminova sights.  The Luminova sights glow once after are exposed to a direct light source.  The trigger is the standard V1 Double Action / Single Action setup, allowing you to carry it hammer down or cocked and locked.

If you are wanting a 45 auto that is second to none in reliablility and is extremely accurate, the HK45 is the gun for you.  If you want it to have the best finish available and have it in Flat Dark Earth, then the Lipsey's Exclusve HK45 Full FDE is the perfect choice."

#2  I do not buy any firearms without creating a bill of sale for our transaction.

Originally designed with two calibers, a rifled .22 LR and a smooth bore .12 GA -, this rifle can fire up to 12 different calibers thanks to the 8 steel adapters supplied. In addition to the two original gauges, adapters allow you to shoot 8 pistol calibers ( .380 , 9 mm , .357Mag/.38SP , .40 S & W, .44 Mag, .45 ACP , .410/.45colt ) and two shotgun calibers (410 ga, 20ga), combining the flexibility of a shotgun and the power of a rifled gun. The choice of materials is the winning factor of X -Caliber ®: the whole structure is made of steel, but the weight of the stock has been almost eliminated. A metal caging encases a preformed polypropylene foam stock, with a very durable and thick weft, ensuring excellent comfort. Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications including automotive and furniture, abd is unusually resistant to mechanical stress and to surface wear. By simply pressing a lever , the rifle can be bent in two, reaching a total length of 18.5 "" - that is, the length of the barrel - to be easily carried in a backpack. All the details are studied to obtain maximum flexibility and practicality. The stock is ergonomic and has a housing for ammunition and the maintenance/cleaning kit. The front sight is optical fiber and the rear sight is adjustable in elevation and windage to fit the gauge used. The gun is supplied with three picatinny quad rails which allow you to mount your favorite accessories. X -Caliber ® is a lightweight and robust weapon, which marks a step forward in the concept of survival ,this package includes rifle/shotgun combo,8 barrel inserts, insert carry case, sling,backpack carry case for all components ."

I'm currently looking to trade my brand new, never fired, ATI Omni Ar-15, with a 1:7 twist Mossberg heavy barrel. Also attached, are a set of UTG sights. Along with the rifle, I also have 2 440 round sealed cans of Federal Lake City M855 on stripper clips I would be able to trade as well, depending on what you are offering. I will also include a magazine repair kit. I'm not looking for cash offers, only trade offers at this time, but I put a very reasonable trade value on the rifle and ammo at $1000."

Everything that came stock as stainless is still stainless, despite what the pictures may look like... I've had some work done, which includes coating of the slide and small parts in black Teflon (See full image album here: http://imgur.com/a/uPGC9).

List of work done:
Level two package done by TJ's Custom Gunworks (http://tjscustomgunworks.com/TJ-list.htm), which includes:
A full deluxe action & trigger job, smoothing out all the internals as well as the slide & barrel functioning.
A tj short stainless trigger.
Throat & polish the barrel and feed ramp to enhance feeding reliability.
Fit & polish the extractor to enhance case extraction and help prevent extractor breakage.
Meprolight tritium night sights with ""orange glo"" front sight, plate slide and small parts in matte black Teflon.

I'm including the SIG case, stock Hogue grips, the wrap around Hogue grip (currently installed), two stock stainless 8 round mags and an aftermarket 10 round mag.

It is a great shooter, very smooth, with a lighter than stock trigger pull. The teflon coating on the slide has a few very small nicks that do not impact the operation of the firearm in any way.

Price is $800, but I'm open to offers (to include partial trades). Looking specifically for a Mossberg 590a1. We'll split the FFL fee and meet at a dealer to conduct the transaction."

I have a real nice SKS SG WORKS BULLPUP conversion ($250 shipped with rail system)... it's a century that I got in trade last fall.  Ran 200 rds thru it flawless and it's a real fun toy, but just not an ak/SKS guy.  Im just so used to ARs that it's only a toy to me and would be better off with someone that enjoys them. It shoots true at 100 yards (MOA).  Very balanced with manageable muzzle rise and the barrel is 16"" which is hard to find along with receipts of work done.

Browning 035335209 X-Bolt Composite Stalker Bolt 22-250 Rem 22"" 4+1 Syn Blk Stk

The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles and adds
numerous improvements certain to place the X-Bolt at the top of the pack. 
The bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced
safety while unloading. Updated styling features more compact dimensions
for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, while trimming weight. To
ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver
using four screws per base. For precise shooting in the field or off the
bench, there's absolutely no substitute for a good, predictable trigger.
The X-Bolt's three-lever Feather Trigger provides a clean, crisp pull with
no take-up or creep and minimal over travel. The trigger is screw
adjustable from 3 to 5 lbs. and factory preset at approximately 3.5 lbs. An
alloy trigger housing contains the hard chromed steel components that are
highly polished on all critical contact surfaces. Precise engagement angles
mean the X-Bolt Feather Trigger feels light and right and stays that way
through many thousands of rounds. Unlike competitors' triggers with
secondary finger piece levers, the Feather Trigger is designed right, from
the very start.
