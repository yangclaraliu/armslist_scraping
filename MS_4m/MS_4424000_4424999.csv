Glock did, however, have extensive experience in advanced synthetic polymers, knowledge of which was instrumental in the company's design of the first commercially successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced ferritic nitrocarburizing into the firearms industry as an anti-corrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.The Glock 17 is the original 9×19mm Parabellum model, with a standard magazine capacity of 17 rounds. Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced.The Glock 17C was introduced in 1996 and incorporated slots cut in the barrel and slide to compensate for muzzle rise and recoil. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a ""C"" suffix on the slide.The Glock 17L was introduced in 1988 and incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is effectively discontinued and replaced by the Glock 34.The Glock 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was discontinued upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which features a reversible magazine catch.Features:Caliber: 9mmLength: 204 Mm / 8.03 In.Width: 30.00 Mm / 1.18 In.Length Between Sights: 165 Mm / 6.49 In.Height: 138 Mm / 5.43 In.Barrel Height: 32 Mm / 1.26 In.Barrel Length: 114 Mm / 4.48 In.Unloaded: 710 G / 25.06 Oz.Glock 17 9MM FDE Gen 3  Loaded: 910 G / 32.12 Oz.Trigger Pull: 2.5 Kg / 5.5 Lbs.Trigger Travel: 12.5 Mm / 0.49 In.Barrel Rifling: Right Hand, HexagonalLength Of Twist: 250 Mm / 9.84 In.Capacity: 17Optional: 33Includes case & two 17 Round Mags"

I have only put approx 50 rounds through this gun at the range without a single issue.  This gun is in immaculate condition and are $599 brand new.  I spent 6 months reviewing this handgun and its history/reliability and found nothing but high marks from every reputable source.  I absolutely love this gun, and the only reason I want to sell it is to purchase the more expensive model in 40 S&W.

The pictures show the tac light, but I'm keeping that.  However, I'm throwing in a 3rd magazine in place of that.  Gun holds 16+1 and has a highly reputable Omega trigger system.  Comes with an interchangeable safety and decocker.  The decocker is currently installed.  You also get the lockable hard case as well.  You can find nice holsters from Alien Gear for IWB and OWB carry at a very reasonable price.

Here's my bottom line - I don't have to sell this gun!  I'm fine with keeping it.  My price is firm as these are $599 brand new and this gun is about 8 months old.  If you are wanting to haggle, or trade, or you are not willing to provide your IN driver's license and fill out a bill of sale at time of purchase, then don't bother wasting your time or mine.  I know by law I'm not required to collect info, but it's a personal choice to cover myself.

You won't find a finer used CZ P07 Duty at this price, guaranteed!"

I have kept it very well cleaned and maintained, and I am only the occasional shooter anyway so 1,000 rounds through it tops. I'm realistic...

Selling my KelTec Sub2K 40S&W that takes GLOCK Mags-

The 9mm seems to be more desirable on the market for some reason, but mainly for the people that don't know ballistics. With the longer barrel this 40 gets close to the same speed as a 10mm +P with some serious punch. Plus 40SW ammo is just about the same price as 9mm now. I added a accessory rail to the forearm, folding CAA fore-grip, Pachmayr grip, and tri-rail flashlight holder. The flashlight in the picture is a 850 lumen Fenix PD35 ($50 light) that I can keep or throw in for $25. 

Excellent SHTF gun. Folds perfectly to fit in a backpack and accurate to 150 yards free standing.

Still have original box and tools. ARMSLIST will only let you post one picture so I can only put up one open or closed... I have plenty more I can send upon request.

This truck is in amazing shape for its age and I would not hesitate to drive it from here to California nonstop. 

However it is a 21 year old truck that isn't perfect.

The good:
Engine, transmission and transfer case shift perfectly and with only 153k on it there is still plenty of life left. 
Ac/heat blow hot and cold when they need to. 
Upgraded blue tooth radio
New tune up within 6 months

The bad:
The back seat is torn hence the seat covers
Windshield wipers don't work (the motor works but the rod keeps popping off the shaft)
2/3 brake lights stay lit up when the lights are on (an easy fix but I haven't had time to fix it myself)
Rust spot around right rear fender(been the same since I bought it 5.5 years ago)

This is a great truck and will make a great first truck for someone or a great work truck, either way this is a heck of a deal.

extras added: 
2 20rd Pmag for 308.
Larue marked tryo BUIS. 
Harris bipod 6-9"" with swivel and notched legs with larue mount.
Mike jones bore guide for the ar10 ( works perfect )
Nightforce 3.5 x 15 x 50 with the NPR-1 recticle mounted in the provided OBR mount-NF is the non zerostop and MOA knobs model.

This thing shot amazingly well-with PMC 147gr plinking ammo, i was getting 1-1.5"" fairly easy. with PPU 168gr match/Fiocchi 168gr match/federal 168gr gmm, it was about .5 or better depending on how well i shot. like i said, its a lazer.

Will ship in a hard case(not the factory one). Would like to keep this together as a whole set up-will only split the scope from rifle, if i have it all spoken for. 

Would like to get $3150 shipped for the whole deal. 
If both parts are spoken for(scope/rifle) would take $1100 for the scope(no laure mount as that goes with rifle) and $2050 shipped for the rifle. 
If you look at what's added to the rifle(BUIS, bipod) this is a really good deal for a barely used OBR-but feel free to make an offer.


I will ship from non ffl-so make sure yours will accept-if not, let me know and we will work something out.
