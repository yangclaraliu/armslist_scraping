You can easily add on some of the fun GSG 522 accessories like a retractable stock, a nice BSA Red Dot or a 110 round drum magazine.

The 522 SD has a sling loop built into the left side of the standard stock and one on the trigger guard. The SD does not have a front sling loop like the 522 carbine does.

All versions of the GSG 522 has a tactical rail up top that allows you to easily mount red dots, reflex red dots or any size scope you'd like to put up there. The rail is built in so there is no added parts to buy.

The GSG 522 SD features a rubber ribbed hand guard and larger ""SD"" barrel shroud. The GSG 522 carbine features a more rigid plastic hand guard and smaller barrel shroud. You can easily remove the front hand guard for cleaning or to put on an after market front hand guard."

Just to make a correction to your stupid rant.

Not really interested in trading, but I will listen if it's a good deal.  I am open to most firearm trades, if it's in my favor and might consider a nice generator or 1oz. silver bars or Eagles at market value, which was around $15 per oz. last I checked.  Just give me the details on what you have and what you are offering on the deal exactly.

You think you got it all, huh? So you got the AR upper in .22? OK, that’s good for cheap plinking. So you got the AR upper in 9mm? OK, that’s fun at the range. So you got the AR upper in .300 or the Beowulf? OK, now your AR15 can punch above its weight. But if you want a black belt in AR15, you’re going to want this: 

UP FOR SALE: THIS AR15 .50BMG CALIBER UPPER BY WATSONS WEAPONS! 

Ladies and Gentlemen, submitted for your approval is this .50 caliber AR15 upper! This is NOT the Beowulf, but the honest-to-goodness .50BMG! This is the one you want to take your long-range shooting game to the next level. With this gun, you can measure your shots in terms of zip codes, not yards! You also turn your AR15 into a .50 cal rifle without buying another gun. Your wife will respect your cunning! (Now she certainly won’t be able to gripe about you buying another gun. If she asks, you just got some parts for the gun you already own-she can't hold THAT against you, right? Trust me-I’m married. Alternately, just tell her it’s some plumbing supplies for that household project…)

I picked up this beauty at The Armory in Virginia Beach in 2001. I’ve put approximately 25 rounds through her. I like owning a .50, but family, time, and a distinct lack of sufficient real estate for shooting In NOVA forces me to part with her. I’m hoping you can find her a good home with wide open spaces to put her through her paces. 

This monstrous beast was constructed by Watson’s Weapons of Mound, Minnesota. This upper measures approximately 36” long with a big, baffled muzzle break, bipod, heavy MG-style carry handle, flat top railed upper, bolt and bolt crank, and a big, padded carry bag/shooting mat. Sorry, no scope included with this auction, but let me warn you up front-you want to buy a quality scope for this rifle. If you try to go cheap, the .50 will eat your scope for breakfast.

This .50 cal upper is not a semi-auto Barrett Navy Seal Sniper Rifle. You will not be taking on the Taliban or ISIS or Cobra with this bad mother. It fires via a single shot crank-in bolt, so it's not a fast action and you won’t get a follow-up shot if you miss, but I assume you’re shooting this at stationary long-range targets, not invading North Koreans, UFOs, or game. (Shoot this at game and I think you’ll spend half the day looking for enough bits to fill a Ziploc bag.) It might be slow to load, but I guess it ensures there are no bolt failures with the .50 cartridge, and I’m fine with that. You will be able to take your target shooting game to the next level with this gun. 

Price: $1400. As always, I'm willing to entertain interesting offers, i.e. Indiana's Crystal Skull, phased plasma rifle in a 40 watt range, Hitler's Jockstrap, etc, but CASH IS KING. 

Condition: Used, Very Good. Approximately 25 rounds fired down the pipe. Some minor wear to finish. Comes with bolt, bolt crank, padded case, and big honking upper/sewer pipe. Reminds me of Oddball's Loudener (See Kelly's Heroes).

Terms: I prefer face2face transfers. I will travel to meet you within about 100 miles of Manassas. This is NOT a gun, so no credentials required. My time is money, so if you want to meet and refuse to buy, I request $20 for the trip. 
If you really want this upper and can not meet face2face, I can arrange shipping for an additional $80. Long-Distance purchasers shall complete payment for the full amount via Paypal prior to shipment. This upper is not for sale to Californians or residents of states where this item is illegal. Do your homework-I am not responsible for keeping you legal."

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

This rifle is all matching numbers to include the receiver, barrel, stock, bolt and magazine (magazine is a forced match, the others are not).

This is not a Mitchell Mauser. It is import stamped.

Previous arsenal and manufacture markings were scrubbed on this one, but are still visible.
Faintly below the 24/47 markings Royal Yugo markings can be seen, as well as the location of original manufacture (Artillery Technical Institute). This makes original manufacture prewar (1928-31). Hard to get a picture of this as it is so faint, but it is there and I certainly welcome anyone to inspect it in person if they wish.

There are also two scrubbed German acceptance stamps, one on the receiver, indicating that the action (not the rifle as it sits today) was seized and put into German service, and one on the bolt release. So the action certainly saw combat during WWII.

The rifling is nearly flawless. The rifle does have some surface rust on the receiver, but this is limited and there is no corrosion. Not pretty but this rifle has been through a lot looking at the number/type of arsenal marks and stock markings.

Cycles great, shoots/groups dead on (though I don't have anywhere to shoot long range, so a little high at 100 yards as expected).

I have taken pictures of the rifle in and out, including all the markings should anyone wish to see more, ask questions etc.

All and all would make an all matching good shooter with a little bit of history behind it.

471,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4492471,For Sale/Trade:  FN FNX 45 Tactical FDE/TAN,"Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids, Michigan","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, July 7, 2015",Handguns,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'm completely redoing this ad because I just assumed that anyone who would contact me would know exactly WHAT this pistol is and specifically be looking for this model. Apparently that was not the case because I've had people ask me if it comes with a threaded barrel. I've had people ask if it includes night sights. I've had people ask if it comes with the hard case or the soft case etc. Lets try this again! 

What I'm selling is the FN FNX-45 Tactical in FDE color.

The FNX-45 Tactical has an interesting history. In 2005, the US military launched the Joint Combat Pistol program (JCP) to find a replacement for the Beretta M9. The program was searching for a .45ACP caliber pistol with day/night sights, an integrated Picatinny rail and a threaded barrel for accepting suppressors. FN submitted the FNP-45-USG to those trials but the Military later suspended the program.

FN marketed a model of this gun called the FNP-45 Tactical but it had some issues so they later re-released the new FNX-45 Tactial. That it what I'm selling, the FNX-45 Tactical.

This gun includes Trijicon Night sights, raised for a silencer. This gun includes an extended, threaded barrel for usage with a silencer. This gun DOES come come in the TAN colored soft case that has pouches for the pistol, magazines, tools, accessories AND a silencer.

I have fired ONE box of .45ACP target ammo from this pistol, that is it. This pistol is like brand new in the case.

I paid $1199.99 for this pistol, PLUS 6% sales tax. The total was $1270.94 out the door. 

I would like to hopefully trade for an HK45CT. I would also maybe trade for an HK45C if it includes something to make the trade values the same.

That or I would sell this for the cash price of um, maybe $1000.00 dollars or so?

These guns are VERY rare right now. Not many people have them in-stock. If a store does not currently have one, they can NOT order them FNH is currently not shipping them. Most of of the major wholesalers are listing these as ""hard to get"" and out-of-stock w/ no ETA. I'm being told 4 to 6 months.

Feel free to call your local gun store and try to order one in FDE or there are some on Gunbroker."

It doesn't have a visible date and has very few roll marks; I contacted 54r.net and the proprietor said he has seen M44's that weren't struck properly like this one but are an anomaly.   This one is unfired and still in cosmoline. 


The 91/59 is basically free at this price and needs some TLC to get back to glory.  It was a closet find of an older gentleman from a few years back and I don't have the time or energy to mess with it.  It has cleanable corrosion in the barrel and the bolt needs to be disassembled, polished, cleaned and reassembled.  All in all with proper attention this could be a super nice carbine again.  

It also includes a Boyd stock that will fit either and a metal ""Harris"" style bipod

DESCRIPTION
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision and durability

I collect old German pistols and am thinning the heard a bit. 
This Dreyse is in excellent condition with all new springs that I just put in her, fully cleaned and lubbed.  It is all matching including the magazine.  However, of course the original magazine doesn't allow to fully cycle through many rounds at a time so she also comes with a new mag that is not original.  She shoots true and great!   I can include 20rds of .32 APC with it.   This is a very unique piece and was used in Europe police forces and there are no import marks on her. 
I am picky about my collection so everything is in order and clean.    You can't find a better condition for the price locally or online.   The bore is clean with rifling. 
I'm firm on the price of $325.00 cash.
I may trade for an i5 cpu/motherboard combo type setup.

I’m offering this B-B pistol for sale locally as a favor to a friend.  Looking for a local sale.  If you know someone who collects these, please refer them to this ad. 
This model was produced from 1977 to 1995.  The box is in very good condition with a few dings.  I would rate the gun itself in 95% + condition.  Worst flaw that I see is a small handling nick in the bottom of one of the grips.  See the photos - I made several & can e-mail to any interested parties.  I believe it came with three CO2 cylinders.  Two are unused & it has a spent one in inside the grip.  Most likely the 3rd one.  I did not test it’s operation beyond verifying that the installed cylinder is empty.  Looks like it was fired very little.  At 20+ years old, it’s seals most likely need some maintenance.  Since I believe it’s value is mostly as a collector, I will leave it to the purchaser to verify it’s practicality as a shooter."

The peep has not been tied in yet on the strings, so the owner can decide what size or type of peep they want for that. The bow has a Mathews focus grip installed, and the original wood grip comes with it as well.  3 wrist slings are included as well. I will even throw in 6 Gold Tip Expedition Hunter GT arrows that are custom fletched with white tiger blazer vanes and flo green wraps and were spine indexed. They are the arrows the bow was tuned with and weigh 430gr with 100gr tips. This bow really is a super smooth shooting, awesome bow. Please email or text me at REDACTED with any questions or to buy. I am asking $465 for everything, which s a great deal f you bought all of this stuff separate and then paid for new strings and had it tuned along with new arrows it would cost you much more.

One of the first things a GLOCK owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV builds the best triggers in the business and their Fulcrum Ultimate Trigger Kit has been used to set multiple world records.

The Fulcrum Ultimate Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.

You will immediately notice the difference in your gun’s performance after installation:
- The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.

- Because of ZEV’s proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.
- The trigger’s crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. 
- This feedback improves the user’s ability to “ride the reset” to improve follow up shot speed and placement.
- The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.
- The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.
- Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of short take up, post break travel and will result in a a shorter reset.
- The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition.

ZEV Parts always incorporate design, feel and performance at the same time. A Fulcrum Adjustable Trigger Kit will upgrade the look of your gun as triggers come in a variety of color combinations. Finally, ZEV Trigger components are designed to last; replacing plastic stock parts with aluminum or stainless steel assemblies.

This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability. The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition. Advances in AR technology have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks. This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation. We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version. Barrel: 416 Stainless steel. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. Barrel is is finished off with a classic rifle-length handguard, F-Marked gas sight base, and A2 flash hider.Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability.
