Description from KY Gun Co.:
KYGUNCO Exclusive-OD Green Factory Finish with NSN # engraved on frame-Only 200 pistols to be imported per year!!! Get yours before they are gone! 

The P-01 is based on the CZ 75 design, but with improvements in metallurgy, quality control adn design. The components of the P-01 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01 with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful redesign so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. The P-01 is the ony NATO spec pistol on the market that is available to the public. After 3 years of the most aggressive small arms testing ever by any manufacturer for any pistol, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75's previously used by the Czech National Police. 

Reliability: The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!"

The shotgun has engravings on the side plates, butt plate, barrel, trigger guard, hammers, and gold inlays on the barrels. The Damascus steel barrels are the ""tiger stripe"" pattern. As it is very hard to date old Damascus shotguns, the only means I have to on for a date is a R proof mark under the right barrel which was only used until 1889 and means the barrel did not meet inspection and was reworked on.

Other proof marks include the manufacturer proof ( M L with a crown over it), Liege proof mark for Belgian black powder shotguns/rifles ( ELG with star and encircled), 19.2 diameter proof on right barrel and 19.6 diameter proof on left barrel. There are also two H proof marks on the back locking lugs and two v proof marks (one on the outside of each barrel) which I have yet to identify. Also, ""FINE TWIST"" is inscribed on the barrel strap - identifying it as Damascus steel.

The stock on the gun is walnut with normal wear and tear for such an old shotgun. The engravings are worn but still very visible and the gold inlay on the barrels are immaculate. There is also patina on the barrels, also a very light amount for such an old gun. There is little to no pitting on any metal part. Unfortunately, there are two cracks, one on each side of the stock, under the hammer; most likely from someone not knowing to cock the hammers before removing the barrels.

All in all, this is a beautiful piece and a great look into history. I would NOT suggest shooting it unless looked at by a gun smith who knows these shotguns.

Can fire .177 pellets or bb's. Has fired about 200 rounds so this gun is in very good condition. 600 FPS.

This is the tactical package so it comes with a Beretta 4x32 TriTAC tactical scope, picatinny rails, compensator, QSB Bipod (which is also a handle) and a nice, hard, locking carrying case. Everything in the photos are included.

Here is the site I originally purchased the gun from: http://www.airarmsports.com/Beretta-CX4-Storm-XT-Air-Rifle-Tactical-Kit-4x32-Scope/


Product Description:

The belt-fed magazine delivers 30 pellets just as fast as you can pull the trigger. Just fill the mag, pull the cocking bolt, pop an 88-gram CO2 cartridge into the gun and start shooting! You'll get over 200 shots from one CO2 fill. The sights are unusual for an airgun. The front sight is adjustable for elevation, while the rear sight is adjustable for windage. It comes with a long built-in Picatinny rail, so you can quickly mount a scope, red dot sight or laser. A big, bad, beautiful gun that loves to shoot as much as you do, the CX4 looks and feels just like the firearm it copies. The smooth, rounded corners of the synthetic stock won't get hung up on clothing. It slides from side to side and easily lifts to the shoulder. Remember to buy a good supply of pellets, 'cause you'll go through a tin in one sitting. Yeah, it's THAT much fun!"

It's a midlength upper, add sights and it's ready to go on your lower. Sat in the safe, has not been fired. Perfect shape! Includes the charging handle and bcg, these are excellent gas uppers.

From Adams Arms:
The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil.  The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish.  NOTE: The Standard model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length when pinned.FeaturesThreaded for 5/8x24” barrelsMachined from 303 Stainless SteelBlack Melonite finishBall dimpled expansion portsWeight of 2.42oz w/Crush washer IncludedSpike’s Tactical Dynacomp and crush washerSpike's Tactical Lifetime WarrantyPayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

There was a patch of surface corrosion on left side of barrel near muzzle, I was able to get it cleaned up pretty well, other than that, no major detractors, normal wear and tear from a gun which has been used.

Here's the scammers info as passed on to me by a potential victim. 

Gloria Edwards
Address: 1362 Ga Hwy 199s Lot 2 East Dublin, Ga 31027

I contacted local LEO who seemed somewhat interested and the ATF who seemed mostly disinterested. 

I documented everything to cover my ass if this situation takes a turn for the worse. 

Remember, if it looks to good to be true it's probably a scam.

I have a very nice Muzzle Loader package here. It is a Thompson / Center Encore 209X50 Magnum and comes with a very nice Nikon Omega black powder bullet drop compensator scope. The scope alone retailed for around $300. The trigger pull on this rifle is phenomenal; I've never felt once quite so nice. The lower can also accept other Thompson encore barrels, so you can make this into dozens of other guns. It will come with a half-box of pyrodex pellets, a couple boxes of 209 primers, and a box of .50cal hornady HP bullets. This is the perfect black powder deer rifle. 

Would consider partial trade of nice glock pistols, let me know what you have. However, cash is king.

Engraved and grooved for scope mounting (drilled and tapped).  High gloss checkered walnut stock. Excellent overall condition with a brilliant metal finish. The bore is bright and clean, the rifling is sharp.  Don’t believe it’s been shot much at all.   
Just so you know, this gun has been modified by a craftsman gunsmith, not a guy with hacksaw.  I bought this gun as it is exactly now.  It’s one of the most beautiful 22 rifles I’ve owned.  I believe the barrel was 24” when it came out in 1972 but was cut down to 20” at some time.  However, as far as I know the 20’ barrel was the way it came from factory originally as custom upgrade.  The barrel crowning wasn’t cut by an amateur for sure – see pic.  The butt plate isn’t original but has a decent Remington plate.  I’m sure it can be made to look like original.  I don't know a lot more about this rifle, other than I had a gunsmith at Fine Guns in Bass Pro evaluate it and he said the custom work was done by a professional.  I’m planning on going to the gun show in Springfield this weekend to see if I can possibly find a better butt plate to fit.  Perhaps the previous owner wanted it customized a little shorter for a youngster to shoot, I don't know.  All I know is that it's a very nice 22 rifle that’s near excellent condition and possibly values at for a lot more than I'm asking.  I just need the cash right now for house projects.  If I don’t get what I thinks it is worth, no problem.  I really would like to hold on to it to give to one of grandchildren someday.  I’m firm on my price.   Will be glad to email you many pictures."
