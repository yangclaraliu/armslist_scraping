LNIB Smith and Wesson M&P 9c. Comes with all original items. One Flush and One Extended Magazine, Box, Paperwork, all Three Backstraps. All original. No modifications have been made. Shot roughly 300 rounds through it.  Great smooth recoiling shooter, and very accurate for a Compact. I've taken extremely good care of it. Regular cleaning and wiped down with Tuff Glide on the exterior. If you don't know what that is, go get some. Especially for your carry gun.  It's maybe the best ten bucks and five seconds of your time that you'll ever spend. 

I don't have to part with it, and am mostly looking for a specific trade in a Glock 19. Prefer Gen 3, but am open to other generations. Just testing the waters. I've been toying with the idea of switching to Glock and want to see if there is any interest out there

This model does NOT have a Thumb or Magazine Safety (it will fire without a mag inserted).

173 REMINGTON 180 GRAIN JSP.
50 BLAZER 240 GRAIN L-SWC.
25 REMINGTON 240 GRAIN JHP.
18 FEDERAL 240 GRAIN JHP.
6 HORNADY 240 GRAIN JHP.
18 FEDERAL 240 GRAIN HYDROSHOCKS.
20 SHOTSHELLS. These fit both 44 Magnum and 44 Special.
Some of this ammo is up to 6 years old. It is all FACTORY AMMUNITION.
No reloads.
I sold my 44 with a 10 ½ barrel and planned to buy another with maybe a 5 ½ barrel. Reality set in and I realized I had only ever shot the other one maybe 40 times in 6 years and don’t plan to hunt next year so decided not to buy another one and just sell the ammunition. 
My FIRM PRICE is $200.00 for all 310 rounds. Yes that averages .70 cents per round. If you think that’s high for a 44 magnum round then you haven’t bought any lately. What they had at Bi-mart was averaging a dollar plus depending on type and grain. I am in the Otis area east of Lincoln City. If you are not willing to travel here then don’t bother emailing me. You can come to my home or meet me at the Otis Gas station. Email me with your phone number and I’ll call you in the order the emails came in. If no call it just means the guy in line before you was lucky and is coming to get them."

It was the closest to is actual displayed ammo, both of which were manufactured for the same gun. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience that has been caused by such.For its age the rifling looks great. If you are an avid hunter this would make a well tool. This gun does have its cosmetics issues that are clear to see. The left side of the stock has two horizontal holes that may have been utilized for a cheek pad during use. There are also six Holes of equal spacing in a set of two rows (three holes per row) on the top portion of the receiver. These may have been used for a rail attachment, but I am uncertain of such. The serial number (20137) dates the rifle to being manufactured near the end of 1909. The rifle has also been stamped with EA3, this means the rifle was sent to Remington for repair October, 1932. The ammo for this rifle has been discontinued in 1964. The ammo is scarce to come by, but there are places online that re-manufacture the ammo for a reasonable price; it is even comparable to the price of the still manufactured .35 Remington. I am selling with the rifle one box of twenty (20) rounds of unfired pre-1964 .32 Remington ammo in original packaging and a generic hard case. I do have more images available upon request.*The price is firm, and I am only seeking cash at this time.**If the advertisement is up, it is still available.**I will not ship the item (face to face sales only)*"

No, there are no scratches or turn marks on either cylinder. No, there is no rust. No, I don't want to trade for you $800 Smith and Wesson revolver. No, I dont want to trade for your $650 Sig Sauer.

It has wear and tarnish on the cylinder and frame commonly found on old black powder revolvers, but still retains much or the original nickel finish. Owl grips are in exelent condition, with no cracks or chips. It also has a 5in barrel; uncommon for the 2nd model, and bore and groves are in fair condition, but could use a good cleaning. Works well mechanically for its age, however, when the trigger is pulled, it does its job in lining up the cylinder and cocking back the hammer, but doesn't return to its ""ready position"" once the trigger is released and requires it to be put back manually. Not sure if it's the trigger leaf-spring, or a result of being a 110 year old revolver... Brown leather holster is included.

It has a synthetic stock with a shoulder strap attached to the gun. There is also a 26"" ventilated-rib barrel that has a ACCU-MAG choke system that has 3 different chokes and a front fiber optic sight that came with the gun originally. The slug barrel is brand new and this gun has not been shot very much since it was purchased brand new by the current owner several years ago. It also comes with a 52"" Plano Protector series hard plastic case with 4 latches and grey egg shell foam inside to protect the gun. These guns have a dual gas venting system which makes them the softest shooting 3.5"" shotguns available in the market. It also has an adjustable stock drop spacer system along with being over bored to 10 GA dimensions to eliminate shot deformation while using shot shells. The 26"" barrel is only chambered for 3"" & 3-1/2"" shells since this is stamped on the barrel.
I am looking to sell this weapon system as soon as possible for a cash offer and I am not looking to make any trades for the gun, barrels, scope & case."

The Phantom introduces a new type of tactical pack system; it's the first product that provides an integrated drag bag and backpack. It allows you to carry your heavy weapon in the backpack, either with or without the concealing top-cover. If the cover is not mounted, you can withdraw a full-scale sniper weapon from the pack very quickly. Or, with the cover over the weapon, nobody needs to know what you are carrying. And if you leave the Control Clips undone, you can still pull the gun right out.

The modular system lets you choose how much or how little of the system you need for your mission: The full set, just the Backscabbard, just the pack, or a drag bag.

The Phantom pack is a Gunslinger-sized pack in its main load bay, but offers a little more capacity because it is equipped with outboard hydration/radio pockets. It offers the ability to remove the bag and straps from the patented Backscabbard™, which can then be combined with the top-cover to make an excellent drag bag.

It's a front-loader, with two levels of varying-sized tuck-pockets lining its interior, PALS racks inside and out, and a fold-down shelf that can be used to divide the main compartment into upper and lower chambers.

A plasticized mesh ""rack"" on the back wall of the upper chamber can be used to carry larger radios or other items.

It will carry two 3-liter hydration kits, mounted in side pockets.

It features a longer waistbelt, with a 5 x 3 PALS matrix on each side.

The pack includes a lightweight pull-out rain cover, which stows in a pocket on the bottom of the main compartment."

It was designed to fill in a gap for the older .45-70 at a time when that cartridge was not currently available in any lever action, making it the largest at the time available lever-action cartridge.[1] The .444 looks like a lengthened .44 Magnum and provides a significant increase in velocity. It is usually used for the Marlin 444 Lever-action Rifle.In the mid-1960s the .45-70 had all but disappeared from the American marketplace. There was no big-bore cartridge available in a lever-action rifle in current production, so Marlin decided to create a new cartridge to fill this empty niche. They created what is essentially an elongated version of the .44 Magnum by making it nearly an inch longer to give it power similar to the .45-70.[3] The case Marlin created is very similar to a rimmed .303 British trimmed and necked-up to work with .429 bullets.[4]Hunters initially had some troubles because the .444 was frequently hand-loaded using existing .429 bullets that were designed for use at handgun velocities. Remington has stated in letter and email, when asked, that their 240gr .444 bullet was not the same as a .44 magnum handgun bullet.[3] Nevertheless, the rifle did gain in popularity as more suitable bullets were designed for its higher velocity.[5]In 1972 Marlin re-introduced the .45-70 to their lever-action line, expanding their big-bore offerings.[3] Sales of the .444 are now overshadowed by .45-70 cartridge which has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to interest in cowboy action shooting. This quick action and powerful stopping power has been shown to be an efficient and useful hunting rifle for those who are experienced shooters.I have a VERY NICE Marlin 444ss for sale in great condition. This rifle is in good shape and is in 100% working order. Prefect for any big game in America!!!!"
