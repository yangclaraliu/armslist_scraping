M&P SHIELD™ Accessories.pdf 

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

At present time, 2 measure at 12/32's, and 2 measure at 11/32's; thus, giving 55%-60% tread life left on the tires. For reference, approximately 32,000 miles have been put on the tires, so I would think you could feasibly get another 35,000-40,000 miles out of them, depending on use, and preventive maintenance. They were ONLY replaced in order to have quieter running tires. The set cost around $2300 new, and are being sold for $800. Not looking for trades. You will not be disappointed with these bad boys."

Ruger Vaquero, this is the ""old model"" aka the original ""large frame"" Vaquero that was discontinued after 2005 IIRC. Literally one of the strongest .357's out there. This has a birdshead grip and 4 5/8"" barrel. This is a pretty rare configuration in .357 mag, I've never seen another for sale (and I look). Practically no wear, super minor amount of blue missing at the end of the ejector rod housing (holster wear) and then the turn line that you see. Currently the gun has a super blackhawk hammer, but also includes the original which switches out in a few minutes.

I also have a barely worn left handed Triple K Cheyenne holster and Wyoming belt for this, or other similarly sized single actions. Large size belt (they say waist size 38-43, I'm a 34 and wear this comfortably over a regular belt with room to spare). These retail for $70 each at Cabelas. 

$600 for the gun, box, paperwork, and all that jazz included. $75 for belt/holster. 

The main trades I'm interested in are as follows:
Talo Ruger Vaquero Birdshead in .45ACP - Even Trade
Smith and Wesson M66 (current production) - Can add some cash if necessary.
Talo GP100 Wiley Clapp II - Can add some cash if necessary.

Below is the description from the Trijicon website (https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA31RCO-A4CP):

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the USMC's M16A4 weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included)."

I added a list below of some of the major differences between the police and express guns just to give those of you who dont know why the police versions are more desirable. 

 The 870 Police has:
- An aluminum trigger group (vs plastic on the 870 express).
- Old style magazine retention system (you can add mag extension w/o modification) 
- The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts.
- A military-grade parkerized finish.
- A polished bore.
- A one piece barrel.
- A short police-length fore end. 
- The Remington “R3” super recoil pad that reduces felt recoil by 30%.
- Sling swivels.
- Heavy-duty magazine spring to ensure positive shell feeding.
- Heavy-duty trigger-sear spring. to reduce the chance of accidental fire
- Heavy-duty shell lifter spring which also improves positive feeding.
- No use of MIM parts, the extractor is milled
- Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
- The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
- High visibility follower."

(Information below was taken from an NRA article on NM Garand's. I added a few “added notes” as to this Rifle for your information.)
Between 1953-1955 Springfield Armory produced the first of the NM series rifles the NM-1 (Type-1), serial numbers will be between approximately 5,800,000 and 6,100,000. 
Most of the unaltered original Type 1 NM rifles will exhibit the following characteristics
-Markings on right receiver leg: Drawing number, “6528287-SA;” Heat Lot, T 1 to T 10 - Z 5 to Z15 (added note: This Rifle receiver drawing no: F6528291 Heat lot; Z6A, Which matches Springfield Armory records for NM receiver. Left side receiver is stamped with ""S"")
-Barrel: Marked “T” for (targeted); “P” for (proofed); “SA F6535448” (Add Note: This Barrel is marked ""SA F 6525448 drawing number with two ""S"" stamps over the F); Month and year of barrel production; Heat lot code, “m” (magnetic particle testing) and Defense Acceptance Stamp (Added Note: This Rifle has additional inverted ""P"" with punch mark center ""P"" loop which was used as early NM marking).
-Bolt: “6522887-SA” (with heat lot code) (Added Note: This rifle Bolt ""6528287-SA)
-Windage Knob: “DRC”
-Elevation Knob: “WCE” (Added Note: This rifle has ""DRC"" Elevation Knob)
""""It should be noted that the early production examples (1953-1955) may have different parts from those listed above."""" Stocks for NM-1 Rifles were not glassed, but rather hand selected for tight fit and uniform wood grain.
Springfield Armory engineers and armors worked closely to prefect the Nation Match 1 rifle.  
The exact number of Type 1 National Match rifles made is unknown. There is a much-published chart purporting to give a breakdown of M1 National Match production from 1953 to 1963. 

This is a rare find for the shooters or collector. NM-1's are rare in this condition.

Note: Buyer Pays: Shipping and DOJ registration fees
I will consider reasonable offers. 

This is a nice accurate shooting rifle in excellent condition and all the marking as stated above.. For Shooter or Collector. Rare find!

I have the original box with everything else that came with it as well. This gun has been very well kept and looks very new still. It shoots great with both barrels and has never misfed with either rounds. I love this pistol and would not be selling it, but I am after a new bolt action rifle so I need to thin the heard. The gun alone sells for $500 in most places I have looked. When you add in a $125 barrel, $40 Tungsten guide rod+recoil spring, and Trijicon night sights that run about $100 on Amazon it's getting to a $765 value. Asking price is $725, or possible trade if you have a very nice bolt gun I want. I will not entertain low ballers so don't even ask because I am in no hurry to get rid of this."

The RZR has currently 736 miles and 92 hours on it. Never had any mechanical issues, it always starts right up and rides all day long. Used as a family toy, not a hotrod that gets trashed & rolled. You will appreciate the electronic power steering after a days riding is over too, trust me. It's not show room perfect but these things never will be. It has been crawling, mudding, trail and dune riding. I have over $7000 in add-ons and over $28k invested. The lightbar is a cheap Chinese made one but I didn't add it into price since I got it for free anyways. Has had no engine mods or work done. Only routine fluid changes.
