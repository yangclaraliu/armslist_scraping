Purchased it directly from the pro shop in Exeter about a year and a half ago, it's shot maybe 2,000-3,000 rounds. I've maintained it meticulously and it's fully cleaned after each trip to the range. I have the Sig rosewood grips on it as well as the original grips and the 2 15 round mags. Only ever shot out with one of the magazines so the other is brand new and unused. I'm downsizing to the P229. The gun is currently on consignment sale at Shooters Outpost in Hookset for the same price, but I'd rather sell private to avoid their 15% fee. They graded it in the firearms blue book at 98% condition, with 100% being Unfired.  I can meet at shooters for anyone interested and they can broker the sale, conduct the background check and firearm transfer and such. Price is slightly negotiable."

600 rounds Malaysian surplus tracer rounds. Loose packed, brass cased, re-loadable, non-corrosive, berdan primed 147 grain projectile bought from unammo.com. Tracers don't really light(maybe 1 out of 100) but primers are good. No FTF's in all the rounds I've shot. $300 FIRM. Good target ammo at 50 cents a round, you wont find a better price for brass cased. I'll throw in the 50 cal ammo can for this price.

44 MAGNUM; 250 ROUNDS:

130 rounds hornady leverevolution 225 grain FTX ballistic tip. Awesome hunting ammo; flatter trajectory than hollow points, but expands on impact like a hollow point. $20 a box/ $1 per round. Will throw in cabelas 50 round case with sale.

40 rounds hornady 200 grain xtp hollow points. Very high quality hunting/self defense ammo. $20 a box.

80 rounds winchester supreme elite dual bonded 240 grain DJHP. What can I say.... this is hands down some of the best 44 mag ammo made. Very hard to find, and rarely available in-stock $30 a box FIRM. This is a smokin' great price.

Recently sold 2 rifles in these calibers to pay for a new scope for another rifle. These prices are very good, you won't find better, if you can even find them in-stock.

Around 300 rounds through her, taken down and cleaned after each outing. Bore is flawless. Ghost Ring sights, with fiber optic front. 

There are some scuffs here and there on the exterior from being taken out of the safe, but these are purely cosmetic and do not affect function. No malfunctions with anything from regular power target loads to 00 buckshot. 

Comes with a shotgun shell belt, sling, straight stock, plastic shell holder for mounting on the stock, and a box of target ammo. I also have a different sling loop set for a good deal. 

Would prefer to trade rather than sell. There is nothing wrong with the shotgun, I just don't get to shoot it as much, and that's rather boring."

I am the second owner. I purchased it this past spring from an FFL in Central Illinois. I can not recall how many rounds the previous owner was said to have put through it, though it does not show excessive wear. I have only put 60 rounds through it myself. It does have a few scratches on the ejection port side, and possibly some wear marks on the left side of the slide, near the front. Not sure of the cause of any of the marks, since I have never carried this, nor holstered it. They were already present when I purchased it. I have tried to properly show the marks in the photos I have. Additional photos are available (Armslist only let me upload one)

I am looking to sell this as a package. I am not interested in trades, since the funds from the sale of this will be used to finish covering moving expenses. I will miss having it around, as it is easy to operate, very dependable, and enjoyable to shoot. I have had zero malfunctions of any sort with this firearm. I am located in Carroll County, but would be willing to travel a bit, so as long as we meet in a location that ensures our mutual safety, and allows you to inspect the firearm without causing undue alarm and concern (i.e. a shooting range, ffl dealer, etc.)

The XDs comes with the case, 1 7 round magazine with pearce base plate (allowing you to get a full grip, factory base plate also comes with), 1 9 round magazine with the mid mag extension. Extra back strap, mid mag extension, Springfield Armory plastic holster and double magazine holder, lock, and cleaning brush, and factory fired shell casing. It did not have the owners manual with it, and i haven't bothered to purchase one since I was already familiar with how to disassemble for cleaning. Reassembly is equally easy. The ammo in the magazines will not be included. 

The ammo consists of the following:

1 350 round bulk box Blazer Brass 115 grain 9mm full metal jacket. Purchased just after I purchased the XDs.

1 50 round box of Remington UMC 115 grain 9mm jacketed hollow points. Purchased last month.

I have a VERY VERY nice sks with a ton of extras that you cannot pass on.  

I am interested in trades of all shapes and sizes!

I am open to trades - email pictures and the offer to me at 1minutece@gmail.com or text them to 941-666-0215

This is a Norinco SKS is very good condition.  The original wood stock pictured is in very good to fine shape with no carving or wear beyond light use.

This rifle was unused for 10 years - in a closet just going unmolested :)  It shoots straight and is very accurate.  The scope is mounted perfectly for good eye relief and is good enough for out to 200 yards - yes - it is accurate at 100 yards and more with a more skiled shooter than me behind it.  It has the pictured muzzle brake to cut down on muzzle jump and allow for faster follow up shots.  It also has a gas tube heat grill with the attached shell ejector to make sure the spent cases are not hitting the scope.  The length of pull is the same as other sks - which is to say a little short.  There is a PERFECT butt pad for $10 on Amazon.com I will point you towards unless you change it into the included Timbersmith stock that is already longer and has a built in recoil pad.  The Timbersmith stock is BRAND NEW and cost $145 - I even have the box!

I have:

1) the original 20 round internal magazine (less common than the internal 10 round magazine)

2) the original spike bayonet

3) the original bipod

None of these are installed right now and they are all included plus the mounting hardware for them.

It also comes with over $200 of aftermarket magazines.

(4) 20 round metal magazines

(3) 30 round metal magazines

(1) 40 round polymer magazines

When these are available they are $21-$30 depending on the website - they are sold out at cheaperthandirt.com which is the least expensive place to get them.

The rifle needs nothing to take it right to the range.

There are pictures of an SKS installed in the (included) Timbersmith black stock so that you can see how awesome this stock/weapon combo is - they are for reference - this one has not been put into the Timbersmith stock- I bought the stock and then never got around to doing it.

I have mush more than the asking price into this rifle and all of the accesories, magazines and stock so no crazy offers please.

This weapon needs nothing.  It is tight and complete and shoots perfectly.  The stock alone cost$350 plus the Norinco SKS.  I also added the cantilever scope mount/shell deflector (to keep the sheels from hitting the scope).  It is loads of fun - I am just looking for something new to buy or trade for - I get bored of guns periodically.  This is a much more fun rifle than a standard sks in the bullpup stock.  It changes the center of gravity of the rifle and makes it SO much more manuverable.  You will love it the very first time you shoot it.  It comes with (2) 20 round polymer magazines.  These magazines work the best with the SG Systems bullpup stock.

This is loads of fun and the (pictured) extended magazine release is unique to the SG Sytems bullpup stock.

Are you asking why a bullpup sks would have a scope? Don't.  The scope has the illuminated retical to help locate targets quickly in low light.  The beauty of the bullpup rifle is that it's compact and retains the full length barrel so it is accurate at long range.

With the scope zeroed I was able to hit 12"" reactive targets up to 150 yards.  I am sure its accurate to much farther than I can shoot.

The bullpup conversion makes this a really practical tactical weapon that you can move and shoot with in confined spaces.  

I love the SKS - right now I dont need this rifle.  I have to say that having recently fired an AK47 after owning this sks for some time - the sks is more fun to shoot.  The AK kicks more with the same ammunition.  The sks is more stable - the AK wants to jump all over the place.  I have fired neither at full auto and I believe I would rather have a full auto sks than the AK as well.

My son prefered to use a REDDOT optic on this because it let him engage targets quicker and my older eyes need the magnification.

Sig Sauer Desert Digital Camo Combo - 556 & 9mms set.

The Desert Digital Special Edition is a matched set featuring the SIG556® ER folding stock rifle and P226® pistol in 9mm. Both rifle and pistol share unique matching serial numbers and ship in a custom tactical hard carry case by Pelican. SIG556 features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. The set includes (1) double 30 round magazine set for the rifle and (3) 15 round magazines for the pistol. A brass certificate of authenticity is included. This collectors edition is limited to 1500 units total.

It also comes with 2 30 round uzi magazines that can be modified to fit this weapon by grinding down the sides of the mags ever so slightly and cutting the mag catch. It comes with 2 25 round FG mags that can be made to fit by adding the magazine catch and taking a little material off the front of the follower.
If you have the right tools, this process is very simple. I just never got around to it because I don't have the time and unfortunately 30 round factory mags are not yet imported to the US so this is the only option.

It has a “beefed up” top strap to increase the strength of the frame so that it can handle the more powerful .357 magnum cartridge. This rare stainless steel small revolver has been sent to Magna Port for porting and full on custom action job. Magna Port does not stamp every gun they port only full custom guns. This is a once in a life time gun. It shows no wear other than as small drag line between the cylinder stops. It is complete with its original case. This is one of Colt’s more scarce revolvers with a very short production run. Magna Port was and still is the best and will make this gun more manageable firing hot .357 magnum loads. This is a very cool gun and would make a great addition to any Colt collection."

Weight of the gun makes the 40 feel like a 9, and 10mm feel like a 40. Both barrels are bull profile. If I had to estimate, it's probably had 100 40 cal and 50 10mm rounds through it. Nothing wrong with it al all, I just don't keep guns long and I have other 10mm's in the collection.

   All original parts except front spring cap, magazines and barrel (barrel was produced in 1942 as well). 

If the original owner had not inscribed into the handle (what looks like a soldiers ID number, which is barely visible) it would be worth a lot more money. Although I personally  it adds to the guns character!  

Gun is in great condition and includes original holster and 5 magazines along with case. 

Also Along with the factory grips I'm including a set of black pearl grips with gold leaf colt emblems on each side.

The bore looks brand new. Typical storage and service wear on the stock is present. The toe of the stock had a small repair that has degraded over the years, but nothing serious. Spots/discoloration on the bolt can be polished out if desired. Bluing is worn on corners and non-existent on the butt pad, and cleaning rod. De-cosmolened without the use of harsh chemicals or boiling water.

I have not fired this rifle, but I can image that it will perform well with quality ammo due to the excellent bore and crown.
