It has ""Acciaio - Speciale - Extra"" on one of the barrels. It has 27 1/2"" barrels. It is a 12 gauge side by side shotgun, break barrel. It has fixed chokes- I had a gun shop look at it and he said they chokes were full and modified - I think the right barrel is the full, and the left barrel is the modified. There are markings on the underside of the barrel that delineate the chokes, but I cannot decipher them. Markings look like ""1410 18,4 17,3"" and 20,3 70 18,3 17,6"". Markings under barrel and on receiver have a bird (similar to a crane or heron) sitting on a triangle with ""VBG"" in the triangle, has ""PSF"" with a 5 point star surrounded by sun. It has a metal shield in the buttstock, and sling swivels on the buttstock and about half way up the barrel. Stock has a few dings from storage, and finish on barrels is very nice-  It is a dual trigger. The bores in the barrels are so perfect I wondered if the gun had ever been fired, but I was told that it was. this is an all matching number gun, and has beautiful scroll work on it, and is in very good shape. It comes with a Sears Ted Williams Faux fur lined gun bag. Please ask any questions. Gun is registered in my name, and I would prefer to sell in Massachusetts- Must have FID or LTC and present it to me at time of sale. I will do the transfer paperwork in person at completion of sale. 

i have lots of pictures. Beautiful gun!

I am putting a $500 starting price on this gun, but am willing to entertain offers."

There is no barrel bushing at the front of the weapon, such as on the Colt.  The guide rod and recoil spring are made as a unit, as is the hammer and sear assembly.  The trigger pivots, and the connector runs on the left side of the gun, unlike the Colt and M1935A, which use a stirrup-shaped connector.  The barrel has a Browning-style swinging link, but instead of the usual locking lugs on the barrel, the chamber has a sharp shoulder on its top front which engages a shallow cut in the roof of the slide.  This locking method was later widely copied by SIG-Sauer, Glock, and Kel-Tec, among others."

This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote."" MSRP $1819/ $1757 (make offer)

From the website for the M4A1:

""The Daniel Defense M4A1 features the M4A1 RIS II, which has been in use by US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II Weapons System since 2005. The M4A1 features a 14.5” Cold Hammer Forged M4 Profile barrel with a permanently attached Daniel Defense Flash Suppressor. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip."" MSRP $1819 / $1757 (make offer)

From the website for the M4 V11 Mil-Spec+:

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. This rifle is finished in Mil Spec+™ Cerakote™. MSRP $1729 $1671 ( make offer)

The Umarex Octane has a ReAxis gas-piston- SilencAIR integral silencer and a 3-year warranty. If you like to hunt- then the gas-piston will go a long way toward making your hunting trips more enjoyable. Leaving your air rifle cocked a bit longer while you wait for your prey to become available won't hurt your gun at all since it has no metal mainspring. Lastly- the 3-year warranty is 3x longer than what most other manufacturers offer. If you're concerned about the integrity and the life of a gas spring- know that Umarex is there to support you.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

So the Affordable Care Act turned out to be less than affordable for my family... and I have medical bills. Yikes. So, to help make ends meet, I'm selling off some stuff I don't need and seldom use. Lots of stuff here... 

1) Hi-Point 995 9mm carbine in a modified ATI stock with Hogue grip, bipod, custom-mounted Magpul rail sections and a UTG red/green dot. Comes with 3 mags (2 factory, 1 promag). This thing is pretty darn accurate, popping clays from 50yds with roughly 8/10 consistency medium speed. The irons DO co-witness with the sight. $375 w/ optic, $350 w/o. 

2) J.W. 2000 12ga. SxS coach gun. Fun! Shot roughly 50 times, this sports dual exposed hammers and dual triggers. Nicely done checkering on the wood, as well. If you've ever handled one of these at Fleet Farm, these are always tough to break open... not so with this one! Barrels break super easy and lockup is nice and tight! $250

3) T53 Mosin Nagant sporting an m44 stock. This is quite possibly the nicest t53 I've ever owned. The bore boasts strong rifling and a mirror finish. Also, this has probably the lightest stock trigger of any Mosin I've held. This puppy breaks at just a hair over 3lbs to just under 3.5lbs!

4) Beretta U22 NEOS .22 target pistol. This pistol is a very solid target pistol that has been very reliable for me (standard bulk-pack duds not withstanding).

We accept all major credit cards with a 3.5% ccard fee added to the total. We are a dealer so all ATF rules apply including a complete background check unless you have a current Nevada ccw permit. The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I am looking to trade because I realized shooting a Glock 31 that I like the bigger Glock better. 

If you want to buy,  send me an offer,  no low ballers - not desperate to sell,  because I want to trade. 

Let me know if interested  and I will send more pictures."

It has a sling attachment point on the stock and on the barrel band on the rifle. It also has a bayonet lug for a traditional M1 Carbine. The rifle will come with all the original manufacturer items, along with 2 10 round mags, and a 15 round Beretta 92 magazine. FMJ and JHP rounds have fed this rifle without any problems as well, and it is relatively light weight so good for any applications and shooters that would work well with a pistol. Honestly the only reason I am selling it is because I don't own a Beretta 92 so I don't have a stock of mags for it, and I'd rather have a pistol caliber carbine that I can use my current pistol mags with.

I have decided that I will list my glock in order to find a specific brand of firearm. I have dumped quite a bit of cash into this glock, and although it is as nice as can be, I have never shot it. It is brand new, unfired. This is my gen 4 glock 19, and I have a ton of extras with it. The package is valued at 800/850 as is, I don't intend to separate. I am not rushing to dump this gun, it makes for the best daily carry and nightstand gun ever. This pistol includes-

Trijicon HD night sights, green/orange
TLR-1H with defensive strobe
Three glock 19 mags (15 rounds)

K Rounds OWB holster, fully adjustable (65.00 from the custom shop)

I have approximately 320 rounds through it.  It had all the recall work done years ago, so everything was upgraded/fixed and there's no peening or other signs of trouble that were common with the earlier models.

Includes:
3 - IMI Israeli 35-round steel magazines (two are like-new, the original one that came with the rifle has a lot of finish wear and just this last range trip starting causing some feeding issues, so it probably needs a new spring)

If you have any legitimate questions (don't ask if this is still for sale or what my bottom dollar is) feel free to ask.  I can e-mail more pictures if you want, but I can't text any.  I wish I could keep this, but my family needs the money right now, so I'm looking for something I might use more plus some money for our bills.

The Galil's design is based on the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle. It was selected as the winner of a competitive bid for the Israeli Army that included many other designs and was formally introduced into service in 1972."

Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

Note: AR with no flash hider is much quieter to shoot, Point being, some compensators, flash hiders and brakes will direct a lot of gas to the sides and up. So goes the noise, and they get much louder to the shooter and those beside them.
This A2 upper assembly has a 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore, standard pivot pin holes, and it's in excellent condition under 500 rounds fired. To many toys, need cash, no trades please---Sacramento area only---too lazy to ship
Very low round count on both"
