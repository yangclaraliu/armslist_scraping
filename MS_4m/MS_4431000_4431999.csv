This is a CMP Rifle.  The stock is in good condition but has its fair share of dings.  Wood is well preserved.  The finish is good.  Internals are perfect.  I just did a field strip and its flawless.  I shot this rifle ONE time. This is not a worn out old M1.  Although any M1 is a piece of history this one is a shooter.  It gauges ""1"" at the Muzzle and ""2"" at the throat.  My best friend is High Master and he put 5 shots in prone at 200 yards and all were covered by a fist.  He claims this rifle is capable of being used in the national matches at Camp Perry or any other Service Rifle Match."

From them:
The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I also have three aftermarket mags that work well, a larger mag pouch that carries 4 mags and a really nice Bianchi holster.

As for the gun itself, it has about 500 rounds through it and I have kept it nice and shiny and clean. I have added some grip tape to both the grip and the slide which is really helpful when your hands sweat. I have also replaced the guide rod and recoil spring. I have a heavier rod and a stiffer spring, both which decrease the amount of felt recoil. Last but not least, I have installed a Powder River Precision Match trigger kit. There is barely any creep and no over travel in the trigger.

I am also including 600 rounds of 9mm 115gr ammo. (Manufacturer is RWS).

This ammo is going for $30-$50 more than my asking price per 500rds right now due to possible sanctions still in the air on Russian ammo. Have a decent amount but prefer to sell atleast 500 rounds as I need to use the ammo can for other ammo and need the extra space in my Safe.

The Wilson Combat Classic features the timeless look and function of a traditional full house 1911 pistol, considered by many to be the optimum marriage of a full featured match and carry pistol. Over the years, one of the most popular improvements to a 1911 pistol has been improving the sights. Typically that has meant incorporating an adjustable sight on the rear. We use our own Wilson Lo-Mount Adjustable Rear Sight – many people consider it to be the best in the world. If you have ever encountered broken adjustable rear sights, try this one and you will understand why it is so popular. If you ever shoot in low light situations, I can add tritium inserts. If you love the traditional full size 1911 pistol, the Wilson Combat Classic will greatly exceed your expectations. Regardless if it is for home defense, personal carry, or competition, this firearm will meet your needs.
