Here's what it has:

Green polymer stock
Bent bolt and scope rail
Timney match trigger (adjustable from 1.5 to 4 lbs. of pull, single stage, breaks like a glass rod)
It also has a 2 position safety which is much better than the ""plunger"" safety that standard Mosin's come with.
6-24x Tasco High Country Scope

  I also have the original stock Mosin trigger that you can swap out if you don't like the Timney trigger.  The original trigger will come with the kit at no extra cost.

  The extractor has been honed so you don't have to do the Mosin slap in order to close the bolt.  Just a firm turn will close it.

  Here is my price breakdown on the whole kit:

$250 Mosin Rifle & Stock
$80 Timney Trigger
$60 Tasco Scope

  Total value: $390.  I doubt you can build one yourself for any cheaper than that.

It has a 32"" ported barrel with a high post vent rib and a white front sight with white mid-bead. The receiver is beautifully engraved and features gold inlay Buckmarks on either side. This gun is in very good condition with the exception of one unfortunate ding on the bottom of the forearm above the release lever. It's about the size of a match head and just barely broke through the clear coat. There are a few other very tiny handling marks consistent with normal use. The action is still very hard to open and the lever sits well right, so this gun has not seen too much use. Overall I would rate the condition at 96%. The barrel takes Invector Plus Choke tubes and comes with one Full choke installed. This gun does include the original box which contains some spare front sight options and an extra trigger."

Not a single failure of any kind, with all sorts of ammo. This thing is dead accurate, with a much better trigger than any other single stack subcompact 9mm, and I've owned a lot of those. Only reason I'm selling is because I'm downsizing to a much smaller 380 for deep concealment. 

Comes with one 6-round flush magazine, and 7 round and 8 round extended mags. Also has original box and papers (purchased new from Kevin's a couple months ago), DeSantis Superfly pocket holster, and Fobus paddle holster. 


The extra mags cost $40+ apiece, and holsters were $20+ apiece, so please don't offer me the Bud's Gun Shop price. The Ruger LC9-S and S&W Shield don't even compare. I'd prefer trades in the Glock, SIG, Walther and HK domain, and only in 9mm. Or an S&W Bodyguard or Ruger LCP plus $300 cash.

I've lowered the price more than I should, the price if firm.  

You won't find a better deal for this rifle that comes with a lifetime supply of magazines!

I've fired about 100 rounds through it and followed Armalite's manual for proper barrel break-in. I've always gotten at least 1 MOA accuracy at 200 yards. The rifle's accuracy limitations are only the shooter's ability. That's the farthest distance I had the chance to shoot it. 

Check Armalite's website for more info if you are not familiar with this rifle.

Rifle Comes With:
1 - 10 rd magazine
5 - 20 rd magazine
Original Box and Paper work (the manual comes with factory paper work)

Buyer pays for shipping if it has to be mailed to an FFL. For a long gun, anyone can ship a rifle to another FFL so long as there is a copy of their FFL and my driver's license in the box. However, I know a local gun dealer who says he'd mail it for me if that makes you feel better. I will take paypal or money orders for a non-local purchase. I'd ask for 20 cents as test (if using paypal). For a local purchase, my preference is also that the buyer meets at a local gun store and covers transfer costs. That is pretty much the fairest and safest way to do this.

This rifle started life as a ""spare parts"" build or ""Franken"" AR, but it has turned out to be a pretty nice little rifle.  The receiver is an Anderson Arms lower, finished off with an assortment of quality lower parts that were sitting in my parts bin.  Everything works as it should.  The buffer tube is a commercial-spec carbine tube, but the Magpul stock that is on it is a fixed-style stock they make for the carbine tubes.  To make the lower look a little more battle-worn to match the upper, I spent a lot of time putting wear on all the parts and places that get beat up on a real military lower receiver.  Everything functions like new, but the lower looks like it has been beat around a military armory for a decade or two, just like the Colt upper.

The upper receiver started as a Colt surplus M16 upper receiver, and was completed with new A2 sight parts and ejection port cover.  It's a nice worn Colt gray color.  I added a Sota Arms 16"" 5.56 barrel, A2 front sight gas block and A2 flash hider.  The bolt and bolt carrier are from Shadow Ops.

Furniture is all from Magpul's MOE line.  The front handguard and the grip are from the ""slim line,"" and the stock is a fixed stock designed for carbine buffer tubes.  It's all in Stealth Gray color.  The rifle also comes with one Magpul black M3 30-round PMAG.

Not pictured, but also included are a picatinny rail adapter for the carry handle that allows you to mount a scope, and a partial box of Fiocchi brass .223 rounds.

This rifle has only been shot once to function check it and make sure everything ran right.  After building it, I just realized I didn't really need it.  I prefer shooting my registered short-barreled .300 BLK and .458 SOCOM AR15s more than a standard 16"" 5.56 rifle.  But it's a good rifle, and if it doesn't sell, it will live happily in my gun chest.

Mainly looking to sell, but if you have any interesting trades to offer, drop me an message.  Might consider trades for the right 1911, but overall I'd prefer to sell outright.  Also feel free to make an offer if you don't think the price is right."

If you're unfamiliar with the ballistics of this caliber, it is slightly faster than a 300 Winchester Magnum. Recoil on the rifle isn't bad.

I need to get rid of this this week so if you would like to make an offer, please do. Having said that, please do not low ball.

Let me know if you are interested. Text is best 503- six one six- 6 sevn seven 5. You need to have an Oregon Drivers license to purchase and must sign a bill of sale.

But he speaks the truth!!  Kevlar degrades with heat, moisture and most specifically - sweat.  You CAN run a vest past the expiration dates given by the manufacturer and still receive some protection from the panels.  But only if the vest has spent most of its time hanging in a closet or riding around in the back seat of a scout car.  If you are looking at used body armor, take a look at the ballistic panels inside the carrier.  If they are soiled, stained and discolored - DON'T FREAKING BUY IT! Some newer vests have the panels heat-sealed inside plastic covers that repel moisture.  They will last longer than older vests with panels sewn inside cloth wraps.  Still, Kevlar will degrade as a natural process.  So even a clean panel (or one sealed inside a plastic cover) that's five years past the expiration date wont provide the protection reflected on the tag.  If you are playing paintball, any old rotted body armor should do the trick.  If you are playing with actual bullets (or the other guy is) I would be very careful what I wore - and I am, just ordered a new vest myself."

Arguably the most sought after 1911 in the world. 

The Professional is a full custom pistol that begins with a national match frame which has the oversized slide rails cut into the frame in the Springfield Geneseo machine shop. It uses all custom parts, including the Springfield Custom tool steel hammer & sear, S&A mag well, Wilson ambi thumb safety, Novak low mount rear sight, dovetail front sight, match skeletonized trigger, standard guide rod system, and 6 specially tuned Metalform 7 round magazines. These pistols are hand assembled by custom gunsmiths in the Geneseo custom shop, under the supervision of master gunsmith David Williams. The Professional models meet or exceed all specifications of the FBI SWAT contract, including the accuracy requirement of 1.5"" or better at 25 yards with Remington Golden Saber ammunition. The civilian pistols and the FBI pistols are built at the same time, with the gunsmiths never knowing whether a civilian or FBI agent will be using the pistol. These pistols are built approx. every 45 days, with the FBI order being filled first and civilian orders getting all of the remaining from the production run. These pistols do not have front cocking serrations or full length guide rods because the FBI chose not to have these features on their pistols. (Front cocking serrations catch on clothing and full length guide rods require additional tools for disassembly.) These pistols are finished with the Black T finish done by Walter Birdsong in MS.

Serial # 102817

The Model 742 was one of only five Remington models that exceeded one Million Rifles Produced, 1,433,269 to be exact. However, Remington tooled only 2% or a meager 28,665 rifles in the 6mm Rem Cartridge. The 6mm Rem is modest in recoil and fun to shoot at either the range or in the field. Its high velocity and flat trajectory provides for outstanding accuracy. The rifle includes a Kassner 2X-7X x 32  nitrogen filled fully coated image-movement Japan. Top of the line scope in it's day.

The scope is a flip down model commonly called a Bush Scope. Very convenient for going from bush hunting to field shooting.
Both front and rear factory sights are also intact.

Marlin 39A ""Mountie"" rifle chambered in 22S, 22L and 22LR. Bluing is about 98%, with only light freckling on the left side of the receiver. There are also a few very minor scuffs and scratches (shown in the pics below). Wood buttstock and forend are oiled finish and are at about 90-95% condition with fairly minimal damage and dings from over fifty years of use. The buttstock is the hard-to-find straight-stock version. The ""P"" serial number prefix indicates manufacture in 1957, and this beauty was built EARLY in 1957 - before the ""Marlin 39A Mountie"" roll-mark was initiated. Also note that the capacity for this is as high as 20 shots, but GB only goes up to 19, so we had to choose 19 in order to list the 39A.The barrel is 20"" long, the bore is shiny and clean and the rifling is strong. Capacity is (20) 22 Short, (16) 22 Long or (15) 22 Long Rifle cartridges.

I have a Sig P320 Compact 9mm for sale.  Excellent condition, comes with everything as buying new, 2 15 round mags.  I have another one with night sights and don't need 2.  About 400 rounds through it.  Handles very well, and is comparable to a Glock 19 in size / weight.  I think the trigger is a little smoother than the Glock and it seems to fit my hand better.  Super easy to maintain, and within seconds you can remove the fire control module to allow for thorough cleaning or to change out a frame or slide.  http://www.sigevolution.com/p320 .  Comes with box, manual, lock, paddle holster.  

If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED (text/call). Please be 21 with a current handgun permit and we can complete bill of sale. No permit, we can do transfer at FFL in Valparaiso. We can meet at the Bass Pro in Portage for transfer, so if you can't make it there, this probably isn't the gun for you. I can appreciate the need to try and haggle, because I do that myself, but please be respectful.  My price is very reasonable but if you can find it elsewhere for less, I encourage you to buy it there, but please don't try to use that as a bargaining tool.

Thanks for looking and have a great day / night."

950,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4194950,For Sale/Trade:  Lot for trade/sale at Lake Sherwood Estates,"Lake Sherwood Estates, St. Louis, Missouri","$ 1,500","Listed On: Thursday, July 16, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Come out to Lake Sherwood Estates private community and enjoy the multiple lakes to swim, fish, boat or just relax. The main lake allows small boats up to 20' and pontoons to 24'. Or kayak and canoe the coves or the swim docks by the Dam. There is a beach with a roped off swim area, life guards and security. They have a pool, club house, seasonal cafe, sand volleyball, Marina and picnic areas throughout. The 15 acre and smaller lakes allow electric powered fishing boats, kayaks, canoes, etc. Guard shack and patrols keep the place quiet and relaxing and your lot and boat safe. No back trails with ATV's screaming around, etc. 

I bought a .25 acre lot to allow my family and friends to come enjoy the lake, beach, fishing and campground over a year ago. My Mom loved it so much she bought a lot also. So I am putting this one up for trade or sale so you and yours can enjoy as well. All my taxes $60 a year, and my monthly assessment $90 a month (or going out to dinner with two kids twice, lol) are all current and paid up. You can also pay it quarterly and yearly to save a few dollars. I am not dumping my debt or problems, we love the place! But why have two family members pay the assesments? Alot of lot only owners bought steep unbuildable lots and put an APPROVED shed or gazebo up to just enjoy the place without building a home, no moblie homes or RV's allowed. Our lot has the perfect grade for a walkout and nice yard. The lot next door 1598 Marion owned by Lake Sherwood Estates has an asking price of $11,000.00 and a drainage ditch down the middle?!? The brick ranch across the street was going for $180,000.00 last year. 

My lot 1599 Marion has a trade value of $1750.00 and a cash value of $1500.00 . Why so cheap, whats wrong with it? NOTHING. Just passing on the deal I got, that is typical asking price unless it is MAIN or secondary lake side property. Some are cheaper and further from the lake or almost have a cliff side slope. Or some owe so many back taxes and assesments they can't dig out. I will still be at the beach and enjoying the place this year and many more. But using Mom's guest list and gate pass to get in. So why pay twice??

Why take a once a year vacation when you can do it every weekend? Pack the cooler and beach gear and come enjoy, a boat is not necessary but a fishing pole helps.  It is located close the intersection of Hwy T and Hwy D. Close to Wentzville, Wright City, Warrenton, Washington, New Melle, etc. It takes us 35min from driveway to beach down Hwy 70."
