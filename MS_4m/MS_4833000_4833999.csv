They are called B Barrels because of the ""B"" stamped on the barrel which is indicates that they were assembled with with barrel blanks from Belgium. The total production of B Barrel M39 is believed to be between 9-10,000 although exact figures are not known. Even though the barrels are all dated 1942, B-Barreled M39's were all assembled post war using refurbished parts. The receiver was manufactured in 1893 by Chatellerault, making this an antique rifle. B Barrels are famous for their plum colored barrel, due to the nickel-rich composition of the steel used in those Belgian barrels. I've seen much more distinct plum coloring on other B Barrels, but the color difference between the receiver and the barrel on this rifle is definitely noticeable (see pics).

Stock is in excellent condition, blueing is good and the bore is clean. Since B Barrel M39s were are assembled from refurbished parts, the numbers do not match and you will find markings from all over (ie, Tula floorplate, Chatellerault receiver w/ scrubbed Imperial Eagle).

  I bought this Walther PK380 about 2 years ago when I was working at a gun store.  I've never fired this gun and I have basically kept it packed away.  I'd say it is technically NIB.  I was hoping I would get around to shooting this as I have heard that it truly is a nice sidearm.  Its a super comfortable and compact pistol.  Its very easy to work the slide and it would be a great gun for CC.  It comes with everything pictured  (50 rounds PMC bronze FMJ and 30 rounds of Speer hollow points).  I'm sure I have the pistol lock around here somewhere but, if not I believe I have a trigger lock as a substitute.  I have priced it to sell quickly but rest assured this gun is brand new, never fired and you will receive the extra ammo too!  Thanks for looking.

Ryumon Samurai Sword Imperial Katana

Welcome to the flagship model of the Ryumon Samurai Swords. The Imperial Katana is handcrafted by the sword makers over at the Ryumon forge who have been handforging katana for generations. It all starts with a hand forged and folded AISI 1060 High carbon steel blade.

The blade is sharpened and hand polished to perfection leaving only a distinctly unique hamon. The tsuka is wrapped in authentic top grade rayskin and Japanese cotton.

The Akagane (red copper) tsuba has an incredible look of design and authenticity. The wood saya is coated in rich black lacquer and has a rayskin covered throat.

If you search ""Dr. Robert ballistics"" and go to the ar15 forum and look at the tests in bare and heavy clothed ballistic gel, they perform best in either caliber or weight of any of those tested. Perfect penetration (plus p falls a bit short of the mark), largest cavity, and widest diameter, sometimes almost double. 12 inches penetration and double diameter is about all you can ask for. Perform well through all barriers, in both 9mm weights and the 180 grain .40. Velocity really doesn't mean much except unnecessary recoil (excluding magnums and the like, but still unnecessary recoil). I switched from Gold Dot +P only to HST standard only (Ranger T 124+p is the exception to that and the plus p not worth it rule)  I had to buy 5 boxes (50 round boxes, i.e. 250 rounds) of each to get them. I already sold some .40, but have 2 left since I'm selling my .40. I am selling them for $30 each (50 round boxes). The  civilian version, which you're lucky to find even +P (expand no more than standard, more recoil, and LESS penetration because of opening earlier from velocity) sells at $30 or so for only 20 rounds. $30 for 50 is a steal. You don't have to buy all 6. I will likely give a discount if you do though (like $160 instead of $180). These are all new production in their original boxes. REDACTED."

I am trying to clean out my gun closet and can’t do any trades so all prices are cash.  I will also not ship firearms.
Lowball offers will not be responded to.
Regarding the transfer procedure, there is a pawnshop a few miles from my home that will handle the background check and paperwork for $20 which includes the state fee.  If you decide to purchase the firearm, we can arrange to meet there and you will pay me for the rifle and then make payment arrangements with him for the transfer."

Discription - 
Trijicon's longest-range scope ever, the AccuPoint 5-20x50 riflescope gives tactical shooters, varmint hunters, and law enforcement snipers the ability to accurately extend their range in any light. The scope is outfitted with the company's advanced fiber optics technology and tritium aiming-point illumination, which speeds target acquisition even at dusk or under heavy cloud cover. That's because the scope's dual illumination system automatically adjusts the brightness level and contrast of the reticle to available light conditions--without the need for failure-prone batteries. As a result, the scope won't let you down during critical moments in the field, a must when trying to bag elusive game. The scope also includes a manual brightness adjustment override, so you can control the light output of the fiber optics to your personal preference. And to boost clarity, the scope offers a multilayer lens coating that lets in a ton of light without distorting the image.

The AccuPoint body is crafted from aircraft-quality hard-anodized aluminum to ensure a lifetime of use, with all-weather construction to protect against the tougher elements. Other advanced elements include a 30mm tube that offers a greater range of mounting options; unmatched long eye relief to protect against high-impact recoil from high-caliber rifles; easy-to-use external turret controls for windage and elevation adjustment; and a side parallax adjuster for enhanced accuracy at long range.

This is a very interesting rifle in that it is reminiscent of the war expedient sniper rifles used by forces during the Yugolsav Wars in the 90s. I have been unable to confirm whether or not this rifle came out of such conflict, but its features are somewhat indicative of possible militia use and not of gunsmithing in the US: The rifle serial number appears on the mount, stock and bolt, the bolt was bent to clear the scope, and there is carving (possible ""trench art"") on the right side of the stock depicting a howling wolf.
The side mount has clearly been professionally installed as it is rock solid and straight. The bore on the rifle is dark, but has very crisp and strong rifling. I have shot this rifle and it is very fun, accurate and reliable with surplus ammunition. The scope works perfectly (all turrets work) and the illuminated reticule works perfectly (this version has an adjustable focus as well).
I will only sell to a NH resident with a valid NH driver's license and a holder of a valid Conceal Carry Permit (no exceptions and no shipping to other states). I am only looking for cash... I am not interested in trades or vehicle services, etc., etc."

very presentable spreewerk manufactured p38 9mm pistol . ""cyq"" as can be seen on the left side of the frame indicates this P.38 was manufactured at Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin, Germany. CYQ was simply the code the Germans used for that factory so that Allies could not target specific small arm factories (similar to ""ac"" for Walther and ""byf"" for Mauser)
all matching with original magazine, serial numbers on frame, barrel, slide, & locking block match correctly' this is not a russian capture frankenstein pistol', rather being an original wartime nazi issued pistol possibly being used for post war police/military having replaced walnut grips. Minimal internal wear, shiny bore with strong grooves. decocker works fine as well as loaded chamber indicator, crisp break on the trigger, all in all a rock solid piece!
holster reads wunderlich berlin 1963. only issue being import marked very discreetly on the backstrap under the beavertail. 'very minute you wouldn't even notice' 


orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.

She's old and has rust but was bought as a beater truck to haul and pull a trailer.  The front tank was disconnected when I bought her, so she'll need a new tank.  All hardlines and electrical is there. and working.  Tank with pump installed and new straps runs $300 from Rockauto.  I haven't put a new tank in the front as I drive local only and she's a weekend truck. Exhaust is solid with a newer muffler from the previous owner, but she needs new hangers welded in as they hung it using wire.  She's far from perfect but she gets compliments anywhere I drive her...lol.  


Trade value on the truck without the new crap is $2500.  All of the new items are within the last 3 months and ran me about $2500....so a trade value of about $3700 is a fair point.


Looking for a long range precision rifle in the Surgeon, AI, GA, or Remington action flavor.  Looking to stay at .308 or 6mm.  With or without glass is acceptable.  I'll also entertain high end 1911 offers

First is the most comfortable IWB holster on the market today. The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster. $60
The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster is the ultimate IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster. It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!

Second is the extremely popular Blackhawk Serpa Sportster Holater. $30
Designed for civilian concealed carry or range use, the SERPA CQC Sportster Holster is constructed of injection molded polymer for long-lasting durability. It features the same dependable SERPA technology but is specifically tailored for low-threat civilian operation.
• SERPA® Auto Lock™ release
• Passive retention detent adjustment screw
• Gunmetal gray holster body with black locking mechanism
• Speed-cut design for rapid draw, target acquisition and re-holster

Yes this is posted in the right place (CA). Yes, any legal gun owner may transfer this to him or herself, face to face at any FFL dealer. Just because CA made a list this remarkable pistol didn't make, FFL dealers cannot sell to anyone except LE or through private party transfer. So you do not see many of these in CA. Well I ordered two from different distributors to see who would get it first. Well they both came available in the same week. So. .. I don't need two. Here you go legal CA firearm owners...I'm taking the best offer starting today. You get everything in the picture. No magazines?? No... unfortunately CA law does not allow me to transfer those for obvious reasons. I know it sucks but you can order them from many places. I recommend Sig Sauer's website or cheaperthandirt.com. You will most likely have the magazines before you pick up the gun after the 10 day wait. Before you order,  understand the modularity of this particular firearm. Any 9mm Sig P250 or P320 magazine will function flawlessly. I'm pretty sure if you're searching for a P320, you totally understand so no need to go on about that but if you have any more questions, please research or even email me. Anyway. .. back to this pistol. . 

It is in new condition, meaning never fired, carried, or loaded. I have not registered it through Sig Sauer for warranty or recall notification. Cash deals only. Must meet at a local FFL to do transfer paperwork. Buyer pays transfer fees, if you have never owned a gun before please pass or at least do your research if there is ANY reason why you might not be able to buy a gun legally.
