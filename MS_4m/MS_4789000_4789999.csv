Gun trades: Full trade or partial trades are all okay. Looking for Glock, Sks, Ar15, Taurus, I'm not too particular just ask and if it's something I can use I'm interested. 

My camper is not perfect either, canvas needs a little seem work done, the electric motor to raise the top isn't working (I may try to fix this if I have time) It cranks up manually though. It had a roof leak at one time that was repaired. Everything inside works, electric, convertor, A/C. Someone stole the sink and the tabletop stove :( I have another small stainless sink I will give you if you want it. I used a camp stove when I went, BUT that stays with me I still use it. Tires are good, spare is new. Solid floors. Should clean up nice. I lost the title for it someplace but will give you a bill of sale. It's a pretty large camper when opened up and is definitely better than a tent! Cheap camping too. If it ever stops raining I'll try and get more pictures.

We are also looking at flat panel tvs, outdoor furniture, landscaping, a PS4 and games, or might consider Xbox 1 too. Just ask.

Gun trades: Full trade or partial trades are all okay. Looking for Glock, Sks, Ar15, Taurus, I'm not too particular just ask and if it's something I can use I'm interested. 

My camper is not perfect either, canvas needs a little seem work done, the electric motor to raise the top isn't working (I may try to fix this if I have time) It cranks up manually though. It had a roof leak at one time that was repaired. Everything inside works, electric, convertor, A/C. Someone stole the sink and the tabletop stove :( I have another small stainless sink I will give you if you want it. I used a camp stove when I went, BUT that stays with me I still use it. Tires are good, spare is new. Solid floors. Should clean up nice. I lost the title for it someplace but will give you a bill of sale. It's a pretty large camper when opened up and is definitely better than a tent! Cheap camping too. If it ever stops raining I'll try and get more pictures.

I am a tight wad and looking to stay at or below $300 if possible. A Remington 710/770, Mossberg 100, Ruger American, or Savage Axis will do. Doesn't have to have a scope.

Located in Pinehurst but willing to meet at a reasonable time and place for the right deal.

I have pistol purchase permits in hand and a NCDL to simplify the process and I have no problem signing a bill of sale.

When replying, please include details and price.

MAXIMUM $300 to spend.

Thank you in advance!"

I currently have a Trifecta FH installed on the barrel.  If you want the Trifecta add $50 to the price.  I can swap out a standard A2 flash hider for no extra cost.  The charging handle has the RTV seal on the rear portion.  For those that shoot suppressed you know the benefits of the RTV seal.  It works great to keep gas out of your face when shooting suppressed. 

The Primary Arms 1-4 scope is not included in the price.  I can include it for an extra $100.  It's a great scope for the price.   

Sell complete upper with A2 flash hider installed for $350.  If you want the PA 1-4 scope and Trifecta flash hider add $150.  I will not sell the scope and flash hider before the upper sells. 

Here's a list of the parts used for this upper:
-16"" 1:7 stainless lightweight barrel
-Daniel Defense low profile gas block
-mid length gas system
-Nordic Components free float rail
-A3 upper receiver with m4 feed ramps

Includes 2 magazines and everything mentioned above.  Will include the little bit of ammo in the mags for FTF sale, but otherwise cannot ship together (obviously) due to USPS/BATFE rules.  Pricing at less than I paid for all the parts (significantly less, actually) because I need to sell it ASAP.

I've been keeping it in a basic OEM Stag Arms hard case - you can have that if you want.

Fired 3 shots rapid-fire after completion, just to ensure build wasn't faulty and it cycled correctly.  Other than that, haven't had time to fire it.

Practically brand new. All original factory. Less than 100 rounds through the barrel. Comes with a cleaning kit, cleaning rod and dis-assembly tool, which are all stored behind the flip up metal butt plate in the stock. (see photos). A very soft shooting .308 semi-auto, thanks to the heavy duty and ultra reliable M1A action.

Rear Sight Enlarged Military Aperture .135 w/ MOA Adjustment For Both Windage and Elevation Magazines 1 - 10 Round, Parkerized Steel Stock Black Composite The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design. Comes with a short piece of picatinny rail, that goes under the last two inches of the stock near the barrel, if you want to connect a light or laser, bipod, etc. See ""Versa Pod 150-807B Conversion Accessory Picatinny Rail Mount M1A and M14 (Socom/Synthetic Stock)"" on Amazon. Also comes with a cleaning kit, cleaning rod and dis-assembly tool that is already contained in the metal butt stock, which I bought extra and added. Also comes with (1) Colorado-legal, very nice 10 round parkerized steel magazine that originally came with the rifle from the factory. Nice and compact for hunting, doesn't stick out much. Original from the factory, it has a piece of picatinny rail on top to mount optics, but it is not the ridiculous setup of the SOCOM II, with all the heavy rails on the sides. Still looks like a traditional M14. I have seen people add wood stocks and leather G.I. sling to make it look even more like a traditional M14. Heavy-duty iron sights and the tritium front post glows for a nice sight picture in low light. I think the cleaning kit and dis-assembly tool was probably $30 and the picatinny accessory rail, made specifically for this rifle so that you retain the sling swivel, is $70 on Amazon, so some nice extras thrown in. It would make an excellent hog hunting rifle. Very quick to the shoulder. If interested, purchaser agrees to pay transfer fee through licensed firearm dealer in Denver metro area. This rifle is FOR SALE only; not interested in trades. Colorado residents only please - I don't want to deal with shipping. Thanks for taking a look."

Some now feature alloy frames.
This pistol was a pre CZ-USA import, Imported by MRI
Some speculate that MRI may have done a trigger job or something else.
The craftsmanship on this gun seems better than those of the newer produced Cz's. The serial was even engraved with a different tooling than what is used today.
Some newer CZ barrels are ""in the white"" meaning can rust if left to the elements. Such as a drastic temperature change or condensation accumulation being left in the car. This pistol has a factory polished barrel and will not have that issue. Cz's today only come in the white or blued. Unless you get a specific or special model. 

The gun is in great condition. DA/SA
comes with a CZ Hard case from a newer model weapon. The original hardcase was not as durable as the newer models. Original factory 16rd mags x2. Also included is a new 18rd factory cz Sp-01 magazine which also fits this weapon. The grip has been upgraded to a rubber combat grip found on some newer models. 

My price is $500 and firm. This can or will be a collectible model for any CZ enthusiast . I have owned several Cz's in my lifetime and have only good things to say about this firearm.

Manufacturer's description:

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16's unique design.The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you'll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you'll have a hard time believing that you're shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquistion capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory's forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect.If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won't let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

Excellent gun, accurate and reliable and excellent for conceal carry. It's roughly had 120rds through it, I have 3-factory Ruger 7-round mags all with pachmyer grip extensions and 1-factory 9-round extended mag. ( these guns come with 1 mag when new and OEM Ruger mags are $39.99 a piece! $120 extra value) also comes with a sticky holster which is great for pocket carry or the small of your back. Also I had some upgrades done and had it serviced and laser sight adjusted by Tactical Advantage Guns in Portage last week so it's ready to go........ The upgrades were just new updated Ruger front and rear sights and replaced factory guide rod with a stainless steel one. Also added a pachmyer tactical grip cover. This gun new with the lasermax laser sight is anywhere from $469-$500 new and I have 4 mags as well and with the sight and guide rod upgrade and holster it would cost well over $600 new. The only flaw with this gun is the finish on the slide has wear due to spending it's life as a carry gun and a center console gun in my truck, doesn't affect anything and polished up great, just being upfront and honest. With all that said I'm asking $400 firm but would trade for a nice 38 special that's +P rated or 357mag revolver or even a Taurus Judge and with revolvers I perfer snubnoses. Will also consider an Glock 43, Springfield XDS or Smith &Wesson M&P shield in 9mm( I will trade + some cash for the right gun) I have my CPL and perfer you do to for easy transaction.

CZ description
This model is a decocker version of the  CZ 75 B model. The decocking lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a loaded chamber for a safe, ‘hammer down’ carry.
CZ 75 B is used by more Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.
* All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts)
* High capacity double column magazines
* Hammer forged barrels
* Ergonomic grip and controls
* Unparalleled accuracy
* Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control
* 3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available)
* Smooth double action and crisp single action
* Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials
* Firing pin block safety
Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

Comes in factory case along with the original factory shipping box.
Included-
2 15 round high capacity magazines
All paperwork
Cleaning brushes

Beware, shipping these are costly!If you do outside gatherings, big yard sales, host outside sales events or have large camping hunting adventures, this is the best tent you can own! I'm willing to consider offers, but do your homework BEFORE you call me. These things are rare and this has generated a lot of interest. No BS offers. All low ball, insulting offers will be ignored.  I love it! The only reason I’m selling it is #1: I don’t use it enough, #2: storage is becoming an issue for me, #3 It takes 4 guys( you can get by with 3) to set up and I’m getting older, #4: I’m wanting a trailer or RV I can move by myself.

The rifle floats when in the stowed configuration.
The rifle is fun to shoot and it is interesting to say the least.
This style of rifle has been made for a long time and have been made by 4 different manufactures.
Some of the older rifles have a bad rep for quality, but not the ones made by Henry!
