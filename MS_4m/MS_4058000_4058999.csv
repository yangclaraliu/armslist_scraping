It was ordered with grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 that came standard on all Super Grades. Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari sights and a Kickeez recoil pad. The stock has fantastic figure and color and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is perfect except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore is mint and looks like it was rifled yesterday. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new and very well cared for. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. Comes in a Browning hand fitted model 1915 safari case with both keys owners manual and care card. The case was purchased in the early 70s and is in mint condition. Also includes a Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased at the same time as the case. One box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solide and one box of empty's. You want ever find another transitional Custom Shop Super Grade this complete or in this condition. Thanks for looking.

Up for your consideration is my Sig Sauer 1911 Fastback Carry with a few extras.  This is an amazing and somewhat rare 1911 with a commander length slide, a fastback frame, and VZ carbon fiber slim grips;  all of which make this an awesome gun to carry. I have shot around 350-400 rounds through it so far, and the only reason I am considering selling this gun is to possibly upgrade to custom 1911.  

-The gun itself cost around 1100.00+ 66.00(tax) =1166.00
http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Sig-Sauer-1911-Carry-Fastback-Handgun&i=733362

-I am also including my Crossbreed inside the waistband holster (black leather/kydex) which cost around 90.00 after shipping.  This holster is amazing and well worth the money, unfortunately it is custom made for a Sig 1911 slide and I will be unable to use it in the future.

-The VZ Etc carbon fiber grips cost 120.00

-You also get both 8 round Sig Sauer mags (original base plates and Wilson combat base plates), the original Case, lock, and the Sig ""range bag"". 

**NOTE**: I am NOT including my Wilson Combat mags or the ammo in these pictures, they were used for display purposes only. In fact, if you are not interested in the grips, I may sell the gun separately from them and keep them for my future project.

As you can see I have around 1376.00 into the gun, and I am asking 1200 obo.  Please use your best judgment if you would like to make me an offer. I have no problem keeping this gun so I will not be taking low ball offers.  

Thanks, Kyle"

The pistol is in excellent shape with minimal wear and roughly 300 rounds through it. For those unfamiliar with the .357 Sig, I would highly advise watching this video as it is a mean self defense round: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lK6KbA-HuZ8&list=PL858978D90283EA35 . I am including in the sale the GLOCK 31 pistol with one magazine, GLOCK competition adjustable sights currently installed, and a hard plastic case. Unfortunately I do not have the original case, paperwork, etc (it's a loooong story) however I will throw in a box of American Eagle target ammo as seen below. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol and it has been extremely well taken care of, it simply does not have the case. My price is non negotiable at a cheap $350. I will not take 349 so don't bother asking for a lower price then $350. This same pistol sells new for $525 plus tax. If it bothers you that it doesn't have a case go to theglockstore.com and order a brand new one for $22  http://www.glockstore.com/glock-factory-parts/glock-factory-gun-case-w-brush-and-rod/glock-factory-gun-case-new-version-w-brush-and-rod . That still only puts you at $375 for a very nice GLOCK pistol, cheapest on ARMSLIST I am willing to bet. Again, don't bother will the low ball crap, you know who you are and no one on here can stand your cheap garbage, as I will not even bother to respond. I'm only selling to fund a side project. If you are interested text ONLY at 513-six3zero-6five5one. I do not check my emails so your offer will not be seen and my schedule does not allow me to answer my phone nor do I answer numbers I do not recognize. Text only please. Local buyers only, I WILL NOT travel, so check the convenient little map button on the top of the ad before wasting my time with an offer. I hate to have to add all of the disclaimers but unfortunately that does happen quite often in here so I apologize to those of you that have common certousy. Thanks for looking and have a good one."

The Trail-Lite offers Buck Mark® lovers improved balance, accuracy and a lighter weight (barrel weighs 6.0 oz). Installation of the Trail-Lite barrel on your existing Buck Mark frame is quick and easy and requires no gunsmithing. 

Let me clarify. Only the barrel is for sale, not the pistol.

The 5.5 inch fluted barrel is getting hard to find and are almost always on back order. New from Tactical Solutions it runs $260.00.   I purchased it used for $200 and received it with a couple of small nicks  (shown in picture) on the barrel which is not seen when installed. I'm guessing they hadn't removed the lower allen screw all the way and tried to pry it a little, not sure why. It does not distract from the way it looks or shoots on the pistol. Shoots great. I've put around 100 rounds through it.

The barrel is gloss black with silver flutes and does come with the thread protector. Will ship for $7 extra."

Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead.

The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results.

Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry.

The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal.

Flat-top receiver, 16.5"" chrome moly barrel, standard A2-type two-piece handguard, and standard Picatinny railed gas block w/forward assist & dust cover. One 7-round magazine.

Is out-of-warranty armor as good as new?  Please review the following information to learn more (link provided below) :

""NIJ tests failed to demonstrate any significant differences in 10-year-old armor, regardless of the extent of use or apparent physical condition.  The warranty exists solely to limit the manufacturer's liability on the product and is not a reflection of the anticipated service life of the product... Guide to Police Body Armor, National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC)... In the absence of abuse such as machine washing, or ultraviolet exposure, Aramid ballistic fiber is good for many, many years.  However, legally, the Manufacturer's Warranty expires after an arbitrary 5 years.""

Blued finish, fixed, typical snubbie sights. 6 chambers as opposed to the typical 5 of J frame types. Comes with wood grips, Pachmayr grips, Leather pistol rug, and an old school leather OWB holster. I got it in a trade, and have not shot it. It appears to have been carried more than it has been shot, and likely, was a backup for a cop back in the day. Which makes it more interesting, since this could have been used to fell several badguys. Anyway, while I am a revolver guy, and appreciate the beauty and history behind this piece, I can't justify owning it. I also do no like the design of Colt wheel guns. They are fine works of craftsmanship, but are not for me.

Or great for a beginner no recoil. It has very nice bluing and wood scales. These are very high quality pistols. Price is $350.00 I will add 200rds of ammo. The knife is not included in this sale.


Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades. It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment .22 LR it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.

Practical, Safe and Reliable

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Beretta.

Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16”, 12.5” and 9” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)
A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*
Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used.  Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

This one (as you can see from the photos) has a shaved grip so that it can accept the 15 round Glock 19 mags, as well as the Glock 17 mags and the 32 round mags.

What you see in the picture is what you get: the rifle, a factory 15 round mag, and a factory 32 round mag.  Also note that this rifle has a single-point sling adapter ring on the right side, which is handy.

A bill-of-sale will be required, and an AL carry permit would make things a lot easier. I am not willing to travel very far from suburban BHM. I prefer to meet anywhere between Trussville and Hoover along I-459.

Arsenal Bulgarian SAM7UF. CHF Chrome lined 16"" barrel, Hammer forged milled receiver. 1200$ Or best offer. Sealed AK Pmag included. 

Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

Has an illuminated reticle and a tremendous amount of eye relief, giving you both the benefit of a medium-range rifle scope and the functionality of a red dot in a lightweight, compact package. 30mm tube lets in a whole lot of light. Battery life on this thing is ridiculously long due to a built-in motion sensor that shuts off the illuminated reticle after 5 minutes and instantly turns it back on upon any sort of motion. The turrets are customizable to your specific caliber and load (you must purchase any custom turrets from Leupold). The SPR reticle is awesome, and is the most expensive reticle Leupold makes for this line of scopes. Includes front and rear Leupold aluminum ultralight magnetic flip covers, which cost $50 each. No box or paperwork. Price is $500 cash, firm. I will throw in a Burris PEPR QD mount for an additional $25 (I will not sell P.E.P.R. mount alone for $25, only if scope is purchased for $500 cash). Any cash offers for less than $500 ($525 with mount) will be ignored. Buyer must pickup in Lake Highlands area. Thanks for looking."

The GSG Rebel AK47 is the only licensed reproduction of the famous Russain developer of the Kalashnikova AK47 rifle.  I have two new ones and this used AK47.  I have been taking it to the range for the past 6 months.  The stock was broke and I ordered a new one.  I was shooting the rifle without the buttstock and it was very accurate without the support of my shoulder.  It took a while to get the stock, as ATI does not make the stock for this rifle.  One of ATI's main business is stocks for standard AK47, AR15 and other carbines.  I had to go to the German website and request the butt stock.  It came a few weeks ago.  I finally got a chance to go shooting with the rifle, it is simply a beauty.  The magazine is on of the best designed.  It takes about a minute to load 24 rounds without a speed loader.  The magazine is spring loaded and the tension can be pulled down by two outside, on either side, tabs.  The safety is large and locks the bolt open after the magazine is empty.  This would be a great training rifle for anyone wanting to shot on the AK47 platform with the expense of the larger ammo.

No longer imported since the mid 1990's, Chinese AK's are some of the best AK's ever made featuring a thicker stamped receiver, heavy barrels, all original foreign built parts, and blued finish. It's probably had 40 rounds through it total and is in excellent original condition. Comes with everything you see here--all original accessories.  I won't sell anything separately.  When I shot it years ago I was blown away by how accurate it was.  I'm selling because I have little kids so paring back on guns.

NO sales to ANY state/locally where this isn't legal. I will NOT modify/remove any components. Payment is Post Office money order and shipping is $40 fully insured to your FFL. Please make sure your dealer will accept a firearm from an individual. It is perfectly legal for an individual to ship a firearm to an FFL, but some dealers like to make up their own rules.  Private party transfers must go through DROS process and you pay all fees (I think $35 in CA).

Rare

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate

The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m.

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.

Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.

Fully Safe

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing."

The rifle has been fitted into a genuine USGI M-14 stock. The original Marlin wooden stock was cracked and I had the M-14 stock, so with only a few very minor modifications the two were fitted together. This is the old style Model 66 with the 17 round tube magazine and the bolt holds open when the magazine is empty and the last round is discharged. Marlin microgroove barrel shoots accurate and it cycles every kind of ammo I have thrown at it. Tasco scope on top is variable power and it's the old Tasco made in Japan before they were sold and relocated. I've taken it to public ranges a few times and it really draws attention. 

I really would prefer to trade rather than sell. My daughter is getting old enough to shoot and I want a .22LR she can shoulder easily. I would like a HK or GSG MP5. I can add cash or ammo to the right deal if you have extras. I would sell outright for the right price, but please understand I am really looking to trade. Thanks for reading my ad, have a great day.

From the Remington website. 
Model 700P LTR (Light Tactical Rifle), chambered for .308 Win. SA Ultra Mag.; features a slimmed down stock to improve portability and reduce weight. The flutes in the 20"" LTR not only assist in weight reduction and heat dissipation, but are engineered to enhance barrel rigidity for pinpoint accuracy.
Like its big brother, the LTR stock is laid up around an aircraft-grade aluminum bedding block that runs up the entire length of the receiver. It has a textured, black, non-reflective finish and comes with sling swivel studs."
