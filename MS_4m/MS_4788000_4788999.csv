Its got a beat up rattle-can camo job on it. 
Comes with 5 20 round mags, a sling, and a rifle case.
Its in great shape mechanically and works every time.
Neverbhad an issue except once with a cheapo magazine.
I tossed that mag in the trash and havent had a failure since.
Has probably ... 1000 rounds through it.  Give or take 100.
This rifle has a better reciever than a springfeild.  Its a forged reciever.  If you dont know how that is an upgrade research it.
These guns are notorious for reliability and theyre lretty damn accurate.
I usually get about 2 moa (typical of any m1a/m14) but i have lulled the occasional 1-1.5 moa 5 shot group.
If you take your time and the wind is still it can be done.
As you know these can fet into sub moa pretty easily if youre willing to spend the time and $.
Unfortunately, i dont have much of either.
And I don't want to see this rifle get neglected.
She can hunt she can plink she can fight.  One of the best rifles ever created.
$900.
I know you can spend 400 more and get a springfeild 16"" but trust me... this is the one you want.
These cant be imported any more and theyre somebof the best m14s available at the best prices.
Without any cases or mags or slings you can maybe find one of these forb $800 if youre willing to wait around a year searching dilligently daily for one.
But likely you wont.
These are getting rare so i know what its worth. Dont low-ball me please.  This rifle is the only way youre getting into an m14/m1a for under $1100.
I will get pictures when i have time.

I'm selling a used KAC 30mm One Piece Tan/Taupe Scope Mount. I got it from a fellow AR15.com member who painted the mount to match his rifle so that's why it looks the way it does. The mount is very well made locks up tight, but two of the scope ring screw might need to be replaced because the top allen screw hole is a little rounded.

Truglo TFO`s are night sights that incorporate fiber optic light pipes. When I describe these sights to my customers, I let them now they are the brightest sights available for use at night or during the day. These sights are truly a 24 hour lighting system. When there is any ambient light available, the fiber optic light pipes gather that light and channel it to the rear where your eyes pick it up. The sights also have built in vials of tritium like any other night sights.  These are always emitting a glow. What makes the TFO`s so special is that those tritium vials are buried in front of the fiber optics. When there is not enough outside light available for the fiber optics to pick up, the glow from the tritium is then channeled to the users eyes. These sights use multiple technologies to gather enough light, day or night to be one of the most useful sets of sights available on the market."

The reason I listed ""no permit needed"" in title is because private sales does not require one nor is a permit to purchase meant to be used for anything in a private sale, it is specificaaly for ffl sale only. If someone wants to ""cover their as*"" they can simply print out a bill of sale. Any person involved in a private sale has no right to see a ptp or permit to carry, it is none of their business. MN ID and bill of sale covers everything. If someone wont sell a firearm without seeing a ptp or ptc they shouldnt be selling privately to begin with, to those people bring your firearm to a ffl or list it on gunbroker, armslist is a place for private sales."

The GEN II trigger geometry gives the shooter a more connected feel with the Vector. The trigger features a smooth pull, a clean break, and a reset that is both audible and tactile.  The safety throw on the KRISS Vector GEN II has been reduced to 45°, making it easier for most shooters to manipulate without changing their grip.  The contour and texture of the pistols grip more closely matches the profile of a closing fist to give the Vector GEN II a natural feel.

The reason I listed ""no permit needed"" in title is because private sales does not require one nor is a permit to purchase meant to be used for anything in a private sale, it is specificaaly for ffl sale only. If someone wants to ""cover their as*"" they can simply print out a bill of sale. Any person involved in a private sale has no right to see a ptp or permit to carry, it is none of their business. MN ID and bill of sale covers everything. If someone wont sell a firearm without seeing a ptp or ptc they shouldnt be selling privately to begin with, to those people bring your firearm to a ffl or list it on gunbroker, armslist is a place for private sales."

It is the most durable finish/treatment available, and can withstand carbon build up even beyond what Nickel Boron does. And being made by Seekins Precision it is USA Made. It is $150 straight from Seekins and the lowest it is for sale anywhere else is $142.50. I will take $130 cash (firm) for it. If you happen to need a charging handle too I also have one that I can include for another $20. You will not find a better BCG than this for the money, and you will not find this one anywhere else for this low a price, check around for yourself and see. The price is firm so please no offers of less, it is brand new and I am already selling it below what it would cost to buy the same thing directly from from them or anywhere else. Yes you can buy a cheaper one but you get what you pay for and Seekins stuff is as good as it gets. This is a great price for a complete BCG of this quality and well worth it.

Its pretty much brand new, I put 15 rounds through it, but I find I like to hunt with my revolvers, mostly tree-ing squirrels so I think something larger would be better for me with adjustable sights.

Asking 400$ for it. Have a box of 9mm too. 

As far as trades, I am looking for maybe a nice ruger single six or bearcat .22lr. Or always on the lookout for nice .38 specials.

New Subcompact Glock 27 .40 caliber with lots of upgrades and extras. It's a new $500 gun, with easily over $500 more invested in this ccw package, details below. Selling it for $650 firm, and if you know what you are looking at then you will know that this is a bargain for what it is. Please no offers of any less, no need to waste our time, the price is $650 FIRM. There is much more than this just in the gun and parts alone, not even including any of the work done. I have never shot it once. There are a few trades I'd take that I will list below but I am mainly interested in just selling it outright for cash. So for me to trade it would need to be one of the specific items I have listed, or something worth at least what the total value represented here is (easily over $1k, not $650 - that is the ALL CASH price). The few photos shown are not even close to enough to do this gun justice. If you are interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on. If you don't and I do not respond to you that is probably why.

It has contrast sights, not night sights. As you can see from the pics the slide has slight holster wear but that's expected when a gun doesn't live in the back of a safe. Just like every other SIG, this one is a tack driver, very accurate and always reliable. It comes with one 12 round magazine. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever, I'm just clearing out the collection a bit.
The Sig Sauer P226 is standard issue to the U.S. Navy Seals, U.S. Marshals and many other law enforcement agencies throughout the country.
The asking price is fair but I will entertain reasonable cash offers, just please don't be ridiculous. This gun is for sale only, no trades. I will not reply to emails or texts with trade offers.
I am honest and have bought and sold several guns through Armslist with zero issues. I expect a potential buyer to be honest as well.

In my humble opinion these are one of the best AK variants we can own other than maybe a Legend. I have several Norinco, Polytech and a couple Arsenal USA and I can honestly say this is the smoothest out of them all by far. Only reason I'm considering selling it is because its way too nice to be beat on and abused.

880,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4788880,For Sale:  High Speed Red Dot Laser Alignment,"San Jose, Casper, Wyoming",$ 52,"Listed On: Monday, October 19, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"How to get the most rapid and accurate dot positioning at quite long working distances? It might be quite a hard work for users to still make dot projection with a simple sticker or laser pointer. However, when users are beginning to make dot generation with high brightness red dot laser alignment, it can always bring users quite satisfied dot positioning as expected.

In current industrial dot alignment work, such as laser marking or laser engraving work, the desired laser dot should be limited with high stability in 24 hours continuous work. As a result, this advanced red laser module always selects quite compact designed structure with tube diameter of 12mm, 16mm and 26mm. Once there is enough space as its metal heat sink cooling system, this advanced red laser module just ensures high stability and high reliability red reference dot projection efficiently.

The laser dot projection always makes the best use of laser features of good direction, high brightness and good monocles. As a result, in following dot projection work, only after users are making proper selection of output power, red laser diode module always gets quite satisfied dot positioning result. According to simple adjustment of laser beam focus, this advanced dot laser alignment tool can ensure high beam concentricity, thus getting super satisfied dot positioning result on all working surfaces efficiently.

These uppers were _never sold separately_ by Bushmaster; you had to buy the complete pistol, which retailed for $1049 and typically sold for $700-$800. 

See more pics here: http://www.ar15.com/mobile/topic.html?b=7&f=118&t=1463516

I am original owner of this minty upper, which is a take-off from a P97S pistol that I SBR'ed in 2005. The pistol S/N is D068** (you can fit a free-float handguard to this upper if you like, because the barrel nut diameter is AR standard on this S/N range). The P97S was Bushmaster's top-of-the-line rework of the old Professional Ordnance guns, and it runs great. This upper takes any standard AR BCG. 

_Also included_ is the original quick-detach muzzle brake, the original charging handle, and the discontinued #AZ15133 threaded adapter, which swaps out with the quick-detach muzzle brake to fit any 1/2 x 28 TPI accessories you may wish to use. It weighs less than 2.25 lbs. all together. 

_Not included_: BCG.

Pictured below is how I had the upper setup on my SBR; I ran the threaded adapter to an AAC 18T blackout MB to the AAC 762-SD, which worked great. Without a suppressor, this barrel length produces a massive fireball and concussion. 

I've gotten out and shot this maybe 5x times in 10x years, the pictures speak for themselves. I am parting the SBR out because resale transfer fees are prohibitive ($400 total), and I am trying a 10.5"" upper now. Price includes S&H to your door -- ppal + 3% or USPS MO both accepted, check my feedback under this username on both eBay & GB. 

""The P97S Upper Receiver features a full length anodized aluminum Picatinny rail that includes integral front and rear iron sights. The windage adjustable rear sight is a combination ghost ring and precision aperture flip-up. The square post front sights offers elevation adjustments for fine zeroing. The Picatinny rail allows the option of mounting a wide variety of auxiliary sighting systems such as long eye relief and standard scopes, red dot, holographic, or laser sights. A similar rail extends the full length of the bottom of the hand guard allowing for the attachment of flashlights and accessories. The pistol’s stainless steel, match grade barrel is chambered for the 5.56 NATO cartridge and readily accepts the .223 Remington cartridge as well."""
