As stated the Makarov is in almost new condition. Was unfired when I got it and I've only put 150 rounds through it since.  This is an Arsenal commercial model and not military surplus, so it is in excellent condition cosmetically, I'd say around 95-98%.  Is still in military configuration though with fixed military sights and bakelite grip.  Will come with two 8 round magazines (one of which is serial matched to the gun), a surplus military flap holster, and 450 rounds of 9x18mm ammo.  

I've enjoyed Makarovs but I'm looking for something a little smaller for carry this summer.  Primarily interested in a Springfield XDs (prefer 9mm but would still consider 45), a Ruger LC9s plus cash or ammo,  Walther PPS, a S&W J Frame of some kind in 38 special (not interested in LCR's), Glock 26 or 27, or maybe a Ruger SR9c or SR40c. The only 380 I would consider would be a recent production Glock 42. Not interested in S&W Shields, No Taurus or Kel Tec please.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 if interested, texts preferred.

I bought it last year in the beginning of November, they usually go for around 360. The rifle has had about 500 rounds through it, it shoots pretty good. To break it in and for plinking I’ve been shooting Wolf Gold, which groups pretty good for cheap ammo at about 1.5 inches. HPR ammo with 55 gr. VMAX bullets shoots at about 1 inch. 24 grains of IMR 4198 with a 55 gr Sierra varminter bullet was really good; I shot one group at about a half inch but honestly I’ve never been able to replicate that, but normally its under an inch. So the gun shoots really well. I put a Nikon 3-9×40 scope with the BDC reticle, the scope came off of a Savage Trophy Hunter XP.  The scope with the rings is worth about 150.
I glass bedded the action and the fore end of the stock to stiffen it up. It made it a little heavier but it shoots better. The X7 or XL7 is is a good gun, they basically just combined all the popular parts from all the guns into this one (Rem 700 safety, Win 70 bases and bold release, Savage trigger and barrel nut). I’m not set on the price so make me an offer. REDACTED.

The bike is pretty much stripped at the moment. It's a Suzuki gsxr 750 frame and engine. Engine had compression test done prior to me trading for it and compression is good. Has a hayabusa swingarm, suspension and rear rim/tire on it. Rear tire is worn but front still has life to it. I have the wiring harness, a spare harness for backup parts, a coil kit (aftermarket, unused with plenty length to cut to size) 
Carb rack (minus the screws for the float bowls) and pod filters, 4-2-1 ceramic coated header, and an aluminum plate machined for between the 750 frame and top connection of the busa shock to keep the geometry right.
It has the original sub frame removed and I have the stainless steel tubing in different sizes to make a custom subframe of chosen size and shape as well as the ""slugs"" to bridge the tubing to the frame.
It is definitely a project so if you are into putting in time and energy for a custom outcome it's a decent start but if you aren't into projects it's probably not what you're looking for.
Has title.
Looking to get 500 obo. Need it gone soon and parts are worth more if you part it out but it's taking up space that I don't have and I need to get rid of it before HOA a-holes make me completely lose my mind."

Selling this limited run (only offered by BladeHQ) Microtech VenomTech VT-1T. This is the tactical version with blacked out hardware, black handle, black dagger blade (sharp on both sides), no serrations.

Never cut anything with it. Opened and closed a few times. Sliced a piece of paper. Has sat in box since untouched. Flawless. Comes with box, sheath, etc.

Email me and I can provide you a video of the double action (it's awesome sounding and lightning fast).

A very unique knife that was only made for a short run as a BladeHQ exclusive. Sold out.

Here is the info on the knife from BladeHQ:

Limited Edition Run! Meet the Venomtech, a cousin once removed of the Ultratech and newest member of the Microtech family. You may notice some similar familial features; sleek black anodized chassis, finely milled details like the stepped actuating button and custom tri-wing screws. You probably also noticed some glaring differences. Without going into details, we'll just say the Venomtech ""acquired"" his enhanced features like many of our radiation-induced superheroes. 

The VT functions (almost) like any other double-action Microtech OTF. Slide the button forward and the blade extends, pull the button back and the blade retracts. The thing is, the VT has some extra blade real estate. Fully retracted, the blade extends out the handle 2"" which means fully extended the blade clocks in at 5.5""! 

The VT conceals its identity with a sleek, form-fitting tailored suit, something akin to Clark Kent, only revealing his true self at opportune moments that call it to action. Once unmasked with blade in full glory and the custom VT Microtech ""M"" emblazoned on his chest, this knife is a force to be reckoned with.

Not sure if the stock is bedded or not, judging by the quality of the build it may very well be.
Because the rifle is fitted to the stock so well i do not feel I can remove the trigger guard for to remove the rifle from the stock. I've looked an there is just no room.

Condition: I feel the gun is in excellent shape for its age, even the wood in the magwell is not chalked up with unburnt powder, one small imperfection on the one near the magwell. Shown last picture. Judge for yourself.

• Gain Twist Rifled Barrel for Superb Accuracy
• Lighter Loads That The 460 Will Also Fire Include .45 Colt and .454 Casull
• Incredibly Low Perceived Recoil For All Loads

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver."

This revolver is the Police Service Six with a four inch barrel and fixed sights. Timing and lock-up are perfect and the revolver is accurate. I've shot less than 50 rounds with it and I believe it was shot very little. In fact, I think it spent most of its life in a holster in a drawer as the cylinder has a holster mark on one side where it touched the leather undisturbed for years. Some holster wear at the end of barrel as well. Not sure how to rate the bluing percentage. Great bore.

The revolver is very clean inside and out and has a fresh set of reduced power trigger and hammer springs (Wolff) installed. The single action trigger is as good as it gets. A lot of gun for the money!

Over the last decade, AMSEC has made their claim to fame in the gun safe industry with the almighty BF series by taking these commercial security aspects and introducing them into your everyday gun safe.

The BF series is considered the most unique gun safe in the industry with a 1/2"" steel plate door combined with 1"" DryLight insulation, 2"" total wall thickness on all sides also filled with DryLight insulation and two layers of steel for exceptional fire and security protection. With all that steel in the walls we end up with a total thickness of 7 gauge!

The DryLight in between the steel of the walls and door is an advanced poured concrete insulation material that eliminates the use of gypsum board and provides a dry and seamless barrier that provides ETL verified fire protection of 120 minutes at 1200°. It's proven to maintain interior temperatures of less than 350° and has 2 stage dual fire seals with silicone seal on the door jamb and an expandable Palusol seal on the door that'll keep the smoke out.

On the door lies a U.L. listed Group II Lock with a spy-proof, key-locking dial, decorative five-spoke handle and a convenient ""Pull"" handle in brass, chrome or black nickel. Optional electronic locks are available.

Once the correct combo is entered, the ultra smooth cam driven locking mechanism with increased handle rotation allows the door to open on the commercial grade, adjustable ball bearing hinges that can swing open a full 180°. As an additional feature, the handle will disengage under severe attack.

Once inside, you'll first notice the beautiful mirrored back wall that provides increased visibility.  The included premium door organizer (PDO) maximizes storage space and offers quick access to commonly used items like passports, handguns and other important documents/valuables. There's also a standard built in internal AC power port with a removable external power cord that will allow you to charge your electronics or use a dehumidifying rod. The E-Z Slant-Out interior provides easy access to your long guns and the entire interior is upholstered in rich pin-dot fabric. The 8 drawers fit in well with the

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
