REVIEW FROM CONCEALED NATION
Size
The SR40c is a striker-fired, compact, double-stack design. The grip is only 1.18″ thick, making it one of the thinnest double-stack handguns available.
Overall length is 6.85″ (barrel is 3.5″), width (across safety levers) is 1.27″, height is 4.61″ It weighs just 23.4 oz. The full specs can be found HERE.

Caliber
This version of the SR series is chambered for 40 S&W. The compact SR is also available in 9mm for those who like the extra stopping power, but at the expense of 1 round in the compact magazine, and 2 rounds in the extended magazine. The 9c is identical to the 40c in length, width, height and weight. Having fired both I can say that the 9c is unsurprisingly a little tamer in recoil. Muzzle rise is reduced due to a low slide profile. Overall it is a very easy and fun gun to shoot.

Safeties
There are numerous safeties on this handgun – one of the many reasons I love it.
It has a Glock-like “trigger within the trigger”, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, magazine disconnect (more on this later), plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator on the top of the slide.

It also has an ambidextrous manual thumb safety. This is an area where there will never be a consensus. The SR40c has a relatively short trigger (when compared to, say, an LC9) and as such I like a manual thumb safety. I have some guns with and without them, and for guns with long, heavy triggers (such as my LCP or my Sig P250c) the lack of manual safety is fine. For this, though, I like to have one. I treat every gun as if it has one anyway, as it does not matter if I sweep off the non-existent safety on a gun that does not have one. In this case, it is small enough to not get in the way, but large enough to be easy to hit when you need to. It ‘snicks’ on and off cleanly and positively.

Reliability
To me, reliability is one of the most important factors of a personal defense firearm. If I am going to stake my life (or that of my family) on the firearm then I need to know it will go bang in my moment of need.

Several thousand rounds have been put through this handgun, and I have yet to have a failure of any kind. If I could not say that about the gun, I would not carry it.

Grip
The grip has a fine checkered texture, with fine grooves at the front and back. I find it is rough enough to gain a solid purchase without hurting my hands. It has a reversible backstrap, allowing it to be adjusted to fit smaller hands. As someone with relatively small hands myself, I love this. I find it fits my hand perfectly on the smaller setting."

I bought this brand new, I've owned this less than 1 year, and I paid more than $1300 for it. It's a gorgeous gun, and it's off roster so it's not available except via PPT. I'm moving to Texas later this week, so I figure I'd like to give someone else in California a chance to own it; once I take it with me, it's gone from California for good.

I've taken it to the range once, and cleaned it once. It's sat in my closet, in the case, ever since.

Comes with all the standard materials: the gun, the manual, two 8-round mags, cable lock, and foam-padded case.

Two cosmetic issues to note (visible in the pictures): (1) the frame has a small nick in it under the slide. That was my hand slipping when I was cleaning it, and letting the slide hit the frame (the pic makes it look worse than it actually is). (2) There is some slight fading on the left-hand grip - hard to see, but visible if you look closely, which is why I mention it. Neither issue is obvious.

I live just over the line from North OC, but I'll be in Riverside County later this week on my way to Texas, so I'd be willing to try and meet buyers in Inland Empire or Riverside County. If you have a preferred FFL I'd be glad to meet there, otherwise I can find one. Buyer pays DROS fees.

I have here for sale or trade an almost new glock 30S, which is the compact double stack .45 acp. Nothing special really, just an unmolested gen 3 carry piece, all factory original. This pistol has seen 20 rounds, then I decided that it is too different in feel from my glock 19 and 17, and have opted to sell or trade it. I am fairly easy going and easy to deal with, but I will not respond to junk or lowball offers. I am not under the mistaken impression that my glock is worth a couple hundred dollars more than what I paid, so don't worry about me spiking the price. I had K rounds make me a custom OWB holster for this, which ran me 65.00, and I will include this.

 Heritage Rough Rider (RR22B6)

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered in .22LR, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

2004 Harley Davidson FXSTSI Springer Softail Fuel Injected 

19,600 miles, will go up as weather gets nicer.

Never down...Clean Title...

This is a great bike, only selling because I bought a Ultra Classis and I find that I ride that more than the Springer. This bike has many upgrades, everything is harley, but the Vance and Hines Longshot HS pipes. This will come with the harley tuner and big manual. The tuner is great as you can change the fuel maps (did with new pipes and stage 1 air filter kit) and check diagnostic if you need. I never needed to use the diagnostic because the bike never gave me problems. Fluid maintance was done every 2500 miles with all 3 fluids. The OEM Harley battery is 2 years old and was put on a tender over the winter. This is a great riding bike that has been to Sturgis to Myrtle Beach to Canada and many other places. The springer front end makes it stand out in the crowd. There are not to many springers out there. 

List of OEM Harley extras: 
(I find the quality is higher with harley stuff)

I would be adding $200-250 cash on top of the g26. A brand new m11a1 can be had for $775 from cdnn currently, so I value a used one below that number of course.

I may also be compelled to offer up a gen 4 g19 with night sights and all factory goodies if your sig has accessories, etc that I may want. I'd rather trade the g26 though since it's the one I shoot less.

I have my ccw and you'll need one too or an original NC pistol permit plus a valid NCDL. Ftf Charlotte area hopefully. I may be willing to travel, just a bit.

I can add pics later today, but if you clicked on this ad, I'm sure you know what a g26 looks like.

The one-piece 30mm tube, precision-machined from a single solid block of aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum, offers ample windage and elevation adjustment. Born from an intimate understanding of riflescope design, forward-thinking engineering, and open ears to a market incredibly vocal about what it wants in a riflescope, the Viper PST series delivers the performance and features tactical shooters demand at an economical price.

Illuminated Reticle provides precise aiming under low-light conditions.
Waterproof, shockproof, and fog proof!

The PEPR stands for Proper Eye Position Ready for combat. The ring bases are milled as a single, tough unit. The top of the rings feature the Picatinny rails for mounting additional accessories. The two Quick Detach levers make it easy to change optics or switch to iron sights and still maintain return to zero reliability.

Thank you this is my contact information 480-228-8-1-Nine5

*I have for sale is a Military Issued Multicam Size: Medium I.O.T.V. plate carrier vest that includes with the complete set of Front/Rear Armor and 2 side plates for $300.00 the vest is brand new, no tears or stains of any kind. It is completely adjustable from small to large.

which is what I had paid originally for it*

*I have one complete set up available for a Multicam VooDoo Tactical Front/Back Vest. This complete set with Plates = $200

*We are the only ones who offer to sell to the public. Anyone else who proclaims to sell them are not being honest with you and or are ignorant in what they are selling. Our Armor is certified, tested by the Military. Tested by us and are legitimate. We take pride in the quality of the craftsmanship of our products* The armor fit majority of plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. You are only cheating yourself if you are someone just wasting my time. Anti-Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request. Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

It was restocked (ugh!), and also someone changed the front and rear site (double ugh!).
The rifle still fires and I've included close ups of all the stamping. Please contact me for questions and/or additional photos. Below is a better explanation of this rifle:

The Mannlicher Gew.98/40 German Infantry Rifle was known by the Germans as the Infanterie Gewehre G98/40.

These German contract guns were made from 1941 to 1944 by Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest, (German Ordnance code “jhv”), with some or all of the work possibly subcontracted to Danuvia Gépgyár, Budapest (German Ordnance code “jua”). 

{Note added by Claven2: During the war, the German’s referred to Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest as Metallwaren-Waffen und Maschinenfabrik, Budapest (HU). After the war, the arms maker became known commonly as “FEG”. A full list of codes, including jhv, and most WaA's can be referenced in the following Milsurps Knowledge Library entry: ""Das Heereswaffenamt"" (Detailed Listing of German WaA Markings and Codes)}

The Hungarian-made G98/40 is not a mauser, and shares nothing significant with the G98, rather it is a mannlicher-based receiver design patterned after the Hungarian 35M, the only firearm ever purpose-built for the 8x56R cartridge. The G98/40 was contracted as a war-expedient, to exploit the existing 35M tooling. They were issued primarily to the Luftwaffe.

Distinguishing features of the G98/40 include:

- mannlicher-based receiver design with all steel parts blued;
- two-piece bolt with detachable bolt-heads, and bolt handle positonned ahead of the receiver bridge;
- chambered in 8x57;
- two-piece stock system (similar to that found on the Lee Enfield). Early stocks were walnut, later laminate; and
- mauser sling, bayonet and staggered row magazine designs, allowing the use of the K98 sling, bayonet and stripper clips.

In 1943, the Hungarian Government, adopted a variation of the G98/40 known as the 43M, which differs slightly in sling and bayonet arrangements, but is otherwise identical to the G98/40."

Like new CZ P-07 Duty for Sale. Purchased new from a local gun shop and only fired a few rounds down range. Great firearm for open carry, range use, or home defense. 

I'm asking $400, so essentially it's like buying the firearm brand new and getting $200 off for letting me put about 100 rounds through it. 

The P-07 also comes with its case, case lock and two keys , cleaning tools, two additional back plate grips to interchange at will for comfort, two 15 round mags, and an additional safety lever for two different types of safeties (Decocker and Manual Safety).

Also included for your convenience is an Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0 (IWB Holster) with tools (screws, rubber mounts, allen wrench, etc), so you  wouldn't even need to purchase a new holster if you chose to!

(From Manufacturer's Website)
The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. Standard P-07s may ship with either a lanyard loop mainspring plug or a flat mainspring plug.

(Testimonials and Reviews)

Joe Matiacio – May 19, 2014:
This is one of the best shooting, great trigger and most accurate polymer guns I’ve ever owned and I’ve had them all. Because of the low bore axis and superb trigger feel/reset it is quick to be back on target. This is a compact jem in a polymer pistol.

Ray – May 27, 2014:
I believe that this is the best value available in a polymer semi. The Omega trigger system feel is excellent in single action and very good in double. Accuracy is excellent for the barrel length and it’s a very soft shooter.

Ray – May 29, 2014:
Perhaps the best value available. Extremely accurate for a 3.8 barrel and a soft shooter. Reliable, reliable, reliable.

Frank – May 30, 2014:
I have owned this gun for 2 months. I have taken it to the range three times. No problems whatsoever. This is an awesome gun. Well thought out evolution to the p07 Duty. You won’t regret getting one.

Hellkat1911 – June 22, 2014:
Sweetest shooting compact 9mm on the market today. Low bore axis and superior SA trigger pull make double taps a breeze. Mags drop free with ease and the grip feels very natural. Recoil is very low from the 3.8″ barrel. I outfitted mine with a Viridian tac light, it’s a perfect carry weapon. Get rid of that pocket pistol and carry this ultra reliable and shootable piece of hardware!"

This great little unit is a pulse laser for long battery life and makes it very easy to acquire, even in well lit areas. These units retail new for $400 bucks so I think the price is more than fair. 

The pistol is in great shape with around 500 shots down the pipe. When you add up the gunsmithing, Lasermax rod and trigger enhancements this Glock comes in close to 1k total. This is a great everyday working gun with custom features that matter, not gold plating and pretty cutouts that don't. 10+1 of .45 in the palm of your hand with the reliability of a Glock. Can't go wrong there.

These are an aluminum frame version of the popular SR1911 Commander-Style pistol. This new model features a black anodized aluminum frame with a satin stainless finish on the slide, resulting in an attractive two-tone appearance in a gun that weighs 7oz. less than the all stainless steel version. It comes factory equipped with an integrated, polished titanium feed ramp and features thin, hardwood grip panels for concealed carry, as well as front strap serrations for improved grip. Ruger engineers took a hard look at how they could utilize new materials to improve the performance of the aluminum-framed 1911. Most aluminum frame pistols tend to show excessive wear on the feed ramp, particularly when shooting modern hollow-point ammunition. This can result in unreliable feeding and may be expensive to correct. The new SR1911 Lightweight Commander-Style pistol comes factory equipped with an integrated polished titanium feed ramp for a lifetime of reliable performance.Since entering the 1911 market in 2011, Ruger has quickly become known for producing some of the best quality 1911's available today. These American-made, CNC machined, series-70 design 1911's come standard with many features typically found only in custom manufactured pistols. All SR1911's feature Novak LoMount Carry 3-dot sights, a lowered and flared ejection port, and a titanium firing pin. In addition, each Ruger SR1911 features a precision barrel and bushing which are machined to match from the same piece of bar stock. The frames have an integral plunger tube, beaver-tail grip safety, oversized magazine release, extended thumb safety and a skeletonized hammer and trigger for fast, accurate shooting. All of this, without the price tag of a custom gun.Comes with box, manual, two 7 round magazine, lock and warranty card.

I bought it a few months ago, but haven't even carried it. It's been sitting in my safe since I got the 9MM PCR. I did add the VZ - Tactical Grips, a Stainless Steel Guide Rod and had the internals polished and a 13 lb mainspring installed. DA is 8.2 lbs. and the SA comes in under 4 lbs. I have one extra mag for it (total of 3). All the original packaging is in tact. I have put less than 500 rounds down it and it shows. No scuffs, scratches or dings.

The rest is from the CZ website:

The P-06 is the .40 S&W version of the 9mm CZ 75 P-01 model.

The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.
