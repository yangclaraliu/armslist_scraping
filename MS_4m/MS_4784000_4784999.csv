If you wanted to upgrade to a larger/more versatile Rifle I'll make you the deal of a lifetime on a New .308 AR10 Rifle made by Armalite who is the Original Designer/Manufacturer of the AR Style Rifle & is the only company to make a true AR10, they have several patents that make their Rifles perform like no other including the recoil system which makes the much more powerful .308 feel like a much smaller AR15 with a bullet 1/3 of the size of the .308. This AR10 is very Versatile and great for everything from hunting, to long distance & competitive shooting competitions, or just range shooting for fun.
This .306/7.62x51 Rifle is an upgraded model with 2 Stage Tactical Trigger, 20"" Chromoly Lined Heavy Barrel for Greater Accuracy, it has ChroMoly Lined Internal Parts also which greatly reduces the need to clean & when you do it's so much easier. It has a patented Recoil Reducing Buffer System & One of a Kind Muzzle Brake with Flash Hider, it is decked out with all Forged Matching Upper/Lower Receivers better than Mil-Spec Coating and Internal Parts, it has a built-in storage area in the Stock great for spare parts or a survival kit, etc. Comes with a 20 Round Magazine that is one of the best quality magazines I've ever seen, and more are readily available for less than the price of a common Glock Handgun Magazine or Ruger .22 Magazine.
Now for the Extra Accessories: It comes with a new Bi-Pod to stabilize the rifle while shooting and the bi-pod is an upgraded model with adjustable legs and a pivoting base perfect for any conditions even if on a hillside, also included is 500 Rounds of Brand New, Premium Brass Cased Ammo, 2 Scopes- a New 4-16x44 Mid-Long Range Scope with Red Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle & Normal Black Reticle that requires no battery and is always ready to use, the Red is Perfect for Normal Conditions and Low-Light Situations like being in the woods, shade, at dusk/dawn & more and the Second Scope has a Select-able Red/Green Dot for Closer Shots out to about 200-250+ Yards, Red is Best for Lower Light Conditions while Green is Great in Bright Conditions. Both Scopes Have Quick-Mount Releases for easy mounting/removal + the ability to switch back forth between the 2 if wanted/needed, All Manuals/Paperwork + Lifetime Warranty & Accuracy Guarantee Included, All New as it was from the Gun Store but without the insanely high prices. 
This Rifle cost $1967 alone and the accessories brought the total bill for everything on up to around $2800- i can't recall the exact number BUT ILL MAKE A SERIOUS BUYER A SERIOUSLY GREAT DEAL ON EVERYTHING!

It also has an uparaded Bell and Carlson Medalist aluminum bedded stock ($300). It has a $200+ trigger job which makes for the most crisp trigger pull I have ever felt. Also, the bolt has been refitted to the receiver so it slides perfectly which costed another $250. The gun was made in 2010, which if you read reviews was one of the last year's remington made their rifles with an extremely high level of quality. It has had less than 50 rounds through it, shows very minimal signs of use and maybe one or two small scratches. Also come with a $50 sling, a lense cleaner, and a Plano gun guard.

The SAM7K PISTOL:
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES
• 100% new-production parts and components. 
• Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger
• Cold hammer-forged barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
• Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
• AK scope rail.
• Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). 

Inside dimensions 1.80"" Outside dimensions Picatinny to picatinny 2.42"" 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose,"

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES
• 100% new-production parts and components. 
• Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger
• Cold hammer-forged barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
• Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
• AK scope rail.
• Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.
• Ambidextrous safety lever"

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is proud to announce the Ruger® Gunsite Scout Rifle, the ideal ""fighting carbine"" in .308 Winchester that is a credible rendition of Col. Jeff Cooper's Scout Rifle concept. Cooper called for a relatively lightweight, hard hitting, do-all rifle that in the hands of an accomplished shooter was able to place accurate, sustained fire out to long ranges, yet was quick-handling and light enough for all-day carry.

Developed in conjunction with Gunsite instructor Ed Head, the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle is a new platform in the Ruger M77® family. While the Scout Rifle has M77 features such as controlled round feed and integral scope mounts (scope rings included), the 10-round detachable box magazine is the first clue this isn't your grandfather's Ruger rifle.

""Ruger has taken an in depth look at the intended purpose of a Scout Rifle and developed a full-featured rifle designed to meet the Scout Rifle criteria of hunt, fight, defend,"" says Head. ""This firearm offers outstanding features in an affordable, versatile and reliable rifle designed to deliver .308 Winchester performance in a variety of situations. It is compact, lightweight, offers 10-round box magazines, can be fit to the individual shooter, and accommodates a host of optics. It is a serious rifle for those serious about rifles.""

The Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle has a 16.5"" medium contour, cold hammer-forged, alloy steel barrel with a Mini-14® protected non-glare post front sight and receiver mounted, adjustable ghost ring rear sight for out-of-the-box usability. A forward mounted Picatinny rail offers options in mounting an assortment of optics - including Scout Scopes available from Burris® and Leupold®, for ""both eyes open"" sighting and super-fast target acquisition.

A Mini-14/SR-556® flash suppressor is effective on reducing the muzzle flash that may be present on some .308 Winchester loads when fired out of the short (16.5"") barrel. The 5/8-24 muzzle threads allow most standard .30 caliber muzzle accessories - flash suppressors, muzzle brakes, and sound suppressors - to be installed. 

The Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle features a matte black oxide alloy steel barrel and receiver on a black laminate stock with sling swivel studs and checkered grip and forearm. A soft rubber recoil pad, with three 1/2"" spacers allows the length of pull to be adjusted and allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or to give the shooter the proper fit with outerwear or defensive gear of varying thickness. With its compact size and weighing in at just under seven pounds, the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle combines ease of carry and shooting for the serious Scout Rifle enthusiast. 

The rifle's trigger guard and magazine well are formed with glass-reinforced nylon. The magazine release is a push-forward Mini-14 paddle just ahead of the trigger guard. ""Gunsite Scout Rifle"" is engraved on the grip cap of the laminated, weather resistant stock, and the receiver is roll-marked ""Ruger Gunsite Scout"", commemorating the collaboration of Ruger with Gunsite Academy, America's oldest private firearms training facility.

As they say, beware the man with one gun, for he probably knows how to use it. Never has this been more true than with the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle, the one rifle to have if you could only have one. It is the perfect lightweight, hard-hitting, do-it-all bolt-action rifle - where rugged, reliable Ruger meets the practical, tactical.

FLASH SUPPRESSOR: Reduces muzzle flash and can be removed from the 5/8-24 muzzle threaded barrel for the fitting of the most standard .30 caliber muzzle accessories

With a round in the chamber this provides the shooter with a total capacity of up to 15 rounds with no reloading and firing as fast as you can pump the action. The overall length is 29.5 inches while barrel length measured 20.5 inches.

The receiver is made completely from fiber reinforced injection molded polymer. The top of the receiver has nearly 19 inches of continuous Picatinny rail. A magazine tube selector switch can be set to auto alternate or to feed from a specific tube. The 4140 steel barrel is chrome lined and threaded to accept any standard Beretta choke tube.

Operating the UTS-15 was actually very easy and straightforward. First open the dustcover for the magazine tube you want to load and push the exposed follower forward until it locks. Then load six rounds forward into the tube. To load the seventh round you simply drop it in the tube. When you close the dust cover the follower releases and applies proper tension to the rounds in the tube. With the action open you can also load a round in the chamber. I found the loading process to be easy and quick and keep the shotgun oriented in the right position for fast use.

In delivering the UTS-15, UTAS has done American shooters a great service. This is a super-fast shooting lightweight and reliable tactical shotgun with a plethora of special and well thought out features. The extras included make it readily adaptable for home defense, or sport use all in a very compact and easily transportable package."

It offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority.The 30P-1 was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it’s the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester, .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum and Winchester Short Mag.The 30P-1 has racked up impressive results at long-range filed shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it’s easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The 30P-1 is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and constructed provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The 30P-1 is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.Special Features100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreHelical Baffle TechnologyMagnum ratedRock-Solid POI Repeatability  SpecificationsCaliber.30 Caliber, up to .300 Winchester Magnum MaterialTitanium Length 9 inchesDiameter1.5 inches  Weight17.2 ounces (varies with thread pattern) Thread5/8-24 standard FinishBlack Cerakote Use Precision / Long-range rifle, bolt or semi-automatic"

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil by 60% and muzzle climb by 95% when compared to traditional operating systems.The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm (Coming October, 2015), the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16â€ barrel. The adjustable folding stock reduces the overall length of the Vector by more than 8â€, which helps during storage and transport. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

The Trijicon SRS (Sealed Reflex Sight) represents the highest level of performance from a sealed reflex-style sight. Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery."

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™

It comes in original box, with Leupold mount and 1'' rings on the rifle.  I have taken it out on maybe 7 hunting trips, but rifle has not seen more than 150 rounds through it.  Its a great shooter, and is in pretty good shape.  It has some wear from the hunting trips I have been on, some scratches and marks on the wood finish. But no significant damage or anything like that.  Refinishing the wood would make it look like-new. The action and barrel look great too.  

I will include 5 boxes of factory ammo (I also have two other boxes with about 10 rounds in each, with used brass, that I will give to buyer anyways):

Winchester 150 grain Power-Point (20rds per box, 2 boxes; originally $34.49 per box)
Winchester 160 grain Accubond CT (20rds, 1 box; originally $41.49 per box)
Winchester 160 grain XP3 (20rds, 1 box; originally around $44.96 per box)
Federal Premium 140 grain Nosler Ballistic Tip (20rds; 1 box; originally $36.99 per box)
TOTAL original price of ammo = $192.42 

I was originally planning to start reloading for this rifle so I have RCBS full-length dies, shell holder, and case trimmer that I will also include if you are interested.

This is the link to the Leupold VX-3 3.5-10x50mm scope that I am also selling in case you are interested, I'm asking $580 right now for just the scope, but I can install it back on the rifle and give you a deal on the whole package if interesting.

(its the one with the Boone & Crockett reticle)

I am asking for $450 for the rifle, scope mount/rings, reloading stuff, and ammo.  So if you take the ammo for $100, you basically get the rifle for $350.  Please let me know if you are interested the in the scope as well and we can discuss a deal.   

Please call or text with any questions.  NO TRADES PLEASE, I really need to the money for something else.  Thank you for your time!

PLEASE NOTE: We will have to go a local gun store (I prefer Keith's Sporting Goods or NW armory) to do a background check and transfer.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop.

I need something bigger! There is literally almost no wear on the barrel of feed ramp yet so this is being listed as ""like new"". If your looking for a good carry package and have the hands to fit it, the GLOCK 19 might just be the pistol for you!

Up for sale or possible trade is a GLOCK 19 Gen 4 with Trijicon straight dot night sights with the flat back for one handed cocking. Also comes with everything a new one would include, 3 - 15 round magazines, case, back straps, Glock tool, manual etc.

I have two holsters that are included. I have a Aliengear Cloak IWB and a Black-hawk OWB

Gun currently has an extended slide take down installed but I will put that back to stock. 

I also have some 3rd party upgrade parts that are included but not installed. The extended slide take down, an extended machined aluminum magazine release and a frame back strap plug that fills that hole in the frame to aid in inserting magazines.

[COLOR=#b22222][B]I would like to get $525.00 dollars, FTF in the Grand Rapids area. The gun on it's own runs $569~579.00 depending where you get them and that does NOT include the Trijicon Night Sights or any of the extras.

Trade wise, I'm looking for the following but not necessarily as even trades, just depends ""what"" you have.

I am only interested in 9mm and .45ACP pistols, I do not want to add any .40's to my collection."

Since then I have added a tromix AR15 stock adapter with a new magpul stock as well as cheek riser that's cerakoted. I left certain parts black to have a black undertone. I also upgraded to an adjustable gas block to take anything from slugs to birdshot and this is not a vodka special saiga, it has all gas ports. It also has an SGM door breeching muzzle break, a 20 round drum mag, 2 SGM 12 roubd mags and 2 factory mags. After labor, the gun and all the gun parts I have spent plenty over 2000 turning this into a war machine and it functions perfectly on the gas settings you prefer."

The aimpoint could be included at additional market cost, the mount would come with it. 

Price reflects rifle only, no light, aimpoint, sling or rail covers included. If you have questions, I have answers! Nothing wrong with the gun, I just want something different and this is how I'm funding it. No trades unless it's a 14.5 pinned (16 overall) light weight AR15... since that's what I want."

The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market.

Hey all, 
I have available for trade/sale a used but in great condition awesome 9mm pistol available. This is a LionHeart LH9-MKII 9mm pistol. This is nearly a direct clone of the standard Korean 9mm issued pistols. These are some of the best build 9mms that you can find and balance extremely well. This also comes with tons of extras. It will have the gun, 5 magazines (1x 13rd mag and 4x 15rd magazines) a tube of frog lube, a nice soft case, factory papers, cleaning jag, cleaning brush, and G-Code Paddle Holster. Basically, everything you need for range and carry except ammo! 
I would also consider trades as well. Im open to most firearm trades. Would like a folder AK47, double stack 1911s, CMR30, Super Redhawks, 45LC Schofields, XDMs with threaded barrel, Marlin 357 levers, maybe 30 carbines, GP100 with boot, SP-101, SP-01, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Some will require boot on your end, some will on mine. Need to meet in norman on this due to my schedule."

I had some upgrades done to it: Apex (Machined Aluminum) Forward set sear and trigger kit (parts plus labor was $250) turns spoungy stock trigger into a match grade trigger with very little take up, about a 4lb pull weight and almost no overtravel also trigger is one piece instead of the factory hinged trigger which makes it much nicer to pull/shoot accurately, Stipple Job on front strap and backstrap of grip also the safety, mag release button and index points on both sides ($80), and Tru Dot ""Night Sights"" ($120), also barrel feed ramp was polished along with all internals, trigger guard was undercut and magwell flared. It comes with 2 factory mags a bottle of froglube and two boxes of Black Ops ammo 185gr. Also both mags are loaded with premium hollow points: Barnes tac-xp solid copper hp, and Winchester PDX 1's.
The only complaint with the Smith & Wesson line of pistols is the trigger. The factory trigger is spoungy and has ALOT of take up and reset and approx a 5lb pull weight. That has all been upgraded. I could sit here and Try to explain it but you really have to feel it for yourself.
I also still have all the parts for the factory trigger plus when the APEX trigger job was done I had to upgrade the sear housing block to the newest version so that's another new part. So if you have any questions please just let me know. I have roughly have $900 into it, and regrettably I'll DROP THE PRICE and sell for $650. 

I also will throw in a complete set of:
""David Tubbs"" - AR15 - Chrome Silicone Steel Spring Kit. This is by far the best of the best spring kit for the AR15 rifle, actually it will fit any AR from a Cabine to a Rifle in terms of gas system lengths. All (Even the most expensive and high end brands and/or model) AR's (factory, Mil-Spec, Etc.) Use ""MUSIC INSTRUMENT"" wire spring steel in their guns. It is not the best that can be used, as a matter of fact the ""music"" quality spring steel Springs last approx 2000-5000 rounds until they fail. Obviously some before others depending on the specific spring in the gun. Usually the buffer spring or the extractor Springs are the first to fail due to the forces being applied to them more so than others. But this is where ""Chrome Silicone Steel"" Springs prevail. Personally I don't know why all high end guns don't use them. David Tubb designed a set of the most important springs that run an AR-15 rifle and did a lot of research before putting them to market. But a short explanation is: they are heat treated several times, shot peened, magnafluxed & inspected with ultraviolet light to detect any microscopic stress fractures that could lead to failure. So needless to say they did their homework and the proof is in the stats. Their springs last over 25,000 rounds and keep going. 
So if you have strictly a range toy then you can just rely on the factory music spring steel springs but if you're ever thinking you may need to use your AR to save a life or take one then I would want the best, because it's basically springs that run a gun. If even one breaks usually the gun is out of action until it's replaced. And who wants to try to try to fumble around in a hostile environment possibly low light, being shot at, Etc. while you're trying to change out a spring, and some of them cannot be changed out in the field at all. Like your ejector spring! If you don't believe me search around the web and see how often AR-15 ""Extractor"" springs fail. Do your own research, if I had a loved one who relied on an AR15 LE, Mil, Etc. I would buy them a set and send it to them. It's only about $80 shipped and all of the springs are easy enough to replace in minutes without any special tools, except maybe the ejector spring that one you need a roll punch but it's not too hard and not the most important spring in the kit. 
It consists of: 1 Extractor Spring, 1 Ejector Spring, 1 Buffer Spring (Flat Wound), 1 Hammer Spring, 1 Trigger Spring and 2 (Flat wound) 30rd. Magazine Springs. So I'll throw in this set of NEW Springs that are still in the plastic sealed packaging, never used. I kept them for spares but had to sell my AR and realized I still have them but no use for them anymore. So I'll throw them in for a deal sweetener. I hope they can save a life!

I have for sale a USP Compact in .40 S&W. It is the variant 1, double/single action. The gun shows a little bit of wear but is in great shape. Unknown round count as I got it from a buddy. I've personally put about 200 rounds through it with no issues. It comes with (2)12 round magazines (1)10 round magazine, night sights, a Galco IWB holster, Galco OWB holster and a Forbus paddle holster. Asking $600 obo. Transfer and background fees are on you. Willing to meet most places in the Denver metro area. Selling because I could use a little extra cash, but would be willing to make the right trade."

It used to do this sporadically and randomly, now it does it after EVERY round fired. I have sent it to Walther 3 times for repair and it still isnt right. The first time it went to the manufacturer, They replaced the sear block and spring. The second time they replaced the entire trigger mech and all springs, the third time they said they fire 45 rounds through it and had no issues at all. I have fired all types of 9mm through it, and it doe it on every round. I have papers from Walther saying it is good to go, but it's not.

Manufactured in 1949 by the French Goverment , this French MAS is in Very Good condition and is all original with the exception of the after market wooden pistol fore grip. Only about 275,000 were manufactured by the French Government arms company. Do not know much more about these except that it is fascinating to look at, hold , and shooting it should be a blast ! The grenade launcher function can legally fire dummies and adds even more fun and is simple to use. There is a grenade launcher video on YouTube. The caliber is actually 7.5 French, not Swiss.  AL has no flexibility to insert ""7.5mm FRENCH"" in the caliber heading. The aftermarket foregrip handle appears to be both bolted in and glued and looks good except the stain and grain do not match.  But the grip is strong and has a very good feel and does add better stability to shooting, especially rapid fire. If you plan on shooting this  piece of history then you will appreciate the fore grip even more. Magazine holds 10 rounds. Blueing appears original and is good for age.   Also, there is a Tactical Rail that fits....the rail costs oer $45 new and this one has never been used but I will toss it in for free. Also I will also throw in a free soft rifle case.       Please text for more info.      James REDACTED     no calls                       ...Cash Only Locally.   I CAN  SHIP to your FFL  ....    if you are willing to pay UPS and the Pay Pal (3.9%+80 cents ).

When you field strip it you don't find the typical signs of cheap manufacturing like you usually do on lower price guns: tooling marks, etching and pitting, it is as smooth as it is on the outside. The feed ramp is like glass, highly polished. It is not snappy at all the recoil pad which I thought might be gimmicky really works.
I spoke to SCCY about the warranty and they said it is a No Excuse Warranty, they will fix the gun no matter what including ""squib loads"" or if you drop it, etc. ""Except deliberate abuse"" They are really serious about standing by their product."

I have for sale a slightly used Tikka T3 in .270 Winchester that has less than 50 rounds through it.  It's a great rifle, but I bought a camper trailer so I need to get rid of a few things to re-coup my funds.  It shoots well under minute of angle with the proper load.  THE SLING, SCOPE AND RINGMOUNT NOT INCLUDED.  It comes with the following:

-Original Box and Paperwork
-Thumbhole stock (Exact stock as the one for sale on Tikka Performance/Mountain Tactical, but without their name on it)
-Oversized Tactical Bolt Handle
-One Five Round Clip
-One Three Round Clip
-Limbsaver Recoil pad

This is a great long range hunting rifle/Sniper Rifle setup that is proven to shoot well.  It is relatively lightweight.  The stock has a few small dings and cracks in the finish only.  See the pictures please.  If you haven't used that style of thumbhole stock, you will be amazed by it.  It puts your eye right in line with the scope and is the perfect length of pull for accurate shooting.  It also has two sling swivel studs up front for mounting a bipod and a sling without interference.  This is a great long range elk gun or tactical rifle that is easy to carry and shoots like a very expensive target rifle.  I hope you like it.  I do ship to a valid FFL holder.  Buyer pays actual shipping cost.

I could not find a stainless version at the time I was ready to buy so I went ahead and picked up a blued model. Well... This is the only firearm I own that is not stainless and I hunt and camp and hike and spend a lot of time out in the elements so I never bring this one out for fear of getting it all wet or scratching the finish. It has only had 50 rounds fired and still locks up tight and everything is as it should be. I also have the Weig-a-tinny no drill scope mount thats never been installed that I'll throw in with in it. Keep your box and accessories. I will include my brown leather Ruger branded holster.I'd also throw in a Maverick 88 12 gauge thats never been fired. This firearm is not for sale and no other offers will be considered. Dont waste your time or mine."
