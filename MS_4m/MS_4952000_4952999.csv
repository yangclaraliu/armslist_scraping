I put exactly 150 round through it without issue. This is a nice pistol but I want something else now.

This pistol comes with everything shown, Pistol, Extra Mag, Thread protector removal wrench, Manual, Case, 2 extra front blade sights and the adustment tools. 

This is a double/single action pistol with a threaded barrel. I never removed the protector cap but the wrench is included.

With the hammer down the double action trigger pull is a staggering 17 pounds which according to Walther is an intended safety feature. The single action pull is light and smooth.


I would like to trade this pistol rather than sell it. If I had to give a dollar figure I would say 350.

I am looking for a 12 gauge coach gun with external hammers. Something like the Chinese made Century JW2000 or similar models. Buds had them in stock a week ago for 260-289 but the holiday sales must have cleaned them out. Finances being what they are this time of year, I can afford a transfer fee and/or some cash/ammo to balance a trade but not a cash purchase of a new shotgun.

I am primarily looking for a coach gun but am open to quite a few other options. I might be interested in a hammerless coach gun or a SxS I could get cut to coach length but hammers are handy. 

If this ad is still up I still have this pistol. Past experience has shown me that trading through ArmsList can take a long time so I am patient. Check out my interest list below and feel free to shoot me a message.

Not interested in trading for Ex-wives, Herb, 72 Pintos or non-firearm related materials. I will not Ship this pistol. I will not accept a cashiers check for 5000 to cash and wire 4000 to Nigeria. Really just want to trade for firearm related items only.

Open to other Possibilities so feel free to toss an idea out there but please do not be offended if I am not interested in an item."

The rifle has a nickel boron coated bolt carrier group (photo below) and includes the mounted Streamlight TLR-1 HPL weapon light, Vortex Strikefire 2 red/green dot optic, and a 200mw green laser, which is much more powerful than any laser you will find locally.

So as you can see, I'm losing money here. The gun has maybe 200 rounds through it. It is sighted in at about 100 yards. The laser, red dot, and iron sights all co-witness. The gun is in perfect condition. It has mostly just sat in my closet. My price is firm, and I can meet anywhere in the Clarksville or Nashville area. Text (931)436-3469"

This pistol comes with everything shown, Pistol, Extra Mag, Manual, Case, 2 extra front blade sights and the adustment tools. 

This is a double/single action pistol. With the hammer down the trigger pull is a staggering 17 pounds which according to Walther is an intended safety feature. The single action pull is light and smooth.


I would like to trade this pistol rather than sell it. If I had to give a dollar figure I would say 350.

I am looking for a 12 gauge coach gun with external hammers. Something like the Chinese made Century JW2000 or similar models. Buds had them in stock a week ago for 260-289 but the holiday sales must have cleaned them out. Finances being what they are this time of year, I can afford a transfer fee and/or some cash/ammo to balance a trade but not a cash purchase of a new shotgun.

I am primarily looking for a coach gun but am open to quite a few other options. I might be interested in a hammerless coach gun or a SxS I could get cut to coach length. 

If this ad is still up I still have this pistol. Past experience has shown me that trading through ArmsList can take a long time so I am patient. Check out my interest list below and feel free to shoot me a message.

Does not come with shotgun or side saddle.

Bought this to try out having a pistol grip on my home defense shotgun. Loved being able to adjust the stock, but the pistol grip is just not my thing for shotguns. Especially pump shotguns. 

The receiver extension bolts into the receiver. The pistol grip is screwed into this extension and also where the AR style buffer tube screws into, as well. The receiver extension has a built in QD mount slot.

The Choate M4 stock has 5-6 adjustable positions like an M4 stock. Although the stock tube and stock looks like they are M4 compatible, they are not. The dimensions of the stock tube is different, so you will not able to swap it out with other AR spec stocks. The stock has a swivel stud built into the stock that is removable.

The choate stock has 2 tube compartments that is water sealed where you can store batteries, ect. The caps simply screw off. The cheek rest of the stock is wider and angled similar to a SOPMOD style stock, so it's fairly comfortable.

Asking $100.  FTF transactions only, otherwise buyer pays shipping cost."
