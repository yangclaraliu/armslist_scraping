This little revolver is a Third Model, Third Variation, one of 4900 made in the year 1927.  It is a top-break chambered for .38 S&W caliber (not .38 Special), and was a strong competitor to S&W’s “Lemon Squeezers” of the same era.  The nickname “Owl Head” was applied to IJ guns because of the trademark used, molded it into the hard rubber grips.  Most “Owl Heads” are .32’s, the larger frame .38 is much more suitable to self-defense use; and the gun is still compact enough to be carried concealed.

Overall condition is Excellent.  The plated finish 95%, with a few minor spots of flaking
 On the left side and the front grip strap.  The bore is nearly mint.  Lockup is tight, indexing is perfect, and the action works flawlessly.  All serial numbers match, on the frame (under the left grip), the trigger guard, and the top strap (hidden by the cylinder) so it is 100% original.  IJ was a pioneer in the use of coil springs, rather than the leaf springs other makers used: the springs in this revolver are as vigorous and powerful as the day it left Fitchburg.  IJ also invented the transfer bar mechanism used on all current production revolvers by all makers: it is impossible to set this gun off by dropping it on the hammer, a real safety feature, that IJ touted in their ads with the slogan “Hammer The Hammer!”

It has been shot, but not much.  Made in the “Roaring Twenties,” it might have been originally owned by a businessman or banker, who carried it to defend himself against “gangsters,” or it may have been owned by a gangster!  Considering the condition, I suspect it laid in a bedside drawer for most of its long life.  

It would make an ideal gun for a hunting camp or carrying in a car or truck glove box, always ready if you left another gun at home.  While today we regard the .38 S&W as sub-optimal for personal protection, in point of fact it’s still useful in that role, especially with reloads.  It is possible to load that caliber to match the standard-power .38 Special; and the fact is that Bad Guys are no tougher now than in 1927.  One could do much worse than this dependable, hard-hitting revolver for a personal protection piece!

This gun can be sold to a bona fide Virginia resident in a face-to-face sale, if you present me with a driver’s license or other ID showing a Virginia address, and sign a statement that you are not prohibited from owning it.  I am not an FFL holder, and can only sell directly to another resident of this state.  If you are NOT a Virginia resident it will have to go to an FFL holder (C&R or Dealer).  Be absolutely certain, if you use an agent, that he will accept it from a non-FFL, as the law allows him to do.  An FFL holder can accept a gun interstate commerce from anyone."

Once-fired military and police brass is used in loading, which is acid washed / processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected for thin walls and defects, to ensure safe internal tolerances.

In our loading process we only use the top quality powders and primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest accuracy.

In 1961, Miroku and Winchester formed a new company named Olin-Kodensha Limited.
Miroku also made the Browning Citori. The Citori and the Winchester 101 are virtually the same 
gun.
Aficionados of Winchester® shotguns know well the Model 101. The styling and handling are legendary, the reliability never in question.
The Model 101 has long had a reputation for strength and durability, and like mine, many built in the 1960s are still in service. Many think the 1964 production year the best ever made. Gun is in excellent condition. Have more pictures on request."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

I bought this gun in Sept 2013 at a Cabela's in Wisconsin. Paid $420 for scope and gun. Later on purchased the $25 case, $20 sling, and there is a box of $20 ammo if I recall correctly. There is a new can of REM oil and some targets and marking stickers."

I carried this gun daily but have switched to a different gun and really don't use the Ruger much anymore. It has some blemishes from carrying it all the time. I always called this Ruger ""Tank"" as it is built like one. What it comes with: the factory box it came in, Blackhawk leather IWB holster, 2 speed loaders and 4 speed strips, Hogue monogrip and the factory grip, Wolff spring kit. I currently have the 9 lb hammer spring and 8 lb trigger return spring installed and it makes a sweet trigger and never had any issues of light strikes. Also comes with all the ammo pictured. The closed boxes of ammo are full and the open boxes are partials to show what is left in the boxes. The partial American Eagle box has some Remington 38 special +p Golden Sabers in it. I bought the Barnes Vor-tx not knowing they were hunting rounds. So I never used them. I thought maybe someday I'd shoot them for fun but never did. You could use the Barnes for personal defense but they will more than likely over penetrate someone as I seen a video demonstrate the ammo into ballistic gel with a snubbie and it was impressive. The Speer gold dot short barrel ammo is what I liked to carry. I'm asking $450 for everything. A great CCW.

I'm wanting to try duracoating but don't want to destroy the finish on any guns that are worth something to me.  That said I'd like to buy non functioning or very inexpensive (>$100) guns that don't have much value that you're looking to get rid of.

Ideal guns would be semi automatics, cracked frames are fine or slides that are cracked internally.  Raven, Cobra, Lorcin, Jennings, Jimenez and similar would be good.  Function is not a concern nor is finish (obviously) but I do not want ANYTHING STOLEN!

Even though I'm pretty much only looking for broken guns, I'm 26 and can legally own firearms.  Most shops won't even take them in trade so I think $40-50 is fair.  Thanks for your time.

The charging handle is a strike industries upgrade, along with the strike industries mlok covers for the rail. The flip up sights are mission first flips ups, really cool sights.

1,400 ROUNDS TOTAL of quality Vietnam Era 1911 Ball ammo. You cannot find quality REAL military grade ball like this very often, its getting harder to find, and in this size lot. And especially Vietnam Era 1911 Ball ammo and this ammo was well taken care of, nice and shiny. All ammo here is Non-Corrosive too. Great heavy duty reloading brass too.

Breakdown:

I have an unopened case of 1,000 rounds 45ACP (45 ACP) Ball 1911. Dated 1965 and made by Federal Cartridge. Tell me the last time you saw one of these cases...should be in a museum. 

Also 8 Boxes of the same ammo, 7 boxes are from 1965 and 1 is from 1961. The 1961 box is Remington, 5 of the boxes are from 1965 and made by Federal Cartridge, and the remaining 2 boxes are from 1965, made by Federal Cartridge, and match the same lot as the case.

$532 FTF for all 1,400 rounds. $19 a box for QUALITY AND THE REAL DEAL military ball ammo, $6 a box cheaper than what genuine USA made military 45 ACP ball goes for online, not including shipping or tax either.

Thanks!"

Kahr PM 45 Diamnd Black Compact. I just bought this 5 days ago for my wife as a replacement to her Kahr 9mm. Since then she has decided the 45 is too much for her to carry. So $800.00  before taxes later, my loss is your gain. Less than 50 rounds (1box) put through this great little gun. Everything is there, box papers, lock etc.... This gun is literally brand new. If you don't know much about the Kahr PM series, please do some research and reviews. It is one of the most reliable concealable 45's on the market today. The all black diamond series is even more difficult to find and actually the same price as the bi-tone. Btw this is not the cheaper ""C"" series as many are shown for sale for less. 
I'll take the beating and sell it for 600.00 (firm). Seriously guys this is a new gun that I wish I could afford to just keep. I shot it a few times and realized why reviews rant about this gun."

This is as original as it gets. Completely matching and unmolested 1939 date 27 code K98 Mauser with low serial number 194i. This is original down to the L&F 1939 dated sling, and even have the original cleaning kit issued with the gun in its original leather pouch. Also comes with a factory 1939 8mm ammo box.
Code 27 was formerly S27, which stood for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik (Erma). The receiver, barrel, rear sight group, bolt group including firing pin, bolt release, floor plate assembly, follower, trigger group screws, bands, bayonet lug, and stock are all matching. The stock has not been sanded and has an original K98K sling marked 1939 with maker.
The bore is excellent with no import mark on the barrel and the stock has not been cut. Still has most of the finish except for the butt plate. Erma stopped production of the K98K in 1941, and the serial number of this rifle is #194, making it a fairly early, hard to find variant.

The gun is all matching down to the screws, and cleaning rod. Nothing has been altered or changed since it left the field. Has the original blueing and is in excellent shape.
Gun has all birds intact and no import or Russian marks.

This is not a Russian capture, Yugo, or any of the other imported, mismatched, crap out there. Please don't waste your time or mine with offers not consistent with current, matching K98K prices.

Please do your homework and read the reviews and see the you tubes about this pocket wonder. You can't believe how good this Gun feels in your hands and what little recoil is felt.  I paid over $1000 for this gun and never regretted a moment of it. Problem is I'm now wanting the all black version of this  exact same gun, but can't afford to keep them both. So off to market goes my baby. This gun has no rub marks, scratches or imperfections as you can see from photos. Looks as good as it shoots. Unbelievable accuracy for such a little Gun without the discomfort of shooting this super compact powerhouse. Yes, it will shoot whatever you put through it as reliable and accurate as you can imagine. First $700.00 takes it home. Then I get to spend 1200.00 to buy the exact Gun but in a different color!!

They are both Anderson Lowers.  Top AR is a dissipator, rifle length gas system.  Comes with an AFG and a stainless hammer/trigger also from Anderson.  The second AR is a standard Dring'd upper with flip up sights, AFG and a slide fire stock (similar to full auto, but can also be set to semi).  Not really looking for trades.  Definitely not interested in future projects in trade.  Located in Pleasant Hill

I've had this firearm since November of last year.  The gun only has a total of 100 rounds through it since I've gotten it.  Gun has always been kept clean, kept in it's case, great condition and functions great.  The only negative thing about it is that is does not like flat nose rounds.  All other ammos I've used works perfectly.  Gun comes with 2 mags which holds eight rounds, hard plastic case, and all paper works it came with.  Let me know if you are interested.  Thanks for looking.
