It needs a starter at the moment but I am tired of putting money into it since it's my second car. Something's that are wrong are the windows do not work, the AC does not work, and need a starter. It could probably use an overall tune up as well since it has been a while. It has 4 almost brand new tires on it. Also less than a year ago I spent $700 on radiator, hoses, and more.

I ask him to make one like he uses and he put together the Mod1 totally the same as he used on deployment.
You can no longer get it made with the barrel from Douglas Barrels, Inc.
At the time, Centurion and the Military were the two options if you wanted to get one.
The  KAC rail  is also no longer made by Knights Armament. It has LaRue Tactical sights and the 12th Model SPR Muzzle Brake Suppressor (MBS) threads directly onto the OPS Inc. muzzle brake. But I never got the suppressor. The lower is Rock River Arms with the standard A2 stock.
You should checkout the website for the details:
Asking $1700 and $2000 if you want the optic. It's a HOLOSUN Paralow HS403D Micro Red Dot Sight (2 MOA) with Battery Housing on the side. It's supposed to last 50,000 hours, but who knows. the cool thing is it turns on with a motion sensor.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, RugerÂ® Mini-14Â® rifles and Mini ThirtyÂ® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14Â® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor â there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting todayâs scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.
Chambered in the popular and proven .300 AAC Blackout cartridge. Integral sling swivels. Simple, rugged Garand style breechbolt locking system with a fixed piston gas system and self cleaning, moving gas cylinder. Improved receiver with rounded contours. Rugged, protected blade front sight. Rugged, adjustable Ghost Ring aperture rear sight. Includes a compact, hammer forged barrel with flash suppressor.

I bought this brand new, I've owned this less than 1 year, and I paid more than $1300 for it. It's a gorgeous gun, and it's off roster so it's not available except via PPT. I'm moving to Texas later this week, so I figure I'd like to give someone else in California a chance to own it; once I take it with me, it's gone from California for good.

I've taken it to the range once, and cleaned it once. It's sat in my closet, in the case, ever since.

Comes with all the standard materials: the gun, the manual, two 8-round mags, cable lock, and foam-padded case.

Two cosmetic issues to note (visible in the pictures): (1) the frame has a small nick in it under the slide. That was my hand slipping when I was cleaning it, and letting the slide hit the frame (the pic makes it look worse than it actually is). (2) There is some slight fading on the left-hand grip - hard to see, but visible if you look closely, which is why I mention it. Neither issue is obvious.

I live in South LA county (just over the line from OC), and I can meet almost anywhere in LA or Orange Counties. If you have a preferred FFL I'd be glad to meet there, otherwise I can find one. Buyer pays DROS fees.

I was going to use this for deer, but I have too much fun with my muzzle loader. It's parts are as follows.

Ares Armor 10.5"" .300 Blackout barrel w/pistol length gas system.
A2 style flash hider
Knights Armament M4 RIS
Low profile gas block
PRI flip up front sight/gas block.
M&A upper receiver
Windham Weaponry M16 BCG w/ o-ring for enhanced extraction
Standard charging handle
Smith and Wesson lower
Standard parts kit and trigger
Mil-Spec receiver extenstion
H Buffer

The low profile gas block is under the hand guard. The hand guard is held in place by the barrel nut and the PRI front sight to give a MK18 CQBR appearance.

The upper has about 60 rounds through it. With Hornady 110 grain v-max it groups about 1"" at 100 yards. With Barnes Tac-tx, it's around .75 to 1"". I'm sure once free floated it will tighten up further.

From AR15perfomance website regarding the barrel:

M4 feed ramps, mid length gas system, .700 under the guard, .750 gas block dia. .700 dia from gas block to muzzle. 5/8-24 thread muzzle.
Hi perf. chamber and barrel allow for ANY factory ammo to be used along with the hottest handloads.
These 5R barrels usually produce 60-80fps more than the common 11 twist 4 groove barrels and are as fast as some 20' barrels.
The 4150 11595E steel Melonite(QPQ) treated barrels we sell will last twice as long as stainless barrels-60 rockwell VS 28-30 of the stainless. The final finish meets or exceeds stainless steel corrosion resistance."

This is PWS's first foray into the direct impingement market. This is NOT your standard DI rifle, as PWS puts their custom touches on even their DI gun that separates it from the rest of the crowd.
The bolt carrier group is PWSâs Enhanced Bolt Carrier. It is precision machined and isonite treated (just like the barrel). The bolt carrier has increased mass (it is significantly thicker than a standard BCG) which should both extend dwell time and slightly delay unlock. What this means is that it allows the chamber pressure to be reduced making extraction easier and thus accumulating less wear and tear on the system.There are a number of gaps and channels between skid pads on the BCG which provides fewer points of contact. With fewer points there should be less overall friction, and this should reduce the accumulation of residue and grime, as well as further reduce wear and tear.

The Buffer Tube, machined from a single piece of 6061 aluminum, is one of the important features. It has a lip that extends into the receiver and provides support against carrier tilt (not as important since this is a direct impingement system). It has four drain holes to prevent hydrostatic locking of the reciprocating buffer, and is fluted to shed debris. It uses a standard carbine length H2 buffer and spring. The difference between this buffer and more commonly available ones is that the buffer itself is a tungsten weight housed in a steel body, coated in nickel Teflon. So it is both heavier and slicker. The tube uses a hex bolt to help align the tube to the lower receiver and two locking allen heads at the top to keep the buffer tube from rotating on the lower. If you are not familiar with the PWS buffer tube, what this boils down to is: No. More. Castle. Nut. On the Modern Musket this buffer tube also has a six-position stop, allowing for standard AR collapsible stocks to be attached.The barrel is a 1:8 twist that's been isonite coated, for maximum longevity and accuracy. The Rail is a PWS keymod rail, which is EXTREMELY lightweght. The muzzle device is PWS's factory FSC556 muzzle break/flash hider which does an excellent job at keeping muzzle rise down.The trigger is an ALG combat defense trigger, which tuned by Geissele for smooth take up. The charging handle is a BCM gunfighter, for easy of manipulating the weapon.Comes with a nice hard case, one 30 round pmag, manual, lock and warranty card. We're the ONLY PWS dealer within 2 hours of Charlotte, so if you're seeking one of these weapons, we're your go-to people. We'll be happy to ship this to your FFL.

The 100 ATR has everything you need to make the most of the season: pinpoint accuracy, smooth action and big-game calibers. Widely popular calibers and a free-floating, button-rifled barrel combine to deliver a high level of accuracy unheard of in a value-priced centerfire rifle. A side lever safety is utilized for convenience and safety afield, and the all-steel, machined receiver provides the 100 ATR with positive lock-up for consistent operation. The integral synthetic trigger guard allows for easy cleaning and maintenance while the rubber recoil pad aids recoil reduction and stable positioning.

Almost NIB Glock 26 Gen 4 with only 72 rounds fired through it. Itâs been my nightstand gun and Iâve never carried it, so it has no wear marks or scratches.   The Blackhawk holster has basically been sitting in its box.

I have decided that Iâd like something a little bigger to use for home defense.  Otherwise itâs an excellent gun and many consider it ideal for concealed carry.  Youâll especially like the Glock trigger...itâs a sweet shooter and VERY accurate.

This one comes in the original factory box with all paperwork and all other factory stuff (unopened backstrap/beavertail package, unopened test fire envelope, speed-loader), 3 mags with Pearce pinkie extension baseplates installed plus the original flat baseplates, childproof lock w/two keys and the Blackhawk kydex holster (with both belt loop and paddle attachments).

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driverâs license or permit.

If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Cash only please so I can go buy something else.  Iâm not really looking for a trade and definitely not low-ball offers.  Thanks!"

This is an original 1944 Remington Rand that was originally United States Military issue as marked on the side of this pistol. This gun, reworked by Springfield Armory has not been fired since it's original rework in 1962. This gun comes with 1 magazine, in the original kraft box. This gun is a matching serial numbers,national match barrel, adjustable match trigger, adjustable rear sight, rear grip has the rock garden stippling, the front of the grip has been checkered to enhance stability. This is not a beat up, pitted rework. This Rand has very minor blemishes compared to most of these guns that have come to market. The majority have pretty progressive pitting and most have indiscernable markings. The markings on this gun are clean and crisp. I would say this is one of the finest condition reworks I have observed."

This is an original 1944 Remington Rand that was originally United States Military issue as marked on the side of this pistol. This gun, reworked by Springfield Armory has not been fired since it's original rework in 1962. This gun comes with 1 magazine, in the original kraft box. This gun is a matching serial numbers,national match barrel, adjustable match trigger, adjustable rear sight, rear grip has the rock garden stippling, the front of the grip has been checkered to enhance stability. This is not a beat up, pitted rework. This Rand has very minor blemishes compared to most of these guns that have come to market. The majority have pretty progressive pitting and most have indiscernable markings. The markings on this gun are clean and crisp.

Background checks are not in effect until August 9, 2015.  Keep on supporting armslist by supporting the 2nd amendment.

From Oregonlive.com......

Some folks have been understandably confused about when Oregon's new law takes effect requiring that background checks be conducted for private firearms sales.

That's because the language of Senate Bill 941 says the measure becomes law the moment it was signed by Gov. Kate Brown, which occurred on Monday.

However, it's not as simple as that.  The section requiring the new background checks doesn't take effect for 90 days, explained Jeff Rhoades, counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee.

""We gave the state police 90 days to ramp up"" so that it will be able to conduct the additional background checks, said Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, the bill's sponsor.

That is Aug. 9, for those who are keeping count.

On that date, if you're conducting a private firearm sale, you will have to go through a federally licensed dealer to get a background check.  The check is meant to determine whether someone is legally prohibited from owning a gun.  Among the legal prohibitions: felony convictions, commitments to a mental hospital or  misdemeanor domestic violence convictions.

One key provision that does take immediate effect deals with mental illness, a major issue in the debate over gun violence.  This provision requires judges who have ordered someone to undergo outpatient mental health treatment to rule on whether that person should have their gun rights suspended during treatment.

Ruger M77 Hawkeye Varmint rifles are time tested, bolt action, special application rifles at a great value. These rifles feature a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion. The heavy contour, hammer forged barrel with target crown provides long range accuracy shot after shot. The wide, target forend gives stability on sandbags or other support surfaces.

-Non-rotating, Mauser-type controlled round feed extractor is the most positive case extraction system ever invented, and features a fixed blade-type ejector that positively ejects the empty cases as the bolt is moved fully rearward.-Hinged solid-steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge. Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.-Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.-Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.-Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).-Unique Two-Stage Target Trigger featuring a short âtake-upâ stage, followed by a crisp, light target pull withno creep or overtravel.-Also Includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels.
