A 9mm pistol.  A 9mm Carbine with front hand grip and light.  I purchased separately 2 extra 10 round mags for the Carbine = 3 - 10 rounders.  I purchased 2 additional 10 round mags for the 380/9mm (interchangeable).  Total of 3 - 10 round mags and 1 - 8 round mag.  Confused yet???  lol.  Everything totaled up, I spent close to $800 on everything forementioned.  Each firearm has less than 40 rounds down range.  Everything is like brand new.  I got them for my wife for home defense, etc.  She really isn't into guns much, and she isn't shooting them.  So I'm selling them at a loss......  $650 for everything.  .380 pistol with compensator and laser sight, 9mm pistol and 9mm carbine with front handguard and light, and a total of 6 - 10 round mags and 1 - 8 round mag.  I bought everything from online retailers, so I know the almost $800 is right.  You might be able to pay a wee bit less for everything brand new if you shopped around.  But you can't touch the $650 price.  No background check BS, etc.  Just show some valid TN ID and we're good to go.  Cash, face to face transaction.

2.) factory cloth case
3.) Target
4.) paperwork
5.) One Magazine 7 round
6.) Crimson Trace wooden lasergrips

The gun has also the following features:

* I AM OPEN TO ALL TRADES. THIS GUN WITH A PORTED BARREL   YOU CANT BUY THIS GUN WITH THE PORTED BARREL. vERY RARE GUN AND SUPER GOOD SHOOTER....

Adding to the versatility of the popular T 3, this new variant features a barrel with a built in compensator, yet retains the overall Commander length slide of this versatile compact.

The 45acp normally does not generate a huge amount of pressure, but modern day +P loads offered by premier manufacturers such as Cor-Bon, Winchester and Federal present increased muzzle flip on a standard 1911 since they are loaded to higher pressures to increase hollow point performance. This is where the T3 Comp comes into its own. Since the ports of the Schuemann Match Grade Barrel are positioned directly on top of the slide, the muzzle flip is reduced by forcing the energy of the blast downwards.

Another feature unique to the T3 Comp is the front sight being integrated into the barrel rather than being positioned on the slide. The slide is relieved to allow the hybrid comp ports to be blended into the cutout on the slide. A sight cut is made directly on to the port area of the barrel, so the front sight stays in line with the barrel while the slide retracts during shooting.

The new T3 Comp retains all of the familiar upgrades of the standard T3 that you have all come to admire. The addition of the new features allow this defensive fighting gun even more versatility.

The features include:

Schuemann Match Grade AET (Advanced Accelerated Threads) barrel 
Frame and Slide cut from Forgings 
Match-Grade Lightweight Trigger with Black-Out Finish Scheme 
Heinie Slant-Pro front and rear sight Rear-of-Slide serrated to match 
Forged Slide Stop cut flush with chamfered frame for easy removal

I'm restructuring my collection and considering selling both of my rare crates.

These are not any standard mosin crate. I have only seen two of these. So I bought both when I could. They are not painted but one says ""EK"" on it with a ""M39"" tagged on it post-import. The other has ""M91"" ""M30"" tagged on it with a brochure holder.

These are natural wood and with a little work would look very cool. They have that antique industrial look to them and could be made to fit a number of different rifles.

$150 a piece. First come first serve. The only way you will see another crate like this is if you choose to only buy one of the two."

Hello all -

Looking to part ways with my LNIB Glock 42 .380 ACP. Purchased new approximately three months ago, ran one box of ammo through it, pocket carried once or twice, and it has sat in the safe ever since. Like new condition, no scratches or finish wear. Has brand new Truglo TFO tritium night sights, 3 six-round magazine, 2 with flat bases and 1 with a pinky extension, grip plug, a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster, and the box and all the factory stuff.

G42 is currently listed at Cabelas for $450, night sights were $50+$25 to install, third magazine was $25, holster was $20, grip plug was $5, for a total value of $575. Asking $500 for the package, and will leave all 3 mags loaded with fresh Winchester PDX1 95grn hollow points for asking price.

Gun is located in Klamath Falls, willing to travel a moderate distance to make a deal. While I realize many law enforcement agencies have expressed they will not enforce this stupid background check law, I do require we do a transfer legally, through an FFL. I have a dealer here in Klamath Falls that will complete a transfer for only the $10 it costs to do the background check, and if we can meet at this dealer, I will cover the $10. If a different dealer is used, any additional costs are covered by the buyer.

Only trade interest would be for a similarly LNIB Gen 3 Glock 17.

Thanks guys!"

Looking to part ways with my Rossi Ranch Hand in .357 Mag/.38 Special. Bought from Cabela's a couple years ago for $450, ran maybe 3-4 boxes of ammo through it, cleaned it, and it's been sitting in my safe ever since. Very good condition. Would make for a heck of a short-barrel rifle if a person were inclined to spend the money on a tax stamp, or a fun plinker or truck gun, surprisingly easy to shoot accurately up to 50+ yards. Replaced the plastic magazine tube follower with a metal follower, and removed the cheesy loose ""safety"" on top of the receiver with a plug, with a parts cost of $50. Looking for $425.

Comes with .223, 30-06 and an additional Carbide Blade, from Father's estate $400. Original cost $575 Key Benefits The power to drive the trimmer comes from a totally enclosed fan cooled 1/8 horsepower 120VAC motor. The trimmer is designed for volume usage, high quality ball bearings support both the motor and the trimmer shaft, not cheap bronze bushings. The trimmer comes with a retained clear LEXAN chip guard. This prevents brass shavings from flying around, won't get misplaced or lost, and lets you safely observe the trimming process. A cogged timing belt and pulley set positively drive the trimmer smoothly and without vibration. The Giraud Carbide blade is standard with the trimmer. It allows a 15 degree inside case mouth chamfer and 45 degree outside chamfer for smooth burr free seating of VLD style bullets. Dedicated power switch to turn the unit off and on. No more plugging and unplugging to use the trimmer. Solid metal base to support the trimmer in both horizontal and vertical positions complete with screw mounted rubber mounting feet to prevent unnecessary marring of table tops and work surfaces. Spring loaded case holder to prevent unintentional touching of cases with the rotating cutter blade in vertical position. 50BMG available with special cutting blade and mounting head for thicker case wall, all on the same unit. No need to purchase a separate trimmer for the big guy.

227,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4660227,"For Sale:  T/C Contender .357 barrel, 10"". Factory compensated","Lincoln County, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 175,"Listed On: Thursday, September 3, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got what appears to be a 70s or 80s T/C Contender barrel. Length is 10"" and it's chambered in .357 Magnum. Includes elevation-adjustable front sight and windage-adjustable folding rear sight, full-length vent rib, factory compensator ports, and a removable shotshell choke along with choke key. From what I can find the purpose of this choke was to give this barrel similar capabilities to a .410 using a long proprietary shotshell that T/C called a Hot Shot, although unfortunately these are long discontinued. The choke has straight ""rifling"" meant to cancel out the spin that scatters shot out of most rifled barrels, and a constriction the purpose of which was to strip the plastic shot capsule and wad away from the shot (along with tightening the pattern like on a shotgun muzzle.) 

Although you can't really get the ammo the choke was originally designed for the information I was able to turn up indicates it also works well for readily available .357 ratshot/snakeshot rounds meant for revolvers, significantly tightening patterns and increasing range. With the choke removed, it can fire any .357 or .38 Special loaded within SAAMI safe specs. Profile is round heavy barrel and condition is good overall, bluing is shiny and intact except for two spots on either side where the Contender's frame contacted the barrel."

Designed both by and for undercover LEO agents, the STI Shadow is a compact aluminum framed pistol with everything anyone needs in a backup pistol.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable. Comes with a quality IWB holster and two set of grips, one set original to the pistol.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot Heinie straight 8 tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system. All external features are KG coated black."

Fox Sterlingworths in 16ga. are seen often enough.  But scant few like this one!  Anybody who has watched the vintage gun market realizes that the 16ga. Sterlingworth value has been discovered, as they are all built on the diminutive 20ga. frame and handle better than most all other American built 16's.  The prices  have gone up significantly with the really nice 16ga. guns being bought up, thereby reducing the available guns on the market.  This gun, sn364093 made in 1928, is NOT one of the normal Fox Sterlingworths.  First, the FACTORY ORIGINAL CONDITION is phenomenal with 99% case color and barrel blue, 85%  trigger guard blue.  The original wood has had finish added.  It still has some of the ""jewelling"" marks on the breech end of the barrels.  Second, THIS IS AN EJECTOR GUN, and there are few of these guns that ever come up for sale!  The gun has been carried and hunted, evidenced by the minor marks on the wood. but it has been cared for well and the metal is near new.  In the world of investment quality guns, condition reigns king, and this gun has it for sure.  As hard as it is to find a decent ejector 16ga. Sterlingworth, this one has to be one of the best you will ever have the opportunity to own, and it will always be highly desirable.  At 6lbs. 3oz. and balanced just so in hand, it demonstrates the true delight of a fine vintage American double gun!  The mechanics are perfect, as are the screws and checkering, and the stock is 14 1/4"" to the original butt plate.  There are no ""warts"" on this gun, with the exception of a chip of wood missing on the right side of the forend, which is being fixed while the gun is listed for sale.  See the photos and you see this small chip that will be near invisible when corrected.  For the collector or shooter/collector, this is a great example of a near new Fox that is 87 years old."

10/22 Overmolded Stock - .920 Barrel, Red Lava
Manufacture ID: 22012

Hogue's overmolded stocks are constructed by molding a super strong field, rigid fiberglass reinforced skeleton or insert, that precisely fits the long gun's action. This rigid skeleton is then overmolded with durable, but soft, synthetic elastomer (rubber). During the heat and extreme pressure of injection molding the elastomer adheres chemically as well as mechanically to the skeleton, resulting in a permanent bond between the rubber and the insert. The super strong skeleton give the stock their strength, and the precise molded dimensions provide a perfect drop in fit of your rifle.

Has 300 rounds through it and attached to an Anderson lower can ring 6"" steel plates at 200 yards with a zero power red dot optic. trading to build my next gun, with no optics which is why I need the fixed front. 

Can trade upper without BCG if you like. Will include Magpul Mbus Gen 2 flip up front sight with trade (keeping the rear). 

I am looking for a carbine or mid length upper with a fixed and pinned A2 front post and a decent BCG (if we are trading BCGs) and a dust cover and forward assist. If yours is nicer, I can add some cash. I would prefer yours be a free float rail, but not a deal breaker. 

Thanks for looking! Feel free to make offers on uppers and I would be willing to trade the whole rifle. I respond to everyone, but please no offers for .22s, shotguns, or pistols. 5.56 rifles or uppers only please."

Mossberg 715T Tactical Rifle
(1) 25 Round Magazine
Magazine Speedloader
Cable Lock
Owner’s Manual
These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market, since first introduced in 2010.

Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, adjustable stock and a 25 round magazine.

Buyer must be an Ohio resident with an Ohio Drivers License and Ohio Concealed Carry Permit.  Face-to-face meeting in north Dayton area.  I am firm on the price as I believe it to be very fair, especially with the additional magazines.   

The only trade I would consider is a 9mm Glock in FDE.  Please email with any questions and thanks for looking."

MSRP: $419.00

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

First, I have a concealed weapons license, can pass a background check, and am willing to pay the FFL transfer fee.

What I'm looking for is a fireable .22lr cartridge conversion of an open top percussion revolver with an octagonal barrel, preferably a converted 1851 Navy .36 caliber replica. 

I realize this is an unusual request, but the reason I'm looking for this type of gun is so I can use my favorite type of ammo with one of my favorite 1800s style guns. I understand from my research that there have been successful .22lr conversions of 1851 models (e.g. with Kirst Konverters). 

If you live in (or are willing to travel to) the Melbourne/Palm Bay area and have a .22lr conversion of a percussion revolver, please contact me so we can set up a time to meet at a local gun shop, look over the condition, and perhaps negotiate an offer. 

My preference is an 1851 Navy .36 caliber replica converted to .22lr, but I'm also willing to consider other period percussion revolvers converted to .22lr (except for 1858 Remington; I'm only interested in open top styles). 

Must be in fireable condition.

God bless!"

When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol.

The Model 36 was designed in the era just after World War II, when Smith & Wesson stopped producing war materials and resumed normal production. For the Model 36, they sought to design a revolver that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the Smith & Wesson J-frame.
The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name ""Chiefs Special"" won.[2] A three inch barreled version of this design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel plated finish.[3] It was produced as the ""Chiefs Special"" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36. The ""Chiefs Special"" continued to be manufactured as a separate variant.

I carry a great deal and the 1911 is just way to much gun for that. It's way to nice to be a truck gun to get scratched up. It's just not practical for my use/needs. Gun has had less than 1 box of rounds fired. No scratches, no dings, no bumps, no smudges. Gun was cleaned and re-boxed after 1 use. Comes with factory case, paperwork, lock, and extra magazine, just as it came from factory. I will entertain any trade offer or cash offer but I am by no means desperate enough to take a low ball cash offer on the gun. Feel free to make a reasonable cash offer or trade offer."
