This is a one owner Handgun, I purchased brand new in 2012. I have put between 500-1000 rounds through this weapon, all at the range. Carried daily for 2+ years. Very good condition. Well maintained. Laser works great and batteries are still strong as I have rarely used it. Excellent carry weapon. Carry holster holds the second mag giving you excellent protection and backup rounds."

Built on the famous Model 700 cylindrical action, Remington Varmint rifles
are the most accurate factory-built models we produce. You ll be stunned by
the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won t
be so lucky. If you value tiny groups and the big-time weather resistance
of stainless steel and synthetic, consider the Model 700 Varmint Stainless
Fluted (SF) an instant treasure. Its 26"" heavy-contour barrel is fluted for
weight reduction while maintaining rigidity and rapid cooling. We also
added a concave dish crown that protects the rifling lands and promotes
tack-driving bullet flight. The rugged synthetic stock has overmolded
panels for a sure grip and a vented beavertail fore-end that keeps air
flowing around the barrel. There are dual front swivel studs for sling and
bipod.

the durability limits of stainless steel by coating the stainless steel

handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic
stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with Hogue
rubber overmolding featured at the grip and forend areas. These
revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest
environments. Shots are made infinitely more comfortable with the SuperCell
recoil pad. X-Mark Pro Trigger System gives a level of crispness and shot

I have included a pic of one without the cover so you can see what it looks like naked.

The included covers are really nice with a big soft rubber ring so it is more comfortable.

They are not really marked for size but they seem to vary from Med to XL compared to other helmets.  The webbing suspension allows for a great deal of adjustment.

The reinforced feed lips and anti-tilt follower do not require a clamp to keep the feed lips from spreading when kept loaded for extended periods of time. Made from improved Troy proprietary military-grade, chemical, biological and impact resistant polymer and extensively tested by Special Ops units, the Troy BattleMag outperforms all other polymer magazines in functionality and reliability. Includes a flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate lock – a $5 value. Available in Black

I was not looking to buy a 5"" 1911 but was so impressed with it, I did. It has a awesome 3.5 pound adjustable match grade trigger,  a match grade barrel, awesome fiber optic sights The R1 Enhanced features a no-snag, Novak-type rear sight adjustable for elevation and the front sight is a long, robust post with a red fiber-optic insert that front site that  makes acquiring a target fast & easy. Remington added an Ed Brown-style beavertail grip safety, which is a huge improvement over the original GI design in both operation and comfort. It also has a factory extended mag release and sweet grips. I shouldn't have bought it, because I NEED one with a 3"" barrel for work. My loss is your gain.

Call/text REDACTED Dave if interested. Thanks

Speer's Gold Dot Hollow Point is one of the best self-defense rounds available today. A top choice of law enforcement agencies across the country, the Gold Dot uses a patented process that forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non-corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance."

This scope includes a certificate that allows you to order a free ""Cartridge Calibrated Custom Clicker."" What that consists of is an elevation knob calibrated to your favorite ammo load and barrel length. According to Burris:

•Designed for big-game hunters who want a custom riflescope to build an affordable custom shooting platform
•Customized elevation turret calibrated to your specific ammunition
•Free custom elevation knob upon request, using the promotion code from your product manual
•Dial in your yardage to the target and the riflescope automatically compensates for bullet drop; no need for holdover
•The C4 Wind MOA™  reticle has 1-MOA tick marks up to 10 MOA on each side so you can easily compensate for wind
•WindMap works seamlessly with the C4 Wind MOA reticle
•WindMap helps you determine hold-off for your exact cartridge; WindMap values indicate how many MOA tick marks to hold into the wind to compensate for a 10 m.p.h. wind at 100-yard increments
•Finger-adjustable, low-profile turrets create a sleek profile; indications always reflect a change in the point of impact, for pinpoint accuracy
•A separated power ring and eyepiece design accepts flip-up lens covers
•High-grade optical glass provides excellent brightness, clarity, and lasting durability
•Quality, precision-ground lenses are larger than those of comparable scopes, for better light transmission
•Index-matched, Hi-Lume®  multicoating aids in low-light performance, increasing your success rate
•A double internal spring-tension system allows the scope to hold zero through shock, recoil, and vibrations
•Precision-gauged and hand-fitted internal assemblies maintain a consistent point of impact through the magnification range, regardless of shock and vibration
•Positive steel-on-steel adjustments ensure repeatable accuracy
•Waterproof
•Nitrogen-filled scope tubes prevent internal fogging and in cold and rain
•The solid, stress-free, 1-piece outer tube is extremely durable; will withstand shock and vibration of even the heaviest-recoiling calibers"
