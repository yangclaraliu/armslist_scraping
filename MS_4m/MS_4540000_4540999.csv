Shoots amazingly, apparently some people say this is a 2 moa gun at best, but with some good ammo I ended up getting 1.25 moa roughly out of this gun. Two additions come with this gun, I have a factory railed forend that was not pictured but is included, also included is an installed neu-trigger which actually ended up lowering the trigger pull and making it feel more crisp on the break. If you need instructions on how to remove it (if that is your prerogative) I will gladly give instructions on how to remove it. It's incredibly easy install and uninstall. Also included is the factory magazine, the factory cleaning kit, and the instruction manual (not pictured, was in file cabinet at house) Physically there is nothing amiss about the gun, from the pictures you can see there are no signs of use. If you would like more pictures, or have any general questions feel free to email me. I accept USPS money order, Western Union money order, Personal checks (if it bounces expect bad rep. and my wrath), Discrete Paypal, and Certified Checks. I only Ship in the USA via UPS obviously, and if you live in a state or are unsure if you live in a state with restrictive gun laws it is your responsibility to be aware of that.

The Sig Sauer P229 Equinox is a medium frame, semi-automatic handgun that is designed for on-duty, self-defense, along with conceal and carry purposes. The P229 models are used by law enforcement agency's such as the U.S. Coast Guard and ICE. The Equinox name refers to the design of the two-tone version that Sig Sauer introduced into the P229 line-up. It has a color contrast between the slide and frame that features brush polished flats and nickle accents on the slide. It has an integrated accessory rail on the slide for mounting a tactical light or laser onto the frame.
The overall length of the P229 is 7.1-inches, with a height of 5.4-inches, and a barrel length of 3.9-inches. The slide material is made from stainless steel, and features a Nitron finish with ground flats. The frame material is made from aluminum alloy with a black hard anodized finish. The grips are checkered custom woodshop that include front strap serrations. The magazine can hold 12-rounds of .40 S&W ammunition.
The combination of the TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

From Manufacturer: 
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed and its sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hex-wrench and your fingers."

    Taurus 617 7-shot .357 magnum snub-nosed revolver, blue finish
    The Taurus ""Ribber"" grips tame the recoil of stout .357 mag loads considerably. This was my first gun and so it has some sentimental value to me but I don't carry it anymore or shoot it enough to rationalize keeping it. It has a small, very minor blemish on the cylinder as seen in the closeup pic but is 100% mechanically sound.

The Range Master shares several of the inherent performance traits as the Target Master. The overall body is more typical to the classic 1911 platform in looks only. The forged steel, Master Series frame provides the solid foundation for a hand fit, buttery smooth slide actuation from the first round to the last. And competition ready checkering and adjustable rear sight put you in the hunt right out of the box. So if you are the type that is serious about hitting the same hole multiple times, the Range Master can get you there.

The information below is an excerpt from an article found on the internet. This example is in good condition except that the cylinder does not function correctly all of the time. It has a 3 digit serial number. ""The mysterious London Pistol Company revolver was actually a product of the Manhattan Firearms Manufacturing Company. The London Pistol Company side-plated .31 caliber pocket pistol were factory-seconds possessing design flaws such as blemishes from screws driven completely through the right side frame or imperfect hand engraving. These weapons may have been placed in a sort of reject bin in various stages of completion. When Manhattan began to phase out production of the .31 caliber pocket pistols in favor of the newer .36 caliber Navy models, management decided to complete and market the factory-seconds under the London Pistol Company name. To these weapons were added the 1859 copyright date stamped beneath the pistol immediately in front of the trigger guard. Thus these were marketed most likely during 1860.Since these were factory-seconds, they had already been stamped with the Manhattan serial numbers. Consequently, no Manhattan pocket model .31 caliber pistols share the exact same serial numbers as those found on the London specimens. Waldo Nutter in his Manhattan Firearms believes less than a few hundred Londons were manufactured and sold. Our research has uncovered fewer than three dozen known specimens today (April 2008)The London Pistol Company revolvers are engraved with the company name only with no reference to a specific location of manufacture.""

I initially purchased this gun for a handgun review video but due to delays in shipping it took about 2 months for me to receive the gun. Ended up using a buddies handgun for the review. Went to the range yesterday and put 18 rounds through it with no issues. 

Gun comes with 3 adjustable grip back straps and will include 2 17 round magazines (Only if you are LEO / Peace Officer. Must present Dept ID, no exceptions) Also comes with standard Smith and Wesson hard plastic gun carry case.

From Manufacturer: 
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed and its sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hex-wrench and your fingers."

As long as its not flat nose and not cheap russian ammo, it will eat it with 100% reliability."
