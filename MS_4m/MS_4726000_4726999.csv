This firearm was built brand new with all top tier parts for a customer a few weeks back. Accuracy was the goal on this one! We started with Rainier Arms Match ambidextrous billet stripped receivers. We finished the lower out with a CMMG LPK, Shockwave Blade brace and hand tuned Elftmann Tactical trigger. This is the best trigger I have ever pulled. The weight is light and take up and reset is non-existent. You have to feel it to believe it. The upper half includes Rainier Arms match bolt carrier group and select match 8.5” barrel. This combo is guaranteed sub-moa with match ammo. The upper was finished out with a Rainier slide lock charging handle, SLR Rifleworks 8” rail, nitrided gas tube, Seekins adjustable gas block and Seekins Flash hider. The main optic is a Primary Arms 1-6x24 30mm scope with ACS reticle, Butler Creek flip caps and Primary Arms deluxe extended scope mount. The backup is a Primary Arms Gen 2 Reflex sight on a Daniel Defense 45 degree mount. Both have great clarity and long eye relief, perfect on a pistol. This build includes over $2400 in parts alone, not taking into account the labor time to build, break-in and sight-in! It has had 40 rounds of Sig 125 grain match ammo through it for break-in and sight-in, which gave us the wonderful 3 shot group you see pictured in the bottom corner. I also can provide entire build sheet on request. This little beast will make the perfect compact long range gun or lightweight deer slayer! All firearm trade offers will be considered. We will also be accepting layaway on this high end build. Credit cards are accepted, but card use will forfeit a 3.5% cash discount. Blackacre Arms is a FFL licensed shop located in Stanfield, NC. All federal, state and local laws apply. Shipping to a local FFL is available, if necessary. Please contact me with any questions or interest. I can be reached by direct message or by email, text or phone at the number and address shown. Thanks for your time and we look forward to your business.

This is not a Talo edition or another distributor special edition. This is the gun Colt built for the 100th anniversary. The gun includes the walnut display case that came from Colt. The picture of the gun in the case is not the case and gun I am selling. The box the display case was shipped in has never been opened--it is factory sealed. The gun has the Custom Shop blue box, the white sleeve, and all items and paperwork the gun was shipped with. The other pictures are of my actual gun. These are seldom offered for sale. I am selling this one for $2975 but would consider reasonable offers that involve a trade for a mint Python. Prefer a face-to-face sale in Central Ohio. If I ship the gun to your FFL, the cost will be $60 because the box will be large (it will have the gun and display case in it). Shipping insurance is optional and the actual cost of insurance will be added to the shipping cost if the buyer wants it. If the gun is sold locally, it must be cash only.

The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

This example is un-converted and in factory order and I am including 3 magazines, 1 original 5 rd, and  2 converted 30 rounders for your pleasure.  They all work and feed fine, although I have only fired this a very few times.  This is as good as it comes, it is in perfect conditions and working order.  These will be impossible to find, very soon and is a bargain priced weapon at this price

This pistol has ONLY the original Croatian serial numbers on the right and NO large print new number like my other ones and every other.  Also, unlike the others listed on Gunbroker, NO broken grips on this one AND it DOES come with the xeroxed manual Century gave with their guns (It came with my other one)******* If you are a collector, or just looking for a proven, strong and reliable 9mm Hi-Cap pistol that was designed specifically for combat, this is something cool that none of your buddies will have. Very few will even know what it is. This one, like most of the imported ones, has superb bluing and finish for a military sidearm. There is about as close to ZERO handling or wear as you can get on an issued and surplused pistol. In fact, these are the finest surplus pistols that were issued that I have seen and I have owned almost all of them. An open slide design borrowed from Beretta that eliminates the common source of jams and the tilting block barrel mechanism from the Walther and Beretta designs. This pistol was redesigned into a polymer model in 2000 and then became the wildly popular Springfield XD, which you will notice, all say Made In Croatia. The mags from the XD-9 will fit this gun BUT there is a change needed to the little slot that locks it in (5 minutes with a dremel and tons of cheap mags available including 30 rounders, 20 rounders...). There are 2 online sites with original PHP mags as well. I have a copy of the manual they sent with these that I will send as well. I have shot my other ones, and when you find the ammo it loves, it shoots quarter sized groups at 10 yards. Double action, it is safe to store or carry with a round ready as the first shot is a long double action though you can cock the hammer for a light first shot. Here is a bit of history on this pistol....
By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. 
PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - translates to First Croatian Pistol) is a different and interesting weapon which was developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s
The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges. Other features and the appearance were similar to a Walther 38. Open slide design combined with a straight recoiling barrel lent itself to very good accuracy, along with elimination of possible jams of ejected casings. The slide, frame and smaller operating parts were milled out of solid blocks of steel, a procedure which was later dropped in favor of more economically feasible investment casting."

It comes with the usual factory stuff including 2 magazines, 3 interchangeable backstraps, a loader, owner's manual, and of course the safety lock (because everyone needs another one of those laying around the house). 

I bought the magazine release kit from Beretta, so it also comes with the small, medium, and large magazine release buttons.

I also installed rubberized Talon grips, but those are fairly easy to peal off if you don't like them. The gun itself is in really good shape. I bought it new and I've only put around 250-300 rounds through it.

Would be willing to trade for Glock 26 or 19 gen 3 or 4 only."

Handmade Sniper Ghillie Suit
Low crawl Camouflage Desert Camo
Pictures are of Actual Ghillie Suit that is being sold

Not as light or pretty as the ones that are being mass produced for airsoft but is that what you want to trust.

 Ghillie Suits are camouflaged suits made of burlap, twine and similar materials that provide a high degree of concealment for military, hunters, and paintball/airsoft players. Although some ghillie suits are manufactured for sale, many military snipers and others make their own suits, both for the ritual and also for matching the suits to certain climates and terrain. 
 Every individual has their own traditional preferences. The single most important of these is an apparently strong desire to spend as much time as  possible crawling around. Extremely low profile and as little burlap as possible between them and the ground. The suits tend to be, simple with no particular frills, built on function rather than “gimmicks”

Military Suits have limited jute on the front (to discourage snagging) for low crawling situations

One pocket on the upper part of each sleeve have been retained from the original top
Velcro tighteners at the wrist to adjust fit

Sonny Crockett had one in season 3 of Miami Vice, now you can have one too.  They are getting harder to find in any kind of great condition.  This one is pristine condition and comes with all the original items Original S&W box (s/n does not match though but the box is correct and in excellent shape for the years), original wax paper the gun was wrapped in, Safety pamphlet, warranty card and statement, 645 owners manual, magazine dis-assembly, up opened S&W cleaning kit, and finally a warning label.  The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  This is the most complete package that I have seen and the weapon is the best looking on the net.  Check out the others and you will see.

$795 cash or trade.  The only item I am interested in are handguns.  No Taurus, Glocks, Kahr,Hi Point, Keltec Derringers,  handgun. Partial trade and cash OK.  Handguns must be in excellent shape as this one is.  Please respond to the email below since I do not always get a timely response from this site.  Pickup must be in Lake Worth/Boynton Beach area since I cannot drive to far.  Low balls will not be responded too.

No welding has been done, no weldments are included. We have built maybe 50 rifles with these receivers, Actual product is pictured below. NOTE these receivers were rolled from ORF flats that we bought before they closed. The mag wells were trimmed in a way that makes the mags fit to tight, we just simply put a slight gap in the front of these before welding and there was no issue. We have 6 of these left here and I'm on a mission to clear out all of our old stock.

If you are hesitant I can provide prior build pics and process pics if needed. I just wanted to disclose this so a prospective builder would be aware of this issue. Of course we prefer using our flats or LSC flats, but these are rolled and half the price. Also gapping the front of the mag well prior to welding is an easy fix!

We just built three 94 rifles with 16in barrels on these receivers about a month ago, with no complaints! 
-The first picture is the actual product.
-The second picture is the receiver finished and built into rifle.
-The third picture is the receiver finished and built into rifle.
THE PRICE IS $125 EACH, PLUS $13.85 FOR SHIPPING (USPS PRIORITY). We will combine shipping on multiple orders.
NOTE: These RECEIVERS ARE AN FFL ITEM, MUST BE SHIPPED TO A FFL.
