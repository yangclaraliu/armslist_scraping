It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights.

Specifically, the Duty line is most closely related to the CZ-75B models with its added firing-pin block, a passive safety system. Like the CZ 75, the P-09 can be fired in either single- or double-action modes and features a frame-mounted decocker installed (the pistol comes with an ambidextrous manual safety conversion also). The slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside. Though some shooters do not care for the reduced surface area with which to manipulate the slide, this slide-to-frame fit is unusually tight and enables a very efficient barrel lockup, providing exceptional accuracy.

The upper comes with flip up polymer sights, metal tactical light, Barska GLX green dot laser, and Sig Sauer STS-081 red dot sight with end cap covers mounted on a quick detachable riser. The light & laser both use the single CR123 batteries for easier purchasing and matching of power supply. The photos are not updated with the new tactical light & laser, but are mounted separately on the quad handrail. The Olympic Arms lower is a standard AR-15 lower receiver that has a Rodgers magazine well funnel fore grip with finger grooves, the longest buffer tube on the AR market (9 1/8 inches long) with a rubber cap on the end, Hogue rubber pistol grip, ambidextrous single point sling attachment end plate, and utilizes the 10 round modified UZI/IMI Israeli style magazine (with an adapter block welded on the back of it) which comes with a total of 4 magazines (and locks open to the rear after the last round is fired). This lower can be used with any other AR platform and the buffer tube is set up for the future installation of a SIG TAC Brace (if the new owner wants it that way). With the long buffer tube installed, it makes it easier to have a good place for a cheek placement when sighting in and firing at the range without your face too close to the sights.

 If you have inquiries or questions, all that I ask is that you would respect the seller’s wishes when the questions/inquiries are answered. What I am asking is--please don't low ball my selling price for any outrageous offer--the price is $875 FIRM or trade for the pistol described in the ad. For NC residents, you will need a photo copy of your NC driver’s license, your NC CCW permit, and sign a bill of sale along with a photo copy of my NC driver’s license and NC CCW permit. All NC laws and ATF laws apply in this transaction. If you’re looking for an FFL transfer and shipping, then the extra costs will apply to the buyer. This AR pistol was my second build to own and loved it ever since. My son and I (both of us former military) have taken this firearm to the indoor range, along with my other AR pistols, and shot this with great performance. This is not the first time that I've sold other firearms of mine. I don't have to sell this item, but since I own many other AR pistols in different calibers, I'd figure that I'd give a try out on the website. You can email me for more details or questions. I thank you for your time and inquiries."

	Hey all, 
I have an old but great revolver for sale. It is a Ruger Security Six 357 magnum. It is the 4 inch model with adjustable sights. This one was one of the first run produced in 1972 and is a  low 4 digit serial number. It has normal blue wear from holster and a drop mark/ding on the rear sight. Its not too big of a deal and could be replaced pretty easily and cheaply if you wanted. I just had this at the range a day or so ago and it shot fantastic with no issues. I would keep this, but i have a security Six in 6 inch already, so it would just be a duplicate! haha.
	This is in good shape overall and the gun shoots great. As far as trades are concerned, I have a few. I would consider trades for a PMR30, a marlin 357/38 lever action, “maybe” a SP101, Draco AK Pistol, PLR-16, SU-16etc. Honestly, just shoot me an offer. worst I can say is no! (Please no 22s, black powder, or shotguns). Rifle wise, aside from the lever 357/38, I am mainly looking for semi-auto, but would consider others if the deal is good. Best bet is to message me on here or shoot me a text at REDACTED. I can add ammo or cash on my end for certain trades, but prefer to trade even or trade with ammo/cash on your end if possible. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Very excellent condition weapon with original hard case and all original documentation/manuals, tools, except trigger lock [a real loss for sure. lol]. Also has muzzle brake, barrel cap, etc. ATI clone of the H and K pistol/rifle. You dont see these very often in the pistol configuration as most were made as carbines. This one can be either.

Extras include: New stainless 16"" carbine barrel, 4-position ATI metal sliding stock [not the cheap plastic crap for airsoft] 1-10 round original magazine, 5-22 round GSG magazines, 1-110 round GSG drum magazine [new], new BSA Red-dot sight, heavy duty clip on bungee lanyard, and new aircraft aluminum faux silencer with internal steel tube, thread adapter and threaded cap for the pistol configuration. Adds nice balance on the front end.
I also have the original pistol barrel and rear butt cap for the pistol configuration as it would be illegal to use the sliding stock with the pistol barrel. All three takedown screws have been replaced with HK style push pins for much faster takedown without tools
.
I have the complete cap screw replacement set for this gun as well as a 4-part video showing the complete teardown and screw replacement order. Changing the barrel including re-sighting the BSA takes about 15-20 minutes and uses one allen wrench. I have replaced the screws necessary to change the barrel. I have not replaced the rest. I will include all original screws and the original three screw pairs I replaced with push pins.
Fun gun for the plinker. Surprisingly accurate as a pistol to the 25 or so yards we had it sighted in at. Very accurate with the 16 inch barrel. Red dot works better than I expected, even in strong light.

This gun is like new. Has only 100 rds through it. It is a Gen 4, so it comes with the extra backstraps. This gun has been gone over internally, and comes with extra magazines, and extras: truglo tritium/fiber optics sights, optimized duty sights, master sight pusher tool, competition spring kit, lone wolf 3.5 lb connecter, flame and crossbones slide cover plates, titanium safety plunger, stainless steel pin kit, Hogue grip, extended teardrop mag release, chrome extended slide release, nylon holster, threaded Lone Wolf barrel, Lone Wolf compensater, and thread protecter, 26 rd magazine, and a total of 5 13 rd magazines. It is .45 ACP and has a 5.3 inch barrel.  The tritium/fiber optics sights are on it now, but the sight pusher makes it easy to change them. These sights are the brightest I have seen. If you want the latest and greatest full size Glock- the 41 is what you need. I am asking $650 for the gun and will travel 1 hr in any direction for an eye to eye sale at any FFL dealer. Background check is required. Cash deal only. The only reason I am selling it, is because after putting all these extras in it, I feel it doesn't fit my hand. OBO. I WILL CONSIDER OFFERS."

Maybe you have a stock with a bunch of gouges in it, or was carved, or maybe even has the ugliest paint job on it. 

I'm not looking for a beauty queen here, actually the opposite.
I want to practice stock refinishing and restoration on mosins, as I have a soft spot for them.
The rifle must be in shootable condition
The stock shouldn't have any cracks in it that make it unsafe to shoot.

I purchased this SIG firearm on 4/20/15 brand new. I finally had time to go shoot it today 4/26/15. At the range I was very impressed with how accurate and smooth the gun shot . However the trigger is a little too light on the SA side for my me.  Im positive there is someone out there  who will love this gun and the fast/light trigger pull it came with.  I just feel its not for me.  My loss your gain. It has only had 70 rounds thru it and that was today.  I used the sig grease on the slide and rails prior to shooting. Never Holstered , and as good as new. I have the case and the all that came with it , Lock,mag, and extra mag is in the mail on its way..... asking 700.00 includes an extra magazine..... also Looking to trade for a H&K .45 compact...or H&K usp .40 or .45 compact .

The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8” barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk.

Barrel was professionally cut down to 16 1/2"" and RECROWNED, and front sight was dovetailed into barrel. Stock was painted flat black and has a Jurassic Park dinosaur in red. Has a removable box magazine and can be used as a single shot while you teach a youngster MARKSMANSHIP, yet will probably shoot as well as quickly as the new cheap AR copies and be more reliable and accurate. Will handle SHORTS, LONGS, OR .22LR UNLIKE THE JAM-O-MATICS. Spend $ on ammo, not useless tactical B.S. Available for LOCAL CASH SALE, NO SHIPPING, TRADES, OR OFFERS, THANKS. I CAN'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND. Teach marksmanship, not making empty brass! What the hell is a tactical .22 for anyway???
