This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

These 1900 actioned Husqvarnas are renowned for accuracy, smooth as glass actions, and unrivaled workmanship.

Husqvarna began production of the 1900 in 1967 and continued to 1970 when Husqvarna rifle-making was taken over by FFV/Carl Gustaf. FFV/CG continued production until 1975-77.

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm or a Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs.

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $525.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

(OD Green and Black)

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle rifle), is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand. Made in U.S.A. 
 (This UBR includes the optional metal strike plate.)

The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Fixed Night SightsManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Safety2 18RD Magazines"

Answers to FAQ:
*I'm sorry but you cannot take the gun to go and test fire it, then come back and make an offer.
*You must have a photo ID, be a resident of WI, and free of felonies and DV misdemeanors.  I verify via CCAP.
*I realize that in WI it is allowed to sell a handgun to someone that is between the ages of 18-21 if it is a private transaction.  I however will not unless your are in the military and can prove it.
*I don't need to sell this pistol.  I am consolidating my calibers.
*All upgrades were done be myself, and I have the experience and training to do it.
*If you think the price is too high, I can give you links to purchase this online on Gunbroker.com.  The cheapest on there is for $579 sans shipping, transfer fee, and background check, and that is without the upgrades from WC mentioned above of which replaced some plastic parts."

This pistol has had a complete action job, and has a very sweet trigger. It is the most accurate and reliable 1911 I have ever owned. I bought this direct from Advantage Tactical and it has their wonderful Firefly night sights on it. It also has the complete set of inserts. These sights are amazing. They cost about $100 plus another $50-100 to install. 

The pistol was fired by Advantage 50 rounds to confirm zero and reliability. Then it was used as a display piece and a ""model"" for their online catalog. When I got it, I fired 100 rounds through it. That's it. the pistol looks virtually new, and has never been in a holster.

So if it is so great, why am I selling it? To get another, even more expensive one. I'm cheap-selling this one only to put more money into another one.

Cut and paste this link and you will see what the sights are, and the actual pistol itself in the ad. 

http://www.advantagetactical.com/handguns/rock-island-armory-1911-ats-sight-front-sight-should-be-installed-by-a-professional

This price is firm, and you will like it. It comes with its original box, 2 magazines, and all the papers as new, as well as all the inserts for the sights. These sights never die like tritium ones. Firefly material never loses its ability to glow in the dark, and they are highly visible in daylight and in the dark.

Call me or email through Armslist and we can arrange to meet in Santa Fe for you to handle it. You won't be disappointed. REDACTED

Buttery smooth action, detachable magazine.

I can attest you can see well enough to shoot way, way late into the evening or early dawn.
Even overnight with a good moon. (Of course, who would need to do that?)

You can find the rifle online for anywhere from $900-$1600

A nice .45 pistol with an amazingly low price!
TP Series pistols are Kahr's premium polymer pistol with match grade polygonal barrels, machined slide stops, dovetailed front sights, and slides with engraved markings and extensive cosmetic rounding. TP Series pistols are provided with three magazines.
CT Series pistols have Kahr's same patented features, but reduce production cost by use of barrels with conventional rifling, fewer operations on the slide exterior resulting in simple roll markings and pinned front sights. CT Series pistols use a metal-injection-molded slide stop, and are shipped with one magazine.

Litton is L-3/Insight who makes eotech and other high end night vision/thermal imaging optics. Excellent condition, image is excellent. This is light years ahead of my night owl gen 1 $200 scope. Would love to keep this but the taxman cometh as usual. Oh the joys of being self-employed. Also selling a couple eotechs and some other parts to raise funds as well.

This comes with the 1x and a 3x lens that are interchangeable. This is as close to a pvs-14 you're gonna get for the money, and it's pretty awesome. i can walk around my house in pitch black with it. runs on 2 AA batteries, can be weapon or helmet mounted via the 1/4-20 threaded hole just like pvs-14s and similar. It seems that this is a pretty rare unit.

Here it is mounted on a friend's ACH helmet/Rhino flip mount/J-Arm - which can all be found pretty cheap. It's made of some tough polymer so it's relatively lightweight. All the glass is basically in perfect condition. the dust in the pictures wipes off of course. I've only used nice lens microfiber cleaning cloths on it- I'll throw one in the deal as well.

here's my crappy attempt at capturing with my phone, for comparison to my eye it was pitch black. the actual image is more clear but it's hard to take pics on my phone. You really just have to see and handle it to understand the value. I'd be willing to meet up at night somewhere and let you try it out. as long as you're not creepy.
