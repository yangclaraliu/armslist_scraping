I also replaced the stock Heinie Tritium Slant Pro Night Sights with Dead Ringer Snake Eye Tritium Sights which for self defense are the best sights that you can get. I will have nothing but those on all my carry guns. Once you use these you will never use anything else. It does come with the stock Pro sights as well. This gun has less than 300rds put through it and is deadly accurate shooting 1.5 in groups at 15 yards. My wife just wants a Sig Sauer P938 that would be easier for her to conceal. The pkg new would run $600.00 The N82 Holster is $70.00 and the Dead Ringer sights are $120.00 so that's over $800.00 with taxes. I'm only asking $410.00 that's less than just the pistol.

I also installed a Magpul ASAP - AMBIDEXTROUS SLING ATTACHMENT POINT that helps if you want to use a one or two point sling.

Up for sale is a ""Test fired only"" S&W .38spcl+P Airweight Centennial (Enclosed Hammer/no Safety). Purchased for my mother, she put 4 rnds through it (reluctantly) and said it wasnt for her. This is the simplest and best solution for a home defense / carry weapon in my opinion, but she has opted for something smaller. 

Gun is virtually brand new and comes with all documentation, lock, box, and remaining ammo.

Local purchase only - Buyer must provide NC Pistol Permit (or) Copy of valid Concealed carry, Copy of valid NC Drv. License, and bill of sale. I would print a bill of sale but my printer is a piece of crap.

The Champion™ Operator® mates this forged Operator® frame with a shorter slide and a 4 inch barrel. This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed – and it doesn’t sacrifice any capacity.Pick up a Champion™ Operator®, and you’ll find that it’s a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Delta™ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3-Dot tritium combat sights mean that the Champion™ Operator® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Champion™ Operator® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Kote™ finish will keep it performing for years to come.You can carry the Champion™ Operator® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity. Then slide your favorite tactical light on the rail, and put it on your nightstand. When you need a feature-packed 1911 for night and day, reach for the Champion™ Operator&reg"

It was completely disassembled , cleaned, inspected and lubed. It was then converted from 50 rimfire to 56/50 by replacing the block and hammer. All the original parts are included with the carbine so it can be returned to as issued configuration .
Carbine is a blast to shoot ! Twenty eight grains of 2F  under a 370 gr bullet provides an accurate, easy recoil load. Brass, bullets, and dies readily available .
Conversion work was expertly done by Providence Tool Co in Plymouth, Wi.  Timing and headspace are perfect. I've seen a few rimfire conversions that ended up with drooping levers or questionable workmanship by Bubba, not this one ! A lot of hours went into making a safe, reliable firearm out of the rimfire wall hanger . 
Carbine had a nice uniform brown patina. Bore is excellent. I've fired hundreds of rounds and it is pure fun! Carbine always attracts a crowd and this may be your only chance to to get a genuine Peabody carbine in this condition you can shoot. Only reason I'm selling is daughter will be entering college next year. No trades, sorry ! Will be at Tulsa gun show November."

I've owned it for roughly two years now.
As soon as I got it home I stained the wood furniture back to the reddish/ brown color with a dim coat of gloss. Otherwise it was just bare wood. You can see where the Cosmoline soaked into the stock and discolored it a bit.
Being an M70 it does have the canted sight. It's hard to see unless you know what you're looking for. Even with the canted sight, believe it or not; this rifle can out-shoot my AR.
With that said you're probably wondering why I'm selling it. I was originally interested in purchasing an AK variant for it's wonderful, rugged ability to take it damn near anywhere. But this rifle has an RPK barrel on it, making it very accurate and it can sustain a high rate of fire. The downside to this barrel is it makes it an absolute hog to hump through the woods and up and down hills.
Since I don't feel like breaking my back all day carrying this thing everywhere and I don't visit the range as often as I did, I feel as though I must sell it to a new owner.
It comes with 4, 30 round mags.
I have roughly 300 rounds (mix brands) of 7.62x39 that may accompany the sale if we agree on a decent price.
Feel free to call or text me at (715) Five Seven Two - Nine Seven Nine Zero.
The price can always be negotiated. People need to make a living... Not interested in trades but never hurts to ask.
