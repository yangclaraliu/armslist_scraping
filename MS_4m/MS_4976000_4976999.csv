Nice trigger pull. Stock shows wear in a couple areas on left side. Arsenal repair on the foremost handguard. Receiver shows some minor pitting, and there is pitting on the barrel bands which are easily replaced if you want newly parkerized pieces. 

This rifle is dated 1943 by the serial, and by looking at it I highly believe it saw action in world war 2 and possibly beyond. It is not a display piece, this is a shooter, and a good one. I had never fired a rifle and my first shot was a near bullseye, with the second hitting dead on. So I think it is dialed in well.

It has a mysterious arsenal rack number which I have no idea how to trace. 

After MANY hours on youtube I learned to fully field strip, clean, oil and grease it, which I have recently done. So it is good to go. The parts on the inside looked to be in great shape.

My terms of sale are non-negotiable. Due to not having a car, this item is pick up only. Any and all weapons in your vehicle must be unloaded and in the trunk or out of reach. I will follow the same rules with only the m1 in my possession and unloaded. My family is near, so please understand my reasoning for this. I accept cash or paypal payments. 

I am including a butt stock kit tube , combo tool, cleaning kit with new brush, and 9 enblock clips and some grease.

The sling you see is what I am going to use on the new rifle I get, so it is not included.

Thanks for looking, ask any questions."
