That's a grand total of 10 factory mags! The magazines cost $30 each plus shipping; you can look around and see for yourself. I have only actually used 2 or 3 of them. With this many mags, you won't need to panic next year during the election like everyone else.

I'm looking to sell or trade this pistol face-to-face in Tampa Bay. I live near Ellenton but I work in Pinellas Park during the week. For a straight-up sale, I personally require a Florida DL, CCW and a signed Bill of Sale.

No, I won't trade for low end guns or other trades that are not of equal value. I'm sorry if  you don't understand that 8 extra factory mags adds to the value of the package; that's a personal problem and you're not getting them for free."

I am interested in bulk ammo so if you dont have the cash you can order some ammo and trade that.


This caliber is generally too large for J&J to allow and I am sure that we can get in there to try a handful of rounds if you want to shoot it.  If you buy it no charge for the range time and ammo - if you dont you pay for the range time and ammo.


This is a nice rifle. Nicer than my other Mosin.  The only reason I am keeping the 1922 round receiver is because its already in an Archangel stock.


This rifle is an inexpensive way to take almost anything on the North American continent.  The 7.62x54r packs a serious punch and Youtube has videos of the Mosin reaching out to 400 yards (with an optic) so you know the rifle will shoot accurately at least as far as you can shoot it!

I have put approximately 500 rounds through the gun. Please note that this is one of the early Gen 4's, the recoil spring is brand new (has approximately 200 rounds through it) and the ejector is the most recent version (the original ejector for the Gen 4's had issues with brass ejecting and hitting you in the face. This issue was fixed with the 30274 ejector, which is what is installed in this gun).
The gun comes with:
- Original case
- 3 magazines (two 15 rounds magazines and one 17 round magazine
- Glock 19 (duh)

PLEASE NOTE: As you can see the photos below, the gun has trudot night sights. The tritium in these is dead, so they are basically now just basic three dot sights. They work well and I preferred the three dot sights to the standard plastic glock sights, so I traded with a friend when he was going to be throwing his old sights away (the trudots are steel sights, while the original glock sights were plastic). The condition of the gun can be seen in the pictures. The inside of the gun is in very good condition (since I've only put 500 rounds through it, this should be obvious. I am a bit OCD about cleaning the gun, so it was cleaned at least once per month, regardless of whether it was shot or not). Note that I put 500 rounds through the gun, but I had bought it in near-perfect condition used from a gunstore. The gun had no notable wear on it (aside from a couple minor scratches on the back of the plastic cover at the rear of the slide), so I'm assuming the previous owner didn't like the gun and sold it before putting any significant amount of rounds through the gun. (My theory: he didn't know that glock had recalled the extractor, so he was getting hit in the face with brass and promptly sold the gun out of irritation... I replaced the extractor as soon as I got it and the gun no longer has that issue)....

I WILL REQUIRE TEXAS ID. CHL PREFERRED, BUT NOT NECESSARY. I WILL NEED YOU TO SIGN A BILL OF SALE. THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.

 This same ad has been posted for four separate areas of Buncombe and Haywood Counties. He pulled the ad for about 10 days but he's back at it again.
Talks about trades then vanishes when you ask for pics or to meet. Uses a bunch of various emails but it's the same guy. Also disappears when asked to provide either purchase permit or concealed carry permit.
 Maybe cops trying to entrap? Criminal trying to unload a stolen gun? Just some flake getting his jollies? He's been at it for a couple of months now.

The guy said nothing when I dropped the gun off but I returned I found he had marred the rear sight. It is not that bad… but it did suck that I just paid over $80 after shipping for a new set of sights and this guy scratched the side. I was quite upset and wanted him to pay for the sights and he refused saying the marks on the rear sight were not that bad. Long story short… I did not pay for that work. I have since replaced them with night sights and I am now selling them. I have attached pics so you can see the marks. I’m sure they can be buffed, polished or painted over and no one will be the wiser but I wanted to make sure you could clearly see what it looks like.

I have a new in box Glock 23 rtf2. This pistol has not been fired other than the factory test fire. I purchased this gun from gunbroker in unfired condition, and to my knowledge it appears to be true. This is probably the nicest rtf2 outside of an unsealed pistol. The glock 23 rtf2's command a premium due to the limited production, and this one is in new condition.

This pistol has not been handled much over the years. I disassembled it to show the lack of wear and factory copper grease. The only thing to note cosmetically is the slide stop paint is starting to flake off a bit which was common when this pistol was produced.

The pistol is in the original case, with test fire cartridge which is still sealed, manual which is still sealed, cleaning rod and brush, lock, 3 mags, mag loader and factory night sights.

This isn't your typical glock, and the price reflects it. Search gunbroker and armslist will show a very short/non-existent availability of these guns, and it's hard to find any that are still new. The last of the rtf2's were made nearly 5 years ago.

I am not in a hurry to sell it, I am not interested in trades. I do have detailed pictures that can be sent if necessary.

The belt is 60"" long. I left it blank without holes, so you can tell me your size and I can punch holes for you, or I can leave it blank and you can make your own hole. If you're skinny enough, you can leave the excess belt length on and tuck it under like Bohannon does on the show.

Holster only; the gun is not included! Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I do leatherwork as a hobby, so each piece is one-of-a-kind."
