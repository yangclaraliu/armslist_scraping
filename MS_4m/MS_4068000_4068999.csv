The M2000  comes standard with a full set of chokes, so shooters can use it for any type of shooting. Instead of a gas system, it has an inertia driven recoil system where a strong spring inside the bolt absorbs and delays the recoil. While the shotgun recoils the bolt basically stays still momentarily (microseconds) before pushing back and chambering another shell. Since the bolt isn’t gas driven there isn’t a lot of carbon build up–meaning less cleaning. The bolt itself has a simple three-piece design: spring, bolt body and rotating head. The safety button is beside the trigger. The butt stock has a hollow tube behind the bolt, so an optional mercury-filled recoil reducer can be installed. And, the M2000 is available in four stocks. Stoeger recommends the M2000 for leisure shooting, home defense and, depending on the choke, hunting most game. Gun shoots 2/3/4 and 3 inch shells   28 inch barrel"

Only reason I'm getting rid of it is, I now live in the city and don't get out to hunt as much, and would like something different, I can add 60 rounds of 147gr FMJ ammo to the trade if I receive ammo, or for an extra $50 I'll include the ammo with the ammo box it's stored in.

This is Ruger's new Striker-fired version of the award-winning LC9® pistol. It has a short, light, crisp trigger pull for faster, more accurate shooting. 

The all new Pro version is designed to meet law enforcement specifications as a back-up gun for high-stress situations when there may not be time to deactivate an external manual safety. The absence of a magazine disconnect safety also is a benefit for tactical reloads that allow the user to engage a target with one round remaining in the chamber and the magazine out of the gun for reloading. 

Like the LC9s, the LC9s Pro features a newly designed striker action that delivers a short, crisp trigger pull to improve accuracy and performance. The LC9s Pro offers 7+1 rounds of 9mm Luger protection in a slim, lightweight pistol. The LC9s Pro uses the same holsters, magazines, and accessories as the rugged and reliable LC9s. It also features a blued, through hardened, alloy steel slide; a high performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame with aggressive texturing; a grip extension magazine floorplate to improve handling; and a rapid acquisition, windage adjustable, 3-dot sight system.

We use only factory stock firearms in recording velocities, so that you get true, actual field velocities with our ammo --- not exaggerated test barrel velocities

All .45-70 Magnum loadings are intended for use in the following firearms:
All Marlin Model 1895 variations made since 1972

New England Arms Handi-Rifle
Ruger #1 and #3
T/C Encore

The 500 gr. load uses a dual diameter, bonded core bullet by Alaska Bullet Works. The bullet diameter in front of the crimp groove is .449 inch, while measuring .457 inch on the shank. This dual diameter allows for reliable chambering in rifles with short or no throats. This is a non-expanding Full Metal Jacket bullet designed for the deepest penetration on the largest game animals. This load is safe for use in any firearm designed for the other BBA .45/70 MAG. LEVER GUN cartridges.

 A CUR 2 is a P.D.B (Produced During assualt weapons Ban) Romanian semi-automatic AK-74 clone. This rifle has a pistol grip and can accept Hi-capacity magazines. A good number have been reported with the AK-74 style muzzle brake instead of a muzzle nut. It uses the standard AK-74 5.45*39 cartridge. The fit and finish of this rifle is good. The advantages of this rifle are its reliability, cheap mags, cost, and low recoil. This is another great starter AK. NOTE: This rifle is essentaly a MK II, the only diffrense is slightly higher quality and the AK-74 brake.This rifle comes with 6 original Bakelite magazines. These magazines are hard to come by.We also have 400 rounds of 5.45x39 ammo that can be purchased for an additional $100.00"

This buttstock integrates the materials and practices needed to satisfy the government, along with the rugged functionality demanded by tactical forces and enthusiasts. This buttstock has a contoured buttplate, made of a rubber-like material, that allows the stock to rest comfortably in any shooting position. The buttplate provides a positive, non-slip contact surface. The buttstock features a sloping cheek-weld surface that allows for greatest shooting accuracy. The stock attaches by a unique, patent-pending method that ensures smooth rattle-free action and proper fit to the receiver tubes. There are 2 water-resistant storage chambers for batteries or cleaning kit in the buttstock. There is no need to remove the buttstock to access the storage, the chambers can be opened while the stock is mounted. The release lever is shielded and the whole stock is designed to be very snag-resistant. The release lever can be operated with a single hand to adjust or remove the buttstock. The TI-7 commercial size stock also has an ambi socket for quick release sling swivels."

The XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact Model is an amazingly slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.
 
From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.
 
Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.
 
And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.

I tried to change some photos and Armslist wouldn't let me do it, which ultimately ended up with my post having NO photos at all!

I just built this rifle about 7-8 months ago and only have about 300 rounds through it to make sure it functioned correctly and zero it. The trigger is amazing, it shoots AWESOME, recoil is minimal and the muzzle rise is practically non existent... Not to mention it is GORGEOUS. Only reason I'm selling is the wife has had an extended hospital stay and I'm anticipating a very large out of pocket bill from the insurance company. There are very few items on this rifle that are just basic (buffer tube, gas block/tube, ejection port cover and the mag release lever are all I can think of) the rest of it is all top of the line stuff. Probably won't ever see another quite like it! The build list is as follows:

 -Northtech Defense matched upper/lower with titanium forward assist - $450
 -PWS 15"" keymod rail w/ 2 rail attachments for accessories - $270 
 -Cerakoted in Magpul FDE (color fill is done with crayon for easy removal) - $175
 -Voodoo Innovations 16"" melonited barrel - $240 
 .750 Shoulder
 1:7 Twist
 Government Contour 4150 CM Melonited (inside and out)
 Chambered .223/5.56 x 45 mm NATO
 -CMC 3.5 lb single stage curved drop in trigger - $170
 -VG6 Gamma muzzle brake (YouTube this... no muzzle flip at all) - $75
 -Battle Arms Development Ambi safety and Enhanced takedown pins - $100 total
 -Seekins Precision magazine and bolt release buttons - $40
 -Palmetto State Armory Nickel Boron BCG - $120
 -Rainier Arms Raptor charging handle - $85
 -Spikes Tactical ST-T2 buffer - $40
 -Damage Industries Enhanced Buffer Spring - $15
 -Magpul MOE+ grip and MOE stock- $80 total
 -Gas block/tube - $50
 -Buffer tube - $20
 -KNS anti-rotation pins - $35
 -Set of Noveske keymod panels - $20

 All told, I've got $2,000 invested NOT including taxes/shipping etc, etc for all of the parts to build this rifle. Considering that it's practically brand new, I don't want to come too far down. 

Asking $1,650 FIRM as configured in the first 2 pictures. I've got 2 PMags loaded with the precious green tip for the buyer as well.  If you like the fixed carbine stock, I can put that on instead.  Transfer will be required, I'll cover it.

 I also have available to add on if you'd like:
 Primary Arms RBGII with absolute cowitness mount: $100 ($110 new, never fired with)
 Magpul MBUS front/rear sights: $50
 Tactical Link Z-360 FDE sling mount: $50

$1800 with the red dot and MBUS

I've attached photos with those things attached to show you what the rifle looks like with those things installed (last 3 photos).

I do a lot of hunting and shooting, so a shotgun that sits in the closet for home defense isn't going to provide much fun to me.  

It's one of those all black, special purpose rigs, pretty much all factory.  It has such a low round count the gun isn't even broken in yet.  I spent some time getting the action a little bit smoother, put on a nice high-viz front sight, a stock sleeve, and mounted a 220 lumen light to it.  It has a 20 inch heavy barrel and full length magazine tube for an 8 shot capacity (of 2 3/4 inch shells) and it's drilled and tapped for an optic mount if you choose to add one.  
-The new sight is not in the image, I only added it 2 days ago.  

The thing is effectively new and I will let it go as is for $350 with the light and stock sleeve.  $325 for just the shotgun and the new front sight.

This top of the line take-down rifle comes with 3 different barrels, (1-270 Winchester, 2-300 Winchester magnum and 3-416 Remington magnum). With this setup you are covered for anything from long range light skinned game all the way to heavy African hunting. The first 2 barrel each have their own 3-12 x 50 D Swarovski scopes with Ballistic turret attachment. The 416 barrel has iron sights and a muzzle break. There are 2 complete bolts, one for the 270 and one for the magnums. The 416 barrel also has it's own forearm for the heaver barrel contour. The stock has a “kick-stop” recoil reducer.  The Blaser R93 Luxus is a top of the line straight pull bolt action hunting rifle from Germany. The locking system of the R93 bolts in a straight line without rotational movement in the barrel. When repeating, the body movement is minimized. The process is faster than with conventional actions, allowing more time to aim and re-aim for subsequent shots. This is a particular advantage on drive and big game hunts. The safety system is also very advanced in that the firing pin is not cocked when on safe. Immediately prior to firing a shot, the firing pin spring is cocked by pushing the safety slide forward. This movement is virtually silent and will not alert game to your presence. If no shot is fired, simply return the safety slide to its original position for maximum safety."

The SSA-E’s reduced first and second stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light first stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like second stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired. The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community."
