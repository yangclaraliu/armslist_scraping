This includes all the hardware you will need for the rail, the barrel assembly is complete with gas block, gas tube, Daniel Defense Flash Suppressor and the RIS II barrel nut.

Everything is in very nice condition, as this came off a factory Daniel Defense DDMK18 SBR which is pretty much a safe queen. The rail system has only ever had a front sight and QD mounted to it and was protected with ladder covers. I will include the 3 FDE ladder covers with the sale, I just forgot to put them in the pictures. Barrel is as mint as it can be for a take off, according to the records I've kept there have been exactly 400 rounds through it. Please let me know if you have any questions.

This is a recent production gun and it has had 500 rounds through it. Gun comes with factory box, paperwork, test target and two 15-round mags. I also have four more factory 15-round mags and four 20-round magazines. That's a total of 10! These beautiful, blued, reliable OEM mags were made by Mec-Gar for Walther.

The ""AS"" pistols give the shooter 3 trigger modes to choose from. They can be fully decocked into DA/SA mode (striker down). The gun can also be left pre-cocked after chambering, leaving the trigger in AS mode (SA trigger with light take up). The gun can also be placed in fully cocked mode for a short, crisp trigger pull with a light reset (think Glock, M&P, PPQ, etc.). It has adjustable sights and interchangeable backstraps. These guns were way ahead of their time, and in some ways they still are. These guns are triple proof marked and their build quality rivals that of H&K.

The P99s can usually be had for just under $600. There's close to $300 in additional mags here, which you can see for yourself if you shop around.

http://www.deguns.net/strike-one-pistol-p/sostdblk9mmfs17.htm
The Strike One pistol is quite possibly the most revolutionary advancement in firearms technology in the past 100 years, featuring a new locking system that greatly lowers the bore axis of the Strike One's barrel, resulting in easier to control recoil and quick follow up shots.

The locking system of the Strike One is a unique system to this pistol, and lead to several new patents. The inline barrel leads to very tight tolerances with the slide and the lowest center bore axis of all production pistols.

The Strike One features a fully ambidextrous magazine release for both left- and right-handed shooters. This revolutionary deisgn can be taken down by hand with no tools.

Will come with bill of sale from Government Liquidation so it could be titled. 

These are the specs on the manufacturer's website. There is no difference between the M1101 and the M1102, the military did a weird rating system and the difference between the two is actually based on the vehicle towing the trailer, not the trailer itself. The body being aluminum is awesome because it will never rust. The capacities listed are actually the off-road capacities! It has really good surge brakes and I towed it with an '04 F-150 4x4 no problem. I also bought a wiring harness that takes the military 9 pin connector down to a standard commercial connector that's included. The trailer is a freaking beast. You can also buy the soft-top for it with the bows from the manufacturer. I REALLY hate to sell it, because it would last forever but my parents are moving and I was storing it in my dad's detached garage so I'm losing my storage for it.

It has the gold trigger and is absolutely one gorgeous piece in every way with zero flaws.  Less than 100 rounds down the pipe.  Just in time for hunting season and ready to fire out of the box, set up with a brand new Bushnell Trophy XLT - 3x9 scope sited in at 200 yards and accurate as hell.  This is a fine rifle and the pictures should tell the story, it is honestly one of the nicest I have ever seen in this configuration.  It has never seen the woods, range only and few times even there.  I also have 500+ rounds I will add for the right trade or price, also pictured.

I am listing the gun for an aging relative and according to his story it was given to him by a German police officer friend in the late 70s - early 80s while serving in Germany in the Army. He lived there for many years during his service in the military and I have no doubt there is truth to that fact. After years of continual failing health issues he is being forced to part with it. I don't know how or when it was brought to the states or how it was procured once arriving here. It does have roll stamps showing importation to Trussville, AL and I have been told that would put importation somewhere in the early 80s. This example has been untouched by anyone since acquisition other than 2 magazines being fired down the pipe. Once by my relative when he was given the gun and the other, 2 weeks ago for me to test functionality and get a chance to fire it before selling it. I can also tell you that it is absolutely original and is in 100% perfect working order. It has never been tinkered with, re-polished, re-touched or otherwise molested in all the years we have had it in my family. Without question, this is a rare piece and is in very good condition overall. I hate to see it being parted with. I have just been asked to facilitate the most money I can in doing so to help him out with other more pressing bills. Priorities sometimes hinder us our intentions and the money for this firearm is needed elsewhere. 

 I do not have the original box as it was cardboard and long ago deteriorated. I currently store it in a modern HK case which is also included. it contains all the original paperwork, cleaning tools and one extra magazine as it did new. It functions flawlessly and honestly shows no visual defects whatsoever that I can discern. I would be willing to send it to a gunsmith / FFL for a rating at your expense but it is perfect for an original condition firearm of this age and feel confident it would score very highly by an standard. 

 I am no professional and honestly never thought I would be offering this for sale. I will gladly send additional pictures at request if that would help in any way. I am certainly not trying to be unfair but I feel that the price offered is very similar to other P7s I have seen advertised. I can tell you I have personally never seen an unmolested factory polished nickel version sold, or traded at any price, ever, in all the years watching auctions and forums since my family has owned it. Again, if my opinions, thoughts or stated facts are in any way not as advertised please make me aware, I am an amateur and open to mistakes. I am just trying to be as honest and open with the condition and history as I know it or as it has been conveyed to me by a failing older gentleman that tried his best to give me his story. Price is honestly a guess based on what I have seen on Gunbroker and other sites as I can only judge on what I see. I haven't seen one of these ever sold in nickel, Hence my valuation. Talk to me, I am a fair guy and open to opinions, facts or advice by those more in the know than myself. I have already been given some facts that I did not know and were misrepresented to me so I adjusted my price downward to reflect those facts. I figured I would try locally before going to Gunbroker, which I will if this doesn't peak anyone's interest in this area. Thanks again for the info everyone is providing and for looking at this fine pistol. Have a great day.

PRICE: $2,500

It shoots like a dream, has a massive, thick .308 AR bolt which very nicely accommodates the 7.62x39mm round, has virtually no muzzle rise, and the recoil feels like a standard 5.56 AR. On the AKM2 (there are 3 variants, the AKM2 being the most ""suped up""), it has a 2-stage competition trigger, a very nice muzzle brake, and magpul furniture. 

Now you might be wondering, why am I selling it? After all, I've only owned it for about two months now. I am an AK enthusiast, through and through, and I just don't enjoy the AR platform. I thought, upon purchasing this, that it would run similar to an AK, but it doesn't. It runs just like an AR, direct-gas impingement, has the accuracy of the AR and the breakdown is identical. Shooting it is AWESOME! Smooth as fricken butter. I just would prefer an AK in its place. I tried with the AR platform, it's just not for me.

I've fired about 80 rounds through it. It's brand-spankin'-new.

Bushmaster® .450 Upper Complete Kit

Engineered to mount on your mil-spec AR-15 lower
Hurls 250-grain bullet downrange at 2,200 fps
Chrome lining in both the bore and chamber extends barrel life
Includes five-round magazine
It’s called ""Thumper"" and it’s capable of taking any game animal in North America. Engineered to mount on your mil-spec AR-15 lower, this 20"" model hurls the 250-grain Hornady SST/FT .450 Bushmaster bullet downrange at 2,200 fps. Though not designed as a long-range caliber, there’s nothing on this continent capable of standing up to the firepower of Thumper and inside 200 yards its accuracy is outstanding. Recoil has been compared to that of a 20-gauge shotgun. A tubular-aluminum forend allows the barrel to free-float from the nut forward to enhance accuracy. Chrome lining in both the bore and chamber makes the .450 Bushmaster easy to clean and extends barrel life. A five-round magazine is included."

There is a lot of 9mm Mak self defense ammo being loaded these days.  It has a slide safety that also acts as a decocker.  There is no magazine release so you can't close the slide when there is an empty magazine inserted.  It is double action/single action.  The double action trigger is very heavy.  I would say in the 10-15 lbs region.  Single action is very smooth and relatively light.  Probably around 5 lbs.

I have more brass than I know what to do with it right now. So much that it is going to injure me moving my big box around.
9mm -  2K+
357 Sig - less than 1K (Almost all nickel plated)
40 -  2K+ (brass and nickel plated)
45 - unknown amount at the current time (possibly some nickel plated and also the small pistol primer cases too)
I also have a few odds and ends of other calibers.
I might have a handful of 6.8 spc, 30-30, 270, etc. I cannot guarantee any quantity on these until I go search the miscellaneous bag. If you want them and you buy a bunch of other brass I usually just throw them in for free to get rid of them and help you out.
If there is another caliber you need just ask and I can see what I have.

I also have a ton of 12ga shotgun hulls. I have AA, Remington, Federal, and a bunch of others. 

I have many of these already bagged and counted in 100 and 200 count bags to make it easy. If you want a certain amount I can have it counted and I will usually throw in a few more per 100 pieces just to account for the possibility of any cases slipping through the sorting process that I wouldn't use.

As a warning, I don't clean or process any of this brass. It takes way too much time and I personally don't like buying brass that has been cleaned and processed. I find this way you can see exactly what you are getting rather than hiding quality issues by cleaning it up. I've had a few people try to sell me 30-06 in the past and tell me that it is once fired, but on inspection it is obviously not that. I don't do this to be lazy, but rather make sure you know what you are buying and the both of us are happy with the transaction. If you want me to clean it I can, but I will also have to increase the price a small amount to account for materials used and time spent."

Comes in factory box and has Tru Glo TFO tritium/fiber optic night sights, the two 9rd mags than came with it, plus one factory Glock extended 11rd magazine I bought separately that gives a place to rest your pinky finger. Also comes with DeSantis leather crossdraw holster. I have 750 in it but will take 500 for it. The bare gun costs that, so you get all the extras free plus a gun I spent $250 in ammo breaking in for you. Has exactly 240 rounds of factory loaded hollow point ammo fired through it. I got it for a concealed carry gun, but I'm a .45 guy at heart and picked up a Springfield XD Mod.2 .45 to take its place."

It also has a 5-shell side saddle on the right of the stock and can be switched over to the left side if needed. This firearm also has a heat shield with ghost ring sights on it. It also features sling mounts. It does come with original stock. Firearm is clean, however there is a blemish on the left side of the firearm due to having a side-saddle on it and removing it for personal use. It has only about less than 50 shots through it. Love this gun but need money for another project. $250 is all I'm asking, NOTHING LOWER.
