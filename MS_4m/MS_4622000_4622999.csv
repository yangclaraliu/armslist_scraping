I don't have either gun to verify which one this goes to, but the M1951 used a heel-style magazine release lever, while the 92 Type M used a push-button magazine release, like the Beretta 92 FS.

C.C.U. Upper for Glock is available for the following Glock models: 
'SF' models - (All Gens)

G17; G17C; G34; G19; G19C; G20; G20C; G40; G21; G21C; G41; G22; G35; G22C; G23; G23C; G31; G32; G32C and the respective 'SF' models - (All Gens)

NOTE: Factory Loaded Ammunition Only. Mech Tech recommends only using good quality factory loaded ammunition in the CCU which meets SAAMI, CIP or NATO standards. The CCU is a blowback operated action and is capable of safely firing ammunition up to +P. DO NOT USE +P+ or 'hotter' loads.




NOTES FOR CCU's WHICH FIT GLOCKS

The CCU's fit Glock frames that are Compact (G19, G23, G32), Standard (G17, G22, G31, G34, G35) and Large (G20, G40, G21, G41). Mech Tech Uppers are not available for sub-compact Glocks. An interesting fact relates to Glock magazines. A frame separated from the slide and barrel will physically accept a magazine of a cartridge different from that for which the assembled pistol is designed (using magazines designed for the same series of frame sizes). What this means is that a Glock pistol & CCU combination can be set up to safely fire a cartridge different from that for which the assembled pistol is designed. Example: The frame (lower unit) of a Glock designed to fire the 45 ACP cartridge in the assembled pistol can be safely used with a CCU Upper designed to fire the 10mm cartridge. This is accomplished by assembly of the 45 ACP Glock frame to the 10mm CCU and the use of a Glock 10mm magazine designed to be used with that series of frame size. This information is provided only to illustrate the flexibility of the Mech Tech CCU. (Caution: the foregoing does not imply that a Glock pistol designed for a given cartridge can safely shoot a different cartridge by simply switching the magazine - this is dangerous - do not try it! Likewise a CCU Upper can safely fire only the cartridge for which it is designed!) If further clarification is needed please contact Mech Tech Systems Inc. 

NOTE: 357 Sig - this is a bottle necked cartridge. The CCU is a blowback action and therefore will work the brass during firing causing the shoulder to be set considerably forward. Re-loading the brass works the brass even more and may result in case separation when firing. Mech Tech has a 'factory ammo only' policy for all cartridges. 

Note: the CCU is not associated with Glock or endorsed by Glock - it is designed and manufactured in the USA."

The GEMTECH Suppressed Bolt Carrier is a drop-in replacement and will allow the shooter to choose between suppressed (S) and unsuppressed (U) settings without any permanent modifications to the firearm. No longer will you need to change gas blocks, buffers, or any other components. Not only that, but with the GEMTECH Suppressed Bolt Carrier, there is a reduction in carrier speed and less felt recoil, bringing the cyclic rate of the suppressed rifle down to unsuppressed levels. And in some systems, testing has shown that it can actually bring it LOWER than unsuppressed levels.

Reduce Bolt/Carrier speed while suppressed (S - setting)
Unsuppressed velocity is unchanged (U - setting) from that of a normal bolt carrier

Hi all, I have for sale or trade a great shooting SKS with ATI Strike Force folding 6 position stock in destroyer grey, with 200+ lumen Cree flashlight, battery and charger, laser sight and red dot, both sighted in and ready to go, with single point sling. This has all matching numbers, machined not stamped parts and I am going to post a pic of the 70 yard group that it held, 1.25"" after the first shot flyer, with a red dot, if it was cross hairs would have been much tighter because the dot covered the bull completely so really couldn't get it on the bull as accurately as it would otherwise. It also has a marine corps type bipod fore grip. Comes with 1-30 round steel mag, 1- 40 round polymer and 30 stripper clips. All the accessories, stock, laser, flashlight, scope mount, bipod fore grip and redot are over $200 alone so add a good early fully machined Sino Soviet SKS built to the original Russian spec's and easily $600 value so get it at a steal.  I have almost $600 in this rifle included with the mags and strippers is a striper clip pouch that will go with it too.  A original cheap made later model chinese SKS with stamped receiver parts and pinned on barrels like the Norinco's that are listed on here for $400 are going for $400 and up now so this is a damn good deal for an early made to Russian spec Sino Soviet SKS.  If you just want the SKS and bare stock (no red dot, laser, fore grip, single point sling or flashlight)I will let it go for just $350 and keep my accessories for another project, this is a $100+ stock alone so easily $500 in value with just the top notch tactical stock and quality SKS."

Holds 6 long arms and 4 to 6 handguns.  Two bottom drawers, which also lock, for ammunition, cleaning kits, attachments, etc.  The rifle and the handgun cabinets are felt lined and lighted with low voltage lighting (all wiring is recessed/hidden).  The bottom cabinet has hidden casters on it (only lifts it about 1/4"" off the ground) which makes it really easy to move and position without worrying about damaging it.  The top and bottom cabinets separate by simply removing a few hidden bolts - no need to remove molding or anything else; yet when assembled it looks, acts, and functions as one seamless cabinet.  The handgun cabinet felt ""floor"" and door are tilted back so the hand guns are in a displayed position.

Measurements are approximate:  83 1/4"" total height; top cabinet is 12 1/2"" D x 27"" W x 55"" H; bottom cabinet is 19"" D x 27 1/2"" W x 29"" H.

I'm only parting with this because (1) family emergency has put a huge dent in the wallet, and (2) I've gotten rid of most all of my guns and the two rifles I have left I'll be selling as well (again, family emergency)... so there's really no need to display an empty gun cabinet - no matter how nice it is - in our den.

Since this is a hand built custom cabinet, it's not easy to try and find a comparable value to price it.  However I found several ""fake wood"" china-factory built gun cabinets online for $700 to $1500, so I think my price of $1000 for THIS cabinet is not only reasonable, but pretty low.

ALL FIREARMS I am selling at dealer cost + shipping and IL sales tax.  Shipping is generally $15-$20 depending on which distributor I am able to get the product from.  I am not limited to just firearms, I can get accessories too but I am only offering cost on firearms.  I will do the best I can to give you the best price on the extras.  My goal is to be ""YOUR GUN GUY"".  I take care of you, you take care of me!  Someone asks you, ""hey, im looking for a nice new piece for my collection, you know anyone?"" you just say, ""Yes,  I GOT A GUY!, here's his card""  Want a gun that's out of production?  I'll find you one!    You're happy!  I'm happy!  We go shooting sometime and enjoy a cold drink!

Here's how this works.  You figure out what you want, you email me the specifics and I give you a price.  A MFG product number helps ALOT as there are many variations with many guns.    I know you already have an idea in your head of what this gun costs so you will know Im shooting you an honest number, the next thing you reply with, is ""cool, lets get this deal done"".  I don't want to hear any ""BUDS GUNS HAS IT CHEAPER"" Fine, order it up then you cheap bastard!  Pay the credit card fees and a transfer fee and perhaps shipping.  In most cases, that puts you back up to buying it locally.  Time is money!  For both of us!  Here you are puckering your asshole trying to keep that extra $5 in there on the purchase of a new Glock!  Do you realize you have just wasted an hour of your time to save $5?  Its ok! I've stayed up many a night till 3am wasting my time replying back to broke asses that got the best price and STILL didn't buy. I'll never get those hours of my life back! 

If you dont have money to buy anything, dont even bother contacting me.
Its people like you that make people at gun stores a bunch of angry assholes.  You come in there, make us run around till you have finger banged everything in the case and then you leave without buying because you walked in damn well knowing you couldn't afford it. Go away..... Go rot the rest of your brain playing Candy Crush on your $800 smart phone.

If you're not ready to buy TODAY, don't contact me!  I don't want to hear any ""I'll be looking to buy in the next month""  fine, hit me up next month!  In the mean time, make sure you ok this purchase with your wife....... being that she wears the pants. Im not dealing with any pissed off women.

Don't bother me about Glock 43's. I don't have any, they are back ordered, not sure when I will see any.

""Rhino"" Mount Arm
NSN: 5855-01-457-2953
Material: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy

The Rhino Mount clips into any helmet shroud that has a universal interface such as the standard MICH and PASGT shrouds, the OpsCore VAS Shroud, Wilcox L4 One Hole Shroud, and the Norotos Universal Shroud. The Rhino will accept any night vision device or adapter with a standard bayonet interface. It has an auto shut-off feature that will turn off the night vision device when it is flipped up over the helmet so the lit-up green glow from the eye piece lens does not show down-range. The arm articulates with a “force to overcome” motion meaning the user simply pushes the device upward or down into position.

PVS-14 J-Arm, Swing Arm

Standard issue USGI “J-Arm’s” are used to adapt the PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular to the standard issue USGI Rhino Mount. It screws into the threaded hole in the PVS-14 body housing and lines up two contacts which complete an electrical circuit. This gives the J-Arm the ability to shut down power to the night vision device when the user flips the Rhino Mount up; saving battery power, and limiting visibility of the green glow emitted from the ocular lens of the PVS-14.

Rotary Barrel Design
Shortened Barrel & Compact Frame
Ambidextrous Slide Stop
High Capacity Magazine
Built around a modular concept so that a single pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operation, the Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is designed to make the most of the simple concept of individualized performance. The Compact model is sized between the full and sub-compact models. It adopts the rotary barrel design of Beretta's larger pistol, but with a shorter and proportioned slide and grip. This model also introduces an ambidextrous slide stop lever. A high magazine capacity is maintained, with 15 rounds in 9mm. The Compact models accept the full size magazines as well, increasing capacity to 17 or 20 rounds in 9mm. While the ultimate goal is comfort and ease-of-use, the Storm Compact will never feel oversized with a barrel length of just 3.2 inches."

My dad never shot it.  It doesn't look to have been carried, as the blueing is in very good condition for the year.  My dad thought it had never been shot besides at the factory, but I have no proof of that.  The blue wear is very minor and probably came from sitting in the box.

Hey all, 
	I have up for trade/sale a used but classic 223 rifle. This is in great shape for its age and is a blast to shoot. This is a Ruger Mini-14 series 181. The action is smooth and it shoots great. I bought this to keep, but my loads didn’t perform as well as hoped in the gun (they were worked up in a longer barrel with different twist) so i would rather pass it on to someone else who needs a great little rifle. This will also come with two 30rd mags and two 20rd mags, and a sling. I would also consider trades on this. Mainly looking for a decent M1 carbine, XDM 9mm, CZ SP-01, SP101, GP100, Security Six, Redhawk, other full size CZs in 9mm, possibly a Glock 17 and extras, AK47s, etc. Some trades will need extras on my end, some will need it on yours. 
	Honestly, just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this due to my schedule.

	Hey all, 
I have for trade/sale a used but great condition EAA/Tanfoglio Polymer Carry 9mm full size pistol. This is a great shooting pistol and would be an outstanding gun for almost any size shooter. This will come with the gun, two cleaning brushes, case, and magazine. I would also consider trades for an M1 carbine, AKs, Ar uppers, towards a SP-01 9mm, a Ruger Security Six, Ruger SP101, GP100, Glock 17, XDM 9mm, etc. Honestly, I’m pretty open so just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will need it on yours.
	Need to meet in Norman on this if at all possible due to my schedule. For any questions, please give me a text message at REDACTED or message me on here.

Like-new Ruger LCR 22 magnum. Double action only, no exposed hammer. 6 round cylinder. Comes with a ""Speed Beez"" speedloader, pocket holster and 4 cylinder's worth of 22 mag ammo, 24 rds total.

I bought this brand new 2 weeks ago and shot only 100 rds through it. There were zero failures to fire. DA trigger is smooth and relatively easy to squeeze for a rimfire revolver. With the holster the gun fits comfortably in a normal front pocket. I don't want to sell but circumstances dictate otherwise.

Just for the gun I paid $445 including tax and background check (I still have the receipt from the store). I'm only selling for $350 even with the speedloader, ammo and pocket holster. Must see proof of valid FL residency or military PCS orders. Be ready to fill out a bill of sale. Thank you."

This kit is designed to convert your existing gas impingement ar15 (or new build) into a piston operated system. Some obvious benefits include: Cleaner bolt carrier group, which translates to less frequent and faster cleaning, cooler operation which translates to increased longevity on parts. This conversion kit is also regarded as one of the best on the market. The kit includes:

-Gas block w/ rail
-piston
-spring and bushing
-handgaurds
-modified handgaurd retainer
-bolt carrier

This product is new in box and still has the factory seal so it hasn't even been opened. Normal price for this kit is about $280 plus shipping/tax. 

I'm asking $200 for the kit. Or I can do a cash/ammo combination as a trade for the kit. So I could do $100 cash plus a $100 worth of 5.56 ammunition, or roughly 280 rounds. Or you could do more cash and less ammo.

additional info: There is a bushing that needs to be placed into where the gas tube comes through the upper receiver, but they provide a tool for that, as well as an instructional dvd for installation. Product has lifetime warranty and I can show receipts. No shipping."

ALL FIREARMS I am selling at dealer cost + shipping and IL sales tax. Shipping is generally $15-$20 depending on which distributor I am able to get the product from. I am not limited to just firearms, I can get accessories too but I am only offering cost on firearms. I will do the best I can to give you the best price on the extras. My goal is to be ""YOUR GUN GUY"". I take care of you, you take care of me! Someone asks you, ""hey, im looking for a nice new piece for my collection, you know anyone?"" you just say, ""Yes, I GOT A GUY!, here's his card"" Want a gun that's out of production? I'll find you one! You're happy! I'm happy! We go shooting sometime and enjoy a cold drink!

Here's how this works. You figure out what you want, you email me the specifics and I give you a price. A MFG product number helps ALOT as there are many variations with many guns. I know you already have an idea in your head of what this gun costs so you will know Im shooting you an honest number, the next thing you reply with, is ""cool, lets get this deal done"". I don't want to hear any ""BUDS GUNS HAS IT CHEAPER"" Fine, order it up then you cheap bastard! Pay the credit card fees and a transfer fee and perhaps shipping. In most cases, that puts you back up to buying it locally. Time is money! For both of us! Here you are puckering your asshole trying to keep that extra $5 in there on the purchase of a new Glock! Do you realize you have just wasted an hour of your time to save $5? Its ok! I've stayed up many a night till 3am wasting my time replying back to broke asses that got the best price and STILL didn't buy. I'll never get those hours of my life back! 

If you dont have money to buy anything, dont even bother contacting me.
Its people like you that make people at gun stores a bunch of angry assholes. You come in there, make us run around till you have finger banged everything in the case and then you leave without buying because you walked in damn well knowing you couldn't afford it. Go away..... Go rot the rest of your brain playing Candy Crush on your $800 smart phone.

If you're not ready to buy TODAY, don't contact me! I don't want to hear any ""I'll be looking to buy in the next month"" fine, hit me up next month! In the mean time, make sure you ok this purchase with your wife....... being that she wears the pants. Im not dealing with any pissed off women.

Don't bother me about Glock 43's. I don't have any, they are back ordered, not sure when I will see any.

This revolver is in great shape and includes the original box, cleaning kit, paperwork, and sight adjustment tool. This is an interesting gun since standard 25-2's came with the target hammer and target trigger, however this one wears a standard hammer and standard trigger. Most folks would assume those parts had been swapped somewhere along the way yet, because this gun has it's original box, you can clearly see that it was special ordered with the standard components. Someone must've preferred the standard parts and had this one custom ordered from S&W; a decision I very much agree with!

This is as original as it gets. Completely matching and unmolested 1939 date 27 code K98 Mauser with low serial number 194i. This is original down to the L&F 1939 dated sling, and even have the original cleaning kit issued with the gun in its original leather pouch. Also comes with a factory 1939 8mm ammo box.
Code 27 was formerly S27, which stood for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik (Erma). The receiver, barrel, rear sight group, bolt group including firing pin, bolt release, floor plate assembly, follower, trigger group screws, bands, bayonet lug, and stock are all matching. The stock has not been sanded and has an original K98K sling marked 1939 with maker.
The bore is excellent with no import mark on the barrel and the stock has not been cut. Still has most of the finish except for the butt plate. Erma stopped production of the K98K in 1941, and the serial number of this rifle is #194, making it a fairly early, hard to find variant.

The gun is all matching down to the screws, and cleaning rod. Nothing has been altered or changed since it left the field. Has the original blueing and is in excellent shape.
Gun has all birds intact and no import or Russian marks.

This is not a Russian capture, Yugo, or any of the other imported, mismatched, crap out there. Please don't waste your time or mine with offers not consistent with current, matching K98K prices.
