My problem is that I can't find a big box or FFL that has a Bobtail that I can hold and see if it fits my hand like I'm hoping it will.

It seems like a simple request but I am looking for a Bobtail owner that is willing to let somebody hold their Bobtail for 30 seconds to see if it fits.  A couple draws.  A couple cycles (without ammo) just to check the grip and sights.

If you live in your mother's basement, play video games and maybe wear a pretty helmet, let this post pass.  If you understand where I'm coming from, I will do what is reasonable for you to feel safe and comfortable.  (No games, I don't play the banjo and don't look good in a thongs).  I just want to hold a Bobtail before I cut my frame apart.  I work ALL the time but will work around you're schedule or I won't  ask you to meet."

It fired fine and I have not experienced any failures to fire, jams, or ejection problems. However, on the first round of a new magazine the slide seems to not want to go fully forward when the slide stop is disengaged and needs a slight tap before it will fire. Otherwise, it fires and cycles completely fine. I took the gun home, cleaned and lubed it thoroughly, and put it back in the box so it may work perfectly for all I know but I've lost my patience with it and have decided to either sell it outright or trade for another gun, preferably a .22 pistol or a shotgun. This could make someone a nice little truck or car gun. One magazine, manual, and case included. First reasonable offer gets it. All trade proposals will be considered. If interested, call or text me at REDACTED. Prospective buyers/traders must have photo ID and purchase permit or CCW license. Thanks for looking."

This gun features absolutely beautiful wood, the grain is simply stunning! Shotgun was assembled for these photos so any glare on the wood or receiver is from the factory packing oils. 

The A400 Xcel is a 12-gauge competition shotgun that is faster-cycling, softer-shooting and better balanced than anything else on the market. Built on the revolutionary A400 action, it delivers follow-up shots 36% faster than any other brand, while its advanced recoil-reducing systems make it absolutely pleasant to shoot. Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious shooters the world over. The A400 action is the culmination of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and passion for shotguns. It feeds reliably all types of shells from 2 ¾” to 3,” with loads ranging from target-light to hard hitting--making it also suited for the occasional upland or waterfowl hunt. Also, it features the unique Blink technology, a gas-operating system that is capable of delivering two shots in less than half a second, while also integrating an easy-maintenance self-cleaning piston. Furthermore, the action has sleek lines and a low profile, meaning that the vertical distance between the dominant eye and the supporting hand is reduced to a minimum. The result? A gun that follows your swing like an extension of your body and eyesight. There are no two ways about it: felt recoil is only a liability and the less of it, the better. This A400 XPlor incorporates Beretta's revolutionary Kick-Off recoil-reducing system operating to make recoil virtually negligible (70% overall reduction). It has a hydraulic shock absorber that softens the rearward energy from the action’s moving parts, which minimizes felt recoil while reducing wear within the receiver while neutralizing the recoil generated by the power of the cartridge. Also, the A400 is designed to recoil parallel to the comb, meaning no thump to the cheek and minimal muzzle rise. The A400 XPlor's cold-hammer forged barrel is made of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel (Beretta’s “Steelium”), a proprietary formula engineered for consistency, toughness and durability. The bore is chrome-plated to facilitate cleaning and minimize wear and corrosion. And the new Optimabore HP choke tubes are particularly easy to remove--even after several thousands of rounds. Lastly, the new, improved gas piston makes assembly and disassembly a matter of seconds.

Blueing is perfect, lockup and action tight. Has key lock system.

It is hard to explain how it feels when you shoot it. The best way I can is that if you took away the sound, which is sweet, it feels like you just dry-fired a revolver. One hand and the weight and balance of the gun keeps you right on target.  I'll throw in a box of shells and welcome anyone to fire this and feel what I'm probably doing a poor job of putting into words.

We're selling what's left of our dad's estate and that includes a few guns, all NIB. 

This listing is for a new SIG P224 in 9mm, DAK, with nickel slide & controls. These are impossible to find these days, new or used (scan the Web), and make a great concealed carry gun. He had 9 mags for it, (5) 12-round & (4) 15-round, all unused. 

At only 4.5"" in height, and a 12-round mag flush, this is a great gun from SIG for concealed carry (especially IWB.) The DAK action is also perfect for carry and it will accept P229/228/226 mags, both old and new style. 

The price is $749 firm. No trades and no offers. Cash only. Indiana DL required. If you're familiar with SIG's, this is probably the best deal anywhere on Armslist today. I have several more pics that I can email (Armslist only allows one.)"

Hunting season is getting Closer!

I have a Brand New Leupold VX-3 4.5x14x40 Rifle Scope that I purchased in April 2015(paid $550.00). I opened box and put on rifle and took off rifle ( Never Left House) and received a gift of a VX-3L 4.5x14x56 just this week, so I need to sell 40mm scope. It comes with box, soft Leupold Scope cover, sticker and manual, everything that came in the factory box.  Lifetime Gold Ring Leupold Warranty.  NO Low Ballers!  I will ship at actual cost once funds clear."

I have a perfect Arcus 98DAC - blued - new condition compact 9mm DA/SA pistol for sale. The DA/C is a Browning Hi-Power clone and even uses the HP magazines which are very cheap and available ($13-15). It is very accurate with a roughly 3.5-4lb pull trigger with short travel and low recoil and eats everything including cheap Walmart ammo without malfunctions. The magazines are 13 rounds and it is in the original box. I purchased it new less than a year ago and it has about 50 rounds through it. Very clean. I'm selling to buy a different firearm (full size with left handed safety). JUST REDUCED PRICE FROM $295 - I paid $320 plus shipping and dealer fees a few months ago.
