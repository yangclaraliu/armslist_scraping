For a barrel re-thread job he quoted me $30.  He'll send it back with the barrel I bought too (at no charge).  

So it worked out... BUT:  I looked online for DAYS and talked with about 5 smiths in NE Kansas over several weeks.  I left messages on machines and it seems that there are few willing to do this work-- and that's just sad.  There were some GREAT guys too who weren't set-up for easily doing the job and I appreciate there honesty.  But I'm appalled that my own very local smith wanted $250 for a simple re-thread job- that ended up costing $30 TOTAL shop charge.

Saddest of all is that I'd probably have more work over the next few years for my local smith if he were wiling to work for a measly $80 an hour-- and listen to what I needed (Vs. having a whacked wife hang-up on a sincere customer).  But I'll just say that I didn't talk to every smith in NE Kansas and I'm sure with time ONE of them might have called me back.  But it's a damn shame I had to send this work out of state because it was so hard to fine a competent, local smith-- even though I tried for weeks.

Not sure who modified the upper but it is an A1 with the carry handle cut and a rail pinned and screw mounted to the top.  Truly an original flat top upper.  The front sight\gas block is also modified flat.  It has retained the 3 prong brake on the muzzle.  Barrel is also free floated.  This is not last weeks build.  Found it in the back corner of a small gun shop.  It has been this way for over 30 years.  It even has a 80's model Tasco scope on it.  Pictured with a Colt 5rd mag.  Will add a 30rd mag with purchase.  Rifle shoots like butter.

For sale is a complete Remington 870 12ga package, with multiple setup options. Defensive, hunting, competition, recreational; this upgraded package will cover the full range of shotgun needs in one platform.

Shotgun is a Remington 870 Express in 12ga, chambered for 2 3/4"" and 3"" loads. Shotgun has a very low round of under 200 shells, conservatively, and the internals are evidence of that. Shotgun functions smoothly as it should. The bolt, receiver internals, action bars, and magazine tube were lubed with AeroShell 33MS. Condition of parts overall are very nice, with some handling marks present from use. I would rate it an 8.5+/10. No rust or fouling anywhere (it lived in the high desert).

-Safety has been upgraded to a Vang Comp ""Big Dome"" safety (original included).
-Follower has been upgraded to a Vang Comp Stainless Steel follower (original included).

Configuration ""A"" (current configuration) is setup for defensive/tactical use and features the following components:
-Remington 870 Police 18.5"" 12ga barrel (has ball detent), improved cylinder, with XS ""Big Dot"" Tritium night sight. Sight glows bright, purchased February of 2012.

-Mesa Tactical ShureShot 6-shell side saddle (white high-retention rubber currently installed, black low-retention rubber included)
-Mesa Tactical Urbino Stock

Configuration ""B"" is setup for hunting and sporting use and features the following components (than otherwise described above):
-Remington 870 28"" vent rib barrel, bead sight, threaded for removable choke (includes factory Remington ""Modified"" choke)
-Factory 4-shell magazine tube spring and end cap
-Remington 870 Express laminate wood stock/fore-end

Further configurations could be made per the operator's preference and requirements. Again, all stock parts are included as noted above.
This is a turn-key 870 setup that has all necessary gunsmith work, and parts allocation completed, and covers all bases of use.
If you need more detailed photos of any area of the shotgun, please ask and I'd be happy to email/text them.

With over $300 worth of upgrades and parts, the most prominent feature this firearm has is the custom stippling job. Though the texture is not uncomfortable for everyday carry, it allows the shooter a confident grip on the firearm regardless of how slick or sweaty his or her palms are. Having this kind of work done would cost the customer an average of $150. This firearm also features a trigger job that has reduced the trigger pull to a crisp and smooth 4.5 lbs compared to the stock 5.5 lbs from the factory. Also included is a fiber optic front sight and a blacked out ""U Notch"" rear sight from 10-8 Performance that has been efficiently zeroed. Lastly, in addition to the two stock 12 rnd magazines, a full size 17 rnd magazine is also include which is of $45 value.  Overall, this firearm is very nearly brand new and contains all features coveted by professional shooters for a mere fraction of the cost it would take to have them done after purchasing a new firearm."

One tiny mark in the wood, 100% metal.  Obvious that it has never had rings mounted.  The only way you would know the rifle has ever been fired is to look at the bolt face.  A few rds maybe.  No box, no papers.  These are hard to research.  I have found different sources saying that anywhere from 185 to 500 were produced.  The gun is 99%+.   A recent specimen SOLD for $2340 + buyers premium.  I think this rifle is nicer due to fewer handling marks and having never had rings mounted.  I will entertain trades for items of similar value, but prefer a cash sale.  Will ship to FFL of your choice if you are not local for actual cost.

The cheapest I've seen them when they are in stock is $850. 
I love this 1911!! It's lightweight design makes it great for concealed carry it's dead on accurate and looks great. 
I wouldn't be selling it if I didn't need the money for another ""must have purchase"". 
I'm sure everyone on this site has had that moment more than once. You walk into your favorite
Gunstore, you know the one where everyone knows you by your first name, and you see the one handgun that you know, that as soon as you buy it your collection will be complete. 

Anyways, I'm asking $700 for the gun, case and everything that came with it. I'm not looking for trades because I already have its replacement 
on order.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

Double action/single action with a decocker. 

The hogue grips and the perfect grip angle make this a very comfortable gun to hold onto. 

This is basically a brand new gun. It comes with three magazines, the original box and the original owners manual. 

In case you don't know, there will never be another 232 imported into the United States. This is the nicest example of the 232 you will find anywhere. I believe there might be a shop in Oklahoma or Georgia that is selling a new one for $1499. I'm only asking $1000.

I would rather trade this 232 for an AR or an AK than sell it outright.  So tell me what you have and maybe we can work something out.

I am the first owner of the rifle. I have since then made a completely different upper and have found I enjoy long range shooting far more then quick reflex shooting so I am selling my first rifle to build a lower to match my upper I've put together. I'm including 3 rails to go on the moe hand guard. I'm also including a cheap red dot with riser and if interested a knock off eo tech. There is no BUIS on the back. You will have to get your own or a carry handle if you go that route. I do have a railed gas block as well with a gas block riser I will throw in for 100 more if wanted. (140 dollar value). The gun retails for around 1000 and does have a MAID pistol grip on it instead of the first gen it came with. If you want to get your own FDE one I will knock 40 bucks off the price and take it. As a bonus I'll throw in a 40rnd clip. Barrel is a 1:7 Twist.

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics.
Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.

Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.

The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. At just $800 it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.

The 24 inch light weight barrel is chambered in 33 WCF caliber, the bore is as new with sharp, mirror bright rifling and no pitting or frosting. I rate the bore a solid 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. The barrel retains 90%+ blueing with light carry wear as seen in th photos. It has the correct Winchester 24F rear sight and a Lyman #4 Ivory bead front sight. The receiver is mechanically excellent, feeds, chambers and ejects smoothly. It has that fine old Winchester ""smooth as glass"" feel when you cycle the bolt and locks up tight and solid. The take down mechanism is tight and snug with absolutely no wobble or wear evident. The stock and forearm are nicely grained black walnut, both are tight and free of extra holes, chips or bad dents. There are light hunting and use marks but nothing I would rate as significant. The hard rubber buttplate is intact and free of chips and dents. This is a fine vintage 1886 Winchester that has seen light use but has been very well cared for. It will be a fine addition for your collection and an excellent choice for any game you'll find nORTH America. The 33 WCF has a muzzle velocity of 2,450 fps with a 200 grain bullet. The 348 Winchester's muzzle velocity is 2,530 fps - only 80 fps difference! If your're not 100% delighted with this 86 return it for a full refund! I'll provide any additional photos you'd like to see, just let me know the specific views you want."

I am wanting something large and classic looking. I am a firearms collector, with weapons ranging from antiques and classic revolvers to modern AK47s, AR15s, Mini 14s, H&Ks, precision rifles, Kimber pistols, Colts, Sigs, Springfields, Rugers, etc etc. All of my firearms are legally purchased and meticulously maintained. Indeed, many have never been fired as I enjoy collecting and cleaning my firearms as much if not more than actually shooting them. ] would like to trade one or more firearms for a motorcycle. Some pieces in my collection are worth more than most bikes. I'm willing to entertain a one gun trade, multiple guns trade, guns plus cash, and so on. Depending on what you're looking for, I'd also trade one of my higher end firearms for your bike plus a cash payment from you to cover the value gap.

I am a novice rider with very little mechanical know how, so I need a bike which is clean and which is new enough not to encounter problems which need addressing. I'd prefer something still under warranty. If the idea of a firearm for bike trade interests you, please get in touch.

Please know that I take gun ownership very seriously, and will require a background check through NICS via a licensed firearm dealer prior to making the trade, even though Florida law does not require this. I also reserve the right to walk away from a deal if I don't feel comfortable trading you a firearm. In order to receive a long gun you must be 18 years old, and in order to receive a hand gun you must be 21.

Attached below are some pictures of the types of motorcycles I am interested in. Chances are, if there is a specific firearm you are looking for to complete the trade, I have it. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.
