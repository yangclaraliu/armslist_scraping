WASR series rifles are manufactured with stamped sheet metal receivers that were originally intended for single-stack magazines. Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR series rifles are commonly imported to the United States by Century International Arms.
At the Century International Arms factory, the rifles are modified to conform with certain United States firearms regulations — in particular Title 18, Chapter 44, Section 922(r) of the United States Code, which deals with unlawful acts related to firearms. For example, the magazine wells are typically widened to accept double-stack column box magazines. Other common modifications include installation of upgraded gas pistons, fire control groups (i.e. trigger), pistol grips, and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by TAPCO of Georgia. Older WASR series rifles commonly caused trigger slap, which is caused by the bolt slamming backward into the trigger assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's trigger finger.[1] Beginning in 2007, Century International Arms has installed the TAPCO Intrafuse AK G2 trigger group, virtually eliminating the trigger slap problem. Rifles with this trigger group will have ""TAPCO USA G2"" stamped on the left side of the trigger. Some of these rifles may exhibit canted front sight blocks and gas tubes.[2] WASR series rifles are inexpensive and easily customized, with hundreds of aftermarket stocks, muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, telescopic sights, and other accessories available.
Weighing in at only 6.9 pounds, this rifle is comfortable to carry on those missions to the unknown, be it in the field, at the range or a Special Ops mission.

This rifle has been well taken care of in the year that I have had it, I clean it religiously with CLP, and keep it stored in a gun bag (which will come with the SKS). I have only put 290 rounds through the rifle on two separate occasions. The iron sites are dead on and the gun is pretty fun to have around, I just have my eyes on a Colt AR that I would rather have. I am asking $400 but the price is negotiable. I also have 10 rounds of HP still that I will give to you if you purchase the gun. That's all the ammo I have left after taking the gun out on January 31st, 2015. 

I will have a bill of sale, and would prefer to see photo ID to insure that I am selling to someone 18 an older."

I'm probably going to regret selling this as these are hard to find in MA but I could use the cash for other purchases. I bought this subcompact 9mm Kahr CM9 new back in 2012 and have since shot ~750 rounds through it. Excellent condition as seen in the photos. Great pocket carry or IWB gun. No safety like the MA compliant PM9. Nice smooth DA trigger. It's been carried here and there over the 3 years I've had it. 

It comes with 1 6 round magazine with a removable Pierce grip pinky extension, 2 7 round magazines, original box and manual, Desantis Soft-Tuk IWB holster, Hogue grip sleeve, and a Desantis nemesis superfly pocket holster. 

In 2013, I sent the gun back to Kahr to have them professionally polish the slide, barrel, and slide release to a mirror finish, which ran me about $180 with shipping etc.

I live in Washington state. If you live outside of Washington we can make a deal if 
you're an FFL. If not, I need to use an escrow service for payment. There are two
escrow services recommended on Gunbroker.com. They are: PaySAFE & Tradiator.com.
Escrow works like this:
1 - A deal is finalized
2 - I send my payment to the escrow company
3 - You send your gun to my FFL
4 - My FFL makes sure the gun meets expectations
5 - I agree to keep the gun
6 - I contact the escrow service and let them know I have the gun
7 - The escrow service sends you the payment - done.

So far I have not come across another one of these rifles with a factory installed brass deflector. Either as a collector piece, fantastic battle rifle, base for a conversion to full auto or a spares unit for your current full auto, this is an amazing rifle which doesn't come up very often (check this site as well as others and you'll see what I'm talking about)."

OFFEYE Optical Filters

Shoot Your Pistol With Two Eyes Open!

Effective for Pistol - Shotgun - Archery

Stop Closing One Eye to Aim.  Correct Cross Dominant or Middle Dominant Vision.  Eliminate the second ghost target when you focus on your front pistol sight.

The Reason You See Two Target is Your Non-Aiming Eye (OFFEYE) is Too Strong.  You Can Aim with Two Eyes if One is Strong and the Other is Weaker - But Many Shooters Need Help with Eye Strength.

No More Tape on Your Glasses.  No More Closing One Eye.

Don't Block Your Vision with Tape.  Just Turn Down the Signal a Little Or a Lot With Different Strength Filters.  Allow Your Aiming Eye To Be Dominant.

Even Shooters Without Eye Dominance Problems can Sharpen Their Vision With a Small Amount of Filtering.

Fits All Types of Eye Protection.  Removable and Reuseable.  Original Black & Red or Tactical Black & Grey Colors.  

Patent Pending.                                                                         Copyright 2012 MRV, LLC

***************

How does it work?

Focus on a target in the distance with two eyes open.  Now hold up three fingers slightly separated in front of your non-aiming eye (your OFFEYE).  The target is all there.  You can see everything even where the fingers are.

The Science.

What is happening is your brain is filling in the missing parts of the image.  It happens when you look through a window screen, a venetian blind or a picket fence when moving in a car.  The full image on the other side of the obstruction is never 100% in view but your brain puts together the pieces and completes the missing parts. You don't notice the obstruction.  

Its Simple.

Our Patent Pending process uses this ability by the brain and you decide how much of the OFFEYE you need to filter.  Your choice of strength allows you to filter a little or a lot and adjust to your needs.

I will sell with or without the scope. Also the rifle has not been sighted in because I've never fired it personally. Also included will be 5 boxes of Hornady 32gr V-MAX ammo.

This exceptional highly desirable quality Yugo M70 AB2 Paratrooper style model with under-folding stock is built using a beefy 1.5mm thick RPK style receiver with bulged front trunion and a brand new non chrome-lined barrel, making it more accurate than a standard 1mm AKM receiver. Fitted with black polymer upper and lower handguards and Yugo pistol grip for a more modern style and the iron sights have flip-up illuminating elements, initially filled with phosphorus and later with tritium (Which is used on the current production M-70's), to improve aiming at night. Hurry, this item is under limited production. Comes with 30rd mag, slant brake, and bayonet lug. Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:9.5 twist, Overall: 24"" (stock folded), 34.25"" (stock extended), Weight: 7.5 lbs. M-70s also have a grenade-launching sight and gas cut-off on the gas block, and are capable of launching rifle-grenades. To launch them a 22mm diameter grenade launching adapter is screwed on in place of the slant brake or other muzzle device. All of the M-70 models share the grenade launching ability with gas cutoff, and plunger lock that keeps the receiver cover in place during grenade launching with blanks. I've heard of some guys launching golf balls off the grenade spiggots with blanks, never tried myself.
Asking $800 or best offer. Will dicker and entertain all cash offers. Don't have many pics on my PC, most are on my cell so I'll gladly send more pics to any interested enquirers via email reply. FTF sale only.

Officially known as Rifle 7.62mm 2A1, this is a 7.62x51mm bolt action rifle adopted by the Indian Armed forces in 1963, bridging the transition from the Ishapore .303 SMLE rifles to the FAL series of 7.62x51mm Rifles.  The 2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be issued and used by a regular military force other than specialty sniper type weapons.  There were 350,000 of these rifles produced from 1965 to 1973. 
The 2A1 feeds from a detachable 10-rd magazine and has a 800 meter rear sight.  The stock and hand guards are standard SMLE pattern and many rifles utilized these parts from arsenal stores and earlier .303 SMLE rifles withdrawn from service.  Constructed using N-Type Steel with improved heat treating processes, these were strong actions and fully capable of handling the 7.62x51mm cartridge.
Rugged and capable of withstanding rough handling, these SMLE Pattern rifles gave outstanding service intil being sold off surplus by the Indian Armed Forces. 
This one is like most of these 2A and 2A1 rifles.  Mismatched recycled wood buttstock, forstock, and handguards and worn and thin original painted finish.  These rifles left the factory with a local painted finish similar to the British Suncorite of the 1950's and 60's. However, the rough exterior hides an excellent condition barrel and matching numbers on the receiver, barrel, bolt, Forend cap, Rear sight, and Magazine.  Rifle also wears a correct black P07 sling (no longer the one shown in the photos though).  Included is a hard to find unissued magazine.

The Millennium action is striker-fired 
and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
meaning that it fires only by a consistent
and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
And, much to my applause, 
the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
the Millennium pistol does not require any 
rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT140 PRO
has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
against any misfire without having to manually 
cycle the slide to reset the trigger action.

I bought the gun brand new last year at Shooters and shot about 300 rounds through it. Very few FTF due to crap ammo. 
With the Buckmark reflex zeroed this thing is a real tack driver. Looks almost like a shorty due to the short reciver.

 My love for mil-surp guns has taken over and I must make room in the safe"

Took it to the range once and have decided that I would like something with a little more magnification, maybe in the 6-20x range. This is a fantastic scope but was not as powerful as I was expecting. Very very clear, has mil dots, great brand and basically brand new (out of the box a week). Like I said, it was mounted by Cabellas and taken to the range once. Have the box and everything that came with it (manual, sticker, allen wrench). Already mounted in Leupold rings as well. Would like to sell towards buying another Leupold with more power. Paid $350 for the scope and $30 for the rings, Asking for $310, Call or text Dylan

*Kudos to Armslist support for reviewing my ads and reinstating them after they had been flagged!* 

Picked up from FFL at 7:15 pm Friday evening. Pictures added as promised. 

Gun is so new, I am afraid to rack it because it might squeek. It's born on date, see picture, is January 27th, 2015. I think that is like BTNIB (Better Than New In Box) as it's fresher than anything in your local gun store case.

So here's the back story..  been waiting four months on this new gun ordered through police supply who had to get it from the factory.

I sold my Glock 29 Gen 3 about a month ago as I knew this was arriving soon. It was my daily carry gun that I used with a Tagua holster (Remora clone, $40)

I bought a KKM 10-40 conversion barrel ($175 shipped, http://www.kkmprecision.com/) and shot 150 rounds of MagTech .40 through the KKM barrel in my old Glock 29 Gen 3.

Black leather Alessi CQC-S OWB snap holster with custom sweat guard. Matching double mag pouch. ($250)

http://www.alessigunholsters.com/alessi-holsters-double-magazine-pouch-for-glock-guns/

One Glock 20 (15 round) magazine ($30) 
Three BNIB PG-29 grip extensions to add to the factory mags that come with the new gun. ($30, http://www.pearcegrip.com/Products/GLOCK/PG-29)

Also have 10mm factory JHP ammo, see my other ads.

Gun only, best gunbroker price (2/13/15 2200) is $589
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=468378457

Not counting ammo, I have $525 of additional really cool G29 total package gear. Anytime I sold a gun in the past, I never could sell the accessories separately later worth a damn. No, I will not sell the gun alone and if I was, it wouldn't be for $500.

I'd love to see you fully kitted up with my $1100+ worth of G29 stuff... any ideas how you can make that happen?

Stupid offers ignored. Please include a phone number. FTF or through our FFLs.

If someone doesn't grab this deal by Sunday, I am sure I will have grown too attached to it by then to ever part with it. I'm surprised I haven't taken this ad down already. Definitely will not be giving this away, begone low ballers!

My favorite range closes at 1600 hours on Sunday and it will no longer be new by then. This ad will be gone, and you'll only have regrets that you missed the opportunity to possess true perfection.

I'll be happily cleaning and polishing the unicorn, secure in the knowledge that she is mine forever, and hopping on the internet to order the best sights on the market as that is the only thing you could possibly want that isn't already included."

Custom shaved Hammer for Lighter Trigger Pull (Heavy spring also included)
5.45x39 surplus ammo generally requires a stiffer spring in order to sufficiently strike the primer. This results in a heavier trigger pull. In order to avoid this, I shaved down the hammer, lowering its weight and thus increasing its velocity. This results in a successful primer strike 100% of the time, without the heavier trigger pull. A heavier spring is also provided, should you prefer that option.

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."
