Here is some manufacture's information.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Made in U.S.A."

This rifle is accurate and the amber dot on the Trijicon sight is still easy to pick up. Everything about this gun is robust. This thing is built like an absolute tank! It shoots great with cheap steel cased ammo and I never had a malfunction. I only want to trade this off because I want a fixed or side folding stock AK. 

I'm only interested in trading for an AKM type AK. I'm not interested in AR's unless highly in my favor. I can include 5x Circle 10 Mags if the AK you are showing is very nice and not chambered in 7.62x39."

Buyer beware bunch of scammers in here. Crooks buy these items from police returns for $250 or even less and then turn around to ARMSLIST to sell them for more, a lot more. I am not against making a buck, I am against unscrupulous people endangering others: These guns are dangerous nearing their end of service life and in need of full rebuild. They won't tell you that.

Buyer do yourself a favor, check other sites for the real prices. Slickguns, Grab-a-Gun and others post the best values (not inflated) for new weapons and also all those used police returns and cheap imports (like the Sig 2340 which you can buy for $300 at Bud's but in ARMSLIST sells for $600 !!!, or the P2022 that sells BNIB for $400 but sells for $500 or more in USED condition here.

Featuring an innovative, low-profile design, Sightmark’s LoPro Green Laser allows users to mount a high-power laser in front of a riflescope on a picatinny or Weaver rail without blocking the field-of-view. The Sightmark LoPro can also be mounted on the side of a quad rail for maximum efficiency. The laser is offset, clearing the front sight post to ensure perfectly centered aim of the laser. With 1 MOA-click value adjustments, the hand adjustable windage and elevation turrets allow the user to zero in the laser dot for close-range shooting. Visibility ranges approximately 50 yards in the daytime to more than 600 yards at night.

Constructed of high-performance thermoplastic, which prevents a battery from getting cold over a longer period of time, the Sightmark LoPro Green Laser is not only resistant to cold weather, but also heat protected. Additionally, the unit is corrosion resistant, weatherproof, shockproof, and features a matte black finish for tactical applications. Exceptionally reliable and durable, the device provides nearly 30 hours of continuous use with a single CR123 battery."

Comes with the 6"" pinned barrel and a six round recessed cylinder. The barrel ends are fantastic and there is very little holster wear and some slight freckling from storage. This gun has a serial number of S243XXX and has been researched to be manufactured in 1965. The gun is in very nice condition for being fifty years old. The Eagle target grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the bead blasted top strap and blue frame finish. The finish on all the model 28's top straps have been bead blasted to deflect any glare in bright conditions. The condition of the bluing is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Smith & Wesson released this model as a lesser option variant of the 27 and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. This 28-2 also features the checkered semi Target Hammer with a serrated Trigger and both have been finished with distinctive case hardened coloring. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 6"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model 28-2 function perfectly, and as with all Smith & Wesson revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed. This revolver carries a very rich tradition and has a strong following by those individuals that were looking for function over form. All business all day long. This highway Patrolman honors all those American servicemen and women who dedicated so much in the line of duty. $600"

Glock 26 Gen 4, excellent+ condition, immaculately maintained, detailed cleanings immediately after every range trip. The vast majority of sellers would list it as LNIB, but it has been to the range a few times, so it's not quite ""like new"" to me. It has never actually been used for EDC. No visible marks or blemishes, maybe a very faint scuff on the ejection port from a spent case. You would have to look very closely under a bright light to find any marks at all.

Comes with 3 OEM Ten Round Magazines(one with a Pearce +2 floorplate) original case, paperwork, backstraps, brush, fired shell casing (April 2014), ect. 

Installed on the firearm are Trijicon Bright and Tough three dot green tritium night sights (2014),  Pearce grip frame plug, Lone Wolf Extractor, Glock OEM NY1 Trigger Spring and Glock OEM ""-"" (Minus) Connector. An amazing carry trigger, recommended by many Glock experts.

Also included are all the original parts: OEM Sights, OEM Gen 4 ""."" (Dot) Connector, OEM Trigger Spring, OEM Extractor. OEM Magazine Floorplates. All of these parts can be easily installed, if you prefer the stock set-up.

Finally, you will also get: 2 additional OEM ten round magazines with Pearce extensions(for a total of 5 Magazines),  an extra OEM Recoil Spring Assembly(RSA), a Glock Armorer's Tool, and (barely used) Blackhawk CQC Serpa Holster complete with all original packaging and contents.


What I have into this firearm:
Glock 26                    $560
Night Sights               $100
2 Extra Mags              $50
Minus Connector         $20
NY1 Spring                 $5
Grip Plug                    $10
Pearce Extensions       $30
Glock Tool                  $10
Lone Wolf Extractor     $25
Serpa Holster              $45
Recoil Spring Assembly $20
                       TOTAL $835

Price is VERY FIRM at $650. 

I don't expect to recoup all the money, but if you know Glocks and their parts, you know that's a VERY fair price. That is basically the cost of the pistol and the night sights alone. I would much rather keep it than sell it for less.

The Mission Maniac compound bow is a dual cam bow that is adjustable enough to ensure it suits a wide variety of people. The Maniac Dual Cam also combines nicely with parallel limbs, limb-based string suppressors and D-Amplifier string silencers to keep the noise and vibration to an absolute minimum.

It is all based around a fully machined aluminum reflex riser and this helps keep any jump down to a minimum.

The versatility of the bow and the great level of adjustment that is provided by the cam system ensures that the Maniac will be ideal for the young archer who will be looking for a formidable bow that will also grow with them. This doesn’t mean that the bow is only meant for the youngsters. In fact, it is a great hunting bow that will be appropriate for archers of all levels."

$525 FTF in Shelby County/Memphis area.  Buyer must have a valid TN Handgun Carry Permit.  No trades offers please.

The PCR is near identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

This rifle has two just perceptible pin prick defects on the stock... one on the toe of the butt stock, one on the bottom of the fore end.

I am the second owner, it's been in my safe undisturbed for about 7 or 8 years. I cleaned and lubed it, installed the sight and put it away. Shortly after I deployed to Iraq and forgot about it. It does not appear to have ever been fired.

Even though this is a replica of a firearm made before 1898 in a caliber not available through normal commercial trade, I will only transfer through an FFL.

Just how narrowly does the ATF define “normal commercial trade”? I don’t know… Even though 45-90 is not commonly available… it is nonetheless commercially available: http://ammoseek.com/ammo/45-90.

Further, even thought not an advisable thing to do and may prove destructive; commonly available 45-70 can be discharged by this firearm.
