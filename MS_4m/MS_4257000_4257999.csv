If you have any questions, don't hesitate I'll be glad to help

The Website has this to say about it:

""Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16”, 12.5” and 9” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition"""

I'll need to see the buyer's Indiana drivers license and License to Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. For those who question this requirement, I apologize if it offends, but I can't perform a background check so I will deal only with those folks the State Police have cleared. 

This item will be cross-posted in multiple groups. FYI. I will respond to all offers in the order I receive them. I consider my word as my bond, so the first person I come to terms with will get the same consideration.

The gun is in good working order. I have shot it and cleaned it regularly. It is a nice piece of history as well. Stamped on the bottom is ""P.P.D. No. 16"". After some research I concluded that this was Philadelpia Police Department number 16. The gun shows signs of its age but for the most part I think it looks nice, still has its shine. It has a few scratches on the sides and part of the left grip piece has a chunk missing from the bottom. This was like this before I purchased it. It shoots 32 S & W. When I bought it, they told me the ammo would be hard to find since it was an archaic round. But in all honestly I found it easily at my local gun store and Gander Mountain. It's is just not always in stock. I have personally had a good time with this gun given its age and history. I would like to sell it or trade it for a Chinese Mosin Nagant, type 53 or a Zastava m70a.

When I got it home I cleaned it and promptly took it outside to play. Round after round I had light primer strikes. I was furious! So I set it off to the side up until about a week ago, I contacted American Tactical Imports and they informed me that it needed to have the updated Bolt Stop installed. Which they sent and now it works flawlessly! IT HAS BEEN FIXED! This is the most fun .22 I have ever shot! But I have many .22's so this one needs to go.

It comes with:
3 22 round magazines.
A folding stock
Tasco red dot sight
Quad rail with vertical foregrip
And the conversion kit to closely resemble a Heckler & Koch MP5. GSG used to make them this way but Heckler & Koch filed a lawsuit against them and won. So they had to make small revisions to the 522 to sell. As the rifle sits it resembles a predate Heckler & Koch lawsuit.

Has had 200-300 rounds through it.

And as always, price may be negotiated. Comes with the original box and everything in it, minus my paperwork - for obvious reasons.

Description from Brownells:

Adjusts, Removes & Installs Sights Without Damage

Safely moves fixed sights right or left in their dovetails without deforming slide or sight. Specifically designed for use with factory and aftermarket Tritium night sights, which are too fragile for the traditional hammer-and-punch sight installation method; works equally well with iron sights. Thumbscrew securely locks the slide so it’s fully supported in the rigid, machined aluminum body. Separate slots in the screw mechanism engage the sight and firmly, yet gently, concentrate screw force to loosen sights from even extremely tight dovetails. Hardened steel handle provides plenty of leverage, while self-lubricating, oil-impregnated Oilite® bronze bearings and extra-fine threads ensure smooth, precise movement."

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp is a .308 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil. 

The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish. 

NOTE: The Standard model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length when pinned.

575,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4257575,For Sale:  (2)WWII M1/M2 30-round Carbine magazines (Seymour split back) - like new!,"St. Paul area, Minnesota, United States",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, April 19, 2015",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here are two of the nicest carbine mags that you will find outside of factory wrappings. 
Got these years ago new in wrap, unwrapped them and....never used them.
Have plenty of 15 rounders and probably will never own an M2, so these would be better off in the hands of a collector or an M2 owner who wants correct mags to display with the gun.

They are:

WWII Seymour Split back 30-rounders in nearly flawless condition, with a couple small exceptions. See the pics here (21 high resolution images) http://tinypic.com/a/3s9ea/2

As you can see in the second picture, there are three small yellow circles indicating tiny surface rust spots. These will probably chip off easily enough but I want the buyer to see exactly what these are. There are also numerous very VERY tiny scratches overall, but many of these are pressing/drawing scratches from when the mags were made. See near the feed lips...some bright areas where the bluing is gone....still, very tiny areas and as you look at the tops of the mags, no big insertion scrapes showing, and the followers are perfect, indicating these mags have never had a single round in either. 
I wiped all the oil off these to show all the imperfections....oil them up and most of the tiny marks won't even show, but if you own NOS mags, you probably know this.

Beautiful bluing overall, perfect floorplates, nice SEY markings for Seymour, classic split back design with nice clean spot welds, clean drain holes pinched front fold and not a single dent or ding anywhere. Aside from the marks I mentioned, these mags are in about as perfect condition as you will ever find and will make a nice pair for your collection! You won't find new mags anymore, especially in this shape as they all have dried up and the price is skyrocketing. Get these while you can!

But be sure and take a good look at all the images.....you can save then to your PC and zoom in on any details....you'll see these mags are really, REALLY NICE!

My Price?
$150.00 for the pair
I can ship, too.

Thanks for looking!"

It is without a doubt, the best piston system money can buy and I have owned all the best piston rifles on the market (LWRC, POF, PWS, etc..) This is POF’s Premiere rifle at the current moment. i bought this rig to varmint hunt with.. My needs have changed and I am going completely away from the AR platform. I intend to focus entirely on the long range bolt gun platform now… Im selling to fund a build so there are very few things I’m interested in as far as trade goes…. Below is a break down of everything included in the package and what I paid for it. I have all the paperwork, boxes, manuals, warranty cards for everything. gun has been fired less than 60 times. I had zero problem hitting a 12” steel swinger at 600 yds. The barrel is 1/8 twist so it will stabilize all ammo from 55-77gr. This rifle coupled with the Leupold glass is a great setup. The scope has the Kenton Industries turrets with yardage marks on the elevation turret. Rifle is dialed at 100yds. Just range target, roll turret to specified yardage and fire! its dead on out to 600yds. Minus wind of course :) Please Please Please do your research before making an offer..Im not hurting for money and I don’t HAVE to sell it. Lowball offers will be ignored!!! This is NOT an Academy, Wal-Mart AR….. For those of you who have the same ""Best Money Can Buy"" disease as me, you will appreciate this more than others! Thanks for looking!
