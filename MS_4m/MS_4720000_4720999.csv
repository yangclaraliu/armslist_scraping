While this is a great match rifle, it can also be used as a tactical stand off rifle or just a fun range tack driver. It shoots less than 1 MAO. Now I have young kids and do not compete, it is just sitting in my safe and this rifle deserves to be out there being used. I have all paperwork, everything it came with.

 It uses dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.Comes with two 18 round magazines, poly holster, paddle attachment, belt attachment, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty. Barrel: 4.47"", Overall: 7.5"", Weight: 1.8 lbs."

Will take interchangeable choke tubes, only comes with one, full. 30"" barrel shoots 2 3/4-3"". This model never had the issues the 3 1/2"" model did. The Gold Hunter is very easy on the shoulder. The gas system and recoil pad do a great job of softening the punch. A great little feature that is exclusive to the Browning Gold is the speed-load. With the bolt locked rearward, as it does when empty, inserting a shell into the magazine tube sends it immediately to the chamber, making the Gold ready to fire instantly, without pressing any buttons. This is a worthwhile feature when the shooting is fast, as over an active dove field. The balance and handling of the Gold Hunter is with a slight bias towards the front end, steadying the swing and allowing for quick handling without being too light and whippy out front. It comes up quick and swings very smoothly. The gun weighs seven and one quarter pounds, but feels a bit lighter due to the excellent balance. The slight muzzle-heavy feel along with the gun’s ability to reliably cycle very light target loads, would make this gun very suitable at Sporting Clays. For a gas gun to handle both hunting and clay sports, I can think of none better than the Gold Hunter. Using the same gun for shooting clays and hunting should improve scores in both areas. After being around for a few years, I think that Browning has a real winner in the Gold auto loading shotgun. It is a good successor to the venerable old A-5, and worthy to wear the Browning name. I think John Browning would be proud."

Barnes TAC-XPD ammunition is optimized for carry and home defense use. Loaded with the popular Barnes TAC-XP bullet it is designed to deliver top performance when it matters the most. The TAC-XP's all-copper construction and very large, deep hollow-point cavity expand, penetrate and perform more consistently than any personal defense product on the market. Performance through bare gel, light and heavy clothing, car doors, plywood and automotive windshield glass is unmatched by the competition. TAC-XP bullets are 100% copper, making them safe for the environment. These lighter all copper bullets also result in less felt recoil in comparison to lead core bullets allowing the shooter to recover quickly without sacrificing terminal performance. Barnes specially engineered each load using low flash powders to produce almost no muzzle flash, ideal for low-light situations. Distinctive Techni-Crom plated shells feed smoothly from the magazine for reliability shooters can depend on every time. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases."

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 without additional parts. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself. The Daniel Defense RIS II M4A1 FSP feature a cut-out in the top rail to accommodate a standard front sight base.

NSN # 1005-01-566-5280

The Daniel Defense RIS II free-floating picatinny rail systems are designed to allow individual operator to quickly, and without special tools, mount the M203 and precisely mount SOPMOD accessories to host weapon without effecting point of impact. The Daniel Defense RIS II is an innovative upgrade to the platform.

I have more in this than I'm asking so I the price is justified. If you think it's too high it's obviously not the gun for you.

This isn't a squirrel hunting rifle for carrying around in the woods so it's not priced like one.

No need for a buffer assembly. 
The ARAK-21® is a gas piston actuated, complete upper receiver assembly designed to seamlessly interface with the standard AR-15 platform.  The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin.  The new ARAK-21® upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools. 

Your ARAK-21® upper receiver will be shipped to you with one “Barrel Assembly Unit” (BAU), or two, depending on which package you purchase.

The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion.  The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob.  The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings.  Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation.

The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system.  Along with your new ARAK-21® upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails.

Due to the unique and innovative features of the ARAK-21® upper receiver, there are very few parts that are interchangeable with a standard AR-15.  The firing pin, extractor spring, and ejector spring are the only parts that are standard and interchangeable with an AR-15 upper receiver.

Also have 80% receivers, barrels, uppers, stock kits, lower parts kits and bolt carrier groups. Many more items!!

Crossbow-review.com gives the X-2 an excellent review:

The TenPoint Stealth X2 is a very well designed and manufactured product. Its perfomance is outstanding and consistent. In the field also proved to be durable, I can attest this having used (and several times abused) this product for over three years now, having gone through several thousands shots. This product is now out of production but a few pro shops may still have one in house or you may have a chance to buy one from ebay or another online shop. If you either want to use it for field shooting or hunting the TenPoint Stealth X2 will not disappoint you. It is well designed with plenty of muscle, enough speed for the largest games, great accuracy for pinpoint arrow placement and it is built to last. Enjoy."

According to her, however, her youthful looks are a result of the regular vitamin infusions she gets from ASCI Asian Stem Cell Institute / Asian Stem Cell Regeneration Philippines.

She didn’t have health conditions or an illness that prompted her to take vitamin infusion therapy, but she had begun seeing and feeling signs of aging, so she looked for a way to regain her health and youthfulness.

“I just noticed that I didn’t have the usual stamina that I previously had. Before, I could work from early morning until late at night. Then, I noticed that I would get sleepy sooner than usual. I would feel tired more easily. I just felt that I wasn’t functioning as well as usual, and I didn’t want to get it worse and affect how I was enjoying life,” she said.

Upon consultation at ASCI or Asian Stem Cell Institute / Asian Stem Cell Regeneration Philippines, Rose’s hormone levels were checked and balanced and several blood tests were done to evaluate her state of health.

“After my checkup they told that I would benefit best from Nutritional IV therapy. Now, it’s a regular treatment that I undergo, and I’m very happy with the results.”

“I didn’t just increase my energy and stamina, but I also began to look younger. My skin is now much smoother, and has that youthful glow. People have noticed the difference… It’s hard for them to guess what my real age is.”

“Even my sons are happy with the result of the treatment, and told me they are beaming with pride of their youthful-looking mother.” She smiled.
