Yeah, yeah, I fell into the peer pressure and I dropped $689 for this crossbow alone; over $800 with all the accessories and after taxes. I waited for the weekend and took it to the range. I shot it and I got to give it to my pals. They were right about hitting what I want and where I want. 

 Listen, I am a traditional archer. I hunt with traditional archery equipment. Why? It is because I like the challenge. If I really want to shoot something with a scope, I would just shoot a rifle. So now I am feeling guilty about a purchase that I will never really use. So now I'm selling it. It is in perfect condition. Shot only one day at the range. Got to admit it is a tack driver, but not my style of shooting or hunting. 

 It comes with three bolts and quiver. This item is also being sold with string cocker and high quality case. I even upgraded the bolts to high carbon fast flight. Why? Because I'm OCD and a perfectionist and only use the best of the best. Now that pushes it way above the $800 mark. 

 For those who like to haggle, please don't embarrass yourself. Do the math. Over $800 with all the accessories and after taxes. $500 FIRM. Local pickup only.

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.   Product SpecsCaliber: .380 ACP Length: 5.26”Height: 3.75”Width: .750“”Barrel Length: 2.80”Distance Between Sights: 4”Weight (unloaded): 8.8 oz Trigger Pull: ≈5.5# Magazine Capacity: 6+1 Rds UPC: REDACTED19"

These frames had serial numbers starting with 'CPA.' Colt was having one of its internal upheavals and they never got any guns out to speak of - Colt 'Pony' pistols from this run are fairly rare. Garcia/FI had all these frames and the FI Model D was born. This example is in mint condition. Bluing at 99% or better, grips are flawless, and the bore is as new.

Trying to make room in my safe for a few more SIGs. 

The 75B Matte Stainless sells online anywhere between $700-$780 depending on the store, then you have shipping, FFL transfer fee, etc. The Meprolight Tru-Dots are about $90 at the cheapest, and the CZ black Desert Sand G10 grips run about $80 before shipping also.

All in all, to get one of these new you'd be looking at MINIMUM $850-$900, and even more once you add in shipping, FFL fees, sight installation, tax, etc.

I'm asking $700 obo to try and get it sold fast. I'll listen to all trade offers, but definitely more interested in cash right now.

Review any of the riot photos from the 1960s; all the riot guns were wood stocked. The Mossberg 500 riot gun was always 3 inch chambered. Here is the 500 in riot gun configuration: 18 1/2 inch cylinder barrel, blue and checkered wood finish, with full steel, double slide bar forend hardware. We have added a Masen Company trench style heat shield. Manufacturer and warrantor is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, TX. Model is 500, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells or 4 + 1 on 3 inch shells. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel, magazine tube, double slide bar pump assembly, bolt, trigger and internal parts all built into an alloy receiver, with cut checkered semi gloss finish hardwood stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced gold plated trigger. Safety is top tang type with polymer button. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 and 3 inch interchangeably. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch .728 vicinity muzzle diameter, standard bore and digests any 12 gauge shell, from steel shot to rifled slugs up to 3 inch. Sight is standard hex base brass bead. We have added a polymer Trench Gun type heat shield, and this Mossberg looks more like a Trench Gun than anything else made in the United States. Muzzle measures .728 vicinity, okay for any type 12 gauge load, from super light #9 to T steel to rifled slugs and buckshot. Sight system is conventional brass bead sight. Magazine holds 5 rounds of 2 3/4, or 4 round of 3 inch, shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech face. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch brown rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, with a new factory barrel. They served light duty, likely with a sales rep or writer. Each has the letter U stamped near its serial number. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal only faint occasional edge or operation wear evidence.
