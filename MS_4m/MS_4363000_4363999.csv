Default WTS Geiselle Automatics SSA-E trigger Like New
Up for sale is a Geiselle Super Semi Automatic Enhanced trigger for the AR15. This is a two stage trigger and I literally got this trigger brand new today but after taking it to the range and firing 40 rounds I have decided this is not what I was looking for for 3-Gun competition rifle. 

Specs on trigger:
2 Stage
1st Stage Weight:	2.3lbs.
2nd Stage Weight:	1.2lbs.
Total Pull Weight:	3.5lbs.
Adjustable:	No
Recommended Use:	Target Shooting, Precision Shooting
Pin Size:	Mil-Spec

Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced first and second stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light first stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like second stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired.

It definitely has a ""candy cane"" like break that's for sure, just looking for something different...

I bought these from a professional reloader who uses top of the line equipment. I have function checked 30 rounds of this ammo through my 16"" 1:9 twist AR 15 and through my buddies 16'' 1:7 twist AR with an Arizona legal suppressor and they work just fine and are very accurate (I've heard pellet guns louder than these rounds when run through a can). I know it looks weird but they work. However, they do not, I repeat DO NOT cycle the bolt. So it would probably be best to shoot them out of a bolt gun, but semi auto's will work too. I have a very limited quantity so let me know how many you want and I will let you know if I can fill your order. 
Price is $1 a round and if we meet at a range I will give you a few to try out so you can make sure they work.

A limited quantity of the Gen III 21SFs had a 1913 style picatinny rail instead of the traditional GLOCK accessory rail. This is one of those.
 Yes, it's been shot. Don't know how much but looking at it I would guess a few hundred rounds judging from the wear on the end of the barrel. It hasn't been used as a carry gun. I have the case, extra mag, and all original Glock paperwork.
 Yes, you can find them listed on the web anywhere from $449 to $689 but everyone says out of stock. Most common price in stock is $545, plus FFL ($20 and up) and shipping ($20 and up). That makes it $600 for a new one. 
 Not really looking to trade but might consider it. If not the same value weapon be prepared to add cash boot. Interested in .22, 9mm, and .45 caliber handguns. Rifles possibly but not likely. I would trade up with cash on a 1911 or AR15.

I have for sale a very good condition, hardly used, Smith and Wesson M&P 15 rifle. I've put somewhere between 100 and 300 rounds through it, but it's too expensive to shoot and too cumbersome to try to find places to shoot it (or too expensive for the memberships that grant rifle range access), and I'd rather have a second pistol, so I'd like to find a new home for this fine rifle.

The rifle has magpul handguards, a magpul vertical grip, but comes with the stock handguards (and wrench to change it) as well. The rifle also includes a magpul 2-point sling, sling mount on the handguard, a daniel defense addition for the rear mount point for the sling, a Bushnell red dot sight, 3 30-rd p-mags, the oem mag, 2 locks, and a rifle case for it all.

I'm offering this at $800, OBO. Shipping from my ffl to yours. $850 includes shipping / transfer fees (on my end). If local sale, transaction will take place at my FFL (no meet-ups or ""off the grid"" sales).

I'll sell it to the right person for $3,000...the price is firm. The rifle is STUPID ACCURATE and shoots smooth. I have it zeroed to about a one inch group at 100 yards. There's no replacements parts other than the stock I I got about 200 rounds through it. It's in pristine condition and is locked in my safe with a light coating of lube and a dehumidifier keeping it around 45% at all times. I'm in no way rushed to get rid of it and will not budge much (if any) on the price. Feel free to contact me with any questions.
Thanks for looking

So for sale I have my original Sig Sauer SIG556 Patrol rifle. It has the original Swiss style hand guards, but you can add a rail to them very easily. This rifle is piston operated, and combines AR accuracy and ammo with AK operation and reliability. These are not in production by Sig, but still under warranty from the factory. Breaking down the rifle for cleaning is very AR like, with quick break down and easy cleaning thanks to gas not being blown back into the bolt. The safety is ambidextrous on the rifle, and it has a side folding stock that is also adjustable for length of pull. The rifle takes AR magazines, and I've only had the opportunity to put about 120 rounds through it. If you purchase the optics with the rifle, it is currently sighted in at 50 yards which should put the point of impact right in the center at 100 yards or so. The barrel is the quality you would expect from Sig, and has a 1 in 7 twist. The gas system on the rifle is also adjustable. The rifle is also equipped with a lower rail on the Swiss style hand guards, and a Sig 2/3 point adjustable sling is also included. Below are the details of the rifle package:

$925 Sig Sauer SIG556 Patrol Rifle w/folding and adjustable stock and one Pmag.

DANIEL DEFENSE 300 BLACKOUT!!!!
Description:
Daniel Defense’s 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend. Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

I purchased this a gun show a couple years ago and do not know a whole lot about it. Rifle appears to be in over all good shape but is used for sure. There are a couple small spots of surface rust. The barrel appears to have been threaded with one of the threading tools that was popular a few years ago. It appears to be a decent job, the flash hider threads on with no problem. There is no pin or timing key on the flash hider nor a groove in the barrel for one. Bore looks very good but there appear to be a couple of small spots of corrosion near the muzzle. Nothing major but worth noting. The muzzle picture shows a 30cal M2 ball round. I loaned out my muzzle gauge awhile back and it never returned so this is the best I can do for now. Ive tried to take plenty of pictures.

Just looking for something a little smaller.  Looking for a subcompact double stack 9mm such as. Glock 26, XD9sc or XD9sc mod 2, FNS9c, or similar.  Would also be interested in an XDs 9mm or Lc9s plus cash.  The only non 9mm I would consider would be a recent production Glock 42 plus cash.

Would sell with all 4 magazines for $475, though I prefer to trade.

Feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 if interested, texts preferred. 

Thanks!"

The rifle comes with original box, three magazines (one factory PMAG, two PMAGS with windows), one Magpul Maglink and sling. I have put Troy H&K flip up iron sights and they are loctited in place. The sight picture is amazing and the sights are accurate out of the package and have not been adjusted.

Also, I have 100 rounds of Federal .223 and 40 rounds of Tula steel case to go with it. 

I paid around $1,000 for this rifle after tax without the sights (those were $160 themselves). I'm asking $925 - or trade up to $975. Please don't offer a trade that's worth $200 less, not offer any boot and expect me to trade straight. Also please do not offer a gun that's missing parts.

Please call with special applications and we can discuss a solution that would work for you.The Mystic X was born from a need: the need for a “Swiss army knife” of silencers, so to speak, for first time suppressor buyers. The first time buyer is literally overwhelmed with the amount of intel that is currently available. Due to this problem, we feel that the first time buyer needs a choice that will allow them to “dip” their toe into NFA and be able to have the most versatile suppressor available at the same time. Armed with this idea, we took one of our most popular suppressors, one that has already been adopted by many first time buyers, and improved on it. The Mystic X is the ultimate first time owner’s silencer!For more info and demo videos -- http://libertycans.net/mystic-x/www.gatewaytactical.com"

	Hey everyone,
I have available for trade/sale an awesome and hard to find little 5.56 pistol. This is a Kel-Tec PLR-16. It is chambered in 5.56/223. This is a really hard to find pistol and they are literally a blast to shoot. This one has a brand new OEM Kel-Tec hand guard with picatinny rail. In addition, I have installed an aftermarket single point sling adapter (way better than the OEM janky one). It also has a Levang Linear Compensator installed. This helps with follow up shots and directs the blast forward so as to not be so hard on the shooter. This will come with the single point sling, single point sling adapter, Linear Compensator, one metal 30rd magazine, factory 10rd magazine, and original box, papers, and tools. Also have some ammo or extra mag available. These are nearly impossible to find at the moment so the price is all over the place on these. I am open to reasonable offers, but i know what I’ve seen these sell for at the last three gun shows and on the classifieds, so please don’t waste both of our time bickering about supply and demand. I just got this on trade and would keep it, but there are other projects that I would rather have. 
	I would also consider trades. Mostly interested in ARs in 1:8 twist, AKs, a 5.7x28 guns, AR10s, PMR30s, CMR30s, etc. Honestly, just make an offer, as long as it evens our fair on both sides then i will consider it. Please no Blackpowders, 22s, or shotguns unless it is weighted heavily in my favor. I would also do multi gun trades or partial trades. Some trades will require boot on your side, some will require it on my side. Can add boot on my end as well if it is something I am interested in. I would keep this, but i would rather have a full platformed AR  5.56/223 than the pistol variant. For any questions or for offers shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible.

Thanks for looking and happy hunting

Approx 250 rounds shot.  Email or call/text REDACTED


The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

 There are two buffers included. The shorty buffer that was made before the ban (do not know or even seen how they work) and a new one made for the Sig arm grip. The stainless spring is still in the plastic bag. Sig arm grip is not included. Both buffers are cerakoted to match the stock.

 The pistol is professionally camo coated with a Cerakote finish. Finished by BMR Shooting in Alaska. Normally a $400 camo blended finish with colt coyote, chocolate brown and light sand colors so it will be easy to match a magazine. Or if you want a camo matching magazine, I am sure BMR Shooting in Alaska could do one for a fee. You can contact them.
