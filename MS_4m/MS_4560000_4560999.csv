I have all the paperwork and proof of authenticity. The reason Im offering today and on this wonderful site called armslist is because I know there is only very fair pricing no trickery and only very honest people and by all means no overpriced guns what so ever. Elvis carried his beloved 38 special wherever he went. He would sit in front of the TV and blow the HELL out of it when someone said something he didn't like. It is documented that this gun along with Elvis behind the trigger destroyed over 500 TVSduring its reign of terror. I feel the price of the gun is more than fair with all the documentation it has to go with it. I know what I have here so don't try to lowball me BRO! Whoever the lucky buyer is will get a free trip to Graceland and all the fried banana and peanut butter sandwiches you can eat. Thanks for looking and hope to here from you soon with any questions. God bless Elvis and especially armslist.

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

I bought this gun used a few years back, carried it for a couple of years, and put a couple thousand rounds down the pipe.  Comes equipped with factory skeletonized trigger and hammer, stainless bushingless bull barrel, lightweight aluminum frame, and low profile rosewood grips.  Also has 2 factory 8 round magazines with extended base pads (for mag-well use), and 2 Wilson Combat 9 round magazines.  The 9 rounders work, but I carried the 8 rounders, just because I trusted their feeding more.

Only issues I have ever had with the factory mags were when the recoil spring wore out, I had some feeding issues, as one would expect.  The spring that's in it now has about 300 rounds on it, and I'm including 2 new OEM springs.  This uses standard Kimber pro-sized (4"" barrel) springs, same as for 45 ACP models.

The condition of the firearm is good.  Completely functional and no rust, but the steel parts do have some holster wear, as Kimber steel finishes are prone to.  The aluminum frame is in good shape with some handling marks, and the barrel and all other functional components are great.

The Trijicon rear tritium sight is on the gun, and there is a fiber optic sight on the front.  I have and will include the Trijicon front sight, and extra fiber optic inserts as well.  There is also an aftermarket mag-well / main spring housing on the gun that was ground down to fit the low profile grips.  The factory plastic main spring housing is also included.  Holsters included are a custom leather IWB by Tucker Gunleather for comfort, a CompTac C-Tac IWB for speed and onehanded reholstering, and a Fobus paddle for range or open carry use.  All high end and cost a combined $230.

Finally, I am including the original box, manual, lock, and stripping tool, plus a spare stripping tool I made from a paperclip.

Kimber no longer makes stuff in .40, but if they did, you're looking at a combined cost of ~$1700 for this setup if purchased new today.  I'm asking for $700 OBO, including the transfer.  Cash only, face-to-face at my FFL in North Loveland.  If you prefer to meet at an FFL of your choosing, that's fine, but you must arrange and pay for the transfer.  Legal Colorado transfer will be required, so don't bother contacting me if you're a felon or illegal alien.  I will give a satisfaction guarantee through your first time at the range, up to 30 days.  If you don't like it, I will refund your full purchase, less $14 for the two transfers.  More pics available on request."

I purchased this setup in December '14. The rifle it was mounted to was only taken out and shot three times, for a total of less than 200 rounds. There are a couple small cosmetic scratches on the top right of the sight. They are hardly noticeable, and much more pronounced in some of the attached pictures due to lighting.

The Rail Light Mount fits on any standard 1913 Picatinny Rail, is available in Right or Left side models, and integrates with the Magpul XTM panels. It positions the weapon light high and cantilevered forward, at the 11 o'clock or 1 o'clock position, to allow a more forward support hand position, keep the light tucked in close to the bore, and to minimize barrel shadow. A textured thumb ramp is integrated to provide the user an index point, aiding consistent hand placement and light activation. Constructed of reinforced polymer, the Rail Light Mount nearly eliminates light compatibility concerns by conveniently including everything you need to mount Surefire 300 and 600 series Scout Lights, 1913 Picatinny attachment pistol lights, and all light bodies from 0.75"" to 1.03"" in diameter via the included set of anodized aluminum mounting rings. Models are available to position the light high at 11 o'clock (LT, Left side model) or one o'clock (RT, Right side model)."

 From Petersonshunting.com article  comparing the .223 with the 22-250 for Varmint Hunting:   http://www.petersenshunting.com/gear-accessories/versus/versus-best-coyote-caliber/
The .22-250 carries over 550 ft-lbs of energy at 500 yards, opposed to the .223, which carries only 402 ft-lbs at best. As the late, great, legendary Jack O’Connor taught, speed kills (especially on thin-skinned predators). Where less-than-perfect hits are concerned, more is better.

Known for inherent accuracy and for being mild-mannered to handload, the .22-250 has one other advantage: During these crazy times of frenzied buying and ammo hoarding, it’s much easier to find on store shelves than .223 ammo.

Protest all you want. There’s no denying the facts. The .22-250 shoots flatter, hits harder, and is more accurate than the .223. Factor in those better hits, coupled with more impact authority,  and this cartridge makes more dead predators. Ditch the .223 and opt for the bigger, stronger, superior .22-250 Remington. — Joseph von Benedikt"

Probably has 300 rounds through it. I am the second owner. The first guy put a yoDave trigger kit in it and the trigger pull is somewhere around a pound with no takeup or creep. Not sure if he did anything else, but it is fantastic. He said he never shot it. (Built it up for a grandchild that turned out to be right handed). 
Gun is a tackdriver with the right ammo. I can routinely get 5 rounds under an inch at 100yds with wolf match, and at 50 they just make a ragged hole. The bulk stuff (winchester 55 or federal automatch) is not as good, but I can keep 10+ rounds in a quarter with most ammo at 50yds. Stock has a ding in the passenger side of the but stock, and there are a couple small scratch on the tang. There is also a tiny spot on the bolt handle where the bluing was worn off. I have photographed all 3 spots. see pictures here   http://imgur.com/a/m36Yh#0

Other than those 3 blemishes, the gun is in perfect condition. I have a sightron s1 hunter 4-12x40 with the HHR reticle mounted on it in warne rimfire rings right now, and it is wearing a caldwell bipod that is NOT INCLUDED.

Selling this CZ in order to buy a different cz. I find that even though I am left handed, when shooting off a bench only, I wish I had a right handed bolt gun instead of a left. So I am willing to sell the rings and scope with the gun, but I would just re-buy them for myself, so they would be sold at replacement cost.  $35 for the rings. 140 for the scope."

On the armslist forum and others this seems to be an ongoing issue for many since about May this year but myself and others I know have just begun experiencing this mess in the last day or two.
If you are also having issues you probably wont be able to even get a glimse of this ad being the popups and redirects happen almost instantly and contniue every few seconds and all one can do is back up to get to main armslist page to start all over only to have the issue start again immediately. Those that can read this who are not having issues please contact armslist as well to resolve this issue. Its either a government hack or a antigun hacker or group so please contact armslist for the sake of all of our 2nd amendment rights."
