I purchased this rife when AR's were scarce and ammo was almost impossible to find. This rifle is in New Condition and cleaner than clean. I paid a lot more than I am asking so please don't bother offering less. Sorry but I am not interested in trading it for anything but cash. I will only sell to a VA resident with valid DL or active duty military with orders. 
It comes in the original box with all packing material, Ergo Grip & OEM pistol grip, 4 unopened 20 round Magpul magazines, Sling, Firearm Lock and Manual. It does not include the 5.56 conversion kit.

Be it prairie dog hunting in Texas, whitetail hunting in Maine or elk hunting in Colorado, the Colt LE901-16S™ is the rifle for the hunt. Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!

It was a display gun I did last year to demo the marine grade finish. 
The slide, barrel and small parts are heavy nickle boron plated, in including slide stop, pins,ect. 
The grip is stippled and trigger guard trimmed to prevent ""glock knuckle"" and allow a ""deeper"" close to bore axes grip. 
Somewhere along the way one of my lovely customers knocked the plastic front sight off, but that's as much wear and tear it has. 
I've sold my gunsmithing business and I'm not really a Glock person. 
What makes the gun marine grade is the particular NiB plating I use is totally impervious to pretty much anything.

I shoot it on very rare occasions and about 75 rounds total have been fired through it and I clean it after every use. I use Hornady Superformance 308 150-165gr ammo and I have tried 308 Winchester ammo and have noticed that the rifle performs much better with the Superformance ammo. I have 20 rounds of Hornady 150gr and 20 rounds of 165gr and 15 rounds of 308 Winchester ammo that will be accompanying the sale of the rifle. I also have the OE pistol grip and buttstock with the adjustable/interchangeable recoil pads and cheek pads, hard case, two 10 round magazines and two 20 round magazines, and owners manual. The reason I am selling it is because I dont shoot it that often and would like to get something different like a Savage 10 FCP-SR magazine fed with threaded fluted 24 inch barrel.

I fired about 8 magazines through it. It has a great trigger for an affordable firearm. It will outshoot my glock 23. Recoil is manageable due to the weight of the pistol. Makes for a nice truck gun, it wont hurt as bad as losing a $500 pistol if someone steals it. 
Affordable and DEPENDABLE home defense. Loads of keyboard warriors love to dump on the hi point but notice they never talk about them jamming, because they do not. I only have a few rounds through this one but it never had a hiccup, not once. I would not hesitate to grab this pistol if i heard something go bump in the night.

The action on this revolver has been hand tuned by Smith's performance center gunsmiths. It is the smoothest double action pull I have seen on any firearm, period. Google it and read up, it is well worth the extra money.
Included are the factory box, factory basketweave grips are installed but am including a pair of hogue boot grips if you dont want to out any wear on those beautiful factory grips. Also am including 136 rounds of +p hollow points, 50 rounds of lead round nose practice rounds, and 5 rounds of defensive ammo. 
Also included is a very comfortable Desantis ankle holster, looks new, only used two or three times. 
Round count on this is 64. I hate to sell it but i am raising money for a new bolt gun, got to make some cuts to the collection.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

For sale is a Sig Sauer P226 Stainless Elite 9mm with factory case, 2 mags that came with it, lock still in plastic and the instruction manual (everything that came with the gun when I bought it).  The gun has approximately 500 rounds through it, is extremely accurate and has been babied.  I've had it for less than a year and love it but want to switch to a standard alloy frame due to the weight savings.  The picture is of the actual item, and it's priced to sell at hundreds below what I bought it for.  I'm the original owner and bought it new.  There is minimal wear and tear in the usual areas but no major scratches anywhere on the pistol.  See below for description from Sig's website and please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.  Armslist would only allow me to upload one photo, but I have more available if interested.

From manufacturer's website:
How do you improve on the world’s best pistol? By adding enhanced ergonomics and new features including an enhanced trigger system with an astounding short reset. The new P226® Elite Stainless is the next generation P226 and features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, custom wood grips and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The P226 Elite is available in 9mm, or .40 S&W."

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.
