The finish is worn, but mechanically it is in perfect condition; I had planned on cleaning it up and chopping it down to defense length and swapping to a barrel length tube.

An original, full-size steel Desert Eagle. It is very accurate and boasts 6"" barrel length. The recoil is much more manageable and practical than the .50AE. Comes with 1 ProMag magazine, cerakoted on magazine base in sniper green. The original magazine is also included. Gun only cycles the gas-operated piston with 270-grain or larger loads. 240-grain do not cycle this piston. You could also buy it as a collector item. There are no nicks or dings on this gun. It just sits in my safe 99% of the time. No box included. No trades. Sale will be done at a mutually agreed upon location at an FFL dealer. Buyer pays FFL fee.- 16 rounds of 270-grain Speer Gold Dot .44 magnum ammo sold for $16"

There are three models, TP9, TP9 SA, and TP9 V2. This is the TP9. In my (and many others) opinion the TP9 and TP9 V2 are better than the TP9 SA. When you de-cock the TP9 SA the double action doesn’t work unless you rack the slide again. It makes no sense.
The Canik 55 TP9 (pronounced Janik by the Turks that make it) is a clone of the Walther P99 without the cost."

Also the butt pad has been changed out to an aftermarket pad, everything else on the gun is original. It has a few knicks in the wood and a few spots in the blueing. I would rate the gun at 80% however I have it priced reflecting $100 under the book value for a gun in 60% condition due to the sights and butt pad not being original.

A continuous picatinny rail on top provides the rail real estate for sights and accessories.

This in no way effects the ballistic panels themselves. The vest is an XL. If you're really small, it isn't going to fit you well. But it is adjustable, so I don't know. Price is firm.

This is a Variant 1 which means it has the safety and de-cocker lever. The USP is also a conventional single/ double action semi-auto handgun with a hammer and is not striker fired. 

The USP is a German made pistol that has durability and quality that is superior to most pistols. They were designed to deliver outstanding accuracy and reliable performance through the harshest conditions of warfare. The USP is the civilian version of the famous H&K Mark 23 which was developed for the US SOCOM in the 1990's and with a suppressor, they are an essential weapon for clandestine SEAL offensive operations. In the movie ""Tears of the Sun"", which is as authentic a Navy SEAL mission movie as I have seen, they show the Mark 23 being used in its quintessential role as they take down a larger force by surprise attack in close quarter battle as they were in the process of ""ethnically cleansing"" and entire village.

The barrel is cold hammer forged and has polygonal rifling which in the application of a military sidearm, is superior to conventional grooved rifling providing less friction to the bullets passage through the barrel which adds to the amazing durability of the USP. In torture testing, USP's have proven capable of exceeding 90,000 rounds of service! 

This H&K USP is offered with the original case, owner's manual and 2 magazines. This pistol has been a safe queen and has had at most 200 rounds fired through it.

Description as follows:
The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight."

- Fiber Optic Dual Line Sight System Optimized for fast-handling balance/instinctive pointing
- Ultrareliable Inertia Driven semiautomatic bolt system
- Comes with three choke tubes and a choke-tube wrench
- 4+1 capacity for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells
- Weighs only 6.5lbs!!

The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System. The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.

Comes with all the chokes and even a very TIGHT EXTRA FULL turkey choke that sticks out the barrel 2 inches.

Also includes a full set of custom Buttstock shims to allow adjustment in length, as well as side-to-side and Up/Down.

It is exactly as it came from the factory... has never been fired or even cleaned... whatever protective coating they put on them at the factory is still on it.  It includes 3 15-rd mags, genuine tritium night sights, 3 sizes of interchangeable grip side panels and 3 sizes of backstraps, so the grip is very adjustable to fit different shooters... speedloader, lock, case, etc.  I have the small setup in it right now because my hands are small.  I will also include a box (20 rds) of Hornady Critical Defense ammo and a box (50 rds) of Winchester 115 gr   JHP ammo and will include an unopened can of Shooters Choice CLP since I won't need it anymore.  These pistols are arguably one of the best semi-autos ever made... the Glock-style trigger is lighter and sweeter than a Glock in my opinion.  I am elderly and have arthritis in my hands... that's one of the reasons I bought it... it is possibly the easiest 9mm to rack I've ever held in my hands... virtually everone is out of stock on this pistol with the tritium night sights... a few of the cheaper versions are still available, but at premium prices now since our federal government pushes for more stringent hoops to make us jump thru... you can buy this one and actually come and hold it in your hands and actually try the trigger... you can't do that online and also must pay shipping fees and transfer fees... if you want one of the best 9mm pistols made, call Al in Bartlesville @ nine one eight- three three six- 8 zero 33    the date in the pic is not correct... It was stored in the camera I used... I bought the pistol new in Oct 2015.   The only trade I might consider is a very good utility trailer."

I will make sure it goes to a good home. First, it has a story. I got this from a close family friend after my high school graduation. His father picked it off of the first German soldier he killed in Italy. He used something to mark the butt of the rifle with a ""K"" for his last name. It's lightly done and was most likely a pencil or maybe even a rock and grease. It's dark, but doesn't distract from the wood quality and to me, it adds that personalized touch of the soldier. During downtime, he disassembled the rifle and mailed it back to his mother. He survived the war and reassembled the rifle once back in the states. I also have a double sided nazi flag that he brought back as well. I truly hate to lose this piece of my collection, but I need to do some home upgrades. It is a BCD manufacture, which is a bit rarer. The date of manufacture is 1944 where BCD is followed by the digit ""4"" instead of ""44"". Manufacturer is Gustloff Werke Weimar (first use of the single-digit year stamp). Bore is bright and mint condition. Wood is in great shape showing natural colors in the grain. Action is tight. Parts are clean. Stamps abound and all serial numbers match. This is truly a safe queen. NEVER reblued and never import stamped. I'll provide the name of the soldier to the buyer. Thank you."
