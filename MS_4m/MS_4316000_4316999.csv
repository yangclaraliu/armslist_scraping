Text John @ 513-Two2Five-081Zero

Back when the West was still wild and the rifle was the tool of choice for survival and frontier justice, the venerable .44-caliber put more meat on the table and outlaws in the ground than any other bullet.

The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles.

Choose from .44 Magnum, .45 Colt and .357 Magnum. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition.
Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy.

They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle.

Big Boy with optional scope
Each Big Boy receiver comes drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting, and the barrels are fitted with fully adjustable sights
The traditional 20″ octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds.

Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today.

The .44 Magnum can also shoot .44 special rounds.

This gun was definitely used as a hunting rifle by at least one of its previous owners but looks like it was taken care of for most of its life. The bluing is great as there are only a few spots worn off mostly on the front sight. The stock has some dings and is worn a bit in one spot but is in very good condition. The action is very tight just like this model is known for and the rifling is still strong. The scope is a weaver 330. It has 90% bluing and the glass is 95% clear except for a slight crack on the right side. If you are a collector or just interested in building a custom rifle with ""The Cadillac of Enfields"" than you should definitely look at the history of this rifle and what people have said about it.

I am most interested in trading this gun for $500 cash and another gun or two. The cash price for the gun is $1700 obo. I am very open to all sorts of trades."

There were reasons for that, and the reasons are evident on close inspection of this 92FS Pistol. Until 1985 or so, Colt and Browning 9mms would not handle hollowpoints. Smith & Wesson 39 and 59 series pistols would, but the Smiths did not capture the market's imagination, perhaps due to the feel of the 59. Here was a pistol that looked good, felt good, and would handle sharp-nosed Federal and Smith & Wesson Hollowpoint ammo. It was, and is, extremely simply made, very easy to field strip and clean. This particular 92FS is factory number JS92F300, Italian made like the originals with characteristic slick Beretta finish throughout. Action is traditional single- and double action, with lock-down, decocking ambidextrous safety levers mounted on the slide. Barrel is 4.9 inch chrome lined. Sights are rapid resolution 3 dot. Capacity is 15 plus 1, and the pistol comes with a total of two factory magazines. Weight empty is a well-balanced, easy handling 33.4 ounces.

The Ingram, the parent pistol, was invented in 1964 by Gordon Ingram and his Military Armament Corporations and variants of it saw service with Special Operations in Viet Nam and in domestic law enforcement applications in the United States and throughout the world. S.W. Daniel Company in Marietta Georgia began production of a semi-auto version in the late 1970s, but BATF stopped production in 1982 because the pistols fired from an open bolt and were too easy to convert. This variant follows current production M11 Closed Bolt pistols. It takes some strength to operate the bolt on this type pistol to begin with, so this is not a gun for the weak of hand. Manufacturer and warrantor is Masterpiece Arms of Comer, Georgia. Factory number is MPA10TCA, and this pistol was manufactured in 2014, its final year of production on this variant. Construction is entirely steel, except for the polymer backstrap grip piece and safety lever; and the anodized alloy dual slot short Picatinny rail forward of its trigger. Chambering is .45 ACP Caliber; each pistol comes with a new factory 30 shot all steel magazine, so 30 + 1 fully loaded capacity. This pistol accepts US M3 Grease Gun Magazines that are still plentiful throughout the country, and usually less than $30 apiece. Barrel is 7 inches overall length, with 4 inches of six groove right hand 1:16 rifling, and 3 more inches of permanently attached muzzle brake. The brake is what makes this variant unique. This pistol weighs 6 pounds 2 ounces. Overall length is 11 7/8 inches; and height is 9 inches with magazine inserted. Finish is military style matte blue. Sights, unlike the early models, is hood protected windage adjustable white outline alloy block rear, and SKS type elevation adjustable front white dot tipped. Each pistol comes in its factory hard shell lined case with inspection card, instruction manual, and factory flyer. This pistol is a discontinued variant that was legal, with certain modifications, in California until December of 2014 when California law stopped its importation in any form. MPA graciously sent us the parts to convert it back to standard configuration, and it is all brand new and all factory. An original transferable Ingram commands pricing in the 5 figure range. SWDs and Semi-Auto Ingrams have recently sold for upwards of $1,000 apiece. We're offering the M-10 type MPA10T in the photo or one of its identical mates, however, for only $ 419.00. 2% Discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & not Credit Card.

Pistol will come with a total of 3 twelve round mags, and everything from the factory, as well as Talon grips. I'm asking $550 for all. To put it into perspective, I just spent three hundred on the exact trigger, sights, and Talons for my shield, so it's like you are paying $250 for the gun.....

(NYSE: RGR) is excited to introduce the Ruger® SR1911® Lightweight Commander-Style pistol; an aluminum frame version of the popular SR1911 Commander-Style pistol. This new model features a black anodized aluminum frame with a satin stainless finish on the slide, resulting in an attractive two-tone appearance in a gun that weighs 7oz. less than the all stainless steel version. It comes factory equipped with an integrated, polished titanium feed ramp and features thin, hardwood grip panels for concealed carry, as well as front strap serrations for improved grip. Ruger engineers took a hard look at how they could utilize new materials to improve the performance of the aluminum-framed 1911. Most aluminum frame pistols tend to show excessive wear on the feed ramp, particularly when shooting modern hollow-point ammunition. This can result in unreliable feeding and may be expensive to correct. The new SR1911 Lightweight Commander-Style pistol comes factory equipped with an integrated polished titanium feed ramp for a lifetime of reliable performance. Since entering the 1911 market in 2011, Ruger has quickly become known for producing some of the best quality 1911's available today. These American-made, CNC machined, series-70 design 1911's come standard with many features typically found only in custom manufactured pistols. All SR1911's feature Novak LoMount Carry 3-dot sights, a lowered and flared ejection port, and a titanium firing pin. In addition, each Ruger SR1911 features a precision barrel and bushing which are machined to match from the same piece of bar stock. The frames have an integral plunger tube, beaver-tail grip safety, oversized magazine release, extended thumb safety and a skeletonized hammer and trigger for fast, accurate shooting. All of this, without the price tag of a custom gun. With the addition of this aluminum frame, commander-style model to the SR1911 line, customers now have a lightweight carry option with the rugged reliability of a Ruger. The SR1911 Lightweight Commander-Style pistol features a 4.25"" barrel and weighs 29.3 oz. with an empty magazine. It ships with two 7-round magazines, a bushing wrench, cable locking device, and a soft case.

Japanese Katana

Excellent Condition
Does show some aging, however considering its age I feel it is

It could be older but I am taking the “safe” road and calling it post WW2
The blade appears to be “folded” steel with temper lines going up into the tang. Also instead of being “smooth” they have the correct appearance of handmade (cured), rather than machine made.
File marks on the Tang also indicate this. Makers Marks on the Tang, however I never did find out anything about what they are.
Guard, Tsuba, is metal and looks like metal inlay of copper or brass.
Scabbard, Saya is two piece wood covered with copper and etched with birds and flowers.

This is a very nice Katana I picked up about 7-8 years ago and had in my “cave”. But I have a couple other things I want to do so I decided that I would let it go.
Needless to say I am not desperate to sell it and I think I have a more than reasonable price.

Magazine is full length steel, holds up to 7 each 2 3/4 inch shells, or 6 each 3 inch; fully loaded capacity is 7 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch. This shotgun will accept Mossberg 500 barrels whose lugs are positioned for a 7 shot magazine, 18 3/4 inches clearance between the receiver and the lug. Stock and forend are graphite based black synthetic. Forend is classic corn cob police type. Buttstock length of pull measures 14 1/2 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch recoil pad, with a 3/4 inch right hand cant.

The rifle quickly became a feared and effective symbol of the German Army. Ancestor to the G3, HK91 series rifles, the STG44 is one of the most prized collectable firearms in the world. Here is American Tactical Import’s very close rimfire clone of the legendary STG44. Manufacturer is German Sport Guns GMbH of Ense-Höingen, Germany. Importer and Warrantor is American Tactical Imports, formerly of Rochester, NY now located in Summerville South Carolina. Construction is principally heavy Zinc alloy, with steel barrel liner, port cover, perforated forend, bolt assembly, springs and internal parts. Metal finish is semi-gloss matte blue. Pistol grip panels are wood, or wood colored polymer, and buttstock is stained hardwood. Barrel length is 16.5 inches with correctly calibrated metric rear long range sight and hooded post front sight. Weight empty is a correct 9 1/2 pounds. Overall length is 37 inches. Magazine is correctly colored polymer construction with steel springs, and magazine capacity is 25 rounds of .22 Long Rifle caliber high velocity ammunition. Each rifle comes in its factory cardboard box with instruction manual, GSG decal, cable lock, chamber protector, ATI catalog, and factory-importer registration card. Please note that the registration card should be mailed to 231 Deming Way, Summerville, SC 29483 and not to Rochester NY. Replacement pricing on an original STG44 will run into five if not six figures. The first import batch of these rifles that came in 3 years ago brought over $500 apiece. We’re offering the authentic looking, functional, well made clone in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 339.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Chicago Cook County IL, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction with “Any Two” laws that affect rimfire rifles. For buyers in jurisdictions where the rifle is civilian legal but its magazines are not, $20 off with no magazine, includes California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Colorado, and Maryland.

Photos are representative on this listing, but buyer will receive a virtually identical specimen, at least as good as the photos. Dealers, departments, and collectors, however, may take any similar P83s we have on hand at the same per-pistol price, and with no additional shipping charges. Photos show one of relatively few Polish Radom model P-83s Wanad pistols to come into the country. These are well made steel frame compact pistols on the order of the Mauser HSC. Manufacturer is Lucznik Arms Factory of Radom, Poland. Manufacture dates on the ones we have ranged between 1987 and 1989. Importer is PW Arms, marking on the left side of the slide. The P83 served with the Polish military in the Gulf War and in the Balkans, from its introduction in 1983 until its replacement some 17 years later. These served in Southwest Poland, Dolnoslaskie Province. Type is double- and single-action blowback semi-auto pistol. Construction is entirely vanadium steel metal, with dark semi gloss blue finish. Chambering is 9x18, 9mm Makarov. This pistol will Not chamber or digest 9mm Luger caliber ammunition. We have Russian 9mm Makarov ammunition readily available. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch, four groove right hand 1:9.83 rifling. Slide is serrated rear, .965 wide with axial dovetailed blade front sight and drift only windage adjustable dovetailed rear steel sight. Safety is slide mounted on the left side, for a right handed shooter. It serves as a decocker with some effort, and the P-83 safety is opposite from a Walther. Fire is down and safe is forward. The P83 does not have a firing pin safety or magazine safety. Double Action Trigger pull is 15 pound vicinity with 1 inch travels, and single action is 6 pound area with 1/2 inch travel and moderate felt creep. Overall length is 6 1/16 inches from the muzzle to the edge of the grip frame strut. Height is 4 3/4 inches from the top of the rear sight to the lowest portion of the magazine floorplate. Trigger is .310 serrated face alloy, with .360 serrated spur steel hammer. Photo specimen pulled at 15 pounds double action, and 6 pounds single action, two stage with moderate felt creep; 1 inch travel on double action and half that on single action. Disassembly is steyr style, with a drop down disassembly plate positioned forward of the trigger. Weight empty is 25 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the slide stop. Magazine is factory Radom, holds 8 rounds of 9x18 Makarov Caliber ammunition, 8+1 total loaded capacity. Magazine release is on the butt, European style. Holster is genuine leather with cleaning tool inside and with an extra magazine compartment. Surface detractions are moderate, with occasional whitening from holster contact and occasional finish freckling. We rate these pistols as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Bore, chamber and mechanism are all bright and clean. From our inspection, we estimate these pistols have been fired fewer than 500 rounds. We're offering this top quality Radom Makarov in the photos, or one of its virtually identical mates, for only $ 239.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts.

(was purchased and stored in safe).  She is chambered in .308 Winchester/7.62x51 NATO, and comes with 3 20rd Mags, Quality Inspection Sheet, Manual, Lock, and Proprietary PTR Hard Case.  I am sure most are aware of PTR Industries moving to Aynor, SC from Connecticut, their reasons behind that move, and the production of this series to commemorate said move, but I am attaching links to literature about that, and the specs of the rifle.  Obviously, she is a very low serial numbered rifle (SC0031...Governor Haley was given SC0001), and is considered 100%.  Priced to sell at $1100.   I prefer to sell, but would entertain quality single or multiple gun trades greater than $1200 that can move quick, and yield ME more cash in the end. That way, you get what you want without pulling out cash, and I get the opportunity to further fund our family Disney Vacation, since we cut up all of our credit cards!

I choose the 6.8mm over the 5.56 or 7.62 for a variety of reasons. It is a heavier bullet and you get a better kill shot if you have to go through a little brush or your shot is off just a bit. I'd also rather have it with wild hogs than the 5.56.
I put an AIM 2.5X10X40 higher end scope on it with an added green laser. These have been bore sighted but no rounds have been fired through the gun yet. I've stockpiled 180 rounds of ammo for it in an ammo can.
I am selling this sweat rifle because I've had some very unexpected expenses and am in need of some rapid cash. I cannot give the gun away but it is going to feel like it to me after all the time and work in selecting parts and assembling it using the American Gunsmithing Institute's AR 15 Armorer's Course and AR 15 Trigger Job Course. I also have two mags for it and a good soft AR 15 case.

It’s in excellent shape, having been maintained by department armorers, showing the minor wear of a working, issued weapon. It's a good example of what during it's day was considered a ""top line"" police sidearm and is a good buy for someone who collects police/military firearms.
** will ship to any verifiable FFL in the lower 48 states via UPS Ground for a $30 flat rate. It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain if this weapon is legal to possess in their jurisdiction and to follow all Federal, state and local laws **"

It is marked ""The Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre"" (French for National Factory of Weapons of War). It is a German Occupational Army pistol with matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel. Both also have the Nazi Eagle over Swastika proof marks and designation of AaW140. A great piece of history with matching serial numbers. I have shot this pistol and it shoots like a dream. After shooting it I took it down and gave it a very thorough cleaning.
This was likely removed from a soldier and brought to America years ago. Someone during that period had it a gunsmith nickel their trophy, and that is great because you can tell this was done during that time period and not a recent nickel job, making this more authentic to the real story. What a conversation piece!

BROWNING HISTORIAN: After contacting Glen, the Browning historian it was determined these pistols were produced for the German Occupational Army between 1940-1944. With limited records, it is difficult to determine the exact date.

PROOF MARKINGS: The frame is marked with the German Eagle over swastika. Also the WaA140 acceptance mark, and the right side has the serial number “156949”. The barrel is marked with an “Eagle” and “156949” and the WaA140.

GRIPS: These appear to the be correct walnut grips in authentic condition for their age. Checkering still present and in good condition. Has some dings etc as expected from an authentic pistol of this vintage.

SLIDE: Slide is in reasonable condition for it's age. Serial numbers match the frame and the barrel.


BARREL: Approximately 4 3/4"" barrel with good bore and rifling.


ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was test fired and worked well for me.


MAGAZINE: This appears to be the correct slotted base magazine.


HISTORY: FN commissioned John Browning to design a new military sidearm conforming to this specification. Browning had previously sold the rights to his successful M1911 U.S. Army automatic pistol to Colt's Patent Firearms, and was therefore forced to design an entirely new pistol while working around the M1911 patents. Browning built two different prototypes for the project in Utah and filed the patent for this pistol in the United States on June 28, 1923 and granted on February 22, 1927.[5][6] One was a simple blowback design, while the other was operated with a locked-breech recoil system. Both prototypes utilized the new staggered magazine design (by designer Dieudonné Saive) to increase capacity without unduly increasing the pistol's grip size or magazine length. By 1931, the Hi-Power design incorporated a shortened 13-round magazine, a curved rear grip strap, and a bar."

If you have not heard of this brand, check it out with the links I have provided. Core 15 provides the best warranty in the industry on their rifles: If anything is wrong, they will fix it. No matter how many rounds have been fired, no matter which owner you are, they will make it right. Period. The rifle is great quality, but has a few signs of use on the buffer tube and upper receiver. I have so far fired 600 rounds from it. The count is low as I have been focusing too much on subguns like the MP5. The rifle was purchased for about $1150 after taxes and before upgrades.

Here are the great upgrades: First upgrade was I added a Tapco sling mount (12$) on the buffer tube so you can attach slings. Second upgrade way I replaced the polymer Magpul tri-rail system with a free float Troy Alpha rail to improve accuracy (This was professionally done, all and all about 230$). This rail system allows for any sort of rail configuration and I have two more rails not currently mounted that are included. Third upgrade was I replaced the polymer Magpul flip up sight with a metal flip up Troy Battle sight (100$).

 The rifle also comes with a Magpul AFG and a hard case. Additionally I have extra magazines and ammo.

The bow is in excellent shape, and is extremely fast and accurate!

Last year I had a new Hammerhead string installed and tuned (timed, synched) by Atlantic Game and Tackle, but haven't hunted with the bow at all since then. I got it sighted in over 2 range days, and that's all. The slide was replaced as well as the arrow rest (whisker biscuit) and the dampener. They also set me up with 4 brand new arrows. The bow is 60-70 lbs draw weight, 26-30"" draw length, 32.25"" ATA, 7"" BH, and rated at 335-345 fps IBO. The bow is currently set at 70 lb draw weight with 80% let off (also adjustable), and 29"" draw length.

The bow comes with a brand new Flambeau hard case, a quiver, 4 new carbon arrows, a Copper John Dead Nuts 2 sight, a new Whisker Biscuit arrow rest, a release, built in limb savers (riser dampeners and arrow shelf dampener), and a ShotBlocker Pro Shot target that can handle both field points and broadheads.

This is a great setup, but I just haven't been hunting recently and don't see myself getting to go much in the future. This is great for anyone looking to get into the bowhunting game, or someone looking to upgrade to a faster bow (believe me, this bow is FAST).

We built this glock at the shop for an advertisement piece, I hate to let a 2500 dollar firearm sit there so she is up for grabs. I do framework and stippling for as my profession so a grip package can also be negotiated in the sale. his glock is 100% not stock. I own ""the precision element"" where we customize and stipple polymer firearm frames. We built this glock with the anticipation of using it as an adverse mentioned piece in the shop. 2500 dollars later and about 30 hours of build time and tune time I just can't justify the investment. Framework and stippling can be negotiated into the price or trade value of this firearm. Ideally what I would like to do is TRADE this glock 34 the way it sits for a benelli m2 20g AND a quality ar15 I can use for 3 gun. Will consider any and all trades. You can text me directly to my phone with trade offer at REDACTED. Trade value must be realistic and respectable between 2200-2600 dollars. My FINA NCIS investment in this firearm is 2500 not counting the man house it took to machine everything and tune/build it. Here is the list of mods:

well that went kind of backwards. But u get the picture. Tried to.copy and paste list of mods and it screwed it all up. All in all. She is a beast. Fired a mag through her for testing. Nothing went untouched that needed love. Let me know

 Once in a great while, a firearm becomes so popular that it becomes a cultural icon. Like a great car or movie, a great firearm can become a true classic. The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. More than ever, the PPK is a statement of sophistication   
The Walther PPK pistol is a blowback-operated semi-automatic pistol made famous by the James Bond movies. Today, PPK pistols are manufactured by Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen in Germany or under license from Walther in France and the United States. These pistols feature an exposed hammer, a double-action trigger mechanism, a single-column magazine, and a fixed barrel which also acts as the guide rod for the gun's single recoil spring.
 The Walther PPK pistol is essentially similar to the larger PP pistol, except for the different design of the grip frame – the grip backstrap is integral to the frame and grip panels are two separate items (left and right) on the PP, while on the PPK the grip frame has a rectangular shape of a magazine channel and the backstrap is formed by the single-piece U-shaped grip unit, also usually made of plastic."
