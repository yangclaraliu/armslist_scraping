I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat Firearms, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat Firearms, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat Firearms, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

If you have any questions or if you would like prices don't hesitate to Text or Call me I am more than happy and willing to help and answer any questions you have. If I have to disassemble and reassemble there is a extra charge of $30-$75 depending on how hard the gun is to disassemble. Thank you for your time I greatly appreciate it. Chris: 513-309-9042 or.

 Here is a scarce Navy Arms Harpers Ferry flintlock pistol in 58 cal.

A blast to shoot and correct for War of 1812 re-enactors through the Mountain Man Rendezvous era and beyond.

Pedersoli made this one for the old Navy Arms Co...they demanded quality in everything. This one has the desireable plum brown finish. This is still being produced
for Dixie Gun Works with a God awful brushed chrome finish (yuk) and I don't think the fit and finish is near as good. The screws even line up on this one!

Bore is shiny and lock works great. It could use a new flint. I don't have one that size or I would replace it.

Comes with about 40 or so .570 Hornady swaged balls and a almost new 58 cal  brass jag.  

Dixie is currently getting $565.00 plus shipping on this model.

You can have this one which is far more desireable for $300.00 FTF cash.

Also can ship for $15.00 USPS Priorty Mail upon receipt of Postal Money Order. (Minus the ammo).

Will NOT ship to Kalifornia of New Jersey...please don't ask.

I will hold your money order until you notify me you are pleased with item. You pay return shipping and return in same condition unfired."

328,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4839328,"For Sale:  Hogan H-223 18"" Designated Marksman","Snohomish, King, Skagit Counties, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,599","Listed On: Friday, December 11, 2015",Rifles,Patriot Ordinance Factory                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have for sale a Hogan H-223 18‚Äù barreled ‚ÄúDesignated Marksman‚Äù rifle.  Hogan used to manufacture all of POF-USA‚Äôs rifles before the two companies parted ways.  Hogan Guns holds the patent on these rifles, so they kept manufacturing them, only now under their own brand name.  I‚Äôm asking $1599.00 and I‚Äôll pay the transfer fee for you.   These rifles sell for $2399.00 new, and that is without the upgrades that I have done to it.  ** I was digging through my safe and found a complete spare Hogan piston replacement kit (piston, gas plug, and oprod) that is brand new.  Highly doubtful that you will ever need it, but I always looked at it as an insurance policy.  Spare parts for every weapons system is a great idea.  These are normally valued at around $175.00.  I'm not going to have a need for it and would rather not try and list it separately.  So, if you want the kit, add either $50.00 to the total cost, or you pay the transfer fee and it's yours.  **

This Hogan Designated Marksman Rifle come‚Äôs with a few modifications, a Larue Tactical RISR, Ergo Grip, Magpul CTR Stock, a Daniel Defense rail mounted sling socket, and Diamond Head BUIS.  I‚Äôll give the buyer the choice of triggers and furniture colors.  I am a certified Armorer on the AR platform and will install a Geissele ALG trigger or SSA if you would rather have that than the stock trigger.  I have other options available in my new parts bin that we can discuss if you wish.  I will also give the buyer their choice of colors for furniture.  I have Magpul OD Green that I can swap out as well as Magpul Black.  There is no charge for the equipment swap.  It also comes with one 30 round Magpul PMAG and a black hard case.

This rifle has perhaps a just under a thousand match grade brass cased rounds down the barrel.  That is nothing for this rifle as it‚Äôs going to take you well over a 100k rounds to show any significant wear.  I‚Äôm not sure of the exact number, but I still have a few rounds left from the case I had purchased when I originally bought this rifle, so I know it wasn‚Äôt over that amount.  It‚Äôs a heavy, fluted, Rock Creek barrel that has been ‚ÄúMelonited.‚Äù  Great care has always been taken with this rifle.  Every time a rod went down the barrel, it went through a bore guide to keep the chamber protected.  This rifle has been my safe queen.  It doesn‚Äôt get used much anymore as I have other projects that I‚Äôm currently working on. 

Whether you‚Äôre looking for a 3 Gun Competition rifle, or a rifle to mount a scope to and really reach out at distance, this is the one.  It‚Äôs build to stand the test of time.  Long enough for it to become a family heirloom if that‚Äôs your choice.  These rifles are built with only the best of components.  They aren‚Äôt your average ‚Äústore bought‚Äù rifles.  Hogan‚Äôs are generally built to order as the people that order them are generally serious shooters.  This rifle will outshoot a Sig Sauer, Heckler & Koch, Ruger, Bushmaster, Windham, Patriot Ordinance Factory, etc. as they are custom builds.  

 I‚Äôm not looking for trades at this time, serious buyers only please.

This is a great match rifle, same as the FWB 700 they call it now. If you know competition air rifles you know FWB and this is no exception. Great gun but I'm no longer involved in the sport. The red laminate indicates this is a junior rifle, so the fixed stock is about an inch shorter than the regular. But I have an adjustable extension on the stock so it fits like a full size. Any questions please ask.

This combined with their hand fitting makes this the smoothest racking and running pistol I've ever shot. Their trigger work is amazing as well, breaking around 2-2.5 pounds with no creep or grit. The frame was also done by PRP in a large stipple pattern. The frame was finished off by adding a matching hard chrome colored magwell, which is easily removed if preferred. It comes in the factory hard cas, including all parts as it did factory new. All 3 19 round mags have oversized baseplates. This package also includes the multi weight recoil/striker spring pack from Wolff. These will allow you to tune it to run anything, from under powered competition loads all the way up to heavy defensive type rounds. There was right at $1800 total invested in this package new, but we are only asking $1200 cash total out the door! Why spend hundreds more and wait months to get your hands on a new PRP custom, when you can get this one right now at a fraction of the price. You have to see and shoot this one to appreciate it. We also accept credit card payment, card use forfeits a 3.5% cash discount. Shipping to a local FFL is available, if necessary. All firearm trade offers are welcome and will be evaluated.

Well made with quality parts.  Quality 7.5"" barrel low round count.  Shoots close to MOA at 100 yards...with EoTech 1 MOA red dot sight with no magnification.  I'm sure it would be even more accurate with magnified optic mounted but I never shot it with anything but my EoTech.  This is a great little pistol upper (or SBR).  I am selling because I have multiple 5.56 AR platforms and decided to build a 300blkout upper for this pistol.  I was going to just replace the barrel but as you can tell by the pictures, the upper receiver and the ejection port cover are engraved with 5.56x45mm so I decided to just build another upper and sell this one whole.  You can look up Tripple J Armory, they build with quality milspec parts.  

*I am ONLY selling the UPPER, the picture with the lower is just so you can see how it looks assembled.

*Price listed is for COMPLETE UPPER INCLUDING BCG & CHARGING HANDLE

*Willing to sell without BCG & Charging handle for $150 less if buyer doesn't want those.

Beautiful trap shotgun. Comes with two trap shooting choke tubes.

This model is no-longer in production and will stand out in a row of model 11-87 shotguns.

minor pitting on the bluing on the sides of the receiver if you look closely, easily removable by a gunsmith or by shaving down the sides and either re-bluing or leaving the sides shiny if it bothers you, but it's not a blaring flaw. Barrel, wood, and internal components are in perfect working condition. Price has been discounted accordingly.

I got this when I was getting into trap and it really did see me right. I used it extensively in the 90s and It has a lifetime of competitive level performance in it if you take care of it."

The gas block does need to be changed out but that is an easy fix and doesn't cost much. This one leaks gas pressure. Was going to lock tite it but never had time. Hasn't seen a full mag through it. Pretty firm on price as it does come with goodies. Will throw in a box of tannerite as well (perfectly legal to use and own). Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you!"

The Trijicon AccuPoint 1-6x24 is going to be the scope that gives you that little extra magnification when you need it. After running your carbine all day at 1x you hit that stage where you have stop, breathe, and take that long shot. When you do, you‚Äôll be glad you can dial it up to 6x. Whether the buck comes from the thick forest to your left or the cornfield to your right, you'll have the confidence to take the shot. 
When used at 6x the MOA (Minute of Angle) Crosshair reticle can be used as your personal BDC reticle. Set up your firearm and cartridge in a ballistic calculator and you know exactly where your holdovers should be with the 5 MOA spaced, 1.25 MOA dots. Or use the MOA reticle pattern to size and range your target. Use the fine dot fiber optic and crosshair to set up those critical shots.
Control the brightness of your fiber optic aiming point with the innovative illumination dial and have confidence with your shot placement in low light when the tritium kicks in. Use our 30mm rings or quick release mount to match your firearms platform.

Features 16 inch barrel and short LOP stock, making this the smallest package you can get without going SBR or takedown conversion.

Cerakoted in ""Sniper Grey""

XS Ghost Ring sights, as well as an XS LeverScout rail.

Upgraded aluminum follower which is compatible with Hornady LeverEvolution ammunition.

Rifle retails by itself for about $425.00, Cerakote job, Rail, Sights, and Follower add up to approximately $300 in upgrades.

I love the rifle, the way it looks, the customizations...I just find that I don't much care for lever action rifles.  Looking to sell for $400.00.  I will throw in approximately 50 rounds of Winchester SuperX Deer & Black Bear ammunition, since I have no other rifle I can use it in.

Transaction will follow all State and Federal laws, including (begrudgingly) I-594 transfer laws.

I am in Vancouver, but would not mind driving a little bit to facilitate a transaction with a serious buyer, though you will have to recommend an FFL for the transfer as I only know shops in Vancouver.

Thank you for your interest."

About the Handgun:
This is Sphinx's offering into the sub-compact, blowback, semi-automatic arena. Slightly smaller in general overall dimension than the Walther PPK/S, it also has a larger magazine capacity. Tolerances on this pistol are very tight and quality very high, as with all SPHINX pistols.
About the Manufacturer:
This is a Swiss based manufacturer of high quality pistols used mainly by special forces, elite police units and sports shooters. This machine-tool and engineering company started in the gunmaking business when it acquired gunmaker ITM of Solothurn in 1989, along with the rights to its handgun designs. Sphinx is best known for its ongoing development of the original Czech designed CZ 75 pistol, which has been evolved into the Sphinx 2000 and Sphinx 3000 designs. Sphinx pistols are not mass produced and are fitted to tight tolerances, so Sphinx pistols are more expensive than mass produced products.
About the Cartridge:
Designed by John Browning and introduced by Fabrique Nationale of Belgium, this cartridge has achieved world-wide acceptance and has even been adopted as the standard pistol cartridge by several governments. One reason for the round's success is that it is the largest practical cartridge that can be easily adapted to small automatic pocket pistols. Ballistics fall far short of even the 9mm Luger, but still prove adequate for most self-defense situations. The round has established quite a niche position in this role, often being chosen over more traditional small calibers such as the .25 and .32 Autos."

The Smith & Wesson 686+ has the more versatile round butt grip frame that
can accommodate a wide selection of aftermarket grips to suit any hand
size. With its intermediate size and weight, it is comfortable to grip by
its finger grooved grip. Its overall configuration allows for a good
position of the trigger finger around the narrow smooth trigger. The
narrow, smooth trigger allowed the finger to roll over its surface,
preventing the tendency to pull the sights off target during the long
double action stroke.

Comes with a set of custom Black & Silver grips from gungripsupply that really sets off the BSS along with the factory S&W combat grips. Also comes with all 8 front sight blades that can be changed in a matter of seconds with no tools case locking key still in factory envelope along with build certificate from S&W all housed in a beautiful solid Mahogany and leather display case that's in mint condition as well. The most accurate 44 S&W ever made plus a sought after collector gun. Will trade for items listed below and some will require add cash from you. Thanks for looking.

The Equinox is the balance between day and night. The P220 Carry Equinox is a limited production .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox features gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

The 19c or 19 compensated is no longer made and offers a great deal of controllability over the firearm. Great for ccw and shooting classes. Probably less then 1k rounds but still has glock smile on barrel. All numbers matching.


No glock case - just 2 factory magazines and sidearm. I can include a blank range bag if needed
