Key to this are:An all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. 


FORGED UPPER & LOWER RECEIVERS

Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.

Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.

REDUCED WEIGHT, YET LIGHTER RECOIL

Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.

REDUCED MASS, FORGED, MONOLITHIC BOLT CARRIERWITH FORWARD ASSIST

New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension.

BEVELED MAG WELL

The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes.

IMPROVED BOLT & BARREL EXTENSION

An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.

These 3"" K-frames are regarded by many as the perfect concealed carry .357 Magnum. This reputation was gained on behalf of the size, weight, round butt frame, barrel length, fixed combat sights, stainless steel, and full length ejector rod. The model 65 was one of the last revolvers to see widespread use by Law Enforcement, with the FBI being the most high profile user of these guns. If you intend to carry a .357 IWB, then this is one of the best choices available. For those of you than camp, hike or hunt, the 3"" K-frames make for the perfect Florida woods gun.

This particular gun is in excellent overall condition. This is not a beat-to-hell Police trade-in gun. There are some small nicks here and there, which is normal for a revolver this old. The gun has an estimated 500 rounds through it. There is no evidence of flame cutting on the top strap and the forcing cone looks great. This gun comes with the original factory Magna grips.

Several of these S&Ws, in similar condition, recently SOLD for $700 on Gunbroker. The pre-lock guns have steadily risen in value. They have become highly desirable and their market values have adjusted accordingly. I personally believe these pre-lock S&Ws will continue to rise in value, as Smith and Wesson no longer makes them with this level of parts quality and hand-fitting. Sorry folks, but I won't be trading this one for your Taurus, Ruger, or Grandpa's old single shot. Ridiculous offers that are not even on the same playing field will be ignored. This is a very nice gun that is difficult to find/replace, so I would like to trade for a gun of similar status. I'm not interested in selling it. A high quality revolver from a bygone era in my hands is better than a fist full of cash."

The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that “you mean business”. Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The GLARE MOUT is compact and lightweight."

1941 dated Izhevsk Arsenal SVT 40.  7.62x54R
The ""M1 Garand of the Soviet Union"".
Nice shooter....and Milsurp ammo is still ""cheap"".
If you're tired of working that bolt on the old Mosin Nagant, give this a try. 10 round detachable magazine.

Numbers match on receiver, stock and trigger guard. 
The numbers on the magazine and bolt carrier have been ""electro-scribed"".
Stock has been ""patch worked"" in 3 areas by previous owner (or arsenal). One area on either side of the receiver and an area up at the muzzle end of the stock. Overall, not a bad job. Stain doesn't match but the fit is good.

Not going to ship this. Local sale only. (I'd rather not drive 100 miles for a ""no show"".) I'd prefer selling to a CWP (CCW in some areas) licensee. At least the State has checked your background as I'm unable to.  Price is firm.
More interested in $1,100 cash than a trade and the only trade I'd consider would be for a Ruger N0. 1 in .22-250"

Without the magazine, you can use it as a single-shot rifle, the magazine holds seven (7) rounds. The rifle has a bull barrel with recessed muzzle; the trigger is not adjustable, the front sight is fixed, and the rear sight is a micro-adjustable peepsight text Mossberg S100, Mossberg S133, or Lyman 57 MS (and there may be other sights out there). The barrel is ""lead-lapped"" which is a process (as explained to me) that fills in the micro-cracks in the metal producing a very smooth surface with very little variance or imperfections. It is also very labor intensive and, as a result, expensive. The process is only applied to the most expensive target rifles these days. The rifles from CMP were manufactured 1943-1946."

The DBAL-I² (Dual Beam Aiming Laser – Intelligent) Class 1 IR Laser is the first Mil Spec infrared aiming laser available to the commercial market. Class 1 IR lasers feature a 0.7mW rating which is eye safe and not restricted by the FDA. While this is a lower output than the standard 5mW+ IR lasers used by Warfighters and LE Professionals, it is perfectly adequate for targeting at ranges out to 450 yards. This encompasses most ranges at which users will engage targets during night shooting and training.
Functionally, the DBAL-I² Class1 Laser features two output modes: Visible and IR. The IR Laser is 0.7mW while the visible is a full power Class IIIa laser. The DBAL-I² Class1 is available with either a visible red or visible green laser. The IR pointer is low powered to make it eye-safe, but will perform well out to 450 yards. The pointer is easy to spot and has a good divergence/shape. The IR pointer works well with a separate LED IR Illuminator at distances, but will become a bit harder to see at close range due to the splash back from the illuminator on walls. This is especially true with light-colored walls. However, it is still easily visible for targeting. The IR pointer is more easily seen in darker conditions. Just like visible pointers, the Class1 laser will tend to wash out the closer it gets to another light source."

So, I'd like to see if we can satiate each other's need by conducting a trade... 

MINE: What I have is a beautifully-seasoned M64-style weapon, built on a brand new Assault Weapons of Ohio (AWO) receiver. Deeply rust-blued for durability and expertly-assembled by a S. Oregon gunsmith, famous for his high quality re-welds. Fully 922r compliant. 

Stock and all receiver-internals look brand new. Good bullet test results. Ready for a BHO lever to be installed, if you are so inclined. Flip-up nightsites and grenade-launching gas valve are operational. If you have never handled a milled Yugo AK before, suffice it to say they are built like a tank, heavy-duty, super-durable and can soak up the recoil well making for accurate follow-up shots. This rifle has that look/feel/balance of a fine milled AK. I'd totally keep it if I didn't already have one. 

Package will include a fully-functional BFPU Yugo BHO mag, Yugo sling and proper oiler pouch, Yugo mag pouch with cleaning kit, correct grenade spigot and matching-number (handle/scabbard) Yugo bayonet."

The Century Arms G-1 is a copy of the Fn-Fal that uses surplus parts from metric versions as well as American made parts to comply with US gun laws. Century makes two types of the rifle.  The Century G-1 model is a metric version. All of the controls and internals operate in the same manner as the inch models. The gas system can be regulated by rotating the ring, that is located just behind the front sight. This is a handy arrangement. When other rifles are very dirty or become fouled with sand, mud etc. they have to be cleaned to stay in the fight. With the G-1 you simply adjust the gas system to allow higher gas pressure in the system that allows it to continue working in adverse conditions. With the gas system off rifle grenades can be used. The standard gas setting is set on the number three. The adjustment ring goes from 1 through 9
