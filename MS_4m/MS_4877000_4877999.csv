The fifth Issue Detective Special ran from 1993 and ended in 1995 and was the end to all Colt production of the Detective.

Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Action Semi-Automatic Caliber 45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP) Barrel Length 5.25"" Capacity 13+1 Safety Crossbolt Grips Polymer Sights Fiber Optic front/Adj rear Weight 32 oz Frame Finish Black Frame Material Polymer Gun Type Pistol Slide Finish Stainless Steel"

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   **This is the 24″ Hunter variant, featuring an OD Green synthetic stock and longer 24″ threaded barrel**RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18″ model to be only 26.1″ long, or as much as 14″ shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work “drop free” and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user’s preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1,789.00  FAMILY:RFB SeriesMODEL:RFB CarbineTYPE:RifleACTION:Semi-AutoFINISH:BlueSTOCK/FRAME:Synthetic StockSTOCK/GRIPS:OD Green SyntheticCALIBER/GAUGE:308 WinCAPACITY:20+1BARREL:24″SIGHTS:NoneADDL INFO:Chrome Lined BarrelADDL INFO:Birdcage Flash HiderADDL INFO:FN FAL MAGS"

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*."

ZEV Customs is the highest quality pistol that money can buy in my opinion. The SRS Trijicon red dot is one of the best optics on the planet and paired with the upgraded Glock 17 it becomes the ultimate target pistol. It has an upgraded Dragonfly slide from ZEVwith a match grade barrel KKM with a four port compensator, with the Brazo's side racker, and the mount that mounts the SRS optic is built by ZEV. The grip has been narrowed, the mag release is ZEV's enlarged custom piece, the grip had 100 grit with stippling done to grip and around the Custom Ultimate Fulcrum that can be adjusted to 2 pound or 3.5 pound trigger, the ZEV flared magwell was added.The trigger has a very short reset for faster pull and reset and every part of this gun was customized to the perfect target pistol. The internals of the frame was replaced to tighten the slide up and improve accuracy. I need $2,800 for it and the new SRS Trijicon optic that was almost 1K new. The Zev Glocks are selling for $2600 with no mount and the cheaper RMR Trijicon optic. This gun is a Glock 17 with 34 length upper chambered in 9mm for the ultimate target pistol. Glock's sponsored KC Eusebio had the same setup and won several matches with it. The gun is just plain accurate and easy to shoot fast and stay on target. $2,600 for the gun, 3 zev tuned 22 round mags, hard case Zev range bag, and the optic box to go with the new SRS Trijicon optic. I will post pics of build sheet. I will only take partial trade on Saiga 12 or 410 shotguns only or bone stock or near factory Glock 17 or Glock17L long slide. I will also take bulk 223/556 ammo on trade, Glock 43 9mm, Saiga 12, Vepr 12, Saiga 410, Saiga 223 unconverted, Vepr 223, LWRC IC AR lower, Benelli M4 shotgun, and bulk 9mm ammo. I be willing to trade for a M11 full auto and throw money your way. Thanks for looking REDACTED. I will sell the ZEV Glock minus everything but the SRS Trijicon for $1,750 which is a deal because the cheaper C-MORE optics can be mounted to the mount and bought cheap used and could probably buy one for $250 to $300 for a newer one/demo model and have an open gun for under $2k"

I do not know much about this rifle since it came to me through an inheritance.  The rifle appears to be in good condition and still has some grease type lube on it.  It has been in my humidity and temperature controlled safe for about seven years and I need some room for new weapons.

Gun has only had about three hundred rounds through it.  When I first got it I had the lower sent off for a grip reduction.  I then further modified the lower myself and, long story short, ruined the lower beyond repair.  At that point I took it to the Glock factory in Smyrna and had them match me up a new lower. So now the upper is in the above condition (nearly new) and the lower IS new.  It was tested at the factory and I have all the paperwork on it.  It comes with:
One 9 round factory mag
And one 13 round mag I bought from a G-23
A ""Vedder"" Light Tuc Kydex holster. 
The holster is in excellent condition EXCEPT for one side where I attached some double sided tape and had to clean it off with paint thinner and sandpaper.  It is ONLY asthetic damage and does not affect the performance or comfort while carrying.  
Also comes with original case and all paperwork. 
The biggest selling point on this pistol is the fact that you get three calibers in one. If you don't already know, you can buy interchangeable barrels for this model Glock that will allow you to fire, in addition to the factory 40cal, 357sig and 9mm!  
I LOVE the gun but have too many and need the cash. 
PRICE IS FIRM!  
Will only trade for a like condition Glock 43"

Ordered what I thought was the full size American, all weather. But got a rude awakening when my rifle was in fact the Compact.
However, I cannot get comfortable with this rifle, it's just too short. I have not even fired it yet. It's been thoroughly cleaned,  and oiled. I then added my Burris Fullfield 2 w BDC, Durasight direct mount rings (similar to DNZ hunt master rings), my trusty claw sling and have been tuning the trigger and trying dry fire drills (with a snap cap) and it does not feel comfortable. 
My loss is someone else's gain. 
I still have the factory box, paperwork, and lock. It's band new!

What needs to be done
Truck is complete and in no way a project... But is in need of a front left blinker. I tried to make a custom one but wasn't worth the time to finish. 
Needs a windshield.
Overspray on the wheels from paint needs to be cleaned off.
I always intended in replacing the rear shocks to bring them to par with the front but there is nothing wrong with them.

 I daily drive this truck for a long time and never let me down, has great power and gets decent mileage with the combo of big tires and decent gears. Over the past 7 months I have not driven it more then 50 miles and I hate seeing going unused. Needs tabs. I am sure I am missing something's but it has been very well maintained and I started this build from stock. Keep in mind I am into this truck in tires brakes and suspension the asking price.... Let's make a deal.

$3800 Obo

Pigeon-Skeet combo model Model # A D 4 3 0 6 B. This gun, based on the previous owner, was built for the pigeon competition discipline. Barrel is a 30"" (mea. 29.5) fixed choke style-IM/F. Wood stock is absolutely beautiful. The stock and forearm was up graded to fancy grade walnut by well renowned stock maker Spencer Mayes...way better than any ASE I have ever seen. The butt stock is a Semi-Monte Carlo style with pronounced right hand palm swell and KickEz Butt Pad. Barrel and wood are in pristine condition. No scratches or dents. Bluing on the barrel is in pristine shape as well...no notable bluing wear,dents or dings. The mono block system locks up and slams shut like it was designed to do by the Italian SO gun smiths intended its still notable tight when opening and closing. The owner had Briley to custom fit Sub-Gauge tubes to fit the barrel (Numbers match) for shooting all gauges. Tubes were pacifically designed as to NOT modify the integrity of the original gun. The gun sports 20, 28, 410 sub-tubes. This gun has one trigger group that drops out and adjustable for length of pull. Both the trigger and barrel have ""Trap"" stamped on them. The trigger is inlaid with gold as well as the under side of the receiver. Receiver is polished nickel finish with gold inlay on the side. Comes with extra sub-gauge chokes. All beautifully cased by Briley which sports the Briley Logo. Words alone can not describe the great condition of this rare O/U, even pics can't show just how pretty the wood really is.

A Vintage Champion Iver Johnson's Arms 20 Gauge Shotgun.

Asking GunsValueBoard.com about this shotgun, the response was that it probably was Made in the period 1921-1939 (per serial number). There are no records to give a more exact date.

Condition:
Well, it does show it's age. The bore is clean. The wood fore grip has a piece on missing on the right side (please see photos). The finish does show wear. Good candidate as a rehab project.
If you need more photos please let me know I can email them to you.

The laser is activated automatically when you grip the gun, no fumbling with switches when time is of the essence and stress levels are high.  The Armalaser uses gold contacts activated by touch instead of a button.  This solves for the grip issues with the button method.  The laser has an on/off override switch so you can practice at the range with it off if desired.  It also has a battery door so you don't have to remove the unit to change the battery.  I have many lasers from various companies and this is by far the best design I think.

Comes with gun, TR1 laser, 7 round mag and 10 round mag, finger extension, soft case, box and manual.  Total cost new was $470 for everything."

What needs to be done
Truck is complete and in no way a project... But is in need of a front left blinker. I tried to make a custom one but wasn't worth the time to finish. 
Needs a windshield.
Overspray on the wheels from paint needs to be cleaned off.
I always intended in replacing the rear shocks to bring them to par with the front but there is nothing wrong with them.

I daily drive this truck for a long time and never let me down, has great power and gets decent mileage with the combo of big tires and decent gears. Over the past 7 months I have not driven it more then 50 miles and I hate seeing going unused. Needs tabs. I am sure I am missing something's but it has been very well maintained and I started this build from stock. Keep in mind I am into this truck in tires brakes and suspension the asking price.... Let's make a deal.

$3800 Obo

Quality	
Everything about this gun is quality, the first time i took it to the range it ate 180 rounds flawlessly. When you handle this gun you know it'll last forever as long as you take care of it. It's a pretty heavy gun but for what you gain it's nothing to worry about, just work on your athleticism. This is my all around gun, home defense and target shooting, haven't taken it hunting yet but the grouping i got at 50 yards for my first time shooting a rifle of my own was tight enough to hit a baseball so for anyone saying an AK isn't accurate isn't talking about this gun. Overall i couldn't and wouldn't have chosen another gun, this is simply the best choice you can make if you're looking for a high quality AK that isn't just a name.

What needs to be done
Truck is complete and in no way a project... But is in need of a front left blinker. I tried to make a custom one but wasn't worth the time to finish. 
Needs a windshield.
Overspray on the wheels from paint needs to be cleaned off.
I always intended in replacing the rear shocks to bring them to par with the front but there is nothing wrong with them.

I daily drive this truck for a long time and never let me down, has great power and gets decent mileage with the combo of big tires and decent gears. Over the past 7 months I have not driven it more then 50 miles and I hate seeing going unused. Needs tabs. I am sure I am missing something's but it has been very well maintained and I started this build from stock. Keep in mind I am into this truck in tires brakes and suspension the asking price.... Let's make a deal.

IT&D rechambered the barrrel, and also squared the action, lapped lugs, and recrowned the barrel. The barrel was not bead blasted after rechambering, so it has a shiny ring around the barrel where it was in the lathe. It was to be a coyote rifle, so I Kryloned the barrel, which is easily removed. Removed the LVSF stock, and now sits in a 1st gen SAUM Ti stock.

Excellent night vision compatibility

The Micro T-1 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs) but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology. 

The clearest brightest image possible 
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). 
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.
