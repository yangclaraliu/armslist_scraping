Pre-Banned Intratec Tec-DC9 manufactured in 1990 with a low serial number of D0016XX. Overall in like new condition. Magazine fit is nice and snug with no looseness and or wobble. Overall solid build. Very low round count as you will see by examining the internal parts, barrel riffling, etc. it's like it has never been fired. Surprisingly nice trigger to add. Very well maintained and kept. Has a threaded barrel (3/4X10) for hosting a flash suppressor if you choose to go that route. Will come with original case, and one original hi-cap 32 round magazine. No doubt a nice piece of history to add into ones collection.

TEXT: REDACTED

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit.

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

Comes with two mags, original case with all factory documents. Has night sights and pearce magazine +1 pinky extensions. No 22s. Also please do not offer your Kahr Cm or Cw series, Ruger SR9, SR40 or SR45 or other handguns in the $300-$400 range for a straight trade. This Glock is LNIB being made in December of 2014 and under 30 rounds down the tube. This IS ALSO A FDE MODEL, therefore it did cost a little more than a standard Glock. It also did not come with Night Sights, I had to pay for those. So if anyone wishes to offer 500.00 for my Glock I will gladly take it, but you will get it with the factory sights, not night sights, factory trigger,not the 3.5lb trigger and factory mag base plates and not the mag extensions. It will also not come with the holster. However with all that being said, if you want a very nice Glock with very nice night sights, a nice crisp 3.5 pound trigger, mag extensions and a holster the cash or trade price is $600.00. I do not expect to get the $750.00 that I have in it. I just want people to be realistic when they look at other's firearms on here and not expect to get a Glock with this quality or any other quality handgun for next to nothing. I apologize if you can't afford the Glock, Sig or other quality handguns that you desire, but those of us on here that do have them please respect us and know that we have these guns because we do know a little something about guns in the first place. Thank you. And for those of you who I didn't piss off, please feel free to offer your trades. I will accept cheaper handguns if you are willing to make up the difference."

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.Specifications:Caliber .40SWRecoil System Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat RearWeight (with Empty Magazine) 26 ozs. w/ Compact Mag, 27 ozs. w/ X-Tension™Height 4.75"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.5"" w/ X-Tension™Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® FinishBarrel 3"" Hammer ForgedLength 6.25""Grip Width 1.19""Frame Black PolymerMagazines 1 - 9 Round Compact, 1 - 12 Round w/ X-Tension™, Stainless SteelIs this handgun legal in your state?  It is your responsibility to know your State and Local handgun laws.No Refunds Will Be Given On Any Firearm That Is Not Transferable.Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.  There is a 3% fee for credit card purchases to cover processing feesThere are no returns on firearms.  Warranty Issues Are Handled By The Manufacturer.Shipping  $25.00 If Required.   I must recieve your local dealers FFL before the item can ship.    Your dealer may email or fax his FFL.  Fax  REDACTEDLocal pickup is available by appointment.   Call REDACTED to make an appointment.You must have a pistol permit or current Concealed Carry Permit for handguns.  A NCDL or State ID is required for all firearms."

 I have put a few rounds through this and it work 100%. One of the nicer ones I've seen. All original and comes with an original Finn sling. Does have a small import mark on the bottom of the barrel.

No trades, if I didn't really need the cash I would keep this one."

Until late last year, most of them had never been suppressed. The Salvo 12 is the first commercially-viable shotgun suppressor and represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology. The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting days, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense,and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle - well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you'll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again.KEY PERFORMANCE FEATURES:Attaches via choke mount to most commercially available gas operated, inertia driven, or pump action shotguns with barrels threaded for chokes.Modular design allows the user to shorten the silencer to 6"",8"", or 10"" configurations to balance size, weight, and sound requirements.Rated for wadded shells up to 3"" including buckshot and slugs.Can be shortened to 8"" configuration and remain hearing safe at the ear.Noticeably reduces felt recoil.Choke mounts and rod kits sold separately - choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full.The Salvo 12 is compatible with the following barrel and ammunition pairings.BARREL LENGTH                                      AMMUNITION10""-16""                                                           2 3/4"" Shell, 1350 FPS16""+                                                                3"" Shell, 1550 FPSSPECIFICATIONS:CALIBER: 12 GaugeMFG ID: SU823MUZZLE AVERAGE dB: 136.8WEIGHT: 34.5 ozLENGTH: 12.00""DIMENSIONS: 2.21"" X 2.96""MATERIALS: Aluminum & Stainless SteelMSRP: 1,400.00"

Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Photos show specimens of a very limited batch of Steyr Factory magazines to fit the M40 Steyr Pistols chambered in .40 S&W caliber. If your pistol is a compact, it will go into battery but will protrude from the grip frame. This is for standard size Steyr .40 Pistols whose height measures exactly 5 1/4 inches on a perpendicular between the lowest point of an in-battery magazine and the top of the rear sight. Some of our photos show such a pistol. Manufacturer is Steyr Mannlicher GmbH & Co KG of Steyr, Austria. Importer is Steyr Arms just to the south of us in Trussville, Alabama. These magazines were manufactured in 2003 before the federal ban sunset in 2004, and we found them in an old Southern Warehouse. They have never been issued and are in new condition. Construction is bright blued serrated side steel, with stainless spring and high impact polymer cartridge follower and extended floorplate. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .40 S&W caliber ammunition, two fewer rounds than the standard issue M4012 variants. Buyers residing in areas where those are permitted may sub at the same price if we are in stock on the MA115s, but those have been unusually scarce for some time. These appear to be Mec Gar manufacture for Steyr, and that certainly indicates quality and reliability; each is marked, however, with the Steyr logo and the word Austria on its front side. Our Single Mag onesy twosy price on these is $39 each. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $33 each. Own 3 for only $ 99.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.

This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Photos show specimens of a very limited batch of Steyr Factory magazines to fit the M40 Steyr Pistols chambered in .40 S&W caliber. If your pistol is a compact, it will go into battery but will protrude from the grip frame. This is for standard size Steyr .40 Pistols whose height measures exactly 5 1/4 inches on a perpendicular between the lowest point of an in-battery magazine and the top of the rear sight. Some of our photos show such a pistol. Manufacturer is Steyr Mannlicher GmbH & Co KG of Steyr, Austria. Importer is Steyr Arms just to the south of us in Trussville, Alabama. These magazines were manufactured in 2003 before the federal ban sunset in 2004, and we found them in an old Southern Warehouse. They have never been issued and are in new condition. Construction is bright blued serrated side steel, ported for round count, with stainless spring and high impact polymer cartridge follower and floorplate. Each magazine holds 12 rounds of .40 S&W caliber ammunition. These appear to be Mec Gar manufacture for Steyr, and that certainly indicates quality and reliability; each is marked, however, with the Steyr logo and the word Austria on its right side and caliber on its left side. Front of body is marked Restricted Law Enforcement / Gov’t Use And/Or Export Only / GSI Trussville, AL. Our Single Mag onesy twosy price on these is $39 each.

After that they are all going back into storage.

All my Izzy's are gone and since I have a few people asking I decided to put a few more desirable / rare Tula's up for sale. I don't know what the production numbers were for a round receiver Tula but you hardly ever see one. I know after all these years of collecting I was only able to get my hands on a few (gotta love those big Russian stars on the receivers). These are mostly pre-war rifles (1938-1940) but likely saw battle. There are a few with rareish BRASS hand guard ends and a couple with nice factory repairs (always a plus for collectors - adds to the mystique). As always, all numbers match. First come / first served on getting to hand pick the best from the lot. If you buy a rifle I will throw in a 440 round spam can of silver tip milsurp ammo for $120. Yes, you might find a cheaper Mosin but it is well worth a few extra $$$ to get to hand pick one that you get to see instead of using mail order, paying for shipping, paying an FFL fee, and then finding out it was ran over by a tank in 1945 and is horrible looking. My rifles look great and all are still packed in cosmoline by the Russians who were waiting for WWIII to begin. Ask around, people know I have a quality collection. I will only sell a few rifles so make sure you jump on this. All rifles have matching numbers (including the bayonet !!!), a cleaning kit, and an oil/solvent canteen. Prices are extremely FIRM.

*** Oh, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. This is to keep the spam down. Again, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. ***

***** NOTE - I am looking for used 7.62x54r brass for reloading. If you shoot brass ammo please keep it instead of throwing it away and drop an email to me. I will buy it from you OR trade it for unfired military surplus rounds (silver tip). *****

No other product from a Connecticut Company commands more respect here in the Mid South than Colt. Ajax polymer grips have just the right combination of strength and flexibility to fit perfectly and survive well, even under steady diets of +P ammunition in Lightweight Combat Commander pistols. Here is Ajax’s number 12IP, smooth imitation ivory finish. These will NOT fit a Government model that has an ambidextrous safety, and we have included photos of an ambidextrous safety on a 1911 Taurus. We do not recommend non-gunsmiths grinding these off, folk can ruin the right panel if they don’t know what they’re doing. Other than that, these are perfect fits for any traditional 1911 Government Model type pistol with a standard size grip frame, and whose grip screws measure exactly 3 inches between their centers. Models include Armscor 1911, Auto Ordnance 1911, Colt Government models, Aces and Gold Cups, Detonics full size, Kimber, Llama full size, Metro Arms, Remington 1911, Ruger SR1911, Taurus 1911s, and Umarex 1911 clones, to name a few. Caliber of the pistol does not matter. These will not fit a Compact variant that measures 2 1/2 inches between the screws; will not fit a Star Pistol, will not fit the door lever of a 1937 Dodge Blue Bird School Bus.

No other product from a Connecticut Company commands more respect here in the Mid South than Colt. Ajax polymer grips have just the right combination of strength and flexibility to fit perfectly and survive well, even under steady diets of +P ammunition in Lightweight Combat Commander pistols. Here is Ajax’s number 12WP, smooth imitation pearl finish. These will NOT fit a Government model that has an ambidextrous safety, and we have included photos of an ambidextrous safety on a 1911 Taurus. We do not recommend non-gunsmiths grinding these off, folk can ruin the right panel if they don’t know what they’re doing. Other than that, these are perfect fits for any traditional 1911 Government Model type pistol with a standard size grip frame, and whose grip screws measure exactly 3 inches between their centers. Models include Armscor 1911, Auto Ordnance 1911, Colt Government models, Aces and Gold Cups, Detonics full size, Kimber, Llama full size, Metro Arms, Remington 1911, Ruger SR1911, Taurus 1911s, and Umarex 1911 clones, to name a few. Caliber of the pistol does not matter. These will not fit a Compact variant that measures 2 1/2 inches between the screws; will not fit a Star Pistol, will not fit the door lever of a 1937 Dodge Blue Bird School Bus. They will only fit 1911 Government Model Pistols with full size grip frames with right hand shooter safety like the one showing in some of our photos. Manufacturer, of course, was Ajax Custom Grips of Dallas, Texas. These grips are old stock Texas production that we found in an old Southern warehouse; Ajax now makes its home in Seneca, Missouri. These grips have not been shown, installed, handled or even displayed until our photographer opened them. We’re offering the Ajax 12WP, Imitation Mother of Pearl Grips for 1911 Government type Pistols only, the grips in the photos or a set of their identical mates for only $ 29.00.

This came as part of an upper I bought and I have no use for it as I replaced it already. Two A2 pistol grips; nothing fancy, just the standard item and don't have the star washer and/or screw for either one. Two charging handles, very lightly used (approximately 20 rounds on the one and zero on the other). One is slightly heavier than the other; that came off a Daniel Defense rifle and the other is from an Aero Precision upper from a build. Also included is an A2 flash hider, ""Birdcage"". Nothing sexy about it but it works and does what it was designed to. These are all spare parts I'm tired of sorting through when I need a tool or am cleaning a gun, so they're up for sale or trade.

Product Information


The Surefire M900A Vertical Foregrip WeaponLight with Swing-Lever attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. This WeaponLight produces a brilliant beam configured for close- to medium-range applications, and also features two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. Primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M900A has four primary beam switches: two momentary-on pressure pads to activate the main light (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), a constant-on rotary switch for the main light, and a system-disable switch that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch.

refinement today's shooters demand. The Sig Sauer 1911 proves that close
tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible with an
off-the-shelf pistol. Sig Sauer has introduced clean, distinct lines that
American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull,
classic ergonomics and exceptional accuracy they expect. These models are
California compliant.

Remington 870 or 1100 field with 26"" or 28"" barrel
Remington 700 SA .308 composite stock
Any combination of the above.

No AK's or AR's, Bolt Action hunting rifles, or shotguns if not listed, as I have those.
Trade value is 2000$, cash price 2000$.

Also, remember this is a right handed rifle. If you shoot it LH, the ejection port is inches from your face, and you will feel the ever so unpleasant hit of hot brass right in the schnoz. (Speaking from experience) There is a LH conversion bolt, and the left side ejection port cover can be moved. The factory scope can be swapped for a rail and your optic of choice can be put in place."

With tax at a store they go for about $760-820, so I'll save you the tax and give a discount on it as well since it's a little bit used and throw in the leather holster. I would like to do a bill of sale and please show a Washington CPL as well. Cash only."

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life.

Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable,ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used.The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case thatfeatures internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pocketswith MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and otheraccessories.

I have never even had the pleasure of firing this particular gun but I bought it after using my friends on a camping trip last year. The barrel is factory bored so that this almost no kick so that if you have to fire again you are still pointing directly at your target.

You can't tell that the trigger is locked by looking at the gun but the trigger wont move when its locked.
