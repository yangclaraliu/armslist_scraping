Why the PX4 is cool?
Its unique design features a rotating barrel that directs recoil straight back, reducing muzzle flip and allowing you to get back on target faster. It's a full size pistol and comes with a chrome lined barrel. See the action at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKs-rMB-cio.

Why the CX4 is cool?
The CX4 is a pistol-caliber carbine that shares the same magazines as the PX4 (you can replace a small magazine adapter to use Beretta 92FS magazines instead). The simple blow-back action is utterly reliable and the recoil is very low. It is a very light and compact carbine that is newbie friendly. Like the PX4, it also comes with a chrome lined barrel.

It is very light and easy to carry in the woods, and it is perfectly suited to tree stand and ground blind hunting because of it's ability to maneuver in restricted areas. 
This is a complete hunting package and includes everything you need to get into the field tomorrow. Except the practice. This bow has exceptional knock down capacity and I have taken elk in Arizona, black bear in Alberta, several large deer in Saskatchewan, and numerous deer here in New Jersey. I have developed a rotator cuff problem and have had to move on to a crossbow and therefore need to sell this bow. The bow has been professionally maintained throughout the years, and is in excellent condition.

It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the Cx4 will deliver what it promises.Accepts Beretta Full-Size Pistol MagazinesThe Cx4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta Px4, 90-series and 8000-series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users, the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the Cx4's dedicated following.Extremely Versatile, Easy to UseThis light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right-or-left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the Cx4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up the the hardest use.Easy AccessorizationThe Cx4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.FeaturesAdjustable Length of PullYou can adjust the length of pull of your Cx4 to fit your body-type or even a variety of tactical conditions, such as wearing a heavy coat in the winter or T-shirt in the summer.Aperture Rear SightThe aperture rear sight gives you a quick tactical sight alignment and is protected against impact. The front sight is adjustable, making it easy to stay on target when you change ammunition brands or types.Reversible Operating HandleLike all other key controls on the Cx4, the operating handle is reversible with no gunsmithing required, making it easy to train or shoot right-or-left-handed.Right or Left EjectionDepending on whether you shoot right-or-left-handed you can reverse case-ejection from right to left, with no gunsmithing required.Reversible SafetyThe safety is reversible (no gunsmithing required) so that you can train or shoot right-or-left-handed.Reversible Magazine ReleaseTrain and shoot with either hand dominant. The magazine release on the Cx4 is reversible by the user (no gunsmithing required), as is the case-ejection, the safety and the operating handle.Accepts Px4 and 90-Series Magazines If you are a current Beretta shooter and own a Px4 or a 90-Series pistol, you can use the magazines you already have for the Cx4. The Cx4 will also take 8000-Series magazines-using optional adapters.Adjustable Front SightThe front sight is user-adjustable, with no gunsmithing required. This makes the Cx4 versatile, as you can easily stay accurate and on target when you use different kinds of ammunition.Chrome-Lined BarrelThe chrome-lined barrel greatly minimizes corrosion and facilitates cleaning, giving you a much longer barrel life.SpecificationsActionSingleBarrel Length (mm)422.5Barrel Length (in)16.6Caliber9x19 (Para)Magazine17 RoundsOverall Height (mm)190Overall Height (in)7.5 Overall Length (mm)755Overall Length (in)29.7Overall Width (mm)63Overall Width (in)2.5Sight Radius (in)12.9Sight Radius (mm)327Weight Unloaded (g)2575Weight Unloaded (oz)90.8"

The Kahr MK9 is a fairly hard to find pistol.  You rarely will see one in a gun shop, so when folks at gun shops have seen it, they always want to know what it is.  If you buy new, this gun goes anywhere from $680-775.

Itâs a pocket pistol (smaller than even the Glock 43 and Ruger LC9S), AND Itâs in 9mm.    Instead of the polymer with the other offerings by Kahr, you get the robustness of an all-metal pistol.   It does weigh more than a polymer gun, but itâs still very easy to pocket carry and the extra weight manages the recoil really well.   It also looks amazing with the stainless finish.   If youâve shot Kahrs before, you know how great the trigger is.

The gun is in great shape.   I believe Kahr recommends replacing the recoil spring assembly after 2,500 rounds.   I like to be prepared, so I have a brand new - still in the plastic - recoil spring assembly that will go with it.   The recoil spring assembly already installed is practically brand new, so you shouldnât have to worry about replacing it for a long, long time.   But youâll have a new one ready when you need to.

The Kahr MK9 comes with two factory magazines:  a 6-round mag and a 7-round mag w/ extended grip.

Also included with the sale is a practically brand new DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster.

I will only sell at a FFL.  So choose your local gun shop of choice, and the transfer can be completed there.  Obviously if you can't pass a background check, neither I or the gun shop will be able to help you.  Good luck!"

I am selling this because I consolidating down to what I plan to holster and carry. I also has aspirations for purchasing a suppressor and I just don't have time to mess with that process right now.

The gun has a couple of hundred rounds through it, is very clean, and has no scratches. I am not interested in trading right now. Please feel free to ask all the questions you want though. However, if the add is up the gun is still for sale. So no need to inquire about that.

I paid 1250.00 for the pistol, 225.00 for the Burris, and 200.00 for the Surefire. At 1300.00, it is a pretty decent deal."

Currently on Amazon for $478. This is an extremely high quality optic. Product Description Recognizing the popularity of AR rifles, Nikon has developed a new line of riflescopes built to deliver extreme speed, accuracy and shooting confidence. The M-223 line offers five new riflescopes, all engineered for the 223 Rem./5.56mm NATO round with 55-grain polymer tipped bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3240fps. With Nikon's latest reticle and adjustment technologies, the M-223 integrates the same level of quality as the flagship Monarch riflescopes. ""The recent surge in AR-type rifle purchases means there is a new group of customers out there learning just how much fun owning an AR is,"" said Jon LaCorte, senior product marketing manager Nikon Sport Optics. ""We've built the M-223 family to help them enjoy and use their rifles no matter if it's for competition, varmint or predator hunting or just plinking fun.""All of the new M-223 riflescopes feature Nikon's famous fully multicoated optics, up to 95% light transmission, waterproof/fogproof/shockproof performance and lifetime warranty. Designed for AR carbines and popular 3 gun competitions, the 1-4x20 with Point Blank reticle features an extremely large exit pupil for low light performance and a super wide field of view. The all-new Point Blank reticle technology means incredibly accurate and fast shooting from zero to 200 yards thanks to thick reticle posts and purpose-designed 3-MOA center dot for instant targeting on paper or steel plates. The 2-8x32 is available with Nikon's all new BDC 600 reticle or the Nikoplex reticle with Nikon's new Rapid Action Turret system; both are ballistically matched to the 223 Rem. round and offer unprecedented speed in dialing in your shots for virtually any known distance-from 0 to 600 yards. Amazon.com Built for extreme shooting, long range aiming, speed, and precision, the M-233 BDC 600 3-12X42SF Riflescope from Nikon is the big brother of the M-223 lineup. The scope offers an adjustable 3 to 12x magnification range to provide the combined benefits of a wide field of view at the low range and fine-tuned detail at the top of the range. Meanwhile the 42-millimeter objective lens with fully multi-coated optics offers up to 92 percent light transmission for large, clear, and crisp sight images. Paired with the BDC 600 aiming reticle, this scope provides precise target acquisition from 100 to 600 yards. The scope's side focus parallax adjustment lays down a serious power range for your most extreme shooting, while the quick focus-eyepiece, and 1/4 MOA reticle adjustments allow you to zero in and focus quickly. Built to last the M-233 BDC 600 scope boasts one-piece tube construction of aircraft-grade aluminum--and the scope is nitrogen purged and O-ring sealed to keep the optics in pristine condition. The scope is backed by Nikon's full lifetime warranty. The M-223's large ocular lenses deliver bright, high-resolution sight pictures.Key Features: BDC 600 Reticle: Developed specifically for the trajectory of the 0.223 Rem 5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet, the new BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards. Ultra ClearCoat Optical System: Bright, sharp, incredibly flat sight picture and light transmission up to 92 percent. Eye Box technology: Impressive four-times zoom range and four inches of constant, non-critical eye relief. A large ocular lens delivers a bright, high-resolution sight picture. Zero-Reset Turrets: Simplify field adjustments--simply sight in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your ""zero"", and re-engage. Smooth Zoom Control: Magnification reference numbers are viewable from the shooters position. Side Focus Parallax Adjustment Quick Focus Eyepiece: This allows the shooter to bring the reticle into sharp focus quickly. 1/4 MOA Reticle Adjustments with easy-to use positive click adjustments to get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting even with recoil. One-piece Main Body Tube: This tube construction reduces weight while maximizing strength and durability. Enhanced Mount Ring Spacing: With enhanced ring mount spacing--hunters can mount the scope on virtually any rifle action regardless of caliber--including magnum-length actions. M-223 Mount: Fits Picatinny rails found on most flattop ARs. Lightweight alloy construction with built-in 20-MOA incline to maximize elevation for extreme long range shooting. ARD Removable Anti-Reflective Device: Eliminates objective lens glare. Waterproof, Fogproof, Shockproof: Nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed.

The Excalibur Matrix Mega 405 is a hard-hitting powerhouse that?s built for today?s most serious hunter. Blistering speeds and bone crushing power make it one of the most capable crossbows for all big game-from whitetail deer to cape buffalo. The integrated, R.E.D.S. (Recoil Energy Dissipation System) string suppressors reduce vibration, noise and shock for quieter, more comfortable shooting. The self-contained Guardian Anti-Dry-Fire System, housed in the scope mount, catches the crossbow string to prevent firing if it?s triggered without an arrow in place. A built-in release allows easy uncocking so you don?t have to fire an arrow to end the hunt. Package includes: a Twilight DLX Scope with 30mm rings, a cheekpiece, a 4-arrow quiver with bracket, 4 Diablo arrows, four 150-grain field points, and a rope-cocking aid.Manufacturere model #: 4000.The ultimate in speed and powerR.E.D.S.

Unfortunately he never got to use them after an unexpected cancer diagnosis just 7 short weeks before he lost that battle. 

Retail on these binoculars is $279.99 but you can frequently find them at Bass Pro Shop for $249 plus tax, and sometimes Cabelaâs at $229 plus tax (see links below), so Iâm pricing these at an even $200.  

I also have the Vortex 8x25 monocular, retail priced at $69 (plus tax) for sale for $50 in another listing.  You can purchase them individually, or both together for $240.

If you know optics, you know Vortex are top of the line and that they have unsurpassed customer service, including their industry leading lifetime warranty, so there is no risk to you. 

Iâm in town for the holidays visiting the in-laws near The Shell Factory, so please text or call me (text preferred) at REDACTED to schedule a time to see these high quality optics for yourself. 

DIAMONDBACK 10X42 ROOF PRISM BINOCULAR

Superior quality, high-performance hunting optics can find their way around your neck for a surprisingly affordable price. The smooth focusing 10x42 Diamondback binocular takes you to the fine details you prize. Taking its lead from the Diamondback rattlesnake, this rugged binocular is striking in how well it detects life in low light. Look for a huge field-of-viewâthe largest in its classâ with enhanced fully multi-coated optics, phase-corrected prisms, waterproof and fogproof construction, soft tapered eyecups, and rugged rubber armor. It's all there in a Diamondback. Now you can use ""wow!"" and ""thank you"" in the same sentence.

I also have Vortex Diamondback 10x42 binoculars for sale in a different listing for $200. You can purchase them individually, or both together for $240.

Retail on the binoculars is $279.99 but you can frequently find them at Bass Pro Shop for $249 plus tax, and sometimes Cabelaâs at $229 plus tax (see links below), so Iâm pricing these at an even $200.  

If you know optics, you know Vortex are top of the line and that they have unsurpassed customer service, including their industry leading lifetime warranty, so there is no risk to you. 

Iâm in town for the holidays visiting the in-laws near The Shell Factory, so please text or call me (text preferred) at REDACTED to schedule a time to see these high quality optics for yourself.

overall this gun is very clean, no rust or scratches on the metals or barrel. the only cosmetic would be on the stock from being in the field nothing too extensive nor notable unless closely inspected. ive always cleaned it right after shooting and has been kept in my safe.

One (1) Pro Mag 20 Round extended steel mag, not ruger manufactured, but works perfectly and a virtual duplicate of the factory steel mags in appearance and performance. All total, to purchase all of these separately would run $240, at the low end, if you can find them. I am selling all 8 depicted mags for $80 as a group, to avoid selling them off piecemeal. This is for LOCAL PICKUP ONLY. i WILL NOT SHIP or take any payment except cash. Thanks for looking. 913-TWO ZERO THREE - 753 THREE"

About the light:  It's a very basic but very bright 190 lumen light with simple side activation and strobe mode.   Honestly, it's not an expensive streamlight, and is probably too bulky for carry, but it's Fantastic for a home defense gun.

The big brother of the Ruger LCP has received an upgrade! The new LC9S Pro is a striker fired pistol which was introduced due to complaints of the heavy and long double action trigger of the regular LC9. The 5 lb +/- trigger is ideal for everyone, but it really makes a difference for anyone with limited finger dexterity or weak hands.

The Pro model does not have a magazine disconnect (it will fire without a magazine) and there is no external safety.

This Pistol is very accurate; its trigger pull is crisp and has a nice reset making follow up shots quick while keeping them on target.  As with CZ75 pistols the slide rides inside of the frame on silky smooth rails the length of the gun. There is very little play between the slide and the frame.

I have fired 300 rounds of FMJ and Hollow point bullets from various manufacturers through the pistol without a single failure.

Older Model with metal barrel band and trigger assembly.  I took it in trade and already have other 10/22s.
   The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular and widely used rim-fire rifles in the US and justifiably so.  The 10/22 has had a solid reputation for reliability and accuracy for over 50 years, making it a favorite for target shooting, plinking, and small game hunting.  The 10/22 utilizes a blow-back semi-auto action, and a 10-shot rotary magazine, both of which are legendary for reliability.  The hammer-forged barrel locks into the receiver by a unique 2-screw, V-block system that provides unsurpassed accuracy for a mass-produced rim-fire rifle.  It sports a gold bead front sight and an adjustable, folding rear sight and a drilled and tapped receiver.  The short and light 10/22 carbine handles incredibly well by adult and youth shooters alike.  The popularity of the Ruger 10/22 has led to a myriad of after-market accessories, making it one of the most customizable firearms ever made.  Then Ruger 10/22 Carbine is an indispensable, go-to firearm for any American serious about shooting, training, self-defense, or hunting.  Mad in U.S.A."

I've owned it for about 2 years and meant for it to be my concealed carry gun. Unfortunately, never came to be so the gun has pretty much been a safe queen. I had some trijicon HD night sights ($130 just for the sights) installed on day 1 and they look great easy to see at night and day because of the black ledge and orange front dot. The gun has seen maybe 200-300 rounds as it got quite expensive to shoot .45 for me. I cleaned it after every range visit. Gun is immaculate with all original paperwork, accesories, and case.

For more information or serious offers please text me at REDACTEDA Project Ar-15 meant to serve the DMR role. The project started off using a Palmetto state Armory lower reciever. The gun is outfitted with a Magpull UBR stock, Standard buffer and spring. Giessele enhanced 2 stage match trigger. Yankee hill machine company Ez pull takedown pins. DPMS factory replacement spring and pin kit. Hogue overmold pistol grip. Upper reciever started out as a Palmetto premium upper reciever. The barrel is a FN-USA 16 inch barrel mid length gas system, 1/7 twist, made from CMV steel. The foreend was replaced with a Midwest Industries M-lock free float handgaurd. Gas block is now a sadlack industries low pro clamp-on gas block. The muzzle device is a compensator made locally in Eugene, Oregon. A compensator with heart shaped cuts instead of traditional baffles. Surprisingly effective at recoil reduction. Accuracy potential is right around 1-1.25 moa with it's prefer factory loading. Its prefered factory ammunition being 55 grain Perfecta, typically found in Walmart. On a good day my best 5 shot groups were a mere qaurter inch in size at 50 yards. Accuracy performance will of course increase when a handload is made for it."
