The versatility of the Public Defender allows you the option of a .410 shotgun shell for shooting varmints and administering crowd control on would-be assailants, or a 45 Colt for stopping whatever is coming your way dead in its tracks. 

The unique polished frame of this particular Taurus Judge is one-of-a-kind and will go nicely into your collection of conversation pieces. Its compact style hides well for concealed carry and fits comfortably inside your waist.

Functions flawlessly, as to be expected with a John Browning design. The bore is decent as is the bluing, but there is some wear. Nothing excessive, just normal wear for a 100 year old pistol. 
The original .380 was a favorite of the detectives of the early 1900's as well as some of the most notorious gangsters of the era. John Dillinger was carrying one in his trouser pocket the night he was gunned down outside of the Biograph Theater.
With modern .380 ammo this would make a beautiful carry piece with decent stopping power. A little more class than your everyday LCP or Mustang.
I'd be happy to answer any questions so feel free to ask. No trades at this time, and buyer pays the transfer fee. 
There is a link to some historical info at the bottom and thanks for checking out the add.

These were built into match rifles by USAF armorers at the USAF Competitive Weapons Shop at Lackland AFB. Very few AFPG Garands made it into civilian hands, far fewer than Navy B's as it was common for the AF team member to ""acquire"" their rifles upon retirement and very few were sold to state shooting associations and clubs through the DCM. After the largest supporter of the competitive marksmanship in the USAF, Gen. Curtis LeMay, passed away the USAF NM rifle program died off. The USAF then turned most of the remaining AFPG M1s into drill rifles (welded and plugged barrels) or parade rifles (refinished for appearances). You can read more about this rare variant of the M1 rifle in the Garand Collectors Association Journal vol. 26 No.3 Summer 2012 issue. This AFPG was built using a Springfield Armory 5.79 receiver. The block started at 5793848 and ended at 5799999. There were only 6152 SA receivers produced in this serial number block which makes it unique and highly sought after. The barrel drawing number is SA 7791035, which was produced for the 1963 National Match rifles. The barrel is marked “80-06” in marker on the top. The area where the lower band sits has been knurled. The barrel has been highly polished from the drawing numbers all the way around to the clip latch side. It’s been polished smooth and is so shiny that you can see your reflection. Super tight barrel. MW 0+ TE 2. The rear sight is a standard base that has been modified. The right side of the receiver ear where the windage knob goes has also been highly polished. The receiver has been modified for half clicks of windage. A hole has been drilled into the receiver where a bolt extractor spring and plunger sit. The Wright windage knob has 8 grooves machined into it to give ½ minute windage adjustments. The aperture is a 520 national match.The gas cylinder has been modified to national match specifications with the rear ring reamed and the tab modified. The front sight blade has been narrowed. The stock has been fully bedded and has an exceptionally tight fit just into the receiver. The lockup is tight as well. The stock ferrule has been modified. The lower band has been reamed. The op rod is a NM 7790722-RA. This was an AFPG barreled receiver that was restored. I think I have the CMP Certificate which the previous owner sent with the barreled receiver. I have personally shot this rifle and it functioned just great. Kept them all in the black on a 100 yard SR-1 target"

For an additional $350, I'll add in an Eotech MRDS (Micro Red Dot) with the ACOG mount and an American Defense QD Rail Mount. Also includes hood shroud, original case, papers, and protective covers. Total of $1200 for Acog and MRDS with all mounts and covers. 

The TA31 is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31 features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR®."

Other info: Purchased from Tracy Rifle and Pistols about a year ago. California model with Bullet Button and pinned (non folding) stock from the factory to comply with CA DOJ requirements. (Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it

Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss
Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen.

Selling because I just picked up the pistol model which is what I originally wanted.

Vortex Spitfire 1x Prism Scope DRT (MOA) Reticle Matte Designed specifically for the AR platform, the 1x Spitfire combines an impressive array of high-performance features into a rugged, ultra-compact package.

Laced with advanced features, the sophisticated prism-based design allows for a more compact optical system without sacrificing optical quality. The DRT (Dual Ring Tactical) reticle is etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times with selectable red/green illumination of five intensity levels to match specific conditions.

    Waterproof: O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust and debris from penetrating for reliable performance in all environments.
    Fogproof: Nitrogen gas purging delivers fogproof, waterproof performance.

Clamp system takes out any slop and is pre assembled to fit Mil-Spec buffer tubes. See link below for manufacturers website with instructions to change over if you have a Commercial buffer tube.Comparable to the Magpul CTR collapsable stock but with more features.The Rogers Super-Stoc™ (commonly called the Super Stock) is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.Rogers Super-stoc"

Here's why: they have been doubly inspected!  These Glocks were issued to police departments  but they were never issued to officers or used.  When the department decided to change either the caliber or the model of Glock they wanted to use, they were permitted to re-box the pistols and send them back to the factory.  They were them broken down and inspected by Glock gunsmiths and repackaged as ""Factory Refurbished"" or ""Rebuilt"", with a FULL guarantee.  Also, the magazine capacity of  these Glock 22's  is 16 and not the usual 15!  And, these never-used Glocks, with all the usual niceties in the carrying case, can be sold for significantly less.

Nikon P300 Blackout BDC Super-Sub Optic:
Designed for the ballistic profiles of the .300 AAC Blackout cartridge in both supersonic and subsonic loads, the P-300 BLK is completely optimized for use with Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology, which allows shooters to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC SuperSub reticle at different yardages for any ammunition and load. To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets into the P-300 BLK. Just sight in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage. Nikon engineered the entire optical system in the P-300 BLK to provide the shooter with maximum brightness and maximum light transmission.  The result is an extraordinarily clear sight picture. Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions.

Gun Details (Upper from AR-X Enterprises) 6mmAR.com
- 24"" free floated 1/10 twist 20 caliber Hart Custom Match Barrel. Barrel was cut out of 416R Stainless blank and sent to Fred Sabreco in Pennsylvania to mate the barrel to the receiver. Has around 500 rounds through it but no visible wear at all. Never rapid fired and if the barrel started to get warm I let it cool before shooting again.
- Gas Block is a custom clamp on to reduce barrel stress. 
- Upper receiver is DPMS Heavy Walled with side charging handle.
- Optic is Burris M-TAC 3.5-10x 1/10 mil mounted in 30 mm Burris X-Treme Rings.
- Lower parts kit is DPMS, but I later changed the trigger to the excellent AR Gold from American Trigger Corp.
- Lower receiver is a Tactical Innovations BDX (Billet Deluxe)
- Stock is fully adjustable Magpul PRS with AR-rester Hydraulic buffer, which significant cut down on already low recoil.
- Grip is Ergo Deluxe with adjustable palm shelf.
- Bipod is Harris BM (Benchrest) 6-9 inch adjustable with tilt. 
Any further questions about the gun feel free to ask...

Now for the extras

I have a lot of pictures I wouldn't be able to put on here due to size constraints but ask if you want more and I'll send them to you. This gun will shoot sub inch at 300 yards with the right load. I'm asking 1100. There is more than that in the gun and optic alone (2600+) May entertain a nice bolt action too.

Never been mounted. Comes with everything needed to mount except allen/hex key wrenches. You get everything that is pictured.

Integrated Sight Channel
• Constructed from a solid billet of 4140 steel
• Two-point lock-up, and three point contact with the crown of the reciever for ultimate stability
• The popular “Brookfield” Type M14 and M1A Weaver Rail Mount
• Rock Solid- Built To Last 
The US Tactical System “Brookfield” Weaver Type mount provides a secure, stable scope base that won't shift between shots. Rock-solid, three-point mounting system attaches to the factory scope mount screw hole in the receiver and the charger guide dovetail, while the setscrew at the front uses the receiver ring as a stop to prevent forward movement. This enhances the stability, and eliminates any rocking motion under heavy recoil. No drilling or tapping required to install. 

This US Tactical Systems M14 mount is constructed out of a solid billet of 4140 steel. Our Wire-EDM manufacturing process leaves the finished product completely devoid of stress. Competing designs, lacking in this essential process often result in critical systems failures, due to the heavy recoil of the larger caliber rounds. Wire-EDM manufacturing also allows for the tightest tolerances, and perfect fit on your Classic M14 rifle. Six precision notched Weaver cross-slots offer plenty of versatility in setting eye relief, and the integrated sight channel allows use of iron sights without removing the scope."

You either sell, the parts or depending which major components, you build. Well last year about this time I got an upper receiver complete minus CH & BCG. Well there it was not doing nothing. Turns out it's an FN Upper (or at least the barrel is and you can tell by the cage code on the barrel) so I threw a fairly new BCG and an old CH in to it and let it sit. I decided to get a lower and didn't want to go through the hassle of waiting on Rainier Arms so I bought local and got an Anderson. 

So just seeing what is out there. I know that the Anderson Lowers are a dime a dozen so the value is really in the upper.

There is one spot of lost bluing about 2/3 up the barrel, but I touched that up with some AlumaBlack. No rust. I am told that the gun was not shot much at all. The scope is a Leupold Vari-X III 3 6.5-20x40. Standard reticle. Sun shade. Scope, rings, bases, all look excellent. Turret caps show some wear but I’m told that he interchanged these with other scopes he had. My customer wants this sold as a package, and it will remain that way. My customer does also have around 400 bullets, some cases, and a set of RCBS dies, if interested. This can be sold separately if you are interested. This gun will ship to your dealer in the lower 48 for $30. Sales tax if sent to a dealer in New York. At this time I don’t take credit cards. Payment by USPS money order, bank check, personal checks also accepted. Any payment must clear my account before I ship, so know of this delay. MO and bank checks strongly preferred due to this. A copy of your dealer’s license must be emailed or mailed to me. I will also need their phone number or email for contact so that I can verify that you have arranged the transfer."

Please Note: ATF 4473 Is Required

Detailed Description:

This is not a light weight platform, the 45 Raptor is a seriously hard hitting cartridge (think 460 S&W in an AR-10/LR-308 platform) and was intended to beat out 450 bushmaster, 458 socom, and 50 Beowulf - I own a 50 Beowulf with similar setup and the 45 Raptor is a beast

Raptor Shooting Systems 45 Raptor Barrel Kit, Custom Medesha muzzle brake & 20rd Magazine with Badger Ordnance .875 Stainless low profile gas block and stainless mid-length gas tube

Aero Precision M5E1 upper with 12"" Keymod handguard with Odin Works bipod mount, Aero Precision 7.62 NIB bolt carrier group with forward assist and AXTS Raptor Ambidextrous charging handle

Aero Precision M5 lower with Magpul grip and STR Stock with enhance recoil pad, CMC 3.5# Flat Trigger with KNS Anti-roll trigger pins, and Heavybuffers.Com Extra heavy carbine buffer and spring kit

Nikon P-223 3-9x40 with Nikon 1 piece mount 

Upper was just sent out to Medesha Firearms to be ""smoothed out"" (chamber, gas port work, bolt/carrier work and polish) along with timing of the muzzle brake and bead blasted barrel assembly and updated 20rd magazine - test fired and new brass comes with it 

Picture show case comparison: 45 raptor vs 308win vs .223/5.56

-------

I rather this be a cash sale or discrete PayPal (buyer pays fees) - I'm NOT interested in trading for ARs, Glocks, or 1911s - remember you will have to come to Mineral Wells, TX as I'm an FFL and this will require a 4473 to be filled out - please ask any questions you may have - serious buyers only, please

Cyclone 7.62mm SilencerAdvanced Armament Corp. Cyclone 7.62mm SilencerThe rigidly simple threaded mounting design provides reliable precision accuracy with minimal and repeatable zero-shift. Extraordinary sound and recoil reduction are two of the instant benefits of the CYCLONE silencer. Durability is maximized by fully CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed fire possible. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. EDM technology is utilized as a final step to ensure precise bore alignment and enhance accuracy. The elimination of approximately 95% of the muzzle report nullifies the need for ear protection, facilitates field communications, and masks the location of the user.*NOT FOR USE ON SCAR 17 OR RUGER SCOUT*This silencer was designed for precision rifles and is not intended to be a direct thread replacement of our quick detach 7.62mm silencers.SpecificationsCaliber:7.62 NATO, 300 BLKWeight:22.4 ozLength:9.5""Length added:8.75""Diameter:1.50""Finish:Cerakote™Sound Reduction:30-33dBMount:5/8-24, M18x1Materials:Inconel 718 & 316L SS"

Contact us today to get yours started.The generation 2 Guardian 22 improved the best in class price / performance to implement changes you've asked for. The new Guardian 22 is shorter, stronger, and quieter. We raised the bar, not the price.+ The entire serialized registered part (not just a thread insert, like a few of our competitors) is now made of heat treated 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer. A 316 stainless steel tube to handle your most abusive use. All baffles are encased K baffles, providing a ""tube within a tube"" for ease of cleaning and durability. The first baffle is stainless steel, with all other baffles constructed from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminum for strength and durability. Length and outside diameter have been reduced. Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 model. Retail price unchanged at $199.JS Sales Price $185.00You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.SuppressionThe Guardian 22 compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.MaintenanceJust because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.Guardian 22 baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.With the Guardian 22 full user servicability is a reality. We are so confident you will be able to service the Guardian 22 yourself we offer the only clean silencer guarantee in the industry. If your Guardian 22 gets so dirty you can't clean it yourself, send it back to us and we'll clean it for free. Yes, free. Who else makes such a guarantee? No one. How can we do this?
