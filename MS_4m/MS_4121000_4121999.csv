I purchased it for $700 a little over a year ago and only put one box (50 rounds) of ammo through it. It is a beautiful pistol and I bought it because ""Everyone needs a 1911 in their collection."" Or so I've been told.

Anyway, I need to purchase a new pistol for work and the proceeds from this Springfield will be put towards that. 

As mentioned earlier, the gun has hardly been used. It does not come with the grips currently pictured on it, however it does come with a pair of gorgeous cocobolo grips with the Springfield crossed cannons logo on them. It also comes with a second set of black plastic grips, also with the Springfield logo. The pistol also comes with a hard plastic case, owner's manual, two stock seven round magazines, cleaning brush, holster, and double mag pouch. In addition, I am including two eight round Tripp Research Cobramags (about $35 apiece) with the pistol.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that this pistol is one of the ""NM"" serialized models. You can Google ""NM"" vs ""N"" serialized models, but the basic gist of it is that ""N"" models are completely manufactured and assembled in Brazil, while ""NM"" models are manufactured in Brazil and final assembly is performed in the US. At least that's how I understand it. The ""NM"" models supposedly have better fit/finish to them. Also ""NM"" models supposedly come with one piece barrels while the ""N"" models come with two piece barrels.

I am asking $600, cash only, and I am firm on the price. Buyer pays DROS and transfer fee ($35 total) at an FFL in the Vallejo area (Vacaville, Fairfield, Napa, etc.).

Thanks for looking!"

I built the lower and then put a 100rd box of Winchester white box through it. It ran 100% without a single hitch. 

The lower is a brand new dedicated forged 9mm lower by GPI with a CMMG LPK installed.

This has two original 14 round magazines, and I believe I still have the original box.

No trades please.

For whatever reason the website is making this list as a revolver, but it obviously is not. I'll fix that when the site cooperates."

To the 2 individuals that placed inaccurate information on Armslist, please study the below article, as well as other factual information outlets, before drawing false conclusions.  I wish you were right on this; however, sad to say you are not.  

FOX NEWS ARTICLE TODAY:

It looked like the fix was in. But the ATF says it was just a misfire. 

As the ATF faces a firestorm of controversy for seeking public comment on a proposal to ban a popular type of bullet, critics last week claimed the agency may have decided in advance how it would rule. 

They pointed to the ATF's latest ""Firearms Regulation Reference Guide,"" released in January 2015. The guide, curiously, did not contain an exemption for popular "".223 M855 'green tip' ammunition"" that was included in earlier guides. Without that exemption, the ammunition is illegal to sell. (The change in language was first noticed by Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich at Townhall.com.) 

So did the ATF already make up its mind?  

No, the agency claims. The ATF has responded that the reference guide is not legally binding, so the bullets have not actually been banned yet, and has apologized for leaving the exemptions out of the guide. They say it was an innocent mistake. And the proposed ban is apparently still under consideration.

""[It] was an error which has no legal impact on the validity of the exemptions,"" ATF public affairs chief Ginger Colbrun told FoxNews.com in an emailed statement, adding that it will be corrected soon. 

""The 2014 Regulation Guide will be corrected in PDF format to include the listing of armor piercing ammunition exemptions and posted shortly...  ATF apologizes for any confusion caused by this publishing error."" 

As of Monday, the 2014 guide with the error was no longer available on the ATF website. 

Case closed? Perhaps. Gun-rights supporters say that such errors are common for the ATF -- but that it could also have been a tip-of-the-hand that the administration already had reached a decision on banning the bullets. 

""This is either real incompetence or ATF got caught with their pants down. With this administration it could be both,"" Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation told FoxNews.com. 

The controversy comes on the heels of a letter from a hundreds of lawmakers urging the ATF not to ban the popular ammunition, which is the focus of regulatory efforts because it can pierce bulletproof vests used by law enforcement. 

These lawmakers say the regulation would interfere with Americans' Second Amendment rights. 

""This attack on the Second Amendment is wrong and should be overturned,"" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who started the petition, said in a statement to FoxNews.com. ""Now 239 bipartisan Members of Congress -- a clear, sizeable majority of the House -- agree,"" he noted. 

Although the ATF previously approved the bullets in 1986, the agency now says that because handguns have been designed that can also fire the bullets, police officers are more likely to encounter them. 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest backed up the agency's proposal at a press conference last Monday. 

""We are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement... This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk,"" Earnest said. 

But gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association note that almost all rifle bullets can pierce armor, and say that this is just an excuse for limiting civilian gun use. 

""The claim that this is done out of a concern for law enforcement safety is a lie. The director of the Fraternal Order of Police has said this is not an issue of concern. And according to the FBI, not one single law enforcement officer has been killed with M855 ammunition fired from a handgun,"" Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told FoxNews.com. 

Some law enforcement groups reached by FoxNews.com also say that they see no need for the regulation. 

""The notion that all of a sudden a new pistol requires banning what had long been perfectly legal ammunition doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to many officers,"" William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, told FoxNews.com. 

NAPO represents over 1,000 police units and associations and 241,000 law enforcement officers around the country. 

But some law enforcement experts support the ban. 

""I am definitely for the banning of these rounds... officers worry about them all the time,"" former NYPD detective Harry Houck told FoxNews.com, though he added that a ban might not actually keep criminals from getting the ammunition. 

Gun control groups also support the ban. 

""We understand why law enforcement has always been concerned about the threat of armor-piercing bullets,"" Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told FoxNews.com. 

Lawmakers warn that the regulation -- especially as it follows on the heels of attempts to restrict lead bullets -- will ""result in drastically reduced options for lawful ammunition users."" Already, the ammunition has been cleared from many store shelves by gun owners looking to stock up in anticipation of the ban. The proposed regulation would not prohibit owning the bullets, but it would stop anyone from manufacturing or importing them. 

The ATF has announced that it is currently taking public comments on the regulation until March 16, when it will prepare to issue a final regulation. Comments can be sent to REDACTED."

Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most unobscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones."

$21.95-The MOE-K2+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments.

Similar in concept to the smaller MOE-K, the MOE-K2 is a drop in upgrade for AR15/M4′s that offers a more vertical grip angle, but in a full-size grip design. The steeper vertical grip angle is optimized for use on PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) configurations and improves comfort and control on short LOP rifles that bring the primary hand in closer to the shooter’s body.
 With the rubber overmolding for positive weapon control, compatibility with optional Storage Cores for gear stowage, and a unique backstrap design for proper trigger finger placement, the K2+ brings modern styling, ergonomics, and comfort to the AR platform.

All mounting hardware and a basic grip cap included.

Made in U.S.A.


The new ARCH-EL Charging Handle from Strike Industries is a T-6 7075 forged hard anodized charging handle featuring a larger latch surface that functions with ease in adverse conditions. With its high polished surface, its ergonomic design makes for a smooth, clean charge. The quality of the ARCH-EL is second to none and it’s built for durability. Its gas busting ability diverts harmful gases, oil and dirt away from the shooter. Once you place the ARCH-EL on your rifle, you will see, feel, and know the quality of the ARCH-EL!

Package include
 - 1 x Charging Handle with Extended Latch

Features
 - Enlarged Extended Grasping Surface for Smooth Operation under Extreme Conditions
 - Traditional Concealed Latch Co-existed with the SI ARCH for Normal Operation
 - Aluminum Construction for minimized weight
 - Fits All Standard AR15 Charging Handles with No Gunsmithing Required

It uses P90 mags and loads from the top. It is an interesting design, the brass falls through the mag well. The benefits of this rifle is that the recoil is to a minimum. You can adjust from target to target very quickly because of this. Also there is 50 rounds to a magazine! It's fun to take out to the range and run drills, also a great entry level gun for the 5.7x28 round. 


It has a special buffer tube and buffer spring so it can cycle properly with the special bolt. It can get finicky when placing a .223 upper on it with the AR57 buffer set up. Although once you find the right ammo it shoots like any other lower.

The 91/30 and M44 (without bayonet) are pristine shooters. The other 2 are cut down 91/30's, gunsmith specials that I liberated from Bubba. The Camouflage ATI one shoots well, but Bubba slightly misaligned the flash hider.
The Black one doesn't shoot, needs a new sear spring, and has a horribly cut-down stock.
I bought them to refurb and maybe rebarrel the 2, but I have gone another route.
Included with the rifles are ~40 loaded stripper clips, ~100 loose rounds, a 91/30 bayonet, tool kit and an oil bottle. 
The 4 of them are priced to move at a combined $440. Given that $200 is the going rate, this is a very discounted price for 3 working and a parts gun.

I also have 6 tins of 7.62x54R, mostly the high quality silver tip surplus.
The cheapest surplus I could find was $89.99/tin before shipping, so I will take $90.00 per tin.
A gun without ammo is an oddly shaped club, so I will not sell the ammo before the rifles are gone!"

This is a rifle made by Bushmaster they called the ""Assault Rifle"". Its design is a cross between an AK47 and an M16. It does have the stamped steel upper on the machined aluminum lower. If you know Bushmaster, you know how rare this gun is, especially with the folding stock. A 30 round aftermarket magazine is included. The fore end wood is painted black and we are assuming that it is factory paint. There are a few minor dings in the paint but there are no cracks or repairs in the wood. We have not fired the gun, but the action is smooth and strong. The bore looks good as does the bolt face. And yes, this gun is very shootable. Pictures tell the story. We respond to all requests for more information and photos."

Selling a Century Galil marked ""Golani"" on the receiver. This is one of the better builds that are out there. The fit and finish is decent while showing wear from normal handling and operation. It fires smoothly and even has a fairly crisp trigger with a decent reset. I think it might be a Tapco but I'm not certain. Despite being marked .223, it shoots 5.56 just fine. I have fired everything from Tula to Federal to Lake City through it and it runs great. It'll be hard to see this go but I am only selling for two reasons. I barely use it these days and I need money to help fix up my car (Got into a bad accident with this past snowfall). Otherwise, this has been well kept and is a very fun range gun.
