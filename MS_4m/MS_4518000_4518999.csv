(NYSE: RGR) is proud to announce the introduction of the all new RugerÂ® LC9sâ¢ pistol. The LC9sâ¢ is a striker-fired version of the award-winning LC9Â® pistol. Like the LC9Â®, the LC9sâ¢ is a slim, lightweight, personal protection pistol that is chambered in 9mm Luger. The LC9sâ¢ features a newly designed trigger mechanism with a short, light, crisp trigger pull that improves accuracy and performance.âThe RugerÂ® LC9Â® set a high standard for reliable, lightweight personal protection,â said Chris Killoy, Ruger President and Chief Operating Officer. âThe LC9sâ¢ follows the success of the LC9Â®, yet provides a new option for shooters who prefer the short, crisp trigger pull of a striker-fired pistol,â he added.The LC9sâ¢ uses the same holsters, extended magazines, lasers and accessories as the rugged and reliable LC9Â® and features a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide; a one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame with aggressive checkering; a grip extension magazine floorplate to improve handling; and a rapid acquisition, windage adjustable, 3-dot sight system.The compact, 17.2 oz. Ruger LC9sâ¢ pistol has a 3.12â³ barrel, an overall length of 6â³, a height of 4.5â³ and a slim 0.9â³ width. The compact frame and short trigger reach is designed to accommodate a wide range of hand sizes. The LC9sâ¢ offers modern safety features such as an integrated trigger safety, manual safety, magazine disconnect, inert magazine for safe disassembly and a visual inspection port that allows for visual confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber. The LC9sâ¢ ships with one 7-round magazine, a soft case and a cable locking device.  We currently have this firearm Â in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $365.

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location.Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel.Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:â¢ Manual thumb safetyâ¢ Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firingâ¢ Firing pin blockEach UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round.

With that that said i have a very nice AR-10 style rifle. approximate round count is 300. Mainly been a safe queen and only been taken to the gun range.  it was built using top of the line parts. I have over $2,800 in this build. It comes with (6) 20 round mags some still in packaging, Optics, and 320 rounds of xm80c ammo. 
I built this with the same high-grade (or better) components than Ruger or LWRC use and it's INCREDIBLE. Easily .75 MOA, probably better in the right hands. very light rifle for an ar-10 it was about 7lbs 8 ounces without the scope and everything off of it. i will include a parts list so you can see everything that has been put into this rifle.

 - Matrix Aerospace Billet matched receiver set. These are the receivers that LWRC and Ruger contract to make their rifles, they are EXTREMELY accurate and are always matched as a set so there is NO slop between the upper and lower to rattle around and throw off your groups. Armalite pattern, takes DPMS P-mags,.
- Tactical Ambush 16"" fluted match-grade bull barrel, guaranteed sub-MOA accuracy by the manufacturer, 5 groove rifling, weight 2 pounds 5 oz. This was professionally press-fitted into the receiver which is what gives these rifles such great accuracy! 
- Troy alpha aluminum light weight handguard - you decide where you want rails to save weight.
- Seekins adjustable gas block, mid-length gas system, allows you to soften recoil by perfectly adjusting gas settings

For sale is a .450 Bushmaster AR upper, just mount this upper to your standard AR-15 lower with no modifications.  Comes with three mags(holds 5rds. each), two are marked .450 Bushmaster.  When purchased new, the upper only comes with one mag, additional mags run $40 everywhere I've checked.  Great round for taking any game up to Hogzilla and if hunting in brush.  If you've been wanting one of these and can't decide between the 16"" & 20"", from all the reading I've done, there is between 60-100fps drop between the two, which is why I went with the 16"", not a big enough difference IMO to have the longer barrel and weight.  Weighs about the same as a std. AR upper in 223/5.56. 

$700 FIRM for just the upper and three mags or higher in trade value.

Or, $840 firm for the upper, three mags, 5 - 20rd.(100rds. total) boxes of Hornady 250gr. FTX and 3(sell for $10-$15ea.) extra followers that allows you to convert more and/or larger AR-15 mags to hold more rounds, higher in trade value.

Prefer cash, but will consider trades if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new along with mags and ammo for whole package.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  Clean Ruger GP100 SS 6"" .357 mag and SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

This rifle was taken on in trade. It has an internal 4rd magazine and is tapped for mounts. It is in good condition with a bit of surface rust on the barrel, but otherwise a nice rifle. I'm not sure on the value, so shoot me a fair offer.

1931 vz.24 in 8mm. This rifle is in wonderful condition for 80+ years old. Better yet, this rifle has no import marks, and is a full numbers matching rifle. An ultimate for the Mauser or Czech collector. I doubt there is a better one out there. The sling appears to be original as well. $400

1937 Mosin Nagant 91/30 in 7.62x54r. This is an Izhevesk pre-war manufacture which appears to be matching. The floorplate is forced matched however. All in all one of the better looking Mosins I've run across. $200

Yugo M24/47 Mauser in 8mm. This appears to be a refinished stock as it is very smooth and in good condition. The barrel was likely replaced during overhaul and rarely shot as the rifling is VERY crisp. The handguard does have the common crack behind the rear sight, but has been arsenal repaired with pins. Despite the bore in excellent condition, I do have an extra barrel that can go with it. $275/w barrel, $250 without.

I also have about 100-120 rounds of 1940's Turkish surplus ammo in 8mm. The rounds are headstamped, and from a little research, these were some of the better years of production. I have shot the rounds in the vz.24, the brass does split, but I haven't had an issue. The ammo is surprisingly accurate at 100 yards and will ring plates. These will come on the original cloth bandoliers. $50"

Â The 100 ATR has everything you need to make the most of the season: pinpoint accuracy, smooth action. Â A free-floating, button-rifled barrel combine to deliver a high level of accuracy unheard of in a value-priced centerfire rifle. A side lever safety is utilized for convenience and safety afield, and the all-steel, machined receiver provides the 100 ATR with positive lock-up for consistent operation. The integral synthetic trigger guard allows for easy cleaning and maintenance while the rubber recoil pad aids recoil reduction and stable positioning. Â This 30/06 calibered bolt action features a matte black synthetic stock, an LBA adjustable trigger, a top-load magazine, and a 3-9x40MM scope. Â We can definitely send more pics of the rifle if you are interested. Â Please feel free to contact us by phone or e-mail with any questions, we are more than happy to answer.

Built around our newest 18â Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precisionrequired to engage the course designerâs most difficult stages.  The V11 Pro Series carries the new SLiM Railâ¢ 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 oâclock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long, 15â rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Armyâs Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.
The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  These barrels, some of the most accurate and durable barrels available, are bead blasted and chemically passivated to resist corrosion.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0â¢ allowing for your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.
The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSAÂ® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  This precision rifle comes finished with Daniel Defense Tornadoâ¢ Cerakoteâ¢ and is furnished with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

The archangel stock on the mosin is feels fantastic in your hands and is an all around joy to shoot but i'm in the middle of a build for a rifle that i'll get a lot more enjoyment out of and could do apart with this one.

The unique LWRCIâ¢ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16â barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20â barreled upper. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-Râ¢ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

It was designed and built to be as lightweight as reasonably possible, short, and quick on and returning to the target. Empty and without optics (as shown in the picture), it weighs only 5.8 lbs . No corners were cut in this build, all component parts are new, and come from âhigh endâ manufacturers (IE: Wilson Combat, Geissele, Fathom Arms, V7 Weapons, etc). Along with doing an awful lot of research online, Iâve used many of these parts in prior builds, or on modifications to other rifles Iâve owned. Everything is subjective and we all have opinions about our guns, but in my opinion, I believe this is about the best equipment I could put together and stay under $3,000. The rifle has had exactly 20 rounds through it --10 to verify function (both slow fire and rapid fire) 5 to zero a EO Tech Holographic sight and 5 rounds to verify accuracy.  If youâre interested in seeing the parts list, or have questions, email: REDACTED and put Northtech Defense in the subject field, Iâll email you back the complete parts list that went into the build and answer any questions. Iâll ship via UPS surface to any verifiable FFL in the lower 48 states for $45. Itâs the buyers responsibility to ascertain if this rifle is legal in their state and city."

BENCHMADE INFO & SPECS
Benchmade Infidel has become the standard for high quality out the front auto knives.
The blade is D2 steel , so it is very strong. However, due to the nature of the knife, the blade is very slim, so you probably donât want to use the blade as a prybar.
This is a double action out the front knife, which is very awesome. As a result there are many springs and parts within the knife. So, you must keep this knife oiled up. This keeps the friction points and springs working smooth.
The full size Infidels are large all business knives for the field and has a pocket clip.
The mechanism that shoots the blade into the out and in positions is based on temporary friction, which allows the springs to stretch. The friction point then releases and the blade extends or retracts. The point I want to make here is to not try to do anything out of the ordinary when extending or retracting the blade. Any out of the ordinary pressure on the blade while activating it will hurt the internal spring assembly. This is true for most all double action out the front knives.

Built for strength and reliability the patent pending double-action mechanics get it done over the long haul. Grab on and you will find the handle grip rock- solid with its patented machined in PresidioÂ® style bi-directional tread pattern, and overall generous sizing for gloved hands. Intuitively pressure the release-slide forward and its spear-point edged steel fires and locks up with a unique three-point retention system with amazingly negligible blade play. Reverse the process and the blade retracts in a rapid blur of motion.
