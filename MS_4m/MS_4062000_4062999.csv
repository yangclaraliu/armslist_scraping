Don't have the bikini scope cover that came with it, therefor cannot return it. 300 bucks for the whole setup. Scope is 3x9x40. I have everything that came with it EXCEPT the bikini scope cover. The reciept is dated 12-30-14. The reciept also reflects it was a cash purchase. If you have a Leupold bikini scope cover, you can get 318 bucks back and keep the Leupold screw on flip up covers. Or, you have a scope with a lifetime warranty with a cash reciept from Gander Mountain. I did't think to look or even add this till someone asked, the scope does have slight ring marks from being mounted. It was mounted on the QD scope mount I have for sale here on armslist. If you're concerned about slight blemishes, I would suggest buying the scope mount to go with it or buy one of the same width rings and it will be a non issue. With that said, I'm lowering the price of the scope to 275.00 bucks. I stand firm on the price, I'll just keep it like I have many things I have tried to sell here on armslist at a fair price.

I have a QD scope mount listed From american defense. If you buy the scope and the scope mount I'll knock 25 bucks off the scope mount bringing the total to 375 bucks.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I will not respond to questions asking if it is, I will assume you are a scammer if you do.  NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES.

I have a rare Winchester Model 270 Deluxe for sale.  It is in new condition with no wear marks or rust of any kind.  Truly have to see it to believe the condition of this rifle.  It was manufactured between 1968 and 1973.  Serial number is B111xxx.

Winchester model 270 is chambered in .22 caliber and digests shorts, longs and long-rifle cartridges interchangeably.   The Model 270 pump action was chambered in the .22 caliber and has a tube magazine with a capacity of 16 .22 long rifles, but can hold about 21 .22 shorts.

The Winchester model 270 is relatively rare in the 200 series for Winchester rifles.  Related 200 series models include the 250, 255,  275 and 290.  The total production for all of the 200 Series family is over 1.6 million according to Winchester.

This rifle came in 2 types: The standard and the deluxe.  The Winchester 270 Deluxe was the same as the standard except has a fancy walnut Monte Carlo stock, factory sling swivels and some enhanced carving.  In certain cases, the deluxe was embellished with basket weave and oak leaf checkering and a gold trigger and safety button.  All rifles in the 200 series have a grooved receiver to accept scope mounts.

All Winchester 270s were produced with a 20.5 inch barrel, a fixed front sight, adjustable rear sight."

This is a Model 1915 Hammerless that is chambered for the .380 ACP. This pistol was developed in answer to the Colt Pocket Hammerless automatics which were outselling the Savage pistols by a wide margin. Unfortunately, changes in the ownership and management of the company and the start of WWI brought about the demise of this pistol prematurely. Manufactured between 1915-1917, total production reached just 3900 pistols and nice examples are quite hard to find today. This pistol has a 4-1/4"" barrel with chamber loaded indicator. Other interesting features include the grip safety device, last shot hold-open, and staggered-stacking box magazine holding 9 rounds."

This is an accurate pistol. Adjustable front and rear sights. Never once a FTF or FTE even with bulk .22LR ammo which is rare amongst the .22lr--it seems to cycle anything quite reliably. Cleaned after each use (complete take-down, cleaning, and oiling). Estimated date of production is somewhere between 1918 and 1933.

Up for sale is a used Arsenal SLR-107FR 7.62x39 rifle in excellent condition.  Original box, papers, and accessories are included EXCEPT the OEM magazine.  Nothing wrong with the rifle; just need to sell something to free up funds for another range toy.

http://texasguntrader.com/billofsale.pdf

Willing to meet up in North Dallas, Plano, or Richardson area.

PERFORMANCE:
Round count is 1,000, with no failures of any kind (perfect reliability with Wolf).  The rifle was cleaned after 1,000 consecutive rounds.  Accuracy is combat-good, although I have not benched it.  Trigger is meh; I'm not a fan of the Arsenal trigger.

EXTRAS:
The rifle will include some extras:
* Meprolight tritium front and rear sights.  Sights were purchased and installed Spring 2014. ($90 value) (Original sights included)
* Tromix SPG79 Bolt-On Oversize Charging Handle. ($30 value) (This is a semi-permanent modification)
* Specter Gear CQB Sling w/Emergency Release, AK-47 Full Stock - Black. ($30 value)
* 6 Magpul PMAG 30 AK/AKM MOE Magazine AK-47 7.62x39mm 30-Round Polymer Black. (Reliability not tested; I had to shave off some of the polymer to get these to fit and after that I didn't trust them.  I'm not factoring these into the price of the package, but I paid about $90 for these)

NOT INCLUDED:
* OEM 10-round magazine.

COSMETICS:
* Minor nicks on the sight base. (Happened when I was installing the night sights)
* Scratching of the finish on the rear sight leaf spring. (Also happened during night sight installation)
* Wear to the finish on the dust cover retention piece.

I bought this ACOG 2 months ago for $1200 + tax, mounted it on my AR and took it to the range once for about 90 rounds.  I have decided i am going the VCOG route instead.  It is in perfect condition.  I am asking $1100 and would consider some trades.  The only ""need"" I have is for a Glock 19 Gen 4 but I will consider others.

   I have a my Glenfield 75C for sale or trade. It's a great .22lr rifle for plinking or dispatching pests. It has a 14+1rd tubular magazine, semi auto. Has eyes for a strap, and steel sights. It was my 'go to' yard rifle, but has been replaced. I always thought it'd be a great first rifle for the younger sportsman... or someone who wants to use it for plinking, etc. She's not a beauty queen (which helps when you drag it into the woods), but accurate and dependable!

I'm always interested in trades (can add some cash for what I want). All set on .22lr, but wouldn't mind some other kind of pistol. Let me know what you have. I will only sell to 18+, Vermont residents (with proof) who are legal to own a firearm and will sign a bill of sale."

-556-1/2-28
The advanced SureFire SF3P-556-1/2-28 three-prong flash hider, which fits M4/M16 weapons and variants with 1/2x28 muzzle threads, features a patent-pending design that greatly reduces muzzle flash—typically greater than 99%—when compared with a plain muzzle. Boasting robust tines built to withstand the rigors of combat, the SF3P-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command. 

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—and including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SF3P-556-1/2-28 flash hider is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning, even after extreme use. 

When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SF3P-556-1/2-28 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and to prevent the audible ringing of tines inside the suppressor. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. 

SureFire flash hiders are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment and are covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. 

FITS: M4, M16 and variants 

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm/.223 caliber sound suppressors 

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, flash hider/suppressor adapters, and muzzle brake/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

The rifle is supposed to be stocked from Walnut or Elm, not sure which but it's a good old hardwood stock with minor dings on it but was refinished over the dings. Like I said it looks as if it were never issued after it was refurbed with a new barrel. Serials were force matched when it was rebuilt.

 Unfortunately I lost the front sight hood. They don't cost much to replace, but aren't much good out in the woods anyway. I will include ammunition, dies and reloading components at no extra cost.

The heavy, free-floated barrel is 25"" long with a 1 in 16"" twist.  

I'm the original owner of it having purchased it from the CMP in 2012.  It is in LNIB condition with no rust or flaws except for the slight razor scratch on the left side of the stock (4th photo but can barely see it). 

Includes original box, manual, adjustable front and rear sights with front sight inserts, three stock spacers, front sling swivel, and CMP certificate of authenticity.

Trigger is adjustable although I've never played with it so it is at the factory setting.  I've put exactly 395 rounds through it.  Even from the first outing I was amazed at how tight the groups were for a half-assed shot like myself.

Reason for selling is to prune the collections as I prefer a lighter rifle for target shooting like my CZ 452.

Price is $650 OBO. No trades please.

Must be 18+, Ohio resident, and legal to own a handgun. CCL holders preferred. We will both sign a dual party bill of sale and each get a copy. Can meet in Polaris near where I work or in Canal Winchester near where I live. 

More details are below from the CMP's original website:
""Top quality U.S.-made smallbore target rifles have been a scarce commodity for many years. Winchester decided in the late 1970s that annual sales of the legendary Model 52 target gun, seldom numbering in the hundreds, were insufficient to justify continued production.

Since then the 40X rifles made in Remington's custom shop have been the only smallbore guns made by a major U.S. manufacturer. German makers, especially Anschutz, have dominated the field. Most U.S. manufacturers have abandoned the smallbore target rifle, but a government contract helped Kimber.

With the help of a big U.S. government contract, Kimber of Oregon has set out to change the situation. The firm won a contract to make 20,000 .22 rimfire target rifles, all capable of firing .700"" or smaller groups at 50 yds. with target ammunition.

With completion of government deliveries near, Kimber now is offering the gun to the civilian market. This rifle differs from the military version only in that the sight set is an optional accessory that most smallbore shooters will, no doubt, want to order with the rifle.

The loading platform of the singleshot Model 82 is inserted in the receiver and incorporates the ejector. The action is securely fastened to the stock by a pair of heavy screws; one through the rear of the steel trigger guard into the rear tang and the other through the handstop rail into the recoil lug. The recoil lug is dovetailed to the receiver, which is grooved to accept the rear sight.

Most of the Australian-made rear sight components are steel, with the housing and mounting bar made of a non-ferrous alloy. The mounting base secures to the corresponding receiver dovetail with two heavy clamping screws. The entire mounting system appears abundantly secure and allows the sight to be removed and reinstalled with minimal impact change.

The adjustment knobs are heavily grooved for easy turning and are located at the top and left side of the sight. Each is clearly marked for direction and scale, allowing easy return to any previous setting. The adjustments are faithful to their claimed 1/5 minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments. No backlash was n6ted.

The front sight is of the standard globe type and is made of a non-ferrous alloy. The 10 interchangeable inserts and the screw-in sight face and back are steel. The three post sizes and seven apertures that make up the front sight insert set seem adequate for shooting at most ranges and under varying light conditions.

The safety lever is typical of Kimber sporting .22s and is ""rolled"" on and off to positive stops. It cannot be applied unless the action is cocked. The bolt handle is not locked when the safety is applied.

The trigger assembly is fully adjustable for weight of pull, overall travel and sear engagement. The manufacturer cautions against making adjustments before reading and understanding the pertinent instructions; and then that adjustment be undertaken only by an experienced gunsmith or armorer.

The three trigger adjusting screws (accessible after the barrelled action has been removed from the stock) are each provided with two locking screws. An inspection port allows viewing of the sear/trigger engagement.

The instruction book states that rifles are shipped with triggers adjusted to a pull weight between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs., and that the trigger should not be adjusted to less than 2 lbs. Notwithstanding all that, the sample rifle tested at a very crisp 3 lbs., and no further adjustment was deemed necessary.

The instructions further state that the rifle should not be dry-fired, but it may be uncocked by holding the trigger to the rear as the bolt is closed.

The cylindrical 25"" barrel, factory fitted with three sight bases (for scope mounts and the front sight) has a diameter of .928"". It has a 1 in 16"" righthand twist and is completely freefloated.

The manufacturer warns against the use of all types of Short, Long or hypervelocity cartridges.

Three buttstock spacers allow the length of pull to be adjusted between 117/8"" and 133/8"". The fore-end's accessory rail accepts the factory-supplied round hand stop.
Fit and finish were in keeping with other target arms in this price range. All metal parts were well polished and nicely blued. The walnut stock had some visible figure and a low-luster finish. There were a few extremely small bubbles in the stock finish that could easily be compounded out.

The Kimber Model 82 was fired for accuracy, with results shown in the accompanying table, and function-fired with a variety of ammunition. There were no failures of any kind, and accuracy results showed the Kimber test rifle capable of staying within the 10ring of the 50-yd. and 50-meter targets used in conventional smallbore competition.""

I have a 6 month old Mac 11 and six 35 round magazines. I have fired 200 rounds through the pistol, enough to make sure each clip works. I also have 200 rounds 9mm for the next range trip. The pistol is top cocking and has a threaded barrel. It has a fake surpressor barrel extension and a forward rail for which attachments can be added.

The pistol is a blast to shoot and surprisingly accurate. I'm looking to upgrade to an assault rifle and want to see what options there are besides buying one outright.
