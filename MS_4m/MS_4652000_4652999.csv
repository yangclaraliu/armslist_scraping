The gun has only had about 500 rounds down the barrel, and has been very well maintained and cleaned after every visit to the range. This was my every day carry gun for about a year. Action is smooth. Gun comes with the following: 2x 15-round magazines, 150 rounds of ball ammo, 21 rounds of hollow points, handgun box, light, six snap caps (the picture shows 3 but I have 6), Comp-Tac IWB holster, cloth IWB holster, and a bore snake.

I'm asking $450. I'm valuing the gun at $350 with the two mags (they're $40 a pop new) and light; and everything else at $100 (the holster alone cost me $120), which is low. I've seen the gun and one standard mag (10 rounds) sell between $250 and $300 over the past month on gunbroker.

I'm selling it because I started carrying a .380 and haven't carried the 40 in about a year (it has been cleaned every other month). Will consider trades or trade+cash. I'm really looking for a revolver - either .38 spcl or .357 mag, or something small, like a Kel-Tec.

The perforations on the grip are a little worn and there is some discoloring from sweat on the slide (hence, why I bought the Comp-Tac holster because the blue was coming off), about an inch worth on one side next to the muzzle. Nothing outside of normal use."

This gun was purchased, and taken to the range twice, with under 200 rounds fired.  It fired every round flawlessly, and is surprisingly accurate for a short barreled handgun.  It has been cleaned and lubricated, and a safe queen in my humidity controlled safe ever since.  

Comes with all original paperwork, manuals, safety locks (unopened) Hard Plastic case with the holster, mag holders, as seen in image.   I have the original sales receipt in my name.  Has one flush 9 round magazine, and one extended 12 round magazine.

Perfect condition, no scratches or idiot marks. 

Will meet locally at a FFL of your choice to do the paperwork, you pay the transfer fee, and applicable sales tax, if required.

Do not waste my time or yours asking me if I will sell it to you directly, or for less.  I WILL NOT.

*************If you don't want to buy the gun and fill out the FFL paperwork, look elsewhere. No exceptions, period.  The gun is in my name, and I will not sell it without a legal transfer under any circumstances.****************  

I don't care if you have a CPL, are a former or current police officer, veteran, or were the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.  I don't care if you've bought 10 guns without going through a FFL process, this gun will not be sold unless it gets legally transferred.  It is the law, and I'm not going to get in trouble transferring a gun illegally.  GO ELSEWHERE if that is what you're looking for !  


Will ship to a FFL of your choice, if you're out of state or too far away to meet me around Kent / King County.  You pay the FFL fee, and shipping cost including full value insurance via UPS.  Will ship after your USPS Money order is received, and cashed.  Sorry, No personal checks.

$300.00 Firm, or best offer above that.  (This is definitely STILL worth well over 300.00, I paid 649.00 plus tax for it, and it is just like new, since under 200 rounds isn't even broken in yet)  Look around, and you'll see that this gun retails for well over 500.00, and around 550.00 in many cases, and most people are selling theirs for more than this.  Priced for a fast sale.


For Local buyers meeting at a gunstore to do the FFL paperwork, I will accept Cash only.

I can also sell it via Gunbroker.com if you prefer.  I have an A+ (13) rating there.

If you want to meet up to see it and buy it contingent on it being as described, your email should list your upcoming available dates and times, and the gun dealer in King County where you'd like to meet at those times.  If your email doesn't include this, it will be politely ignored.

Check out the gun at your local gun store, and buy this one instead and save $$$$$.  You will not be disappointed."

A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle. From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil. Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

Cyclone 7.62mm Silencer MFG # 101228Advanced Armament Corp. Cyclone 7.62mm Silencer MFG # 101228The rigidly simple threaded mounting design provides reliable precision accuracy with minimal and repeatable zero-shift. Extraordinary sound and recoil reduction are two of the instant benefits of the CYCLONE silencer. Durability is maximized by fully CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed fire possible. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. EDM technology is utilized as a final step to ensure precise bore alignment and enhance accuracy. The elimination of approximately 95% of the muzzle report nullifies the need for ear protection, facilitates field communications, and masks the location of the user.*NOT FOR USE ON SCAR 17 OR RUGER SCOUT*This silencer was designed for precision rifles and is not intended to be a direct thread replacement of our quick detach 7.62mm silencers.SpecificationsCaliber: 7.62 NATO, 300 BLKWeight: 22.4 ozLength: 9.5""Length added: 8.75""Diameter: 1.50""Finish: Cerakote™Sound Reduction: 30-33dBMount: 5/8-24, M18x1Materials: Inconel 718 & 316L SS"

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.

Accessory Rail
Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

This gun would be perfect for anyone seeking a competition-ready pistol for target or action sports, but equally useful for carry and home defense. This is a big, no-compromise 1911 with a great trigger, made of the highest quality materials. You can shoot this pistol for the rest of your life, and then pass it down to your children.

I'm open to reasonable cash offers, or trades for other defense oriented weapons of high quality. Please understand that you are trading against a NEW pistol that is priced accordingly, but still at a significant discount from the retail price. Those offering cash will always do better than those looking to trade, that is just how gun buying works. 

Please do not waste my time or yours making ridiculously low offers, this is not a distress sale. The only reason I am selling/trading this gun is that I have a Colt that is very similar to this gun already, and I am looking for something different.

I also have a limited supply of some new Speer Gold Dot 230 grain JHP ammo I can make available with this pistol in the right deal."

ATF Ruling 82-3

The KG-9 pistol is a machinegun as defined in the National Firearms Act.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has examined a firearm identified as the KG-9 pistol. The KG-9 is a 9 millimeter caliber, semiautomatic firearm which is blowback operated and which fires from the open bolt position with the bolt incorporating a fixed firing pin. In addition, a component part of the weapon is a disconnector which prevents more than one shot being fired with a single function of the trigger.

The disconnector is designed in the KG-9 pistol in such a way that a simple modification to it, such as cutting, fitting, or grinding, allows the pistol to operate automatically. Thus, this simple modification to the disconnector together with the configuration of the above design features (blowback operation, firing from the open bolt position, and fixed firing pin) in the KG-9 permits the firearm to shoot automatically, more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The above combination of design features as employed in the KG-9 is normally not found in the typical sporting firearm.

The National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), defines a machinegun to include any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.

The ""shoots automatically"" definition covers weapons that will function automatically. The ""readily restorable"" definition defines weapons which previously could shoot automatically but will not in their present condition. The ""designed"" definition includes those weapons which have not previously functioned as machineguns but possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by simple modification or elimination of existing component parts.

Held: The KG-9 pistol is designed to shoot automatically more than one shot, without function of the trigger. Consequently, the KG-9 pistol is a machinegun as defined in section 5845(b) of the Act.

With respect to the machinegun classification of the KG-9 pistol under the National Firearms Act, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7805(b), this ruling will not be applied to KG-9 pistols manufactured before January 19, 1982. Accordingly, KG-9 pistols manufactured on or after January 19, 1982, will be subject to all the provisions of the National Firearms Act and 27 C.F.R. Part 179.

The G41 Gen4 is a practical-tactical .45 caliber pistol designed to
maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. It
is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces
lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help
to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes
it more accurate for competition or duty use. The surface of the frame
employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured
technology. The modular backstrap design lets you instantly customize its
grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size.

The M40 was designed from the ground-up as a .40 handgun, the story goes that the designer, Wilhelm Bubits, originally worked for Glock and that this (the M40) was his view of the next generation of polymer pistols.

Comes with 2 mags, safety keys, factory case and manuals.

Finish is good. Only issue is the front piece of the ejector broke (common with 870's). Sometimes you need to double rack to eject a spent shell as it gets caught due to the missing piece. Gun fires fine. 

The gun has the upgraded milled extractor used in the wingmaster and police models that I put in about 3 months ago.

To fix the ejector one needs to drill out the rivets holding it in place. It isn't very hard but it's not a simple drop in. If you have experience doing this job or are a decent gunsmith/handyman come get this 870 on the cheap. The parts needed cost $20

The 90-Two stems from the M92 (aka the M9, the US military’s standard issued pistol) and shares several features with the model such as an open slide design, so the barrel is shows through. It has an external hammer that when cocked back changes the trigger pull from a double-action (long pull) to a single-action (short pull). Its ambidextrous safety also acts as a de-cocking lever. A second safety feature is a visible automatic firing pin block that prevents discharge if it’s accidentally dropped. And three-dot fixed sights. 

Where it differs, it has an interchangeable front sight and a Picatinny rail for mounting lights or lasers. Lastly, it has a techno-polymer grip that’s lightweight and designed for an ergonomically friendly hold. The grip is available in a standard or slim size.

Quote:
ATF Ruling 82-3

The KG-9 pistol is a machinegun as defined in the National Firearms Act.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has examined a firearm identified as the KG-9 pistol. The KG-9 is a 9 millimeter caliber, semiautomatic firearm which is blowback operated and which fires from the open bolt position with the bolt incorporating a fixed firing pin. In addition, a component part of the weapon is a disconnector which prevents more than one shot being fired with a single function of the trigger.

The disconnector is designed in the KG-9 pistol in such a way that a simple modification to it, such as cutting, fitting, or grinding, allows the pistol to operate automatically. Thus, this simple modification to the disconnector together with the configuration of the above design features (blowback operation, firing from the open bolt position, and fixed firing pin) in the KG-9 permits the firearm to shoot automatically, more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The above combination of design features as employed in the KG-9 is normally not found in the typical sporting firearm.

The National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), defines a machinegun to include any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.

The ""shoots automatically"" definition covers weapons that will function automatically. The ""readily restorable"" definition defines weapons which previously could shoot automatically but will not in their present condition. The ""designed"" definition includes those weapons which have not previously functioned as machineguns but possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by simple modification or elimination of existing component parts.

Held: The KG-9 pistol is designed to shoot automatically more than one shot, without function of the trigger. Consequently, the KG-9 pistol is a machinegun as defined in section 5845(b) of the Act.

With respect to the machinegun classification of the KG-9 pistol under the National Firearms Act, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7805(b), this ruling will not be applied to KG-9 pistols manufactured before January 19, 1982. Accordingly, KG-9 pistols manufactured on or after January 19, 1982, will be subject to all the provisions of the National Firearms Act and 27 C.F.R. Part 179.

This is a very nice rifle, beautiful stock, nice feel, looks almost new. The blueing is spotless. I have never fired this rifle that I can recall. I remember my dad being happy with its performance, and my dad was not happy with groups over Â¾â at 150 yards or more from his high powers.I am sure it has not seen many rounds as he had a 22-250, 243, 270 and a couple others that he generally shot and went to the field (this gun has not been in the field). It has likely not been fired since the late 1980âs since I have 54 re-loads dated 10/88 (included with the rifle), The price also includes a small bag of .270 brass that has been fireformed ,Vols. 1 and 2 of P.

Bio - White Hunter, Model 6377. Made in 1956. This is the first year of introduction for this model. Acid etching is on the left side marked "" For The White Hunter"" with PUMA Germany and PUMA logo etched on the ricasso. There were two variations for this model. The blade etching occurred on the left and right side. We do not know which side was introduced first. The PUMA® White Hunter knife is handmade in Solingen, Germany, and has long set the standard for the ultimate hunting knife. The PUMA White Hunter was developed in 1956 in conjunction with the East African Professional Hunter’s Association to be the leading knife for big game hunting. 
The PUMA White Hunter’s featured stag handles – which are made from the shed antlers of Wild Stag – are formed via a meticulous manufacturing process and make the knife a truly unique, one-of-a-kind tool. First, each scale is boiled, stabilized, and dried over a period of weeks. Then, the handle is individually cut and hand fitted to your knife. Brass rivets are used to attach the scales to the knife. The rivet heads are filed and, finally, the handle is burnished to a precise size and shape for optimal fit and function. 
The PUMA blade is German-grade 1.4116 stainless steel for sharpness retention, toughness, and corrosion resistance. During formation of the initial steel bars, trace elements such as carbon, chromium and silicon are added to maintain the temper yet inhibit rust. Other trace elements, such as manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, and molybdenum, are also added to give the blade better structural strength and consistency by aligning the molecules more evenly during cooling. After the initial steel bars are formed, the blade is hot-drop forged, wherein the steel bars are heated to 3150-4200 degrees Fahrenheit. Once heated, the blade is placed between two dies and mechanically forged under 2200 pounds of pressure to fit the shape of the dies. The hot drop forging process not only shapes the blade, but it also further improves the molecular structure of the steel. Once the PUMA blade is forged, it is tempered and hand finished in 22 separate steps by skilled craftsmen. Each step uses increasingly fine lubricants, oil coolants, and special polishing grease."
