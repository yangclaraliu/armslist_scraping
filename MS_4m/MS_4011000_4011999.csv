Comes with two 10rd magazines, trigger lock with two keys, instruction manual and warranty information. Comes with Sccy's ""no questions asked"" warranty that is good for the lifetime of the gun, not the owner. These guns are made of quality materials. I have one with an Armalaser TR10 laser that I use as my daily carry gun. I like the size, weight, and the 10+1 capacity along with the lifetime warranty. I have two for sale NIB with consecutive serial numbers, the other one is for sale in a different ad if interested. Sorry I am unable to take credit cards. Payment can be made by USPS or regular money order, cashiers check, personal check (shipping will be delayed until check clears) or via PistolPay (they will charge both of us 2.75% fee). This is my first ad on Armslist so please check my feedback on Ebay (brillo72) and buy with confidence and help me build feedback here. If you reside in Indiana you can save the shipping charge by meeting me at an FFL who is willing to collect the 7% sales tax, within 10 miles of Greenfield IN, as I am not set up to collect sales tax. $13 shipping to your FFL in lower 48 US states only. Please contact me with any questions. Thanks, David"

- Has magazine floor-plate for quick (and safe) unloading of live rounds and metal loop sling hardware installed in stock on the front and back.  
- Has adjustable rear iron sights with hooded and ramped front sight.  
- Has elevated stock on left side for ""cheek"" contact area with stock. 
- Also has ""camo. tape"" on some parts of it to reduce glare for improved odds during hunting.   
- Serial #B628xxxx  (Purchased New by Original sole owner.).
- Never recalled for anything.  Serial number was checked online with manufacturer whom confirmed that it is not under recall for any issue.     Does NOT have a X-Mark Pro® (“XMP®”) trigger.

- This rifle shoots close to a Minute-of-angle (MOA) (say ariound 1.1 inches at 100 yards) with both commercial Federal or Remington 150 & 130 grain ammo from a rest.  
- It has taken a running deer at 375 yards (kneeling position while using a ""quick sling"") and -- also a flying turkey at 90 yards (standing position while using a ""quick sling"").  
- I've never had any trouble with it and it ""gets the job done"".  I don't get the chance to go out and hunt alot like I used to so I'm considering selling this great rifle (at the right price).  
- To sell it I will require a Face-to-Face meeting (FTF) in a cash deal.  Will not ship (at this time).
- I will need to see a VA driver's license and a utility bill with matching name and address on it.   
- Will need to sign a bill of sale with a legiible signature.  The bill of sale will also state something like ""I assert and affirm that I'm legally allowed to possess and own a firearm.""

(Note: Scope and mounts are not included) 

Ammunition used with this rifle: 
- Remington Express Core-Lokt 270 Win, 130 Gr. Core-Lokt PSP 
- & Federal Ammo too.
** Each deer season, usually would shoot a box of 20 for checking the sights and target practice plus an additional round or two while taking game.
** When first purchased proabably shot about 3-4 boxes of 20 rounds through it at the range to check out it's great performance.
** The 130 Grain bullet is real ""flat shooting"" and when zeroed for 225 yards one can ""shoot a deer"" if they ""see a deer"" (without pausing to use a range finder unless the target is ""really distant"" of course)."

About Crosman:
In 1923 in Rochester, New York, Crosman was founded as Crosman Arms Company. From its inception, Crosman's principal products were airguns and airgun ammunition. During the 1950s, new accounts included Sears Roebuck & Co., Montgomery Ward, and Western Auto, all of which sold Crosman's products under their respective brand names.

In 1966, Crosman introduced its own Crosman brand airgun, the Crosman Pumpmaster 760, which has sold more than 11 million units to date. Crosman Corporation is now an international designer, manufacturer, and marketer of Crosman pellet, BB, airsoft rifles and pistols, Copperhead ammunition, and Benjamin pellet rifles and ammunition."

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

I put about 200 rounds through my gun with this system installed but recently switched back to the factory components for a consistent feel across all of my M&Ps. The only part that shows any sign of wear is the top face of the sear, some slight discoloration from the firing pin “hook” dragging overtop of it everytime the slide cycles, totally normal, your current sear gets the same wear, I just couldn’t get my camera to focus on it.

$55 cash gets you:
fully machined sear for 9mm/40S&W/.357Sig
2x sear springs (1/16"" and 1/8"" diameter depending on what revision sear block you have)
ultimate striker block
ultimate striker block spring
talon tactical striker block tool
4lb trigger return spring
Little rounded nose pin to assist in trigger spring installation (forgot to put it in the pictures)

I'm selling my 582 series Ruger Mini 14.  It has the Birch wood stock and blued steel on it.  It comes with six total magazines, two Ruger 5 rd, two Ruger 20 rd and 2 steel 30 round mags (not Ruger brand but they are great for plinking).  I purchased it last summer and haven't really shot it all that much, 150-200 rounds, so needless to say it's in great shape.  It's your basic ranch rifle setup with lots of potential for modification or just enjoy this classy gal the way she is.  The only thing I did to the rifle was to put the Choate heat shield on it because I like the looks of it better.  I still have the original Ruger shield to go with the rifle.       

If the add is up then the rifle is still available.  I'm not really looking for any trades right now, just cash.

The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

From what I read, it should be 1861, but I could be wrong. Most of the finish looks correct, the action works fine, and the hammer goes into both positions, the cylinder does spin and line up when its cocked, however you can freely spin it backwards? There is a piece missing on the barrel that holds the loading lever from falling down. Barrel shows some sort of stippling up and down, I found 2 other pictures of this gun, and they both showed the same marks, I couldn't tell you what its from. looking down the barrel, the bore is dark, but the rifling is sharp and present. 400.00 takes it, willing to ship.

It's a .223/5.56 rifle that takes any standard AR mag, from the military metal ones to PMags and the like.  In addition, it can fold in half for easy storage (but it cannot fire while folded).  The forearm does double-duty as a built-in bipod.  It's ready for your favorite optic with its picatinny rail on top.

For sale is a new, in the box, never fired Savage Axis 223 SR tactical / carbine rifle. SR means suppressor ready.  These are not too common & are EXTREMELY versatile.  Where can I start? This model is perfect for backpacking because it is so light with a carbine barrel. It is also perfect you the youth or lady in your brood. It is light, short, & almost no recoil whatsoever. 

 As mentioned before, this particular model has a threaded barrel for a suppressor or flash arrestor.  As of 2015 it is now legal to hunt in the state of Georgia with a suppressor (Coyotes take note)! 223 is quickly becoming the round for everything from deer on down. Deer, wild hog, coyote, & of course, all small varmint. This round packs WAY plenty power for deer hunting. This is my go to round now for just about everything.  Check out the January 2015 Field & Stream Article on smaller Cartridges are now the way to go.

My father had a rifle just like this one.  It was his pride and joy, and it hung high on the wall for my entire growing up years.  When he passed away, I inherited it.  In 2004, this heirloom rifle was stolen from my home in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, along with 15 other firearms.  Over the past several years, I have been working at recovering firearms like the ones stolen from me.  This work has been successful so far, but very slow and difficult.  There are still some guns I am working hard to find, and haven't had any luck so far.

In researching what this 7mm Mauser might be worth today, and I've discovered that it's valued at between $250 & $500.  I am willing to negotiate, of course.

This is yet other attempt at PLEADING for your assistance in helping me restore the gun collection--ALL family heirlooms--that was so callously taken from my family.

This pistol has only been removed from its case for photos and is 100% NEW IN BOX! This beautiful Colt USMC 1911 is part of a 'Complete Package' including the desirable Pelican Case w/ outer cardboard shipping box, (2) Magazines, Cleaning Kit, Owners Manuals, Test Target, Colt Lock & Hang Tag! As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!

Hey all,
	I have available a Great condition 357 Magnum revolver. This is a Taurus 6 shot revolver with fully adjustable rear sight. This is a great shooter and really only needs a good cleaning to be ready for a lifetime of service with you! This also comes with two speed loaders and has pachymr grips installed. I also have two boxes of JHP 357 mag ammo I can sell at cost as well if you need some. I would keep this, but I’ve decided i want a different 357 model. I would also consider trades for cheaper AKs or ARs. I am willing to add boot to even the value if needed, but please be reasonable on your values and i will as well. Also open to other offers so feel free to message me on it. (No BP, No 40 cals, No 22s). 
	This is for pick up in Norman only due to my schedule. For any questions or for offers please shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.

Hey everyone, 
	I have available for trade/sale a awesome little 22 rifle. This is a Harrington & Richardson Model 750 Pioneer 22 cal rifle. It can shoot shorts, longs, or long rifles. It is a Single shot bolt action gun that is in really good condition. It has irony adjustable sights and a Pine Ridge 2-7X32 scope installed. The gun has norman use marks and the scope has some scratches, but in all this is a very good setup. This would be fantastic for a kid learning the basics or even for a seasoned shooter who loves to collect the oldies. I have not shot this myself but the action is nice and smooth and the previous owner says it runs fantastic. I would keep this but I simply don’t need another 22 rifle and would rather it went to a better home.
	The only trades I would consider would be for 7.62x25 tokarev pistols (M57 model or CZ model),  a cheap lever gun, certain revolvers, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a text, worst I can say is no. This is for pickup in Norman only due to my schedule. (please no 22LR unless a ruger semi, and no blackpowder)
	To shoot an offer or for any questions shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.

With a lighter DAO trigger, this pistol is reliable and safe with no external safety, which when combined with the SIGLITE night sights let you hit your target quickly and accurately.
