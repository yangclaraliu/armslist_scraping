I have put maybe 100 rounds total through this gun.  Never had one FTF and I tried several types of ammo including reloads.

The P230 was replaced by the P232, so this is becoming more of a collector's item since it is no longer manufactured.  

It has been a flawless shooter and very accurate for a small .380.  I will also include a box of Gold Dots and Galco IWB leather holster.  Comes with one Sig factory mag (holds 7).

Like most match ammo, these rounds produce a subsonic, or ""standard,"" muzzle velocity of about 1,050 feet per second.

SK ammunition is made in Germany by Nammo, a Scandinavian defense contractor. Their match grade rimfire ammo is regarded alongside Eley and CCI as some of the best in the world.

The shotgun is obviously used, this is reflected in the less than perfect finish. The shotgun has a 5 round magazine and is equipped with a 28 inch barrel with built in modified choke. I recently bought this and have only fired 100 rounds of mixed type. Despite the finish wear this shotgun has preformed flawlessly for me the short time that I have owned it. This shotgun is ONLY chambered for standard 2 3/4 inch shells and NOT 3 inch. I need this sold ASAP. Please email or text only.

These pistols are excellent and for a fraction of the cost of a ""name brand"" 1911. I've had nothing but great guns from RIA and would recommend them to anyone on a budget. Anyway, the pistol is in great shape, cleaned after every range session. If you do buy this pistol, clean it with CLP, under NO circumstances do you put any copper based lubricant on it. You will destroy the nickel. I've put probably 300~ rounds through it of various brands from Commie garbage Tula to Winchester, Fiocchi, Speer, etc. only one stove pipe (and surprise surprise it was a Tula casing!).

A little but of wearing from holster and use but nothing a tender polishing couldn't fix.

Purchase of this pistol comes with an Alien Gear IWB conceal carry holster, two 7rd Remington magazines, the original RIA 8rd magazine, and 14rds of hollow point ammo. The pistol also has on it Hogue false ivory grips. They are secured with locktite to prevent loosening (a heat gun can easily fix this should you want to remove the grips). Makes for a very fine looking pistol for which I've received multiple compliments.

I'm not desperate to sell it. I don't *need* the money, and I am not accepting any trades of any kind. Cash only. Must be 21, meet face to face and provide a driver's license and sign a bill of sale. No exceptions to this.

Price is $550 firm. If you're going to offer lower or offer a trade, don't bother even posting. I will NOT accept or even acknowledge your offer.

Thanks for viewing!"

Did some research and new pricing averages about $800. Dropped my price accordingly. 

Full disclosure: the KSG has been a problem child for Kel Tec, but this gun is a later model and the kinks have been worked out. It is finicky with ammo and I've found that Win Super X 2 3/4 bird cycles perfectly so long as you don't short stroke the pump. I've had no problems with any slugs or buck. 

The inside of the stock is slightly chipped and to buy a new half will cost $20. Easy to replace. I didn't bother because it doesn't affect function or appearance. 

To make up for the broken stock I am including the Sig red dot, UTG riser and the Magpul vertical grip. Also included is original box and paperwork/manual. 

Cash is king and price is firm. However I would trade for a Beretta M9 or 92FS plus cash or a Mossberg JM plus cash. 

Non gun items I'd be willing to negotiate for would be an XBox 360 or XBox One, plus cash or barter to have some gravel/stone spread in my driveway.

I had stock fitted and altered to be field stripped without tools bolt shaved for easy install of mags and mags fitted to sks also had to fit scope mount to top of rifle back piece and fit aftermarket back piece to sks so I have a bad ass modern day assault rifle that is more accurate than ak and has a bigger punch than your civilian made ar shit they make today this was mad for military use clean heavy 21"" barrel scope attaches with the pull of back lever for long distance and see through dot sight attatches to front top rail for close encounters 

So yes I know you can get a shitty sks that jams mags don't fit can't get mags in whole nine yards I get it so I don't need all the idiots chiming in go buy your unreliable 400 chinese shit cause I don't want to here it

879,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4383879,For Sale:  Pre-Ban M1A All USGI w/ Ultra-Rare USMC DMR Scope Mount,"Lawrence, Kansas, United States","$ 1,800","Listed On: Sunday, July 5, 2015",Rifles,Springfield                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a 1993 produced rifle with every part being USGI, except for the Springfield Armory receiver. USGI parts are highly sought after by M1A enthusists. These USGI parts include:
Winchester Apr. 1963 produced barrel (Chrome lined and mirror bright)
HRA marked Op rod
HRT bolt
BME and WC rear sight assembly
HR Trigger assembly with a mix of SA and HR parts. 
USGI front site with bayonet lug

The rarest of the USGI parts on this rifle is the GG&G US Marine Corps scope mount. These were built for the USMC when they brought the M14 out of the warehouses and began using them for designated marksman rifles. There are pictures online from Marines using them on duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and also in the 90's. These were built specifically for the USMC as noted by that on the scope mount. A handful were sold to private individuals by GG&G at some point during the run. So few were sold that a prominent M14 book stated none were sold to the public, and was edited to show the opposite on future editions. The name of the book escapes me, or I would have written it for completeness. 

So what this rifle is, is as near an original copy as possible to an issued M14 from the early Vietnam war as possible without changing the receiver. And it gets even better than that when you add the USMC scope mount. It then becomes the closest copy of the M14 as it re-entered active service with the Marine Corps as a designated marksman rifle.

For the full price it comes with everything in picture one; USGI wood stock, a USGI fiberglass stock with the selector switch hole filled in my Springfield Armory, current USGI sling, 4 new unused USGI Checkmate Industries 20 round M14 magazines, 1 5 round Checkmate Industries magazine, and a 1990's chinese M14 magazine (which has been flawless), and all the tools shown to dis/reassemble the rifle. The rifle has been shimmed and worked on to increase the accuracy. It is a great shooter, and I really do not need to sell/trade the rifle, but I want to start another project. 

Also open to offers."

I never thought that I would sell my Cooper in 223 but I am in the midst of a kitchen remodel as well as a bathroom project and I tend to use those more than this bolt gun.

The rifle was purchased in 2008 with an upgraded AAA claro Walnut stock as well as the fluted barrel. I added the USO mount and stuck a Zeiss scope on their for the first few years I owned the rifle and then moved out of country. When I came back I mounted the Zeiss on an AR, the reason for the mount. 

It's seen rougly 400rds and always proved a shooter with 52gr SMK, 52gr bergers, as well as 50 and 55 gr VMAX. The rifle isn't a safe queen. It does have knicks and a small crack in the stock that I've attempted to document in the photos. If you are curious about accuracy, I've consistenly shot in the .2s at 100yds and .6 at 200yds (range limit). My best 200yd group was with 52gr SMK and measured .4"" for a 5-shot run.

Rifle comes with a derlin Lucas bore guide.

It has the pinned barrel and recessed cylinder heads, adjustable rear sight.  These are getting harder to find in this condition and makes a versatile carry gun as well. Chambered in .357 Magnum but of course can shoot any .38 special load too.  This safe queen has not been out much and has hardly been fired since new. The action is smooth and lock up is tight. Super nice trigger as well. Simply a gorgeous example of a classic S&W.
