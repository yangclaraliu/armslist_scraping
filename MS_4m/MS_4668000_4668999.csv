I really enjoy shooting it, but I am wanting something new, and prefer to keep my AR-15s

Gun started life as a Yugo M85NP AK pistol, 5.56x45, 10.5"" chrome lined barrel. A 6.5"" faux barrel extension was blind pinned (total length is 16.7"" when measured from the bolt face to the end of the barrel extension). The rear trunnion was drilled and the gun was fitted with an ACE skeleton stock. A wedge kit was used, the rear trunnion is angled on these guns, so the wedge corrects the stock angle and gives a stronger mounting point for the stock than tapping the rear trunnion would. The entire gun was stripped and duracoated black, so everything is one uniform color. 

The handguard was replaced with a Manticore Arms renegade handguard and the grip was replaced with a Magpul AK grip, both are black. The only real downside of this gun (if you can even call it one) is that it MUST be used with US made magazines to remain 922R compliant. The handguard, stock and grip are 3 parts, and the magazine would be another 3, giving the 6 total required for an AK. It didn't bother me much as the gun has an AR-15 magazine adapter on it and I do not know of a single company that makes AR-15 mags outside of the US. I have run this gun with Pmags, Lancer mags, Troy mags, and normal C-Products metal mags. Have never had a single problem with any of them, other than pmags being a slightly tight fit in the magwell and not dropping free. My troy, lancer and metal mags all drop free from the gun. 

The gun currently has a stormwerkz top rail on the dust cover and is wearing a Bushnell TRS-25 on a short QD riser. I have not been to the range to zero the TRS-25 yet. It does not co-witness with or without the riser, so I added the short riser to allow quick removal and installation of the sight to switch to iron sights if wanted. The rail sits low enough on the dust cover that it does not interfere with sight picture using the iron sights. 

I am including two 30 round metal mags with the gun. No case, as I never got around to buying one for this gun, I typically would just put it in the factory plastic case that came with my Stag AR as it fit easily. 

I have a LOT of money into the gun, parts, gunsmithing and refinishing on this. I'm not expecting to get my money back out of it, just looking for an amount that is fair. 

Asking $850 for the gun without the optic/riser and $925 with the optic and riser. $1050 trade value."

I would prefer the P226 Tac-Ops in .40 S&W or .357 SIG but would be willing to accept a regular P226 Elite and buy the extra parts myself to convert it to the P226 Tac-Ops configuration. I am looking for the P226 to be in equally good condition and would be willing to add some cash, ammo, or other parts to make up any difference in price. Again as far as trades go I am ONLY interested in a P226 .40 S&W OR .357 Sig in the following configurations ELITE, EXTREME, or TAC-OPS. Any other trades will not be responded to. Of course there is always the option of offering the $650 cash sale price and I will buy my own P226 as the only other viable option. Buds Lists this gun at $650 new for the gun alone so I feel that with all of the extras this is a fair price but will listen to REASONABLE OFFERS. Lexington, SC  FTF Sales/Trades preferred. I am willing to travel inside of SC to do the right deal. I only have a picture of the gun and holster at the moment but will send detailed pictures of all parts and accessories for serious inquiries."

This is a nice Beretta for field or sporting use. Has the Beretta ""sporting"" model features ie. a slightly fuller stock and wider rib than the field models. The rear stock has a crack along the left side of the grip.  This does not effect use, I've shot it for over a year despite the crack, however I'm pricing the gun low to allow for a future owner to replace the stock if they wish. I have installed a rubber buttpad but it still needs to be ground to fit the shotgun as it's a touch too big (not a problem if you're replacing the stock anyway). Included with the gun will be two Briley Spectrum choke tubes (modified and improved modified), these cost $59.95 each.

Luckily, it's amateur gunsmithing work at most.

The rear sight has had the actual aperture snapped off, meaning a new rear sight assembly will need to be dovetailed into the receiver.

The barrel band retainer spring on the stock has slipped out of place. This could be fixed by either buying a new stock set (this is an older-model carbine, pre-potbelly, so USGI stocks should work if I'm not mistaken), or by forcing the spring back into its proper place and wood caulking it shut which might look slightly ghetto but should work well enough.

Aside from that, the rifle doesn't have an oiler so you'd need one of those if you intended to sling it up, and the barrel band on the rifle lacks a bayonet lug- so if that's something that's important to you, you'd need to acquire and install a new one.


The rifle has an M2-style 30 round magazine and a standard full USGI-style stock set. She eats pretty much any ammunition I feed her, which is nice because .30 carbine is pretty uncommon unless you want to do bulk orders online.


Price point is based on gunbroker prices (less the cost of the parts the rifle will probably need, and less a bit due to some normal finish wear), and what my personal bottom dollar is. Feel free to email me with questions or whatever, I'm a pretty laid back guy and even if we don't end up doing business I'd be happy to explain what I know about the gun if you'd care to hear it.

Apologies for no photos, I'm not in a place where I can take fantastically good ones right now. I'll try and get a few soon."

Brand really doesn't bother me, I do have a couple chances with either a standard panther Oracle, or next up a Ruger AR15 for around $567. I'm looking to trade or trade and cash for one but I'm pretty close to my guns so it's hard but an AR has always been my dream Gun!!! I'll make a small list starting with what I'm willing to let go first, real quick though my 3 handguns and my one 9mm carbine have all been very very well taken care of like been cleaned after every time used plus they were all cleaned right after bought to get the factory grease out of them.
#1- is my Ruger LC9 with a lasermax red dot that has standard Dot or pulsingdot.
It has the hougue rubber grip.
Comes with 3 factory 7rnd Mags with extended magazine plate or there's also the flat ones with it. 
All paper work, plus original Rugecasex, soft black pistol zip up bag with the Ruger logo,
I bought a good plastic pistol case with the Ruger emblem on it and locks sideways with a while to put a lock through,
Also has original bullet that was shot and tested from factory in the box.
Whoever trades with me with this Gun im already committed to my promise that I will fill all three of your 7rnd Mags with his hollow points with no problem!
There is literally nothing wrong with this Gun, yes I've had it for a couple years and I only took it to the range a few times and each time I literally ran literally right around 300FMJ'S through it. It's more a conceal carry Gun or even perfect for any woman that can't handle a lot higher calibers. Plus it's Ruger and I've never had any problem with there service! So that's my first deal with that and cash or the next thing I could throw in and this I've is really hard for me to let go period is my Smith&Wesson M&P .22 and yes it's the full size with the pictany rail and three 12rnd mags with an awesome case. Both guns have every key and lock that it came with also.
Now if I can help it im gonna work on getting my AR without having to get rid of any of my guns period but my fiancé would like for me to already get rid of the LC9 cause I don't shoot it anymore due to my other guns and she wants to go pick out her own.
So I'm really hoping that someone can make a decent deal with me cause I will NOT do you wrong and I don't want to $1,000-$2,000 AR, I could deal with just a plain panther Oracle or something around the category so please someone help me out and if not I don't have bills owed or anything like that, I just want my #1 dream Gun other than a AK47 if someone happens to have one of those. Thank you and hope to hear something soon. Also the .22 has probably between 700-900 of.22 bullets cause I like to stock up on what ever I own and also have a holster for the LC9. Anymore questions you can call or text REDACTED, it is possible for me to just sell the Ruger and what all comes with it but only for a good fair price for either to put towards my AR or my fiancé first handgun so only if you are for sure really serious cause you will get everything you need for the Ruger all right here but the .22 will only go towards trade due to that that's the best .22 caliber I've ever owned with not even one little flaw but thank you and hope to hear something soon."

We are responsible, safe gun owners and would only be shooting for an hour or two, probably on a Tuesday afternoon or weekend. Most of our firearms are chambered in .223, 7.62x39, 9mm, .45acp, and .22lr and of course we would be supplying our own targets and clean up after ourselves.

I got this quite some time ago and built a slug gun to hunt on the military base where you can only use a shotgun. I no longer have access to hunt on the base and prefer to use a rifle so a slug gun is useless to me. for the last few years I've shot skeet, turkey, and doves with it, however, I am partial to my double barrels and this one just sits, so it has to go.

Pictured is the gun in its original synthetic black furniture. the mossy oak pistol grip stock goes right on in about 6 minutes, I used the black one for skeet and doves and the camo one for turkey and deer. I can show you how to put it on if you need. The bird barrel is the original vent-rib double bead that came with the gun, it has had half a trillion rounds down the pipe, I'm not going to lie. The slug barrel is ported to help manage recoil and has a built in cantilever scope mount so that you can remove the scope with the barrel and it will stay sighted in. the scope is a Simmons prodiamond 4x32 scope. I've also added a sling swivel to the slug barrel so it can be slinged. I shot lightfield sabot slugs through this gun and it is very capable of 150-200 yards. I dropped the gun accidentally a few years back and damaged the scope around the lens. To me its not that bad and I will send pictures of damage if you'd like. the scope still works flawlessly for the record. 

Also, comes with a turkey choke

What will I take on trade?

Cash is king, trade value is $400

though its unlikely that you them laying around, I need two nitto terra grappler 305/70/17 tires... my two rears are getting low on tread because I like to burn them .

I'm a sucker for double barrel shotguns, no coach guns

Ruger m77's, prefer red pads, any caliber I don't have (7mm mag, 257 Roberts, 243 win)

I really have a gun obsession that is a true problem so I'm interested in all things, if you have something else just ask, I'm not going to be a dick unless you are the guy who responded to the ad I have up for my 300 black out and tried to tell me his marlin 336 30/30 was worth $500... get out of here dude.

I have a really nice beretta 92fs inox(stainless) compact with rail. Comes with box , two 13rd factory mags . Has only 150 rounds or so through it. Beretta calls this the 92fs compact with rail but in reality it's the m9a1 compact and frame is stamped m9a1. It has beveled mag well , squared off trigger guard and rail for mounting lights and checkered front and rear backstrap which are the same features as the m9a1 full size . Gun has been upgraded with elite ii skeletonized hammer and d spring for an amazing double and single action trigger pull. It also has the elite (I think) extended mag release which I don't think you can even buy anymore , they only offer the enlarged mag release . These parts alone were around $80 on top of the almost $700 purchase price .I have all stock parts as well. May trade it but first option is to sell. As far as trades go no 40s.

Fantastic pocket pistol, this gun has had 250 rounds of ball ammo through it for break-in and 50 rounds of Hornady critical defense. I purchased this gun for my wife in December of 2013 (at the height of the gun craze for $800). Since she purse carries, the extremely small size isn't as important an issue for her. She now prefers to carry a slightly larger CCW. I have a P380 that I pocket carry, primarily use with shorts and a t-shirt in the summer time. Absolutely love it, so small, so compact. But, I don't need two. Here are the stats:

- Locked breach browning type action
- 4.9"" overall legnth
- 3.9"" height
- .75"" wide
- 2.53"" premium Match Grade polygonal rifled Lothar-Walther barrel.
- Forged Stainless steel slide.
- Polymer frame with integral stainless steel rails
- About 11 ounces in weight
- Dovetail Trijicon front & rear night sights
- Manual slide lock
- Striker fired
- Pachmayr slip-on grip sleeve
- (2) 6 round magazines

If you don't know the difference from the P380 and the CW380 let me inform you. The P series of Kahr pistols is their ""premium"" line and the CW series is the budget line. Some of the differences are:

- P380 has a match grade barrel, CW380 has a NON MATCH conventionally rifled barrel (I can tell you that this pistol is ridiculously accurate, way more accurate than I can be. Not that is means much, in a life/death situation, but I can easily put rounds on a steel silhouette target from 100 yards)
- The P380 has laser cut markings vs. the roll marks of the CW380
- The P380 has more refined contours compared to the more basic Slide machining contours of the CW380
- The P380 comes with premium front/rear trijicon night sights compared to the basic sights of the CW380
- The slide release, takedown lever, etc are Forged parts on the P380 compared to (MIM) metal injected mold parts on the CW380

Selling a Ruger New Model Blackhawk chambered in 357 Magnum with a 6.5 inch barrel. This revolver is the 200th year anniversary edition of American Liberty. This dates the revolver to 1976. The previous owner of the firearm stated that they had taken it to the range on two occasions and fired 50 rounds each time, totaling to 100 rounds fired. I have never fired the firearm during my possession. There is very little to no wear on the outside of the firearm. I called Ruger on 8/7/15 and they stated that this model is not a convertible. Not looking for any trades at the moment."

Long range 850 mW infra-red illuminator
Infra-red (IR) Illuminators are common for night vision technology. The IR light greatly enhances the performance of your device, while remaining almost totally invisible to the naked eye. Staying in the dark, switch on your night vision device. If the visibility is low, you may use ATN IR850 to improve the situation. Still, you should remember that the IR illuminator is just a source of infrared light so the greater is the chosen range of observation, the lesser its brightness becomes.
The ATN IR850 is powered with two CR123A lithium batteries To install batteries unscrew the cap of the battery housing and insert batteries following the polarity arrows marked on the housing. Put the cap in place.
The IR850 illuminator has a control panel with two buttons. To switch the IR illuminator on/off press “+” and “–” buttons simultaneously. When the IR illuminator is switched on you can see the green LED lit on the back side of IR850. By pushing the buttons “+” and “–” you may adjust the IR  brightness.
The IR beam is focusable to change the field of coverage. To change the beam width slightly turn the IR lens.
You may need adjust the focusing of the IR beam to change the field of coverage. Do it by slightly rotating the IR lens. The windage and elevation screws help adjust the direction of the IR beam from the IR850 in order to focus on the scene observed in the viewfinder of your NVD. Use the included Allen wrench to rotate the adjusting screws until the IR beam is centered. Please remember the adjustments should be performed in darkness or semi darkness (an IR beam is greatly diminished and may not been noticeable at all during daylight conditions).
You can change the position of the IR control panel to meet your  needs. The wrench that is included in the set, is used to loosen the nut located on the body of the IR. Rotate the IR to the desired position. Tighten the nut with the  wrench to secure the new position.
Before operating your X-Sight please update the firmware to the latest version.

Long range 850 mW infra-red illuminator
Infra-red (IR) Illuminators are common for night vision technology. The IR light greatly enhances the performance of your device, while remaining almost totally invisible to the naked eye. Staying in the dark, switch on your night vision device. If the visibility is low, you may use ATN IR850 to improve the situation. Still, you should remember that the IR illuminator is just a source of infrared light so the greater is the chosen range of observation, the lesser its brightness becomes.
The ATN IR850 is powered with two CR123A lithium batteries To install batteries unscrew the cap of the battery housing and insert batteries following the polarity arrows marked on the housing. Put the cap in place.
The IR850 illuminator has a control panel with two buttons. To switch the IR illuminator on/off press “+” and “–” buttons simultaneously. When the IR illuminator is switched on you can see the green LED lit on the back side of IR850. By pushing the buttons “+” and “–” you may adjust the IR  brightness.
The IR beam is focusable to change the field of coverage. To change the beam width slightly turn the IR lens.
You may need adjust the focusing of the IR beam to change the field of coverage. Do it by slightly rotating the IR lens. The windage and elevation screws help adjust the direction of the IR beam from the IR850 in order to focus on the scene observed in the viewfinder of your NVD. Use the included Allen wrench to rotate the adjusting screws until the IR beam is centered. Please remember the adjustments should be performed in darkness or semi darkness (an IR beam is greatly diminished and may not been noticeable at all during daylight conditions).
You can change the position of the IR control panel to meet your  needs. The wrench that is included in the set, is used to loosen the nut located on the body of the IR. Rotate the IR to the desired position. Tighten the nut with the  wrench to secure the new position.
Before operating your X-Sight please update the firmware to the latest version.

FS/T Aimpoint Micro T-1 2 moa with LRP riser quick release mount new in box with papers, new battery and tool. Never mounted! Only put battery in today to make sure it worked. I had to wait to get this one from Aimpoint directly from promo so I got a different optic sooner and don't need this one.  

The Best price I could find on Amazon and other sites that compare prices on all the gun sights was between $700 and $800 for the set up.  This is the baddest micro red dot out there.  Crazy long battery life and nearly indestructible.  Look it up before you make me an offer.   I don't need to sell it. It's just an extra for me so please no low ball offers.  

 Prices and trades listed below.  If trade. Tell me what you have, the extras and your best offer please to save us time. I'll just say yes or no. Thank you.  

Asking $625 obro.... cash gets best deal or trade toward one or more of guns below.   

 If you can get it cheaper, I understand there's occasionally deals that pop up but I don't need to know about them or your opinions. If you aren't interested then please move on. I'm open to cash or gun offers that are reasonable. 

All trades must be new or like new fully functional perfect working order 

Right now my main interests are a Glock 17 or 19 Vickers or Gen 4 plus cash .....Prefer gen 4 but open to RTF models in 9mm  Other Glocks would really have to be a deal for me to consider but only 9mm, 45 acp or maybe .40 and again prefer Gen 4.  No stippling or frame modification please.  This could be great opportunity for someone with a lightly used blue label. 

Also would consider a 2014 or 2015 Ruger Lcp $250-300 range with multiple mags unless modded plus cash.  

Ruger 22/45 lite pistol 22lr Mark 2 (ii) or Mark 3 (iii) or maybe a similar 22 semi auto target pistol plus cash. Nothing over $450 

Or an LCR 357 or 38 ($350-400 range) plus cash 

Last might consider a full factory Spikes 5.56 Ar pistol or rifle if cool looking and even trade.  

That's really all I'm interested in but if it's a higher quality gun that's a great deal for me. I might consider.  

I can add a little cash or ammo if necessary in multi gun trade As long as one gun is listed here and other is quality.
