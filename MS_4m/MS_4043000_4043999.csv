First Focal Plane scope. Their are two really awesome things about this scope that I believe, beats just about every other scope on the market. 1. The eye relief is very forgiving so that when you are shooting in various positions you can find your target/sight picture much easier. 2. The glass is outstanding you can see detail with this scope that other scopes cannot at the same power (and sometimes greater power). 

This scope is in excellent condition the only issue is minor scope ring marks from the scope being mounted on my rifle. I am selling this to get a greater power scope for a new rifle project.  Looking for cash.

Widely considered the best pistol Glock ever made and I have to agree. This one runs like a sewing machine and will eat anything you feed it. In the rare instance that these do come to market, they typically show a lot of holster wear. This one is in excellent condition and has been babied. It has the best trigger I have ever felt on a Glock. I recently replaced the plastic sights with genuine Glock steel sights. The original  sights are included. This one includes its original ""tupperware"" box with matching serial number label, original owners manual, and original 15 rd magazine. I'm asking $600.00 cash for this one. These are extremely hard to find in this condition. Trade for  a Glock 17 Larry Vickers Model or Sig P938 Scorpion.  Thanks!

It was on my wife's LC380, but she never used it so we decided to just take it off. It works fine, and it has new batteries in it.

$50.00 + free shipping

It is easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock frame pins with the new threaded pins (included). Mount the CK-AMF9 to these pins with the included screw. Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. An added benefit to the Laserlyte CK-AMF9 is that the laser actually helps to provide safer trigger control by acting as a finger guide without blocking the laser beam. The smooth, no-snag design of the laser allows the pistol to easily holster in any available nylon or leather pocket holster on the market.

156,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4043156,For Sale/Trade:  Sig Sauer P226 **MUST SEE**,"North Nashville; Hendersonville; Gallatin, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 625,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 17, 2015",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The item displayed in the images below is a Sig Sauer P226 that was manufactured in West Germany and issued to the German police force. As a certified Sig Armorer, I have taken this handgun completely down and cleaned every inch of this weapon. All worn springs, pins, and other components have been removed and replaced with new ones and the old worn exterior has been redone with a sleek yet extremely durable Cerakote finish. 

Having similar results to other competitors when it comes to impact testing, Cerakote really shines when it comes to corrosion resistance and wear resistance--meaning your weapon can handle whatever you throw at it. When properly applied, the Cerakote finish adds lubricity to the metal, allowing parts that come in contact with one another to glide past each other more easily.
See for yourself in the full report at this link: http://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/resources/files/testing/fullTechnicalReport.pdf 

The following parts have been Cerakoted:
--The slide
--Guide rod
--Firing pin housing
--Extractor
--Frame
--Take down lever
--Trigger
--Trigger pivot pin
--Trigger bar
--Slide release lever
--Decocking lever
--Locking plate
--Ejector
--Sear
--Safety lever (internal safety mechanism)
--Magazine catch
--Magazine catch stop
--Hammer

I have personally tested this firearm to make sure everything is in working order and that all features function as they were intended to by the manufacturer. Since the chamber in any Sig Sauer pistol is manufactured to such tight tolerances, the barrel has been blued rather than cerakoted to ensure that function is not affected. I was careful to make sure that all the beautiful little import marks were left in tact and not covered up by the Cerakote. 

Another huge plus with this firearm is that it has the new style E2 grips from Sig that do not require any screws to hold them in place (I was skeptical about it too until I had some serious range time to test the product out--these grips are awesome). The E2 grips are actually more comfortable than the Hogue grips that came on my 226 Elite, as they are contoured to fit the shape of a human hand rather than just being flat on the sides. This pistol also comes with tritium night sights from Sig--which as you probably know, is an expensive upgrade in itself. 

Note in the pictures, on the right side of the trigger and hammer, there are small blemishes in the finish. They are purely cosmetic and will not affect the function of the firearm. You should be able to see the trigger blemish in the pictures below if you look very closely. The one on the hammer is very hard to notice. 

Shoot me an email if you have any questions about this item. I purchased it for my own personal collection but am selling it to fund another project. Since the item is used, it is being sold ""as is,"" but I am confident you will love it for years to come. There are some small imperfections from where the pistol was carried in a holster, but nothing to be concerned about. Even though it is a simple process, due to a lack of time, the sights have not been zeroed yet. They are the proper sights for this particular pistol (it had a dead on combat zero prior to Cerakoting), they just need to be nudged back into the correct position.

Price is $625 obo.
Would prefer cash, but may consider the right trades. 
Please--no low ball offers--this is an extremely high quality product that has been gone through and tested by a certified armorer. Includes everything seen in the pictures.

Bought this new in November 2014. Looking to sell because I can't find ammo to shoot and want a new deer rifle for next season. Was cleaned really well before it was shot. Has one tube of 22 shorts (22 shots I think) and 10 rounds of CCI minimags shot through it. So under 35 rounds, basically still new. Was very accurate with iron sights. Great crisp trigger. I just added a brand new Bushnell XLT Trophy Mil Dot 3-9x40 scope. Has Butler Creek flip up caps, the back one cracked a bit but still works.($5 for a new one/ little super glue). Brand new Warne scope rings. Absolutely perfect clearance on barrel, looks fantastic. Have not zeroed the scope because I can't find ammo.. Time for a new home. Manual included. 

I require a bill of sale, but not transfer through FFL.
Cash only.
Must be 18 or older with current license

Class is limited to 16 students; cost is $55/student.

In order to obtain your concealed handgun license (CHL) in Texas, you must take a class consisting of 4-6 hours of classroom instruction, a multiple choice exam, and a live fire demonstration. If the thought of sitting in a classroom for 4-6 hours of state mandated training reminds you of everything thatâs wrong with defensive driving classes, youâve come to the right place. Texas CHL classes from Hooten Armory are fun. The instructor is passionate about firearms, safety and proficiency. Our training philosophy is that if you are enjoying yourself, you will absorb more information, youâll retain it longer, and youâll be more willing to continue your education. As the saying goes, time really does fly when you are having fun.

The course begins in the classroom and covers four topics: Handgun Use, Safe and Proper Storage of Handguns and Ammunition, Non-Violent Dispute Resolution, and the legal Use of Force. This is followed by a 25 question multiple choice exam. We will then break for lunch and meet at the range for the firearms proficiency demonstration. 

Class will start at 8:00 AM and we should wrap up around 2-2:30 PM.

You agree to the trade and the person falls off the face of the earth never to be heard from again. Why is that? Also I live in a secured neighborhood that you have to be buzzed in for access and there are several cameras taking pictures at the gate and along the road. After I tell the buyer or trader this they run like ISIS is after them! You have never heard so many excuses why they are backing out of the deal. Now I don't know about the rest of you guys but if you were coming to make a honest trade or purchase what's the problem? If I was a buyer and the seller told me the same thing I would feel really good about going into a secured neighborhood. If someone out there can explain this feel free please. Thank You.

Send me an email with what you have and what you are looking to get out of it. 
PLEASE INCLUDE THE PRICE YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET AS WELL AS A MAKE AND MODEL. If you have accessories please include a list of them as well. 
I run a business so please understand that I cannot and will not pay retail for used items. I will not pay more for your used firearm than I can order a new one in for. Pictures are very helpful. Thanks for your time.

If you are looking to trade in your old items for something new I can do that as well. Cash either way on trades is fine. 


Mainly looking for pistols and nice rifles. Not really looking for Hi-Points, Taurus, and Shotguns as there are not very good margins for resale. If you want to trade up one of the former please contact me only if you understand I wouldn't be able to offer as much as other items."

Class is limited to 16 students; cost is $55/student.

In order to obtain your concealed handgun license (CHL) in Texas, you must take a class consisting of 4-6 hours of classroom instruction, a multiple choice exam, and a live fire demonstration. If the thought of sitting in a classroom for 4-6 hours of state mandated training reminds you of everything thatâs wrong with defensive driving classes, youâve come to the right place. Texas CHL classes from Hooten Armory are fun. The instructor is passionate about firearms, safety and proficiency. Our training philosophy is that if you are enjoying yourself, you will absorb more information, youâll retain it longer, and youâll be more willing to continue your education. As the saying goes, time really does fly when you are having fun.

The course begins in the classroom and covers four topics: Handgun Use, Safe and Proper Storage of Handguns and Ammunition, Non-Violent Dispute Resolution, and the legal Use of Force. This is followed by a 25 question multiple choice exam. We will then break for lunch and meet at the range for the firearms proficiency demonstration. 

Class will start at 8:00 AM and we should wrap up around 2-2:30 PM.

This is not a ""b"", ""bb"", or ""cheetah"" model but the original 84. Date code of AC puts it made in 1977. The 84 is very much a miniature version of the Beretta 92 but chambered in .380 Auto. The gun is double/single action but no de-cocker was ever put into the original 84. The one mag it comes with is a double stack mag that holds 13 rounds plus one in the chamber. Because it is still a small framed auto it makes a fantastic .380 for carry. 

Being as the gun is nearly 40 years old, it obviously is not mint, but still in excellent condition. After I had bought this gun a while back, I completely detail stripped the firearm, cleaned and duracoated the frame matte black. The slide and all other steel parts were then re-blued. Additionally, all the old laquer that was originally used to coat the wood grips were removed, the nics and dings from the last 38 years sanded out, and then treated with several coats of hand rubbed raw, unprocessed linseed oil. This finish will slowly oxidize over the years gaining a rich red patina as it ages in the walnut. Essentially looking better and better with age. This little gun will no doubt gain value the older it gets and the harder it gets to find.

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder.

Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger's Target GreyÂ® finish.
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** HogueÂ® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

If the ad is active then It is still available. *please note* Texas residents must pay state sales tax.This is the Law Enforcement edition of HK VP9, which inlcuded 3 15rd mags, factory installed Tritum True Dot sights. In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Kochâs latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.  Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK âlight pullâ trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HKâs ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panelsâ accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistolâs grip also instinctively position an operatorâs hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HKâs patented charging supports â simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9âs proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HKâs famous cold hammer forged barrel â made from cannon grade steel â ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9âs machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HKâs hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Kochâs Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Kochâs limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

The PLR-16 will accept AR-15 magazines and is chambered in 5.56mm, so it can fire both .223 and 5.56x45mm rounds. Although very similar to an AR pistol, it is piston operated so the receiver runs cooler and cleaner. The muzzle is threaded to accept a standard AR 15 muzzle break or suppressor. The barrel is 9.2"", has a 1:9 twist and is chrome-lined. Since this firearm is from Kel-Tec, it does have a lifetime warranty.

I am selling this with the factory 10 round magazine which will only work in PLR-16/SU-16 series weapons. In addition, I am including a hand-guard, an additional interchangeable charging handle that can be switched and a sling, made specifically for the PLR-16. The PLR-16 being sold is like-new and has hardly even been broken in.

I will prefer to meet someone at a public place, in daylight. I will only accept payment in cash. Since this is a pistol, I will need to see Identification to confirm that you are at least 21 years of age. I reserve the right to refuse a sale at anytime."
