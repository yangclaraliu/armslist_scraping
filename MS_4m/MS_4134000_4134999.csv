This is the enhanced model that comes with fully adjustable rear sight, fiber optic front sight, ambi safety, and magwell. I bought it new and have shot it a fair amount but it doesnt show much wear. Never holstered or carried. Locks up tight and is very accurate, will hold 2"" groups at 25 yds with my reloads, never shot any factory ammo through it. Feeds and functions perfectly, 90% of what this gun has shot has been 200gr SWC. Reason for selling, I have decided Im just not a 1911 person. This is my second go around with the 1911 platform and while I respect the history of the gun I enjoy my poly guns more.

Gun comes with original box, owners manual, factory 8 round magazine and an extra 8 round mag. Has been detail stripped and is very clean. Only trade I would have interest in would be a CZ P09 .40.

Asking $480. This will be a legal sale only with buyer providing purchase permit or CC permit, bill of sale, in or around the Wilmington NC area. 

Best way to reach me would be email gunguy041007 at outlook dot com."

100% condition. 
3x 17 round magazines and all accessories that come in the retail plastic box (different sized grips, cleaning brush, etc). I purchased this firearm approximately 6 months ago brand new and have since discovered I will need something smaller for CCW purposes specifically. It has 17 rounds fired to test accuracy and it handles just as expected. 25 yards, 3 inch groups, decent shooter.  Excellent condition. As a bonus, I will include 1 33 round Glock factory magazine and an Uncle Mikes inside-the-waste-band holster. If you do not want the 33 round magazine, subtract 25.00 from the price. The holster is free with the weapon. It is leather and low-riding--very good for concealment.

Photos coming soon and the price is firm. These retail at 539.00 minimum everywhere as the Glock company does not allow the new models to be sold for anything less.

Buyer must be legally permitted to own and operate a firearm, be a US Citizen, and show a valid drivers license. A bill of sale will be required.

Thank you and good luck."

 Seller's Description and Comments

 This 1987 Fiero GT is in amazing condition. Rebuilt engine ~ it drives great and has much more power than your average Fiero. The body is flawless and the original paint is good for its age (you can see in the pictures how reflective the paint still is as it is reflecting the trees in the back ground and even the white lines from the parking lot). The motor runs and sounds great (as perfect as this car looks, the engine is the gem of the car). I am the type of person who is skeptic of any after market work done to any car I buy, especially of an engine that has been re-done. This car was not re-done because it was broken down....it was redone to make it better than your average Fiero and done right. I took it in to Gaynor's Automotive (A premium Shop here in Vancouver) and they actually opened it up and did a complete inpsection and said whoever did this engine did it right, and the car sounds like it! It is a 2800 V6 bored 30-over with forged pistons with a 5 speed transmission. It has roller rocker arms, a crane cam shaft, ported-heads, and a Holley Fuel Injection System. A new cat converter was installed so it passed with flying colors through WA DEQ which cost me $700. I looked for the perfect Fiero for almost 2 years and found this one in Detroit in 2010. The only time this car has ever been driven in the rain was when I drove it home from Detroit, and it drove great! It is currently licensed in WA State. It has a K&N Air Filter and custom dual-quad exhaust. The odometer reads 130,827 but the previous owner rebuilt the engine about 43,000 miles ago. He also did all of the modifications listed above. 

 It has been kept in my garage since 2010 and the previous owner owned thi car since the early 90s and babied it more than his kids. From the time he owned it and as long as I have, it has always been garage kept. The clutch and plugs were recently replaced and have less than 250 miles on them. The car has 4 wheel disc brakes. The front brakes have been checked and look great. The calipers in the rear are new along with the pads and one of the rotors. It has leather interior that is in great shape. The head lights are fully functional. It has Fiero-GT floor mats, and a 10 disc CD-changer. It also has the huge sun roof shown in the pictures. I have nearly all of the paperwork for the car from the early 90s until now. This Fiero is garaged (and covered) and has been meticulously cared for. 

 And you will not have to worry about this car having body cracks or such issues that I have seen recenlty on another fiero here on Craigslist that was in this price range. Can't beleive someone is selling for about my price for their fiero (with low miles) with cracks?? Just because it has lower miles does not mean it is nicer. The air condiitoning is perfect and ice cold ~ and brand new.....have receipts. 

 If you drove one of these gowing up, you know how fun they are...and if you have not yet, you are truly missing out. 

 I have over 10k into this car since 2010 and have receipts. 

 We can meet at my FFL Dealer in Vancouver if we make a deal."

BY TIM SCHMIDT - USCCA FOUNDER
Tim Schmidt
Although it might be a little too early for responsible gun owners like you and me to celebrateâespecially with claims that President Obama ""remains committed to 'common-sense' gun regulations""âwe can at least appreciate a small victory this week as the ATF backs off its proposed ban of M855 ammunition.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced that, after receiving more than 80,000 comments on the proposalâincluding overwhelming criticism from pro-gun groups and Congressional Republicans, it will NOT ban the commonly used cartridge ""at this time.""

According to The Hill, ""Democrats and gun control groups blasted the move, accusing the administration of caving.""

But Josh Earnest, the White House's press secretary, reiterated Wednesday that ""the president's commitment to putting in place common-sense rules that will protect Second Amendment rights, but also prevent those who shouldn't have firearms from getting them, is as strong as ever.""

I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say that President Obama (among others) doesn't seem to recognize or respect the difference between bad guys with guns and lawful concealed carry permit holders.

I can't think of any other reason why he continues to push for increased regulations on firearms and ammunition, despite evidence that it only deters the law-abiding from being able to rightfully defend themselves and their loved ones.

By now, you and I both know that there will always be people fighting just as hard against the things we believe in as we are fighting for them. (Of course, it doesn't help that the mainstream media never shines light on our side of things.)

But we can't allow the ""other side"" to define this fight. We can't let their inability to see the truth overshadow what is really happening across the country. And this week, there are a lot of good things happening:

Take Iowa, for example, where the House passed a bill that ""would prohibit the public from accessing the names of those who hold permits to carry guns and purchase some weaponsârecords that are currently open to the public.""

And what about Tennessee, where ""the Senate Judiciary Committee approved measures to allow guns in parks, guns in trunks of cars parked at schools or universities, guns at property used by but not owned by schools, and targets that explode""?

And let's not forget about Florida, where the House and Senate have already passed a ""bill to allow concealed firearms on the state's college and university campuses.""

This is just a small slice of positive gun-related news taking place in this great country as we speak (Utah, Arizona, West Virginia, and several other states are also moving forward with their own pro-gun measures). We should continue to recognize such efforts. Remember, small victories pave the way for big wins.

Remember what Margaret Mead once said? ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.""

We're on the right path. Let's continue to get involved, to speak up, and to fight back. The latest backtrack by the ATF is proof that it all really does matter.

When we designed the ARCÂ® Magazine, we started with a clean sheet of paper. After looking at the history, design and shortcomings of conventional magazines, our vision became clear. We wanted the magazine you didnât have to worry about when trusting your life to it. Hereâs how we accomplished that goal-

Design leads the way with simple, ultra strong construction with no floor plates to fail or catch on other pouched magazines. Cleaning is fast and easy, with no disassembly.

Internal shape provides proper, 100 % reliable feeding of the host weapon, yet drops free from the magazine well with no âstickingâ.

External form allows easy manipulation from your magazine pouch until itâs positively seated. Ribs and rectangular recesses see to that.

Material used in every component is the very best available. Spring durability far exceeds most weapons entire life span. State of the art polymer will not change dimensionally, regardless of humidity, and will take a beating that sends other magazines to the trash.

Available in 20 and 30 round capacities for M16/M4/AR-15 type weapons, in 5.56 x45mm NATO/.223 Remington chambering.

Due to legal restrictions, we cannot ship high capacity ARCÂ® Magazines to the following States/areas: CA, CO, CT, HI, IL, MD, MA, NJ or NY"

This is a Sig 556R, the âRâ stands for Russian and it shoots the 7.62x39 AK round and takes AK mags. Sig just has â556â in the name because itâs based off their Sig 556 model which can be confusing. Also this takes AK mags. They make two âgensâ of this, this is a Gen 2 (the latest Gen). The 556R only comes in this configuration, they donât make a sig 556R pistol, like they do the Sig 556, they also donât make a âswatâ version of the Sig 556R like they do with the Sig 556 which has the quad rail forearm. This has quad rail mounts on the forearm and I have those and the original box for the rifle. 

The Scope is a 4x12 Leapers UTG (about a $150 scope and mount). The bag Iâm not sure the brand, but it fits it folded perfectly and I think was around $60. 

Iâd do $900 for the bare rifle with 4 mags and a mag coupler.
Iâd do $1000 for the rifle with scope
Iâd do $1050 for the rifle, scope, and bag. 

The bag fits other folded guns nicely, like a mossberg 500 with a folding stock, and also fitâs the KSG, so itâs kinda a bag I donât mind keeping if I have to."

Started out as a base model Stag Mod 2 that has been added to.  All factory furniture has been replaced with magpul, grip, forend, and ACS stock.  Has a Vickers Tactical two point sling that I added Magpul MS3 hardware to so now it functions as a two point/one point convertible sling.  Has a BCM Gunfighter charging handle and a Surefire Procomp muzzle brake/compensator that does an excellent job at reducing recoil and muzzle rise.  Originally was running it with an optic but I have switched it back to iron sights and it is fairly light weight if that's important to you.  Will also come with a Condor Tactical chest rig that will hold ten magazines, multiple pistol mags, and a vertical universal pistol holster that will hold just about anything, even handguns with lights.  Will come with ten magazines, six magpul and four GI's, and about 300 rounds of Tula 223.

This has been an excellent, 100% reliable rifle for me with zero malfunctions of any kind, has had around a thousand rounds through it of mixed brass and steel, so it is not picky.  If you aren't familiar with STAG they make very high quality rifles and are a contract parts manufacturer for many of the big name AR producers on the market now.  Totally mil spec, chrome lined barrel, M4 feed ramps, MPI inspected BCG, and just about everything else you could want in an AR. Only thing I can say against it is that it has some scuffs on the left side of the receiver from rubbing against gear.

I'm looking to switch things up, so I would be interested in a partial trade for a quality AK47, primarily one of Yugo manufacture (absolutely no WASR's).  Would also be interested in partial trade for a quality 9mm, particularly a SIG P226 229 or M11, HK VP9, or Beretta 92.  might consider a commander length 1911.

If you'd prefer to buy I would sell for $1100, fairly firm on price, I have over $1400 in it.  Would consider multiple firearm trades as well.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred. 

Thanks!"

Grips are very good with some scratches. Leather holster has a mild scuffs and surface cracks from age, as expected and the brown leather color is showing through the light brown finish in some areas. Mechanically, this pistol is very good to excellent. Serial number: 31955f. A collectible pistol from WWII that demonstrates the Belgian manufacturing characteristics under Nazi Germany occupation and control.

The FN P35 âHi-Powerâ had been in production since 1935. Designed by John Moses Browning, and completed by Dieudonne Saive, the pistol was chambered in 9mm and had a 13 round capacity thus called âHigh Powerâ, and was a desirable military firearm. For comparison, the German issued P.08 Luger and P.38 held 8 rounds of 9mm each. When the German forces invaded and occupied Belgium in 1940, they also took over the FN (Fabrique Nationale, in Herstal Belgium) plant.

The Hi-Power was immediately liked by the Germans, and reassigned the designation Pistole 640(b)

The pre-war inventories of parts at the FN were used to produce more of the Pistole 640(b), all bearing Nazi Waffenamts and the typical swastika-eagle stamps.
 When in early â42 the pre-war inventories ran out, the German led war-production was started up, and most Hi-Powers after that had wooden grips, unlike the synthetic grips used on prior production guns.

This pistol has a WaA140 waffenamt in it, which indicates it was produced in Belgium between 1942 and 1944 and inspected by the Wehrmacht inspectors in Luttich, Belgium.
That Hi-Power is known as the third (and final) sub-variation of the German occupation pistol designated the P.640b.

Those brown plastic resin grips are original to that gun as are the rather roughly machined and finished major parts. The blue finish on the b suffix pistols was thin to say the least.
The abbreviated serial numbers on the barrel and slide were common practice for Hi-Powers produced in that time frame.
Unmarked aluminum follower magazines are also correct for guns in this serial range.

Serials up to 63,000b in the b suffix when the Germans had to fall back to the East out of Belgium in September of 1944.
No fixed dates of manufacture are around that I am aware of. Stands to reason that this one was made in the latter half of 1944.

Good looking correct supple holster that does not look either over oiled or dried out. 
It is best for the finish of the gun to not store it in the holster where rust has a better chance to develop or gun oil that would stain the leather and stitching.

In my experience the plastic grip 3rds are more rare to encounter than the much more common wood gripped, fixed sight variation Hi-Powers. I say this as a result of my research of this gun and itâs history

The majority of WWII Hi-Powers, due in large part to their popularity with shooters, have been shot and handled to the point of large degrees of finish being lost.
This gun does not seem to have that apply as the front grip finish is the first thing to go on the Hi-Power and this one looks like the gun would rate in the high 90s for condition.

I am selling the gun because I decided to carry my Gen 4 instead, the RTF is a bit hard on the skin if you carry IWB. If you like to open carry or just shoot with a bit of panache, then this is the gun for you. As far as trade, I would be interested in a Gen 4 Glock 21, a CZ SP-01 or a Rossi Puma .454.
