Due to recent change in Oregon law, transfer must occur through a dealer. Prefer Keith's Sporting Goods in Gresham, but open to Northwest Armory in Milwaukee if it's on a Sunday. Buyer pays fees for their own background check and any fees the shop charges for the transfer (I think that's like $35). I priced this low so that's fair.

This rifle was designed from the factory to take AK mags, and IMO is actually more reliable than any AK, especially those below this price point. This has been my working rifle for the last 5 years and I have carried and shot it to the exclusion of almost all my other guns. I have not bothered cleaning it up for the pictures, you see it just how it is and has been. 

Two bugaboos: The PO put a screw in the gas block to make it adjustable. What possessed him to do that, I have no idea, but the screw head broke off leaving the threads embedded. It has not affected function one bit.

There is also a flaw in the receiver guide rail. It also has not affected function a single bit.

This is not a musuem piece. I would like to sell it to someone who will shoot the piss out of it. Might make a good option for someone wanting a good fighting or working rifle without springing for a nicer AR that would be as reliable as this is. 

ALSO INCLUDED FOR THIS PRICE:
14 AK Magazines, all functional
500 Rnds WOLF WPA Hollow Point 
500 Rnd Yugo Brass Case (the old War Stash--this is the nice stuff)

This comes out to: $400 for rifle, $100 for 14 mags, $100 for 1K rnds of ammo. In other words...a darn good deal.

The Winchester Model 1894 rifle (also known as the Winchester 94 or Win 94) is a lever-action repeating rifle that became one of the most famous and popular hunting rifles. It was designed by John Browning in 1894 and originally chambered to fire two metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. It was the first rifle to chamber the smokeless powder round, the .30 WCF (Winchester Center Fire, in time becoming known as the .30-30). The 1894 was produced by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company through 1980 and then by U.S. Repeating Arms under the Winchester brand until they ceased manufacturing rifles in 2006"

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

The Daniel Defense MK18 Pistol is a variation of the MK18 SBR which has been extremely popular within the Law Enforcement and Special Operations communities. A newly designed Pistol Receiver Extension classifies it as a Pistol and not a Short Barreled Rifle (NFA regulated items require ATF approval and a tax stamp). The Daniel Defense MK18 features the railed forend Daniel Defense currently provides to USSOCOM and a 10.3” Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, the same length commonly used for CQB operations. The MK18 RISII features the Bolt-Up System and has been rigorously tested prior to fielding by USSOCOM (currently over 15,000 units). This pistol comes equipped with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Pistol Grip with an integral trigger guard and soft touch overmolding.

Miyamoto Musashi Daito Katana Paul Chen Samurai Sword

Miyamoto Musashi, arguably the most famous swordmaster in Japanese history, was well above average height and Hanwei’s classic rendition of his Daito (long sword) reflects the impressive length of the original and features the legendary double-ring iron tsuba.

The Musashi Daisho is mounted in black with a textured saya for durability and the tsuka-ito is in leather over ray skin. The blade of this samurai sword is hand-forged in high-carbon steel and is edge-tempered to display a distinct hamon.

Edge hardness is HRC60, back hardness HRC40. The grip is double-pegged to the tang for safety. Japanese Sword supplied with a protective cloth bag and traditional maintenance kit.

Have original box, owner’s manual, and cable lock. Barrel is floated, with aluminum handguard, straight from factory. Adjustable stock. 

This was my first AR, purchased 2 years ago. I’ve shot it on the range 2 or 3 times, and taken it hunting twice. It’s a joy to shoot. Extremely accurate, as Mossberg rifles tend to be. Hunting or punching paper, the bullets go point of aim at 100 yards. There are more “tactical” ARs out there, but the ones that are this accurate tend to cost a pretty penny. 

Less than 300 rounds through it, so it’s barely broken in, if that. 

I’m a private seller, so no Federal paperwork. I do ask we meet in public, you pay cash, and that you sign a bill of sale. 

It’s a great first AR, deer gun, and hog gun. I’m just headed in a different direction now.

The Vzor 45, commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistol chambered in .25 ACP . It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by ÄŒeská zbrojovka Uherský Brod as the CZ-92. In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine. The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin. When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear. Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose. The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger. In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower. CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $750 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round. The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380.

Comes with the 6"" pinned barrel and a six round recessed cylinder. The barrel ends are fantastic and there is very little holster wear and some slight freckling from storage. This gun has a serial number of S243XXX and has been researched to be manufactured in 1965. The gun is in very nice condition for being fifty years old. The Eagle target grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the bead blasted top strap and blue frame finish. The finish on all the model 28's top straps have been bead blasted to deflect any glare in bright conditions. The condition of the bluing is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Smith & Wesson released this model as a lesser option variant of the 27 and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. This 28-2 also features the checkered semi Target Hammer with a serrated Trigger and both have been finished with distinctive case hardened coloring. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 6"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model 28-2 function perfectly, and as with all Smith & Wesson revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed. This revolver carries a very rich tradition and has a strong following by those individuals that were looking for function over form. All business all day long. This highway Patrolman honors all those American servicemen and women who dedicated so much in the line of duty. $600 OBO"

2. Illuminated Reticle - Illuminated circle and center dot allow for quicker target acquisition. Available in green or red illumination. 
3. Multi-Coated Lenses - All exterior air-glass lenses are treated with DiamondTuff14™ to ensure optimal light transmission for more visibility in low light situations.
4. Nitrogen Gas Purged - All scopes are purged with nitrogen gas to ensure they remain fogproof for wide range of temperatures.

This is in excellent mechanical condition and works perfect, although it has some wear from use.  I think it has a smoother action and nicer trigger than a Winchester.  I don't know it's manufacture date, for those of you who keep asking.

I will include 236 rounds of 30-30 ammo for $170 more with the purchase of the rifle. It's a mix of Remington, Winchester, Federal, and Fusion hunting ammo.

It was originally purchased in California years ago. It sat in a safe for over years, never getting fired. I purchased it and converted into the bullpup configuration you see in the photo. I fired approximately 60 rounds through it. I like it, but don't really need it. I have the original wooden stock as well as a polymer Monte Carlo stock for it. In addition to the stock 10 round magazine, I am throwing in two 20 round magazines. The bullpup stock is an SG Works stock.  
If you are interested what you're getting is three different stock configurations, two 20 round mags and of course the stock 10 round mag.
$600 O.B.O.
