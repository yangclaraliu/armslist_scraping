The tool mounts to ""virtually any"" stamped aluminum or plastic magazine. The cap is made from plastic to help protect your AR-15 from scratches and it can be replaced if its damaged or wears out. This simple to use system is a ""MUST SEE"" for any bullet button AR user. 

All research done on the CA DOJ website, as well as feedback from gun shop owners, parts dealers, and contributors to previous Calguns.net threads, indicate that this tool complies with CA DOJ regulations. What makes it compliant is that once a modified magazine is inserted into the mag-well it becomes part of the rifle, rendering the tool ""unusable"". It still requires another modified magazine (or other tool) to remove the magazine from the rifle. However, it is not officially approved by CA DOJ.

This is a soviet ammo crate from the Cold War. This crate contained 800 rounds of 7.62x54r ammunition. That calibre fits a variety of soviet weapons including the Mosin and Dragonov rifles. One of the marking is a ""10"" inside a circle. This is the Soviet country code for Bulgaria, so it was probably made in or shipped to Bulgaria."

This is a top of the line Spring Piston underlever airgun.  Beautiful stock, great trigger, and pinpoint accurate.  The only significant blemish on this rifle is a ding on the plastic endcap of the barrel shroud.  The ding has no effect on performance and is strictly cosmetic (Please see attached picture).

I've owned this rifle for 4 great years of target shooting and field target, but I have moved to an area where it is no longer possible for me to shoot in my backyard and the rifle is sitting in my gun cabinet un-used.  So, time to sell and put the money into a new firearm/rifle.

It's had maybe 500 rounds through it without a single problem or malfunction. The gun has been impeccably maintained and cleaned after every use. Bore is perfect; totally clean, shiny and unmarred. Comes with the one magazine it came with from the manufacturer. The gun still looks brand new.

Its been a great carry gun--just over a pound when fully loaded and under an inch wide at the slide. I'd hold on to it, but I'm moving up to a .45 and don't like to hold on to guns I'm not using frequently or don't plan to keep as collectables. This one deserves to be carried and shot. It won't let you down.

Feel free to ask any questions. I'll need to see an NC ID and either a pistol purchase permit or concealed carry permit.

After we met, I had to leave very quickly after meeting so I didn't  look at what was in the case, beyond the gun and 3 mags he mentioned (my fault, I agree.) when I got home, it was missing the manuals, the backstraps, basically everything except the gun and mags. I contacted him and he said he would find it, he knew he had it no big deal. A couple days go by and I ask again, and again he says he will find them and he got busy. Several days later and plenty of patience in my part he won't even respond to my messages anymore. 

If this guy text or calls you from this number +REDACTED4,  don't do a deal with him, very dishonest and will just eventually ignore you altogether instead of just admitting he didn't have them.

The factory recoil spring assembly has been replaced with a stainless rod with three different weight springs so you can adjust for the ammo you are using. It has the extended mag, and slide release, also stainless pin kit. The magwell is a Carver Custom. One of the only, and the best magwells for the full size Glock 45. I have most of the factory parts including the factory recoil spring, and barrel. You do not have to swap the barrel to shoot 45 ammo, the Rowland barrel will chamber 460, and 45 ammo. The slide has been hand polished so only the black coating has been removed, the tenifer is still there leaving a nice gun metal grey color. The dragon is laser etched. The tenifer is the coating Glock uses to protect the steel. If you see one that has been polished to a silver mirror finish, they have polished off the tenifer. It comes with three magazines, two 15 round, and one 13.This gun shoots amazing, and is much better than new. The target shows two groups at 15 yards. It is also fun to shoot. everyone at the range stopped shooting, and watched me. Don't know if it was because It shoots so well, or if the percussion from the gun going off was freaking them out. It is a beast. I love it, and am only selling to get money to fix up my car.  If you price the gun, the kit, and all the upgrades, you know I have over $1,100 in this gun.   Thanks for looking. Any questions, just ask."

These are arguably the best budget optics on the market, and this one has worked well for me but I've decided to stick with iron sights.  Scope has held zero well, and has unlimited eye relief so you can set it where you want.  Red or green dot with adjustable brightness, and base is a quick detach so it comes on and off easily.  Will come in its original box, the only thing I can say against it is that the rear flip up lens cover broke off, otherwise it's in great shape.  I used it on my rifle with a fixed A2 front sight with a 1 inch riser, I can include it for a little extra if needed.

Description:


The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is a 12 gauge shotgun. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.


The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel).

It has some pitting on it, but the internals are sharp and the gun functions perfectly. At some point to stop the pitting someone refinished it it looks like to a nice dull silver or grey.

Gun comes with a case, spare mecgar 10 round mag, set of hogue grips (not pictured) and a spare set of springs and other parts, most notably an extra internal extractor (these extractors are extremely rare, most replacements need to be hand made by a guy in SD for $90+ a piece)

They glow very bright in low/no light, and very bright outdoors. They also glow indoors, giving you the means for quick target acquisition vs regular stock white dot sights. 

Some info on TFOs: Unbelievable transition through all light conditions due to the combination of Tritium night sights and Fiber Optic sights. Glows in the dark. CNC-machined steel construction. Concealed fiber cannot be seen by target. Fits standard holsters and has a snag-resistant design.

I bought this rifle to have a reloadable squirrel rifle with mild loads, but with the capability of taking coyotes with hot rod loads. I was also planning on buying a 30-30 barrel through H&R's barrel accessory program  to hunt deer and cast for but I have a few deer rifles and a very accurate .22 for squirrels and since .22 is starting to come back around I don't really need this rifle. This rifle is light and mighty handy and the .22 hornet fills the niche between .22lr and .223 the 2x7 scope is well suited to this rifle and it also has really good factory iron sights. The hornady v-maxes would be some mean groundhog bullets they're cruising along at about 3100fps.

Aimpoint® Micro T-1
Lightweight sight for extreme conditions

Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-1 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on

    Rifles
    Carbines
    Shotguns
    Submachine guns
    Handguns

The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a standalone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.


Excellent night vision compatibility

The Micro T-1 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.


The clearest, brightest image possible

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects.  Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

-Zero rounds. I am the second owner of this rifle. It was purchased from a friend. I have no reason to doubt him. I have never even installed it.

-EXTRAS:

-custom bolt knobs from a member here. One of each kind he made. Originals included.
-custom butt pad from a member here
-Atlas bipod with QD lever and custom, sharp as fuck, SS feet.
-DTA factory soft case with shooting mat. Mint (except for some cat hair. Sorry)
-Operators Kit

-Some other factoids:

-Rifle was sent back to DTA when I first bought it to have the monopod installed. While it was there, they went through every screw and spring and replaced anything that looked out of spec. The trigger is very nice.

-As some sharp eyed members might notice, I had a small section of the top 1913 rail 
professionally machined off . When I had my S&B 5-25 mounted in a Spuhr mount, the objective bell touched the rail. It looks fine, like I said it was professionally done by my gunsmiths. The rail is of course, easily replaceable.

-The rifle has a couple of safe marks but is in very good shape. I'd rate it 95%.

I know it's Gen I. You all know it is still heavily supported. And as long as you don't try to install the barrel like you're dropping clothespins into a milk bottle (I may have dated myself), the pin system is fine.

-I actually love this rifle. It was my first high end bolt action as I am relatively new to the hobby. But I just got my first Surgeon Scalpel and I have an EDM .338LM/.408CT, so I really don't need this. I am not a collector, I'm more of a get the one, best gun I can for what I want to do. That said, if I never sell it, no big deal. It's that nice.

-TERMS:

-NO TRADES at this time please
-MUST go from me to your FFL . NO exceptions.
-I will NOT separate anything at this time, especially the little goodies I know some of you are eyeing. ;)
-If for whatever reason you purchase the rifle and are not satisfied as to the stated 
condition, just return it and I will refund you all of your purchase price plus your return 
shipping and transfer fees. I know that's still a PITA but life is too short to get upset over metal and polymer. Fair as I can make it.
-I ship UPS Ground with tracking number to your FFL. Insurance and/or upgraded shipping is extra.
-I do not mind shipping all of the accessories directly to you separately. Some times, goodies get ""lost"" at gunshops. Like a black hole.

PRICE IS $4250.00 firm. Payment method is certified funds in the form of bank check."
