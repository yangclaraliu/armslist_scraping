USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability."

WILL UPDATE

Excellent condition Sig Sauer P250 SubCompact 9mm. Factory package with SigLite night sights, 2 12-round mags, and paddle holster. I bought this gun new last month. December 2014 production - which gets you the upgraded package with holster and extra mag that wasn't put out by Sig until last year. This is also somewhat unique in its having the railed subcompact grip module, ready for whatever light or laser you'd wish to mount - most sc frames don't have the rail.

Great gun, soft shooter, and a remarkable double action only trigger, but I'm going in a different direction now on my carry/bedside gun. The gun has maybe 3 mags through it. If you're not familiar with the P250, the system is truly innovative - if you want a different size gun, or even caliber, simply order the kit and have it shipped to your door. Swap the slide, grip frame, and barrel, and, voilà! New gun! The internal chassis is the ""gun"" and is the only serialized part, so conversion kits don't even require an FFL transfer!

Priced at $450.

Located in Argos - along the US 31 corridor. FTF only - no shipping. I can meet as far south as Peru, as far north as US 6, west to Grovertown, east to Etna Green.

I'll need to see the buyer's Indiana drivers license and License to Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. For those who question this requirement, I apologize if it offends, but I can't perform a background check so I will deal only with those folks the State Police have cleared.

This item will be cross-posted in multiple groups. FYI. I will respond to all offers in the order I receive them. I consider my word as my bond, so the first person I come to terms with will get the same consideration. That being said, once a deal is pending I'll mark the listing as such but this will stay up until the meet is finalized."

It is fun, but just sat in my closet. I bought this for $50 + S&H. I think they are selling for around $40 now.

Below is info available online:

This 80 lb draw weight crossbow uses an easy and safe-to-use cocking mechanism. Manufactured with a strong plastic body and compressed molded fiberglass bow, this crossbow pistol is very durable and perfect for both small game hunting and target practice. The crossbow includes 8 aluminum arrows with metal tips and adjustable tactical sight. With a firing speed of 165 fps, the 80 lb cross bow is great for hunting small game. The new self-cocking mechanism much more safe and far less strenuous to use. By simply pulling down on a pivoting arm lever, this crossbow's cable is cocked much more easily, even engaging the safety automatically. The speediness of the new cocking mechanism shortens reload time, allowing you to get off more shots quickly."

It has the DAK trigger, which I thought was an undesirable option until I did a little research and got it in my hands. There is a reason that law enforcement agencies use it. The DAK trigger is double action only at around 6 -6.5 lbs I think. That means it is a little lighter on the first pull and a little heavier on subsequent pulls than your typical DA/SA semi auto handgun. Similar to a Glock or other striker fired handguns. The unique feature about it is in relation to the self defense application. If you have a misfire, you can continue to pull the trigger until it goes bang. You do not have to rack the slide again, which is a significant advantage if your other hand is occupied defending yourself from an assailant for example. They have done the research and found that almost 80% of the time your round will fire on the second pull. I love it, but I am a function first kind of guy. 

 It was lightly used when I purchased it, but I have never fired it. It is in excellent condition. It originally came with two 10 round magazines and the standard grips. I purchased the extended mag well grips and two 15 round mec gar magazines for it, which I will include in the sale. I am asking $500 for all of it. Thanks for looking. Feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Have a great day."

Up for sale today is a Smith and Wesson Bodyguard 380. It comes with 3 standard magazine and a large capacity promag magazine. In addition, it comes with the original box, documentation and carrying case. In addition, it will come with a pistol clip that is installed on the pistol itself so it wouldn't need a holster.

This is a very handy conceal carry pistol that I have carried for a very long time. The laser works flawlessly and has a very low round count. I know it was less than a box of .380. However, I felt this handgun was very small compared to my hand size and decided to go back to my Glock 27.

If interested, please feel free to reply to this message. I am asking for 435 for this or best offer over time. 

Also standard procedure, I would like two valid IDs, preferably a CCW and a Drivers License. Face to Face. Bill of Sales needed.

Featuring the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 9mm Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 9mm Sub-Compact squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just 0.2"" wider than the industry's slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2 9mm Sub-Compact offers 13+1 rounds of 9mm or 16+1 rounds with an X-Tension magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3"" barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XDs, the Mod.2 Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.

The receiver is the highly sought after IMBEL receiver built on an STG-58 parts kit with all matching numbers. So it's made from the best parts around. I challenge you to find a better built FAL.

The sling is a M48(Yugo) issued / Front sight tool / 15 of the 417 are loose in the bag pictured also a few loose stripper clips / This isn't a matching collector grade vault queen but all of its parts are correct for the G33/40/stock/bolt and its parts. The gewehr 33/40 (Mountain Carbine) is a German made copy of the vz33 (Chez) made from 1940 to 1942 -945 reciever code later becoming (dot) in late 1942 after which only K98's were produced.. The stock is the earlier walnut before being laminated in later production. At sometime the stock was sanded and refinished leaving no visible  cartouches aside from inside the stock.The bolt is a original G33/40 with the hollowed out/lightening cuts on bolt handle. Most of the parts are not serialized but marked with a circled (Z) In early production under German specs many rifles were assembled from Vz33 parts or later on used for repairs.The rifling is still sharp with a even layer of frosting throughout the barrel with no pitting. The G33/40 had a very short production life in comparison to its full length battle rifle sibling K98. Unlike the Jungle Carbine this rifle is FAR more pleasurable to shoot with much less taxing pain from felt recoil.
