The revolver is unfired since I received it back from Gemini Customs (it took over a year for them to complete it). The revolver had the full works done to it including; complete action tuning, recrown muzzle, chamfer cylinder throats, recontour and mirror polish trigger, remove LH side barrel warning, skeletonize trigger guard, gold bead front sight, smooth and dehorn for carry and Gemini Customs top end custom grips that are only available to customers having work completed. Mr. Morganti finished off his excellent work with a cobra-chrome industrial hard chrome finish that is stunning and will last a lifetime. I opted to not have any porting completed as I wanted this to be the ultimate carry weapon. Truly a beautiful and versatile gun that points perfectly with the custom grips. Comes with the case, original grips, lock, fired casing, etc. I also have several hundred rounds of ammo I can throw in.  Stunning safe queen."

The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

However, the M96 has a somewhat different internal mechanism and is semi-auto only. No internal parts exchange between the M96 and the Stoner 63.

The M96 is chambered for the .223 Remington/5.56 mm NATO cartridge, and uses STANAG 4179 AR-15 magazines. Barrels have 1-in-9 twist ratio as is common for .223 Remington semiautomatic rifles. The M96 is gas operated, with a fixed gas cylinder and moving piston connected to the operating rod and bolt carrier. All variants are equipped with a gas regulator, which allows fine-tuning for low or high powered cartridges, outside temperature, etc. and is probably unique for a civilian rifle in this caliber. The bolt carrier has been specially designed for strength and slow cyclic rate for improved reliability. The M96 bolt is a six-lug design somewhat similar to an AR-15 bolt but with larger, stronger lugs. The M96 receiver is stamped stainless steel with a special blackening treatment. The barrel is parkerized chromoly steel and the stocks are molded plastic. Incidentally, the buttstock is the one part of the M96 that is interchangeable with the Stoner 63. The M96 has adjustable military-type sights (rear aperture and front protected post) and does not have a standard scope mount or Picatinny rail.

It has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel which not only enhances accuracy but also gives the gun a very sharp look. The pictures also show the gun with both black G10 starburst grips and dark cocobolo starburst grips. Wilson's Supergrade class pistols are the finest the company makes and will please even the most discerning buyer. This pistol comes not only with a carry case, all original paperwork, and all the standard upgrades that come with the supergrade pistols but also includes a host of extra items that I've accumulated for this handgun. A list of all standard features, upgrades, and extras is found at the bottom of this listing. Gun is basically new with less than 200 rounds fired and the gun has simply been maintained and regularly cleaned as a safe queen as of late.  The quality and craftsmanship of this gun cannot be overstated.  Wilson has put out an unrivaled product with the Supergrade line of 1911s and this one in particular has recieved excellent care. Discriminating individuals the world over asked for a compact version of our Supergrade pistols. The Tactical Supergrade Compact was our answer. Peerless aesthetics and absolute function are hallmarks of the Supergrade Family, and the Tactical Supergrade Compact continues that tradition in a pistol optimized for daily carry. Hand crafted from carbon steel, the Tactical Supergrade Compact, with a 4” barrel and a slide 1” shorter than a full size, is fitted to a frame with a ½” shorter grip. Optimized for use as the ultimate carry pistol, with no compromises in the beauty and workmanship we’re famous for. Wilson Combat® Supergrades are the standard to which all other custom pistols are compared. The Tactical Supergrade is without equal when considering a compact size defensive pistol and one you will be proud to own and carry.

It has a pinned flash hider/comp on the barrel and is in a black synthetic stock. It has a Nikon Buckmaster 4x scope attached with Ruger rings (silver to match the receiver). There are 3 30 round magazines, 1 20 round mag, and the original 5 round magazine that came with it. All mags are metal, not polymer. There is another 30 round mag that has issues locking in unless the bolt it locked back, and a 20 rounder that won't lock in. Not counting those in trade value or anything, just throwing them in so you can play around with making them fit if you want, but the 30 rounder has no feeding issues just a little picky about when you try to put it in the rifle. The rifle has a nylon sling, but sadly no box/docs or anything. The rear sight has been replaced on the rifle to a fold down peep sight so the scope could be mounted nice and low to give a good cheek weld.  I'm the second owner so I don't know a round count or anything. The rifle looks to be in pretty good shape save for a couple of small stains on the scope rings, the Nikon Scope has a couple of scuffs from usage, and the flash hider has a rub mark along the bottom that seems to be from taking it in and out of range bags. I've got a picture of the rub mark for you so you can see for yourself. The chamber is in beautiful shape though and so is the rifling so it is G2G. All in all standard usage marks for a good ol' shooter. The usage wear has been reflected in the price. I can best be reached by email, but also by text at REDACTED. I do work during the day so I may not be able to respond immediately. Thanks!"

I have a number of the FILBE USMC Main Packs for sale. These come complete with shoulder straps, frame and waist strap. Bags are in Fair condition. They are all Coyote Brown, some are dirty from being issued, some have tape on the webbing, and some have wear from being dragged.

These are excellent bags, designed in part by Mystery Ranch out of Bozeman Montana for the US military. They have an external frame system and can hold anything you could feasibly carry on your back. The top lid has several zippers that allow the user to gain access to the pouch on the underside, or direct access to the interior of the bag. There is also a large zipper that runs along the lower portion of the bag to allow easy removal of sleeping gear or access the contents of the bottom of the bag without having to go through the top. There is a zippered divider which keeps the lower section separate when zipped for organization. There are slot pockets running down the sides of the bags exterior that hold 3 liter bladder type water reservoirs, and several lashing straps to keep loads secure. The entire face of the bag is covered in MOLLE or PALS type webbing to facilitate additional pouch or compartment additions at the users discretion.

Would get rid of them all but who knows.

Stormlake stainless steel Glock 22 barrel in 40 SW. Factory length, not threaded. It has standard rifling over Glock's traditional polygonal rifling. This means that if you felt so inclined you could shoot lead rounds out of it. Also it has a fully supported chamber. This means that you won't run a risk of warping the shape of your brass should you feel inclined to reload.

DPM dual recoil spring kit with full stainless guide rod. Comes with 2 springs of different tension to adjust tension to help fit your ammo. I shoot 160 grain through it and it kind of feels like shooting 9mm.

Ghost extended stainless slide release. I have short fingers and this makes it easier with the added weight of the DPM spring kit. 

I spent about $170 on the barrel, $60 on the DPM kit, and $25 on the slide release lever. Picture is of the parts on the weapon. Would prefer to sell the parts as a whole, but preferred to sell the weapon that way as well."

Gun comes with case, 1 mag, and paperwork.

The trigger broke on my original DB9 and Taurus sent me an entirely new replacement. This gun has about 50 rounds through it. While I was waiting for my first to be replaced I picked up another pistol so this is just extra.

Pictures are of the DB9 next to a Kel-tec P3AT .32acp and a Glock 19 so you can see how small this is.

The DB9 is the size of a Ruger LCP but with the power of 9mm. I used a Superfly pocket holster that was made for an LCP.

The truck was from California and was repaired from a front left crash and has a salvage title. This truck has been super reliable. It was my daily driver during the winter, I had a sweet summer ride so it kept the miles low. I have 3 Toyotas and they are the best. This truck was always professionally serviced. Brakes were recently done. Comes with a remote starter, weather tech floor mats, tow hitch, engine block heater. AC works but is not strong, some rust starting above windshield. Passed Frame inspection at Burnsville Toyota. Again this is 2 wheel drive but has been a great winter truck and if you need a reliable truck for a good price this is it. Interior has no tears and is in great condition. THE TOPPER IS SOLD. Email me with any questions. $5400 or best offer."

Last, it comes with 120 rounds of ammunition (new, not reloads!). 3 boxes of Winchester 100 GR Power Point, 2 boxes of Federal 100 GR Soft Point and 1 box of Remington 80 GR PSP. The rifle alone cost 644.99. The sling cost 45.00, padded case, 43.00, sock 9.99, stock 150.00, trigger guard for wood stock 25.00, trigger guard for composite stock 23.00, flip caps 40.00, the ammo 171.00, etc. The custom work I did on this rifle I normally charge 300.00. 

 I have over 1,411.00 invested with my labor. Originally I bought this rifle as a custom build for myself as a Varmint rifle. However, with bills to pay I need to sell it. It is new, not fired, not carried, etc. All accessories are new! ...Everything is absolutely new, so please do not ask.

 The custom work is not cheap as anyone who has had custom work done knows (...and I do not do cheap work). This is a great deal for someone. It will not last long. My loss is definitely someone's gain! 

 Note: This is a regular size adult stock, not a youth. The .243 was never created to be a youth cartridge (even though many use it as one). It was created to be an intermediate cartridge both for deer, varmint and black bear (which it does work!).


 No trades, so please do not ask. I need to pay bills and this is the only reason it is being sold.

 I will sell to only those who are able to legally able to own. Must have a valid CCW. Ohio residents only. 


 Thanks,
 Sincerely
 John"
