Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting."

Thanks for looking!

The ONYX IWB holster is designed for all day, continuous duty, concealed carry, made to be there when you need it and go unnoticed when you don't.

 The heart of the StealthGearUSA ONYX is its revolutionary VentCore™ breathable platform. This innovative ventilation system allows moisture to rapidly dissipate away from your body leaving you dry and comfortable, all day long. No other holster will keep you drier!  No more need to pull out your holster half way through your day to relieve your back of sweat and discomfort. Our Ventcore™ platform is built with a unique combination of synthetic non moisture-absorbing materials and the .093 kydex shell is attached using stainless steel hardware. You will not find a tougher, lighter or more comfortable IWB holster on the market today.  It's simply the most comfortable holster that you will ever own.

Each of our holsters is custom built for your specific gun.  We don't make a ""one size fits many"" holster.  Each kydex shell is molded for a single specific firearm, and even the Ventcore™ platform is designed and shaped specific to each gun model.  These are truly custom holsters that fit each model perfectly.

Key features:
Adjustable for cant and depth
Adjustable retention
Designed for rapid combat presentation
Tuckable
.093 Kydex shell
Full coverage of muzzle for extreme firearm protection

My fiancée is a Mary Kay representative, and she is spear-heading a fund raiser to send our troops who are stationed in the Middle East sunscreen & lip balm sets.  Operation Shield Our Troops is a small way of saying thank you to our military serving in the harsh desert climates of the Middle East.  Will this totally nullify the sacrifice being made by them for all of us, in short, no, but if it can alleviate one aspect of the many conditions they deal with everyday, then what would it be to give that gift to them.  Just to let them know that they are being thought of, appreciated, and possibly reinforce their mettle in the endeavor they have chosen to do, is a small price on our part to help them in any way we can. So please give generously, and know that for your donation you have made one of our troops time in service that much better.  Every set that is donated, there will be a personalized card saying from whom the gift was donated by, so they know exactly who supported them in their time of sacrifice. If you could please circulate this, it would be greatly appreciated. She has set up a donation page; here is the link to the page, thank you.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear.

The ATI Talon T2 Tactical Shotgun Stock replaces the factory buttstock on Mossberg 500/590 shotguns, converting them to serious tactical shotguns for law enforcement or home security. The Talon T2 Stock fully adjusts in length to 6 positions, so you always have a correct fit for fast shooting no matter what clothing or how much tactical gear you are wearing. ATI's Scorpion recoil system includes a recoil absorbing pistol grip with sure-grip texture, and a non-slip X2 butt pad, that together reduce recoil and shooting discomfort significantly, and allow shooters to reacquire their targets quickly by minimizing muzzle lift. The ATI Talon T2 Tactical Shotgun Stock features ATI's Triton Mount System, constructed of Military Type III Anodized, 6061 T6 Aluminum, which provides shooters the ability to switch from the 6-position collapsible stock, to the rear pistol grip in a matter of seconds. The Triton Mount System also includes interchangeable sling mounts for left and right-handed shooters, and an additional blank spacer for when a sling mount is not in use. The Talon T2 is constructed of DuPont® extreme temperature glass reinforced polymer, a material proven to withstand the extreme abuse of tactical environments. A removable, adjustable cheekrest allows shooters to find individual optimum fit. ATI manufactures a full line of quality tactical gear, and accessories for Remington 870 and Mossberg 500/590 tactical shotguns, and the Talon T2 Tactical Stock holds up to their reputation.

From Wikipedia:
The Firestar is a compact, reliable and accurate handgun well-suited for backup or concealed carry. Its single-stack design sacrifices the superior magazine capacity of a double-stack, but permits a slim profile prized by many for concealed carry. While heavier than more modern handguns of comparable size made with today's composite materials, many shooters find the added heft provides a more stable shooting platform that improves accuracy."

Full disclosure: The barrel is a take-off, taken off another rifle. My buddy bought it new, and drilled the sight himself, and didn't do it right. Turns out he ended up having the sight about 15 degrees off to the left. He shot it a couple of times anyway, but then took it off and sold it to me. I took off the sight he had, and replaced it with a clamp on A2 sight. (Those are expensive and hard to find!) Long story short, it's on tight and on right!  Has only about 50 rounds through it, max.

A great beginner rifle for a kid as they get a cool looking gun that is semi-auto and accurate. The bluing is deep and dark and flawless on all blued metal parts and the wood is overall excellent with various small scuffs and dings but none through the paint. 15 round mags are all over Gunbroker.

Selling a ladies 14 karat white gold vintage style halo design ring set with one oval cut diamond approximately 1.40 carats. I special ordered the stone and had the setting made for the stone. The appraiser did not take the stone out to measure it. When I bought the stone it weighed 1.53 carats so it is bigger than what the appraisal says. Also there is about another 1.5 carats of diamonds all around and underneath this thing. The pictures should speak for themselves and if you need more pictures I will gladly provide them.

This model has a 16 inch barrel and comes with the factory box and owners manuals. The condition is Used in great condition, I would rate the gun at 99%. The only wear that I can find is on the loading gate, but even the new rifles have that wear. This rifle was a trade in at our store. Features on the gun include a 16 inch octagonal barrel, rear skinner sight, red fiber optic front sight, Large loop lever, Taylor's action job, Wood stock and for-grip that are wrapped with a black rubber material,  and holds 8 rounds capacity in the magazine tube. The Taylor's Action job is basically a tuning of the action when the gun is imported from Italy. Taylor's is the company that imported the rifle, and they tune the action and I have to say this is one of the smoothest lever actions to operate. Message or call our store with any questions.

This gun is not in the best shape externally but works like it's brand new. It has nicks and scratches and some of the bluing on the trigger guard is worn away. At some point in its life the adjustable rear sight was broken and was recut. The sights are usable, but no longer adjust. I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was used. Comes with a Blackhawk holster.

The only reason I want to get rid of this gun is that the grips are made for a right handed shooter and I shoot left handed.

This gun was imported by Excam from H. Weihrauch in Germany and branded as a Warrior. The same gun has been imported by several companies over the years and including Excam/ FIE/ Arminius and EAA. this gun is the forerunner of the current EAA windicator and many Windicator parts will fit it if ever needed. This gun has a steel frame, not the pot metal frame that the early Arminus revolvers used.
I added a picture of it beside my Smith and Wesson model 66 too show the size of the gun."

NO TRADES.  Offers to trade will be ignored.

I am the original purchaser and owner of this carbine and it is complete, including original foam case and documents not shown in photos.

Rifle has gotten very light use (definitely fewer than 1000 rounds but I haven't kept track) and as you can see from the photos is in excellent condition.  Very small amount of wear from regular use (mounting different optics, moving rail sections) on flat top picatinny rail and a couple of key mod attachment points that can be touched up easily, if desired.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like higher resolution photos or arrangements can be made to inspect the firearm at nearby local firearms shops if you desire.

This is the 14.5 barrel version of the PWS piston rifle with a permanently pinned triad flash suppressor.  Has mid-length gas system that is operator adjustable for use with suppressor.  Rifle is ""suppressor ready"" via use of crush washers (included).  Is calibered in .223 Wylde which means that it is designed to shoot both 223 Remington and 5.56 Nato ammunition.

Rifle is completely stock, I have never swapped parts or done anything other than shoot it on about a dozen occasions.

If you can even find one of these new they go for about $1800 (MSRP is $1995).  I will sell this one for $1180 (which is less than the upper costs) and buyer pays for BG check at one of several shops in south Denver suburbs.

*OPTIC & OPTIC MOUNT NOT INCLUDED IN SALE* - The optic is shown for demonstration purposes only!  Noveske rail panels and BCM fore grip similarly not included but I will throw them in for another $30.

The good: Action still locks up nicely, bores are clean and in good shape. All moving parts are fluid. Shoulders naturally and shoots nice tight patterns. All numbers match.

This rifle was imported by C.J.A. SFLD, MN. It is in pristine condition and is considered one of the best and most sought after AK's. You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer one. It has a 1.5mm thick receiver vs. 1.0mm receiver on most stamped AK rifles and comes with a chrome lined barrel. Unlike your standard MAK 90's, this one comes with a spring loaded firing pin, a much more pronounced feed ramp and a heavy duty recoil assembly with a thick steel rod vs two slim wire rods that are interconnected at the middle of the assembly. I've been told that with the spring loaded firing pin etc, that it ""probably"" started as a Poly Tech but was ""neutered"" when it reached the US, but I can't confirm that so I am selling it as an exceptionally nice Chinese Mak 90. It will also include the original sling, (1) 30 round metal magazine and (1) 40 round metal magazine.
