From what I can see you can't buy one of these for $50, riser or not, so I feel this will be a fair price. I can accept PayPal and can ship. Shipping will cost you $6.

This pistol was one of the inaugural release of the then new All-American Model 2000 pistol designed by Reed Knight (founder of Knight's Armament). The pistol featured a rotary locking barrel, straight-line trigger pull, and passive internal safety. This example, no. 2,351 of 3,000, retains virtually all of its original blue finish while the Palo Alto grip panels with inset Colt medallions are similarly in practically new condition. The pistol is housed in its original blue plastic case with cardboard carton and comes with: two 15 rd. magazines, loading tool, cleaning brush, warranty card, manual, and American Rifleman article excerpt from 1992 detailing the pistol. Also included is a 1991 dated Colt factory letter that lists a shipping date of October 24, 1991, to Midwest Recreational Shooting Supply of Ashland, OH. These pistols were intended to function much like a double-action revolver in the hopes of garnering police sales during the general transition over to semi-autos in the late '80s and early '90s, but never proved popular. They are seldom seen today and this example is in practically new condition; a rare late 20th century Colt.

This is a like new handgun. This gun is extremely clean. Look at the pictures of it taken apart. If you are buying a used gun always ask for pictures of the internal components to verify the stated condition is true! If a seller refuses do not buy the gun, they are hiding something! 

I purchased this gun march 2015 and after taxes and transfer fees paid, it was close to $600 from Cabelas. Taxes add up quick when you buy a gun new! 

There is no fouling, the gun is well oiled and it has been cared for well. The gun comes with a free carrying case, lock, stopper, two 17 round clips and a few grip adjusters (backstraps).

I am willing to consider trades. Feel free to shoot me an email. 

Please Local Buyers only - If you have cash and are over 18 the gun is yours, it is that simple. I'm asking 450 or best offer. No additional tax or hidden fees! 450 flat, and this remarkable American made, time proven reliable pistol is yours.

There are some decent prices online but those are for large bulk orders which also include shipping and hazardous material transport fees. Buying bulk is the only price feasible option.

Here's my pitch - I will be ordering 5000 CCI 450 SMALL RIFLE PRIMERS sometime this evening. I am looking for anyone who is interested in picking some up @ cost from the order.....increments of 500 for $16.50 or 1000 for $33.00. I am keeping 1-1.5k for myself so 3500-4000 will be up for grabs. No money until you meet in person to pick them up....strictly looking for anyone interested.

I have been to Scheels n West Des Moines, Sportsman's Warehouse in Ankeny and Bass Pro Shop in Altoona. These three places either have no stock, crazy high prices (49.99/1k), buying limits or some terrible combination of the three. I reload cause I'm cheap ;)

It is chambered in 7.62x39mm. I would rather sell, but will consider certain trade offers. Pistol comes with the following:

1) Hogue Grip
2) Echo 93 Sling Mount
3) Single-point Sling (not pictured)
4) Midwest Industries Handguard
5) Midwest Industries Flash Hider
6) Indent Pin and Spring installed to hold flash hider (not a pin and weld job)
7) Rail Covers (currently an OD green and black combo)
8) Angled Foregrip
9) Flashlight and Red Laser ($40 CP wallyworld brand, but it works and has held up)
10) Original Wood Handguard which has been refinished (stained and polyurethane) (not pictured)
11) Two metal mags

Pistol has been shot on two occasions, seen 5-6 boxes of non-corrosive Tula Ammo through it (so 100 - 120 rds), and has been meticulously cleaned and cared for. Yes, I baby my firearms. I bought it because I'm a big AK fan and thought I would like this and it turns out I don't. Ran with zero malfunctions of any kind, but in my humble opinion it just isn't a practical firearm. I prefer something with a stock. Make no mistake though, it is FUN to shoot and it really barks when it fires! Definitely a head turner at the range (not that thats a great reason to purchase a firearm but it doesn't hurt either). Will be using the money for another AK purchase.

Yes, you can get a plain Jane one of these with a wood handguard for less at fleet farm and if that's what you're looking for, great! If you want one where you don't have to piece together the bells and whistles and for less than what you would pay in product and shipping, then this one is for you.

It has a slick side (brass deflector only) and an American made 20"" fluted barrel with a 1:8 twist chambered in .223 WYLDE. It has an ATI 15"" free float handguard installed (details view-able at: http://www.atigunstocks.com/rifles/ar-15/ar-15/ar15-forends/ar-15-aluminum-8-sided-15-free-float-forend-and-utility-rail-package) It is complete with bolt and charging handle and only needs sights/optic before hitting the range! It has only been fired once (and only about a dozen rounds) to function test it. It ran flawlessly, and I had plans to put some high $$$ glass and a nice muzzle break to round out it's long range capabilities, but that is no longer an option for me financially at this point. So I'll leave it to you to decide how best to dress her. If you have any questions feel free to email me. Price is somewhat negotiable, but Please be reasonable with your offers...
