Beretta A300 Outlander is a gas operated Semi-Auto Shotgun that uses a compensating exhaust valve allowing the shotgun to cycle a wide range of ammunition, from 2-3/4"" target loads to 3"" magnum waterfowl loads. A self-cleaning gas piston enhances reliability and ease of maintenance. The A300 Outlander semi-automatic shotgun breaks down into 4 major components, making it quick and tool-free to fieldstrip, even under adverse conditions. The rugged, weather-resistant synthetic stock adjusts for length of pull, and has an adjustable shim system that allows you to customize the drop and cast, so you have a semi-automatic shotgun that fits right, points instinctively, and swings fluidly on fast moving targets. A reversible safety adapts the A300 for left- or right-handed shooters. Sling swivel posts on stock and fore-end cap allow for carrying the A300 slung on your shoulder while carrying hunting gear. The barrel of the A300 is chrome lined, and uses standard Beretta Mobilchoke®. The barrel comes with a ventilated rib and bead sight, and the receiver is grooved to accept aftermarket optical sights. The Beretta A300 Outlander is a great value for a versatile, ultra reliable Semi-Auto Shotgun that's well suited for hunting waterfowl, turkeys, and upland game. Made in USA."

Beautifully cut stock with glowing red oak finish! PU scope mount drilled and tapped into the receiver ( not like that garbage rear sight mounted crap). Also has a bent bolt to accommodate the scope mount. It has a thick rubber butt pad to absorb the recoil. Barrel is professionally cut to 16"" and then threaded to fit the heavy duty side and top ported muzzle brake. This rifle is fun at the range. Scares the piss out of everyone around because of the intense gas pressure and fireball the muzzle creates. Only reason to part with it is I am a lefty. Now that I purchased some left hand bolt rifles I am never going back to right hand. This beauty just collects dust now. Thanks for looking!"

This is a Stag Arms Model 3 (Mil-spec lower with chrome lined barrel and bolt carrier). Comes from the factory with the Diamondhead VRS handguard. I installed the high dollar Diamondhead battle sights, along with Magpul ACS stock, Magpul grip, Magpul vert grip, Magpul light mount, and Magpul enhanced trigger guard. I also upgraded the factory bolt to a Stag Arms higher quality mil-spec bolt (158 carpenter-shot peened-mp/hp tested). This rifle is ready to go. It's been shot only once (60 rounds), and that was to zero the iron sights and the Trijicon ACOG Reflexx II (also included with the rifle). The rifle is zero'd at 50 yards. The reflex sight is used but not abused. The amber dot is still very visible in day and low-light. This will come with the extra factory bolt, Streamlight Polytac flashlight, factory plastic case, paperwork, lock and 9x Magpul Pmags with ammo loaded into each mag. (Federal Lake City XM193 to be exact).

I'm only wanting to sell or trade this gun because I purchased a high dollar Arsenal AK at the same time I purchased this Stag and I prefer the AK. Nothing against the AR guns, I've had three before, I just like AK's for what they are."

Fantastic Conditon, has about 500 rounds through. Never any problem. Very well maintained after each range trip. Im ocd, white glove it when im done ;)

Has the PRP Drop in kit which was installed myself (im not a gunsmith, but have done quite a few trigger jobs, and with the youtube video it was very simple) and that has about 400 rounds thru it with that setup. The trigger is awesome, most of you know how great it is. Pull is very short, crisp, and 3-4lbs.

Stock trigger parts are also included.

I also added the stainless steel pins from powder river just to give it a nice contrast.
everything you see in the picture is included, no holster mag pouch or any of that junk.

I would like a local sale in northeast ohio, im not sure how shipping works when it comes to handguns, but if we can work it out lets do it."

Great condition and a gun I have loved owning but now that I'm doing different types of hunting I just need a smaller caliber.. This gun has always been taken care of, it feeds ammo very well.. It's rare to have any kind of jam ups.. And most of the time it's because of the ammo.. But I have had no complaints

It's a pre safety. The only difference I've seen between this and other 336s is the forend cap system that is used instead of the barrel band."

I have put a lot of effort and love into this rifle and it shows. 

The MAK-90 is my personal favorite AK variant. It features the crispest trigger of all the AK variants, as well as a thicker receiver, chromed barrel, and the famous AK reliability. The rifling is in good shape, and there have probably been less than 1000 rounds through it. If you think Chinese weapons are cheap, think again. This is a very solid rifle.

This rifle's finish is much more durable and attractive than the original Chinese bluing. It has a U.S. Palm battle grip, and I refinished the rifle with extremely durable matte black Duracoat. I threw out the post-ban thumbhole stock and replaced it with refinished and re-crafted surplus Romanian furniture. I'm really proud of how the furniture turned out; it's a beautiful shade of cherry red.

I'm including lots of extras:
Hard-sided rifle case
Nearly complete parts kit, including: three recoil springs, a replacement firing pin, trigger group, and a bunch of other stuff
3 steel magazines
200 rounds of Russian ammo (still in box and stored in an airtight environment)

Too small and it’s becomes too hard to shoot. Too big and you can’t fit it where it needs to go. It has to be “just right.” The 1911-380 is 85% of the size of the original 1911 45 ACP model. It’s ideal for concealed carry duty, and for fitting a wider variety of shooters. NEW IN BOXAuthenticity matters - The 1911-380 is the only authentically designed, full-featured 1911-style handgun currently available that is chambered in 380 ACP. Compact, for sure. But the 1911-380 is just a tiny bit larger than many micro 380s. Why?Feels better - You get greater shooting comfort because the grip is long enough for three fingers to fit below the trigger guard. Shoots better - Yes, the slide and barrel are longer. But this greatly improves accuracy and function -- yet the 1911-380 only weighs 3-5 ounces more than subcompacts.Follows up better - It is the perfect size to reduce recoil and barrel jump, and allow for more comfortable shooting, more control, and more accurate follow-up shots.Conceals better - It is easily concealed with its smaller size and single-stack magazine that offer a compact, flat profile that fits easily inside the waistband and keeps the grip narrow for shooters with smaller hands.Specs:Model #: 1911-380 Black LabelType: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Matte BlueStock: CompositeSights: FixedBarrel: 4.25 Stainless Steel Barrel Block, Target CrownOverall Length: 7.5Weight: 17.8 ozCaliber: 380Capacity: 8+1Action: Single Action# of Mags: 1Packaging: Plastic CaseReceiver: CompositeFeatures: Extended Slide Release.
