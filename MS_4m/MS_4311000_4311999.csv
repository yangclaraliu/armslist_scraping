The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semi auto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.Manufacturer: Beretta ( Made in Italy )Model: 92FS Caliber: .9mmBarrel: 4.9""Capacity: 15Action: Single/Double Action"

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.SPECIFICATIONSCaliber: 9mmx19Overall Length: 6.40""Overall Height: 4.55""Overall Width: 1.37""Barrel Length: 3.26""Sight Radius: 5.18""Weight With Magazine: 24 ozWith Empty Magazine: 1.50 lbMagazine Capacity: 10 RoundsSingle Action Trigger Pull: N/ADouble Action Trigger Pull: 11.47 lbsSights: 3-Dot"

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™. SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: .45ACP Recoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod Sights: Fiber Optic Front & Dovetail Rear (Steel) Weight (with Empty Magazine): 21.5 ozs.

Everyone who owns a gun, owns a shotgun. Until late last year, most of them had never been suppressed. The Salvo™ 12 is the first commercially-viable shotgun suppressor and represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology. The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting clays, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense, and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you’ll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again. All shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and other outside the Continental US will be the actual cost of shipping."

The Silver Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, Nickel plated buttplate and gleaming Nickel plated receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.
Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.
Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight.

Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.-Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.-Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.-Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).-Unique Two-Stage Target Trigger featuring a short “take-up” stage, followed by a crisp, light target pull withno creep or overtravel.-Also Includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels.

It's an early HRT model with a full length operating rod.  It has Kensight sights with the rear sight being white dot and the front sight being a trijicon glowing dot.  The grip is wood, the safety is oversized and ambidextrous, and the pistol has a large beaver tail  The entire inner trigger system has been replaced with a Cylinder and Slide trigger.  It is a fantastic trigger!  

The finish shows some wear as it was my carry pistol for a few years.  The extractor could use a professional tuning.  This is a terrific start for a project pistol.  It has many options already included, for the price I'm asking.  I'm asking 500.00 for the pistol and all accessories. I'm not coming down from that.  I've spent hundreds on upgrades and accessories and 500.00 is a very fair price.  The reason I'm asking that little is due to the finish and extractor, but even with those setbacks you'd still be closer to a 100% custom pistol at a much, much cheaper price than starting with a new pistol. I'm not interested in trades.

I'm including all the accessories I have for it, which are the following:
Original case, holster, and two mag holder, bore brush, allen wrench
6x Springfield Armory 7 round magazines

No longer have time to fly fish so it's gotta go. I have 190 flies for sale, some are never used and some are. All organized in a Simms foam box. It fly cost me $2 dollars a piece but I'm selling them for .25 cents a piece, which comes out to $50 dollars for the whole box of flies. If you want i can give you the two leaders and the fly knot book too. The book is in great condition and has some awesome info on fly fishing. I'm asking $15 for the book. The two fly reels are made by Shakespeare fishing company. They are automatic fly rods, they come in handy when you have a couple of feet of fly line out and you need to reel it in. Just pull the lever and it spools up in a instant. I'm asking $15 dollars a piece. I'm willing to sell each independently but prefer to sell as one transaction. If you buy it all I'll sell it for $75.  Prefer FTF in the Reading area but can ship, you pay shipping. Take care and thanks for looking."

The blue is bright & shiny, deep & rich, showing very little wear, mostly limited to some of the high spots. There are no rust or pitting issues just a couple of minor handling marks; excellent condition. The stocks are walnut; flat bottomed grooved pump handle, the butt stock is fluted with a pistol grip & has a hard rubber butt plate.

I also have a Sear's & Roebuck SxS 16 gauge shotgun, It is actually a J.C. Higgins Model 101.7 that was made for Sears, It is a fine a example of a SxS shotgun as you will see, It is absolutely like it came from the factory in every aspect, it actually looks to be un-Fired, It has a very little crack mark at the toe of the stock that has been repaired at the factory, it still has the butt plate, and it also has all of the case colors still in the receiver, this shot gun has been in a safe it's entire life and has only been fired a couple of times if any...it is chambered for 2.75"" shells only, it has double triggers and ejectors, it is a solid 99% MINT condition shotgun...I am asking $450 for the shotgun but I have a little room for negotiation if you take all of the 16ga shells with it...I don't have a way to send pictures, I just acquired a new phone but I have yet to figure out how to send pictures from it, how ever, if we meet, I guarantee that you will be extremely pleased with the condition of this shotgun...This shot gun would surely bring $500-$600 on Gun Broker..."
