11595E Barrel steel, Manganese Phosphate finish, F-Marked Front sight base. 
This 5.56mm cal barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function in full or semi auto. 
The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate the heat of full auto fire. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.
The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A2 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified 7075T6.511 alloy forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. This upper has the newest Mil-spec A2 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

It comes with (1) 7-round factory magazine and the original box. DA/SA action on the trigger and a combo safety/decocker on the slide. Round count is estimated at about 100 rounds. Finish overall is excellent, function is smooth, trigger is nice. Not a lot else to say. It's a great pistol, but I'm in the process of buying something else and could use a little more cash to make that purchase happen.

So, cash only, no trades.

You'll get:

* Bersa Thunder 380 Pistol
* (1) Bersa 7-Round Magazine
* Box with paperwork (missing internal lock key)
* 100 rounds 380acp FMJ ammo
* 25 rounds Hornady Critical Defense

Price is with ammo only and is FIRM at $350

I do have one and only one trade I would consider - a Hi-Point 4595 Carbine with the newer tactical stock. I don't care for the light or laser, so that wouldn't add value for me. Extra magazines would add a little value. Any trade would be the carbine + cash on your end. No other trade offers will be considered.

Meeting will be FTF in the Portland Metro area. Oregon residents only unless you want to pay the FFL transfer fee. 

I will need to see both a current ODL and current CHL or no deal.

Contact me via the ""contact seller"" button on this page and we'll go from there. I can usually get back to you in 1-2 hours tops during the work day."

It's all of 2 months old. Round count is about 150. Finish overall is like new, function is smooth, trigger is nice. It's double action only with a trigger pull that isn't too heavy. The tilt barrel makes chambering that first round much easier than trying to pull back on that small slide. 

If you don't know these pistols, I can say it's a great little plinker and even a possible defensive option for folks that are really recoil sensitive, want to deep conceal a small gun or just can't handle a larger gun. You can shoot this all day and never get tired. As these tend to be tight when new, I can tell you after 150 rounds, it's running flawlessly for me. It's a great pistol, but I'm in the process of buying something else and could use a little more cash to make that purchase happen.

So, cash only, no trades.

You'll get:

* Taurus PT22 .22lr Pistol
* (1) Taurus Magazine
* Box with paperwork, drawstring bag.

Price is FIRM at $200

In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29SF 10 mm with a 10 round magazine capacity standard.

The barrel is full octagon with full length magazine tube. The forend is the full length style at 9 3/4"". The front sight is adjustable with set screw and silver bead. The rear sight is 3 leaf . The barrel has most of the original blue remaining, the magazine tube is gray. The receiver is gray with the initials CM etched on the left side and a # 94 etched on the right side...The letters that are etched do not penetrate the metal more like a scratch on the surface. The action is tight and locks up well and the screws do not show any sign of abuse. No rust or pitting on any of the metal on this rifle. The bore is good with good rifeling but some darkness in the groves. The forend wood is good with lots of dings and scratches. The butt stock wood also lots of dings and scratches and a crack near the receiver on both sides. The wood appears to have been sanded and varnished. This is a well used but not abused rifle that has managed well since 1902. I have a letter from the Cody Firearms Museum that states this rifle was originally shipped with the 20"" octagon barrel. A good specimen for a collector of short rifles.

It doesn't have that ""feature"".  It also has the firing pin mounted on the hammer.  Full stainless steel 4 inch barrel with full underlug, red ramp sight, stainless L-Frame (more durable than model 19s or 66s), I replaced the grips with Nills.  For those unaware, Nills are German made grips made from the finest walnut in the world, perfectly fit and finished... they will make Hogue grips blush, there is simply no higher quality grip on the market.  The Nills make your hand sit higher on the grip, lowering the bore axis and properly positioning your finger on the trigger.  Speaking of the trigger, this has a trigger job from the Performance center, it is the finest trigger on a revolver I've ever shot, period.  The gun has been fired, but cleaned and maintained well.  With the trigger, the gun is easily one of my best shooters and it's an absolute riot at the range.  I will include a couple of speed loaders to get you going with the gun.  

Asking price is 875$ even, FIRM on that given the amount of work and cost of the grips on the pistol.  Trust me, it's worth that price and then some.  I'm pearing down my pistol collection tho, and this one's strickly a range pistol for me, not a CCW piece, so it's on the chopping block.  You COULD CCW this if you wanted, it's not a huge pistol, but I'd just like more capacity.  

NO TRADES.  You'll need a pistol purchase permit or a CCW to buy the gun in NC.  I'm local around Apex, but willing to drive to Raleigh or Cary if you're interested in the gun.  I'm also willing to ship on your dime.  If you want the ultimate shooter's revolver and .357 magnum power, this is it.  It hits accurately and hits hard."

The rifling is strong and most of the crud that gives it that dark bore on all mosins has been removed giving the bore a nice shine. I bought this as a consignment so I don't know if it has ever been fired before by the previous owner but I never put any rounds through it. The action cycles without a hitch. It does not have the common sticky bolt. The price I am asking for is 300 obo. The transfer must be done at a with a licensed dealer. For out of state buyers you must use a ffl dealer to do the transfer and you are responsible for all necessary fees. you must make sure you are legally allowed to own this in your area.
