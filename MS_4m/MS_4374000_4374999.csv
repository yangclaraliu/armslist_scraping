This would be a great opportunity to get a great deal on a great gun with lots of extras.  As I am not in a rush to sell this gun, and even had second thoughts about selling it in the first place, I will only be listing this for a few more weeks (some time in October).  This is the absolute lowest price I can offer.

NEW OFFER - This gun is in perfect condition and has a low round count.  Just the gun with the 2 standard mags are running between 875 and 1100 right now (I paid over 900 after shipping and transfer fees).  I am not in a rush to sell the gun, as I am just trying to thin my collection out a bit.   Here is the absolute lowest I could go:

Just the originals (gun, original grips, 2 standard mags, all papers/case):  750.00

Add the G10 grips:  50 (one could definitely get 75-90 on ebay)

Extra 2 14-round mags: 50

If you do all the above, I would sell for 850 and include ALL the holsters and  some Black checkered G10 grips as well.

I could also cut a deal on the ammo if interested.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLD OFFER - I have a Sig Sauer Custom Shop P229 SAS (Sig Anti-Snag) that is in perfect condition.  I have shot it about 8-9 times with a total round count of 335 rounds.  I cleaned the gun after each use and it runs flawless.  The gun came with the E2 grips (which I still have), but I replaced them with the Scorpion G10 grips (with the Sig logo) to give it that little extra 'cool' look.  It came with 2-12 round magazines, but I bought an additional 2-14 rounders (Mec-Gar with the +2 extension).  

I also have two holsters for it as well which have never been used other than to check the fit for the gun one time.  They are a Safariland Duty 200-74 which is leather with kydex inside the leather and the inside is lined in suede, and a Don Hume H722 FLETC leather holster with an 'P229"" imprinted on the front.  These can be sold with or without the gun.

I also have about 950 rounds of .40 s/w ammo for sale (mostly WWB, Federal, and Freedom Munitions) that I can sell separately, if interested.

Below are the prices:

Gun with original items (2-12 round mags, E2 grips, case/papers) - 785.00
Hogue G10 grips - 100.00
2-14 round mags - 55.00
Safariland Holster - 40.00

Our Model 700 XCR Long Range Tactical Rifle, features a 40-X externally adjustable trigger and 416 stainless steel barreled action with Black TriNyte® PVD coating, providing a diamond-hard layer of defense against the elements.
Its new tactical Bell & Carlson stock comes in OD green with black webbing and features a full-length aluminum bedding block, tactical beaver-tail fore-end and a recessed thumb-hook feature for optimum “off the bench” shooting performance. The barrel features wide tactical-style barrel fluting for rapid cooling."

Please read the following carefully:
The stock is the main body and hand guard only! It comes with the necessary screws to mount the receiver and hand guard. It also comes with the butt stock retainer screw.

Here are a few following important feature to keep in mind: 
While this stock accepts a REM 700 Long Action it is designed to accept the 338 Lapua Mag CIP mags. Unfortunately this means it cannot accept smaller magazine for the standard 338 Lapua Mag and 300 Win Mag magazines. It does not include the butt stock or pistol grip!

Also this is a USED stock so regular wear and tear around the magazine area should be expected along with the magazine itself too.

This is a rifle made by Bushmaster they called the ""Assault Rifle"". Its design is a cross between an AK47 and an M16. It does have the stamped steel upper on the machined aluminum lower. If you know Bushmaster, you know how rare this gun is, especially with the folding stock. A 30 round aftermarket magazine is included. The fore end wood is painted black and we are assuming that it is factory paint. There are a few minor dings in the paint but there are no cracks or repairs in the wood. We have not fired the gun, but the action is smooth and strong. The bore looks good as does the bolt face. And yes, this gun is very shootable. Pictures tell the story. We respond to all requests for more information and photos.

Ive had this for quite awhile now and since cleaning all the cosmoline and dirt off it, its been back in the safe and not being used. Time to move it on.

The rifle is an Early Sino-Banian 1956 ""GHOST"" Chinese SKS.
5 digit serial number and is ALL matching including stock
It was likely produced in Chongquing at Jisnshe arsenal in 1956
These early rifles are comparable to the Russian SKS 45s in most every way with the wood type being somewhat different on many but not all carbines.

Rifle's bore is bright and shiny and not counter-bored.
All matching in numbers, and bears but some Russian and Chinese inspection
marking.    The stock is rough typical for the Chinese Stocks shows wear and
small dings, and scratches, I will let the pictures show how the stock is.
I have never gotten around to firing the rifle,  I ran 10 dummy rounds through
it to check function and it ran without any issues. These early SKS are becoming
harder to find.

I've been on this site for about 2 years, finally registered a few weeks ago, just because. Anyway, before you buy ammo, especially in CA, it would behoove you to check actual retail stores. There are a lot of guys on here selling ammo that is actually cheaper online or even in box stores. I know, I hate going to box stores as well but help get these guys off of here. Flag them. I've seen .223, .380, and plenty of others twice the amount of box stores and 2.5X's that at online stores. So check those sites before you buy from some of these ammo guys. It's really pathetic. Apparently, no one told them there was never really a shortage to begin with. Have a good day. Remember, Armslist generally lets us trade, buy, and sell without fees and dues.

I've been on this site for about 2 years, finally registered a few weeks ago, just because. Anyway, before you buy ammo, especially in CA, it would behoove you to check actual retail stores. There are a lot of guys on here selling ammo that is actually cheaper online or even in box stores. I know, I hate going to box stores as well but help get these guys off of here. Flag them. I've seen .223, .380, and plenty of others twice the amount of box stores and 2.5X's that at online stores. So check those sites before you buy from some of these ammo guys. It's really pathetic. Apparently, no one told them there was never really a shortage to begin with. Have a good day. Remember, Armslist generally lets us trade, buy, and sell without fees and dues. Help Armslist police this place and get the quacks outta here. Thanks for lookin'."

The Springfield XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact Model is an amazingly slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2- .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3"" barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XDs, the Mod.2 Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. The GripZone ergonomics set the XD Mod.2 apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2 Sub-Compact on target for round after round."

As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!"

This model features a tip up barrel design which allows the user to load the magazine full then tip the barrel up with a trip lever on the side to add a round into the breech then fire to cycle the magazine. Perfect for those who have a hard time racking a slide. This weapon can also be chambered by pulling the slide like a typical semi auto.  This weapon is VERY accurate for such a compact design.

I bought it thinking that I would get a lot of use out of it, but its got a little too much punch for a small old dude, so I got a 20 gauge instead.  The only thing wrong with it is that it doesnt like those target loads.  The better full case size shells seem to work well.  I cant promise it anything, cause I ran out of shells when we were out at the range shooting stuff.  Probably better off if you know your shotguns and know how to fix, or fine tune them.  But... its pretty dang cool.  If you are interested, you must have a photo ID, and a permit to carry.  I will not sell to anyone I deem irresponsible.  REDACTED.

This is a very early example, with a prototype first model front sight. Probably one of the first hundred or so made. From what I can tell, t was manufactured circa 1940. It has no serial numbers.

These rifles are legendary for their accuracy. The US military used them for training rifles in WWII. These rifles came factory tapped for scope mounts. I bought at new mount and new scope for the rifle, and it also comes with the original prototype peep sight. It also has a bull barrel.

The bore is in good shape. The rifle shoots .5"" groups at 25 yards. I've taken it squirrel hunting the past few years, though it is heavy. Overall condition I would say is good. Plum patina covers all exposed metal parts, and the walnut stock is worn. The rifle isn't beat up, it just has a lot of character! When I bought it, I took it apart and there were little bits of hay on the inside. In its past, I think it spent some time as a barn gun.

I'm asking $400 for this rifle. Please text/call me at REDACTED anytime. Thanks!

I am deciding to sell my Mossberg 500, and all of its accessories. I bought the gun new in December of 2014.

I have about 250 rounds through the shotgun. It functions, fires and ejects beautifully. It features a wood stock / forend, both of which are in like-new condition, as well as a ported 28'' barrel with interchangeable chokes (includes extra improved cylinder and full chokes). 

I also have a Mossberg factory 18.5'' barrel ($100) and 14'' LOP Hogue Overmold stock set ($65) to offer with the shotgun. 

I am asking $395 for the whole enchilada, and am pretty firm at that price point. I would prefer to sell everything at once, but will consider selling the Hogue stock set and 18.5'' barrel seperately.

For $799 plus actual shipping is a BRAND NEW unfired VEPR 12 semi-automatic AK-type shotgun made by Molot. I just bought it (and can point you to where). Unfortunately, I didn't realized that some of these were fixed stock vs. folding stock (but welded open). This one is fixed stock, incapable of being modified to be a folding stock. So, I'm selling it at a loss to buy the one I meant to buy. No mag is included (I'm keeping it), but you'll get the shotgun, original box, and original manual. Photos are here: http://imgur.com/a/6qvNh/

SOLD PENDING FUNDS. For $399 plus actual shipping is a Remington Model 11 The Sportsman 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun with Cutts compensator. It is US Property marked, indicating use by the military during WWII (for training only, I believe). Licensed copy of the Browning Auto-5. I believe this shotgun to be original finish. It is not entirely original in parts, though. The butt plate has been replaced with a recoil pad (not by me!). Also, the barrel has a different serial number than the receiver. I cannot remember if the stock or trigger group did -- assume none of the serial numbers match. The forearm had a serious crack which I have repaired with fiberglass. I took the gun shooting once (to make sure it worked after the forearm repair) and it functioned flawlessly with everything I put through it: slugs, buckshot, light & heavy birdshot. The bore is bright and shiny. Since this is The Sportsman model, the magazine only holds 2 rounds. A nice gun. Photos are here: http://imgur.com/a/6AMBB/

Either of these can go to a full-fledged FFL. The first one can go to a C&R FFL. Either can also go to any adult TN resident (without an FFL) meeting the legal requirements...
