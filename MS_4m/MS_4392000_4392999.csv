 The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.
When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

130,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4392130,For Sale:  PVS-15 Gen 3 Night Vision Goggles - Like New! Full Kit!,"Boaz, Huntsville, Alabama","$ 4,800","Listed On: Tuesday, June 2, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am the original owner and purchased these BRAND NEW in August 2014 from Wilcox Engineering (Ed Wilcox is a living legend in the night vision world). These are the full kit MARSOC NVBS-15 Gen 3 Night Vision Goggles still in use by both Marine and Army SOF. I have the original Wilcox invoice (pictured below), showing these have over a YEAR remaining on the Wilcox warranty (Aug 2016)!

As you can see by the invoice, these have Omni VII MX-10160A tubes installed. These tubes are NOT autogated, something I specifically wanted since I live in rural farm country. This means these 15's are COMPLETELY SILENT (the night vision ""whine"" you hear in movies comes from ""Autogating"" power supplies, which can be NOISY!) If you're an urban door-kicking high-speed death machine, you may want to have autogated tubes. The left tube has two factory blemishes (normal) -- one on the extreme outer edge of Zone-3 at the 1:00 position, and a small one at the outer edge of Zone-2 at about 2:00. NO BLEMS IN ZONE 1. The right tube has a few flecks, but nothing major.

I can take PayPal, but prefer cash (obviously) for FTF transactions. My ID matches the Wilcox invoice (both name and address), these were NOT originally sold to the military (i.e. they are NOT stolen US.GOV property!!!). Happy to meet up at night here in Cowtown, USA for you to try them out and see what a gorgeous set of SOF-spec Gen 3 NV goggles are all about. If you haven't experience dual tubes, or real Gen 3 NV, prepare to have your mind blown! These NVBS-15 are WATERPROOF and are spec'd to be submersible to 66-feet UNDER WATER! They're lighter than the older-style PVS-15, and the tubes articulate independently -- a HUGE benefit when you want to shoulder a rifle while keeping your night vision view over the other eye!

Call, text, email for more info or to make offers. I still have the original battery in them, and have used them for fewer than 20 hours (on tubes that will last >10,000 hours of power-on time!)."

Description from their website:The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1″ overall length and an 18.5″ cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3″ shells each, for a total capacity of 6 6 1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4″ shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.Will ship to your FFL for $20.

The INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. 

The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. 


All INCOG holsters come with either a Tactical Fuzz or Camo Coating are available with black, gray or green Kydex."

These oversized match barrels are the heaviest possible match-legal barrels that can fit in the M1A, and they feature a 1 in 10 twist that gives optimal performance for the .308 match bullets we recommend. The Super Match also features a National Match recoil spring guide and a match-tuned gas cylinder. Add the match tuned 4.5 – 5lb two-stage trigger, .0595” hooded rear aperture (½ MOA adjustable) and .062” front sight, and the resultant rifle will blow away the competition with its precision and accuracy."

Finally, I have an original AG Russell Sting I.  It was bought as a collectors piece and has been treated as such.  Beautiful mirror polished one piece construction with rosewood scales.  Sadly, the original sheath is not included and the price reflects that.  Asking $175.

Really not looking for any trades right now, I could use cash more than I can anything else right now.  I have no problem bundling any of the knives and would prefer it with the SOG's and Boker.   Thanks for looking."

Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. Easy to Conceal Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. Personal Protection Made Easy The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. Easy to Use and Maintain The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense
The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense.

Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Easy to Conceal

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

Personal Protection Made Easy

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.

Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
This is a new venture so you will be in on the ground floor. We will develop as we go. Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each.  I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience. 
If you are interested, please contact me by email and we can set up a time for viewing. I am retired so any day of the week is good for me.

This is a tough day. Due to a recent move and some unexpected costs I have been forced to move a few guns from the safe. I've held out as long as possible on this one, but to no avail. As the title says, this is an Ultimate Tactical Carry (UTC). I am the first owner - bought new from Crazy John at 1911 Heaven in the fall of 2013. I've (regrettably) only shot approximately 700 rounds through this gun. Other than a small amount of holster wear on the left side of the slide this gun is in great condition. It will come shipped with the 3 original LB magazines as well as 2 Wilson 47D's and a Wilson mag-well. Gun has black Ergo grips installed, but comes with the original wood stocks. I've also thrown in some VZ Diamondbacks. Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm asking $1,800 shipped to your ffl.
