I am selling two high end OEM knives, this for those of you who won't look up the term before emailing me and wasting my time, means Original Equipment Manufacture. These knives are basically clones. They are high end clones, with the same materials as you would find in standard Kershaw, Spyderco, CRKT, Boker, etc knives, but fashioned after much more expensive knives.

The spyderco Rubicon runs 9cr13mov steel and the ZT 0770 runs 440C steel. I have taken them both apart, clean and lubed with Tuf Glide. The Rubicon is very smooth, but a bit large for my hands. The ZT 0770 is assisted open, aluminum handles, fits nice in hand, but isn't one of my favorites so I'm selling it. I am asking $50 cash firm for both of them and would like to sell both together.

As a result the PWS bolt carriers allow chamber pressure to be greatly reduced for easier extraction.Standard Mass Standard bolt carriers don’t have this feature.Contact Gaps and channels between skid pads on PWS carriers allow for fewer points of contact. This results in less friction and keeps debris from interfering with function.Standard Contact Standard bolt carriers don’t have these channels. They are also often parkerized, which is not as wear-resistant as Isonite QPQ.Charging Handle Machined from 7075 T6 Aluminum and hard coat anodized, the BCMGunfighter Charging Handle’s latch is designed to put less stress on the roll pin, extending service life.Standard Handle Standard charging handles have a greater tendency to have a roll pin fail on account of current trends in weapon manipulation.PWS DI Gas Block The low profile gas block found in Modern Musket rifles is machined in house from heat-treated tool steel and is much lighter than standard low profile gas blocks.Standard Gas Block Standard low profile gas blocks can add unnecessary bulk.Accuracy PWS Modern Musket Rifles feature quality components for the best possible accuracy.PWS Barrels Utilizing only the highest quality chromoly barrel blanks, PWS DI barrels are turned in house then Isonite QPQ treated inside and out for hardness and corrosion resistance, resulting in a great enhancement over standard mil-spec accuracy.Standard Barrels Standard barrels and are typically chrome lined on the inside, parkerized on the outside, and have a thinner, less accurate profile.PWS Muzzle Devices PWS muzzle devices offer superior muzzle control, and are precision-machined on a 7-axis CNC lathe , heat-treated for hardness and wear resistance, and finished with a Mil-Spec parkerization process.Standard Devices Standard compensators are typically not manufactured to as stringent standards as PWS muzzle devices, and don’t offer the same level of recoil or muzzle rise compensation as PWS muzzle devices.ALG QMC Trigger PWS rifles sport ALG Defense’s Quality Mil-Spec trigger for a smooth pull and a crisp break.Standard Trigger The use of standard triggers often results in a decrease in accuracy due to gritty trigger creep.Buffer Many adaptations that enhanced and increased the reliability of the PWS long-stroke piston system are directly applicable to the PWS Modern Musket™ DI Rifles as well, like the iconic PWS Enhanced Buffer Tube and Buffer.PWS Indexing Eliminating the castle nut, the PWS EBT’s unique indexing screw & plate system ensures precise alignment of the buffer tube.Standard Indexing Standard buffer tubes are indexed using a castle nut, which make installation and alignment a difficult job.EBT LIP The PWS EBT features a lip that extends into the receiver to support the carrier at rest, allowing for smooth entry into buffer tube upon cycling of the action.Standard LIP Standard buffer tubes do not have this feature.QD Attachments The PWS EBT has QD sling attachments machined directly into the aluminum.Standard Buffer Tube Standard buffer tubes typically serve very few additional functions.Drain Holes and Fluting The PWS EBT has 4 drain holes in addition to the rear drain hole, allowing more water to escape the system, while fluting creates channels for debris.Standard Buffer Tube Standard buffers tubes have no additional drain holes besides the rear drain hole, and are not fluted.H2 Buffer The PWS H2 Buffer consists of a tungsten weight housed in a steel body coated in nickel Teflon for reduced friction.Standard Buffer Standard M4 buffers are carbine weight and utilize an aluminum housing.Ergonomics PWS engineers designed a handguard which is ergonomic as well as durable. Featuring the KeyMod interface, the Modern Musket™ series handguard eliminates unnecessary weight and allows for a wide range of accessory placement.PWS Handguard PWS handguards utilize the KeyMod interface for maximum weight savings, in addition to QD sling swivel mounts forward and rear.Standard Handguard AR handguards are often heavy and bulky due to a picatinny quad rail pattern that may require additional panels for comfort, resulting in an unbalanced weapon system.

It's never been dropped in the dirt, banged up against anything hard or gotten wet. I simply don't use it any more and that is why I'm getting rid of it. It only comes with the rifle itself and 1 10rd clip.

This safe has a de humidifier rod and lights. Will hold approximately 30 or so long guns. And can hold approximately 15 to 30 hand guns.

Was ordered with naked slide, meaning no front cocking serrations or roll markings. This makes for a very clean, mean looking pistol. The Baer bluing is in excellent condition, and very good looking. I have shot this Baer less than 50 rounds. My intention was to send to Alchemy Custom, (who does exceptional 1911 work) and have some modifications/enhancements performed such as ball cut the hood, french borders and flat top-serrate the top. I however ran across a pistol that had this work and more already performed on it, for far less than it costed. I have the original Baer high dollar box and paper work for this UTC. I did have a 10-8 rear site installed right after I purchased the pistol. I have this site on my Baer Custom Carry, and another 1911 and love it. Ask any questions you may have. If you own or have shot a Baer 1911 you understand what they are. If not, do some internet research reading before bidding. Pistol ships from my FFL to yours, you pay actual shipping and applicable transfer paperwork fees. In person Wisconsin resident purchase requires Wis drivers license, but a CC card preferred.

For serious inquiries, i'll provide more and close-up pictures of whatever details desired.

This kit started with a Ruger Mini-30 ranch rifle back during the Clinton ban.

The point was and is to have a 7.62-caliber rifle that could adjust to whatever restrictions our overlord “protectors” in Washington DC and their fellow state-level geniuses dream up.

When the District of Criminals goes on a rampage to “reasonably restrict assault weapons”, this rifle can be put back into its original stock, the flash suppressor removed, and loaded with 5-round magazines. That kind of ranch rifle will probably always be legal in the “land of the free”, as long as hunting with guns is legal.

If the zombie apocalypse or WORL scenario develops, it can be put into its Tapco or Choate stock, with the pistol grip, using higher capacity magazines, Picatinny rail, flash suppressor, and so on.

In that configuration, it's ~7.5 lbs unloaded, which is just under the weight of a milled AK-47. Plus, unlike the AK, it's stainless, with more range, accuracy, and higher muzzle velocity(due to 2 inches more of better barrel), with the same 7.62x39 cartridge AK-47 and the SKS use.

This rifle is in great condition, and has rarely been shot over the years.
When it was shot, accuracy was great, if you know what you're doing with a rifle.

Reliability is Ruger with a Garand-style, rotating-bolt semi-auto action! Enough said!

I've always loved this excellent, American rifle from the day I bought it, and it's time to let it go on to new adventures, due to changes in my life...

Kit includes:

Original wood stock
Choate pistolgrip stock
	Made in Arkansas, USA by Choate Tool Corp.
	Very solid, tough and great quality. Nice, thick rubber butt pad.
Tapco stock
	Adjustable stock – both length and angle (includes 2 stock tubes)
Removable forearm grip (very comfortable) I think it's MagPul.
Removable, stainless flash suppressor/compensator (finished to match barrel)
2 OEM Ruger 5-round magazines
5 OEM Ruger 20-round magazines
2 aftermarket steel 20-round magazines
1 aftermarket Thermold plastic 20-round magazines
	Made by D&D Inc. Wilson, NC USA
*Aftermarket magazines don't work with some of the stocks
Ruger sight rings
UTG bag
	Shoulder straps for both vertical and horizontal carry
	Built-in pistol holster
	3 magazine pouches
	*Barrel sticks out the top in most rifle configurations, and zipper closes around it
	This bag is excellent!
Tac Trigger
Single-point combat sling
Probably a couple of other little nick-nacks i can't think of right now.


Will transfer FTF in SC to those with a valid state Concealed-Carry Permit and Driver's License. You'll have to sign a Bill of Sale.
Those without a CWP or buying out-of-state will have to transfer through FFLs. 
(Too many folks blowing a gasket and doing wrong with guns these days.)

Also available, a can of 7.62x39 ammo for most occasions:

39 rounds Winchester FMJ 123gr
59 rounds Winchester SP 123gr (2 boxes of 20 and 1 box of 19)
7 boxes of 20 WPA 122gr non-corrosive, Berdan, steel case + some loose rounds of the kind
11 boxes of 20 Fiocchi FMJ 123gr (brass case) + 1 partial box
1 box of 20 Federal Fusion 123gr SP (the ones with the flat point)
Steel ammo can 
So, about 500 rounds.

15 cents a round + $3 for the can should do it - $75 + shipping.

If I haven't covered anything, please inquire.

Thank you for your attention."

	Hey Everyone, 
This listing is for a brand new/unfired AR Pistol. This is built on a Anderson Lower with an Anderson parts kit. This model has a free float quad rail, flat top, 7.5 inch barrel, A2 birdcage, and a 30rd Windowed polymer magazine. This also has a single point sling adapter installed. This comes with the gun, Windowed magazine, single point sling, aftermarket extended magazine release button, rail covers, and polymer flip sights. 	
	This is a great little entry level AR pistol that would be great for the gal (for obvious reasons), or just swap out the covers and button and be back to “more manly” as they say. Haha. I would also consider trades on this. Possibly for folder AK47s, Marlin lever guns in 357/44, M1 carbines, CMR30s, 45 LC Schofield revolvers, certain black powder revolvers, break over black powder rifles, SP101, Redhawks, Takedown/survival  22lr, etc. Honestly, shoot me a message on here or a text only at REDACTED and we can go from there. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will on mine. Just please be reasonable on your values and I will as well. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

 I have a Remington 700 SPS AAC for trade. The rifle has seen less then 100rnds through the tube. The barrel was broken in, cleaned and then lapped. So there is no need to worry about barrel break in. Recoil lug has been beaded and stock forend was opened up. 20moa rail mount was beaded as well. Easily shoots sub MOA groups.
