LaserMax' innovative laser sight, designed for the most popular semi-automatics, simply replaces your recoil spring guide assembly. It includes a customized take-down lever which performs its original function, as well as serving as the laser's on/off switch. This easy fingertip activation allows for a natural point-and-shoot motion, assuring that LaserMax is ready whenever you are. Once installed, LaserMax adds less than one-quarter ounce of weight. But it adds a great deal when it comes to aiming accuracy and confidence. The Only NATO Approved Internal Laser Sight.

*Totally internal-cannot be knocked out of alignment 
*No permanent modification to gun-remove it anytime 
*No need to change holster or give up your rail flashlight 
*Compatible with your favorite grips and aftermarket accessories

That being said, I ask of you all, PLEASE do not flag any of my posting, it was my mistake NOT listing my phone number, which in hindsight might have brought a little more credibility to my postings, and I did so only to try and do what you folks just did, stop the crap that sometimes comes along with using classified media like this, and Craigslist etc. I am a Proud Veteran of the United States Army, Honorably Discharged, Airborne, Department of Defense Military Working Dog Team, and also served with the Military Police Corp, and Army Security Agency (ASA). I served our Country during the Vietnam conflict, was attached to the 18Th Airborne Corp. I am now retired and living on a very meek disability allowance, but I am still truly blessed.

I replaced the barrel on my Ruger Tactical (Model 1261).  It is the standard 1:16 twist rate, with rifling that shows no wear.  It is less than 3 years old with little use.  It came from the factory 1/2-28 threaded and includes the crush washer and thread protector.   Free shipping to CONUS only.  Paypal accepted. Very easy to swap out barrels on the Ruger 10/22.  Swap out your stock barrel with this Ruger threaded tactical!"

In trade, I would consider a government sized 1911 (cash can be added on my end for the right gun), a CZ 75b in single action, or maybe a nice wheelgun in similiar condition.  Buyer pays transfer fees, as I have this listed below my own investment in the gun.  Thank you for looking and be safe during the holidays."

LaserMax' innovative laser sight, designed for the most popular semi-automatics, simply replaces your recoil spring guide assembly. It includes a customized take-down lever which performs its original function, as well as serving as the laser's on/off switch. This easy fingertip activation allows for a natural point-and-shoot motion, assuring that LaserMax is ready whenever you are. Once installed, LaserMax adds less than one-quarter ounce of weight. But it adds a great deal when it comes to aiming accuracy and confidence. The Only NATO Approved Internal Laser Sight.

Up for sale is a gently used CZ USA Evo Scorpion chambered in 9mm. I've put about 250-300 rounds through the gun and it runs 100% perfect. Not a single issue, and it's extremely accurate. This gun is 100% original and includes two 20 round mags, original box, and original bore snake. There are lots of aftermarket parts available to make the gun the way you want. The factory iron sights are some of the best I've ever used. 

This is a great platform for an SBR (folding stock readily available). Even better news is the 30 round magazines are readily available from CZ USA. The only reason I'm selling is to fund a custom 1911 purchase. 

PLEASE READ BELOW BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS

Gun is located in NW Raleigh near Carmax. Must be picked up in Raleigh. 
This is a pistol and requires a purchase permit or a CHL. I will draft a bill of sale which must be signed by myself and you. 
Cash only please. 
No trade offers please.  

Price is $800. I respond to emails very fast. Usually within 15 minutes and have a flexible schedule to meet."

If you are wanting to get into long range shooting, this is the perfect rifle for it. I had the gunsmith build it with all the bells and whistles. Contact me with any questions.

!!!!!!!!!! And to whoever is flagging this... If it is because of the price... I paid well over $4k for this rifle, so the price is right. If you have a problem with other parts of my listing, feel free to contact me and I'll try to fix it. Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!"

Scope is decent; illuminated reticle (red or blue) and their version of a mil reticle. Functions fine and does what it should; not a Nightforce but was perfect for paper punching.

All rounds that have been put through it were factory loads. 

Will need to see ID and license to carry; can also do a transfer through a dealer of my choosing at my expense if the buyer would rather go that route. Will NOT ship.

NOTE: In 2009 Heckler & Koch (USA) sued German Sport Guns GmbH (GSG), who manufactured the GSG GSG-5 .22 rifle, and American Tactical Imports (ATI) who imported the GSG-5 into the USA. They successfully argued that the GSG-5 infringed upon their design patents for the H&K MP5. GSG paid a settlement of $300,000 and agreed to modify the design of the GSG-5 so it looked less like an MP5. The newly configured GSG .22LR firearms have been rebranded as the GSG 522."

I don't know the exact year but the original S&W Model 60 was produced in 1965. That was the first year of full production of this pistol model. This pistol is collectable as the first all stainless steel pistol offered by S&W. 

The pistol is in great condition showing almost no wear. The original wood grips still have 100% of their checkering and depth. The overall condition of the pistol is excellent. 

The Model 60 is well known in the gun world for its main claim to fame: it was the first ever mass produced stainless steel revolver.  The Model 60 was instantly popular when first introduced in 1965 and has continued to run strong in Smith & Wesson’s arsenal ever since.

Keeping in tradition with other Smith & Wesson revolvers, the Model 60 is as smooth as you could ask a DA revolver to be.  Whether it’s the trigger pull, hammer pull, or cylinder release, none of the controls on this gun are going to put a blister or a scratch on your skin if used properly.  The smoothness of the trigger in particular is a revolver lover’s dream and allows for faster follow up shots even in DA mode, especially when loaded with .38 Specials.
