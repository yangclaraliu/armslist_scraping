Had this gun for just a few weeks but need to sell or trade it because I just picked up a S&W 500, so don't need it no more. Gun is in great condition comes with a holster and 20 self defense rounds. Feel free to call or text and make an offer or if you want to see the gun.

Lone wolf stainless conversion barrel for Glock 23 gen 4 (not sure if it'll work in gen 3 or older weapons), stock length. 3 glock 19 9mm 15 round magazines. About 50 rounds through this barrel give or take. Alays well lubricated with Militec-1 synthetic weapons lube. Fit and finish is excellent with a polished feed ramp and is a direct drop in to your slide. Just field strip your g23, replace the stock glock pipe with the stainless, reassemble and go! It's stainless, so you can tell at a quick glance what your weapon is currently chambered for.

Only reason I'm selling is I bought a Taurus 9mm and really love it, and don't need two weapons that fire the same round in my opinion.

I've fired some of the cheapest 9mm I could find through this and it LOVES 115gr non +P ammo. Some will say you need +P or even +P+ to get it to fire, extract, feed and return to battery. Some will tell you your extractor will break, but really, what's stronger? Tool steel or brass? Some will say you need a g19 recoil spring rod, but this is crap too. Plenty of oomph in a 9x19 to cycle the weapon. I never had even ONE FTF, FTE or stovepipe . G23 .40 smith mags SUPPOSEDLY will feed 9mm just fine, tho I have not tried it. Just make damn sure you never try sending a 9mm down a .40 pipe! Can you say possibly blow the slide off? !

Face to face sale only. Wold prefer WI CCW permit holders, but will sell on state issued photo ID and bill of sale.

Price is $165. Firm. The barrel new is $125, and the mags are $35 a copy at fleet farm.  That's $165 for $230 worth of pieces. AND no shipping costs on the barrel! Huge savings!!!"

So, I would suggest to all the people crying about it that you just put on your big boy panties and GET OVER IT!

Oh...I have an even better idea...If you will look to the left column on the page, you will see a section labeled ""For Sale By"". Right under that, you will see two check boxes. Check the box that says ""Private Party"" and leave ""Premium Vendor"" unchecked. When you do this, you don't have to see all the dealer listings.

If you spent as much time trying to find a way around having to see the dealer listings as you did complaining about them, maybe you would have noticed this!!!

I have this checked and I don't have to see the dealer ads (unless I want to). Now if I could just figure out how to eliminate all the ""complainer"" ads, I would be set!"

This conceptualization might be appreciated in the context of handgun use and law in many South American countries, where the Thunder 380 is quite popular, and .380 ACP is frequently the most powerful cartridge allowed to civilians.

The thrill and romance of shooting Old West firearms might not be possible today if it were not for gun maker Aldo Uberti. Most of the original 6-shooters, lever-action rifles and buffalo guns, worth many thousands of dollars today, are either locked up in private collections or on display in museums. This makes them unobtainable or impractical for shooting.

In 1959, Aldo Uberti began making replicas of Civil War-era cap and ball revolvers. He founded A. Uberti S.R.L. in the village of Gardone Val Trompia in the Italian Alps. Over the years, as his craftsmen gained experience, the company increased production by including more and more of the Old West firearms.

Uberti firearms are exacting replicas, down to the finest detail. Many are improvements over the originals, with the advancement of materials and the use of modern machinery.

Today, A. Uberti produces black powder revolvers, cartridge revolvers and cartridge rifles. The firearms set the standard by which Cowboy Action Shooting competitors and big game hunters judge other vintage firearms.

Uberti is part of the Benelli USA family of brands, headquartered in Accokeek, Maryland. Uberti firearms are sold through authorized U.S. dealers. In addition, parts and accessories are available online at the Uberti Gear Store."

Has never been fired. 

I'm putting together an AR and need to purchase some more parts which requires more money. 

Transfer will need to be done through an FFL. The place I have used in the past is in downtown Puyallup. They charge $30 (which I am willing to pay half). 

If you buy the gun online you will pay around $530+shipping+tax+transfer fee. Local price is $579+tax. If you purchase mine it will be $500+1/2 transfer fee+NO TAX. So roughly $634 vs. $515"

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."

Here you have a complete package that is ideal for personal carry. The venerable 6906 set the standard for compact firepower with rock solid reliability. I have personally put about 250 rounds down the pipe on this one without a hiccup. All 5 magazines work flawlessly and are in very good condition. The magazines themselves are getting very hard to find and are pricey if you do. The 6906 is a traditional DA/SA pistol with a bobbed hammer for easy holster removal. S&W 3rd Gen pistols are renown for accuracy, reliability and durability. Only interested in trading for the following: Kahr K9, Sig P series(220,226,229,239), HK, Walther PPS, PPQ, or all steel 1911.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 



The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation as well as be entirely removed to expose the threaded barrel. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand, at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. The CZ83 pistol had its heyday for us from 2010 until early 2013, while we were having loads of fun with the Czech Police pistols, and moved several hundred of them. At press time, we were almost out, but the owners have one of the best pistols in the world. Here are factory CZ magazines for the CZ82 and CZ83 pistols. Manufacturer is Czeska Zbojovka, CZ, of Uhersky Brod, Czech Republic. Importer is CZ-USA of Kansas City, KS. CZ number is 11301. Construction is serration dimpled blue steel body with steel floorplate and spring, and black polymer cartridge followers. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .380 ACP or 9x18 Makarov caliber ammunition. That is two fewer rounds than the standard 11302 Magazine; civilian buyers who reside in jurisdictions where the twelve rounders are permitted may sub those at the same per-mag price. All are brand new. These will not fit any other pistol, from our knowledge, besides the CZ-83 in .380 ACP or CZ-82 in 9mm Makarov calibers only. We had to pay dearly for the CZ83 magazines even during the little heyday period, and we had to pay dearly for these as well. Single magazine price is $49 per. We’re offering these steel factory CZ magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $43 each. Own 3 for only $ 129.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

not too many of these around and even fewer built with as much care and attention to detail. This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato/ .223 rem and features all Russian parts with the exception of the trigger group which is a tapco g2 fcg simply to make it 922 r compliant.  All other parts including furniture, gas tube, gas block, front and rear sights as well as a milspec receiver by Izhmash/ Concern Kalashnikov. Rifle features a custom high - temp Cerakote finish in traditional semi- gloss black.  This was a custom built by James of Trident Armory LLC.  They are manufacturers of high- end AR type rifles but they also build AKs for special orders and they put as much care in these guns as they do in their ARs. Barrel length is 16 inches. Chrome lined, cold hammer forged Russian of course. Rifle is dressed in surplus combat used furniture in deep Plum bearing white Cyrillic (Russian) Symbols on the underside of the forend. Buttstock is of AK100 type, left side folding parkerized steel Triangle. Also Russian. These stocks are drying up as well as real Russian plum furniture. Mostly find Bulgarian copies. Functionality is exactly the same but there is no replacement for real Russian parts from a collectors stand point.  Comes with 2 30 round surefire magazines but also accepts promags and other Russian Milspec 5.56 mags with the exception of Beryl Mags. They don't seem to fit. This build has a lot of money in it now and I would like to see it go to someone who will appreciate it for what it is, a true investment. NEVER AGAIN will Russian rifles be imported into the US, even neutered sporterized versions like Saigas before a good conversion. The price now may be a bit intimidating but it will only go UP in time for whomever happens to purchase it. I will take trades with cash but cash offer must be at least 1000 dollars not including the trade. I prefer AK related things but try me, what's the worst that can happen, I say no thanks? I reiterate, this is a beautiful rifle and converted saigas are getting harder and harder to find. Saw a saiga 12 UNCONVERTED go for 1200. converted ones fetch an even higher premium. And most don't have all Russian parts like this one. Ask around. If I had my way I wouldn't be selling it but I have to :( oh well .  At least I still have my Beryl. $1800 OBRO once they're gone, they're gone. Don't hesitate."

The mags have never been dropped. 

The only trade I am really looking for is a Glock 19. I'm really wanting a gen 3 but am open to the other generations. There would be some cash on my end, depending on the goodies that the Glock comes with.

The pistol is a .44 Remington magnum Mark I in bright nickel finish. It has been fitted with a MK VII adjustable trigger and IMI Desert Eagle (made by Hogue) Rubber grips. It is powerful, accurate, reliable, and a joy to shoot.
The .357 top end (barrel, slide, bolt, recoil springs and guides) is a Mark VII type, also Israeli-made, in black (slightly different shape to safety lever) and is fitted with a Bushnell Phantom 1.3x scope on custom mounts. It has been shot little and is very, very accurate.
This package includes:
•	IMI Desert Eagle MK I Bright Nickel finish in .44 magnum with IMI adjustable trigger and IMI (Hogue) rubber grips
•	1 Nickel  .44 magnum 8 round magazine
•	3 Black .44 magnum 8 round magazines
•	IMI Desert Eagle MK VII Black .357 top end assembly
•	4 black .357 9 round magazines
•	Original IMI MK I non-adjustable trigger group
•	Original IMI Desert Eagle one-piece hard grips
•	Bushnell Phantom 1.3x scope on custom mounts. (Mounted to the .357 top end)
•	IMI Desert Eagle marked cordura belt holster
•	Cordura / nylon tactical thigh rig holster
•	IMI cleaning / maintenance tool
Everything is in excellent condition – no scratches or scars. It was my steel plate gun and was only ever used at the range.
As you know, this is a gas-operated, rotating bolt pistol – it has the strength of a rifle action. While it will handle the stoutest loads that you can find, I have always loaded it moderately, for accuracy. Neither the .44 or the .357 barrels have ever seen a non-jacketed or cast bullet – the gas systems are clean! The polygon rifling increases velocity and accuracy and is easy to keep clean.
You get 2 guns in one, 8 mags, scope and mount, spare trigger and grips, tool, and 2 holsters – all for $2395
More pictures available. 
I will not part out this set or sell items separately.
I *might* consider a trade for a 2000 or newer full-size extended cab pickup truck – but it would have to be in very good condition and unmolested – no “monster truck” or “race truck” mods.

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4543993,For Sale/Trade:  S&W 1006 10mm Auto,"Vestavia, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 800,"Listed On: Thursday, March 3, 2016",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,no type,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale or trade, I am offering my S&W Model 1006, a big gosh darned stainless steel automatic in the 10mm Auto caliber -- built like a small, handheld tank. Of the market's current four most popular 10mm pistols (S&W 10 series, Glock 20, EAA Witness, and Colt Delta Elite), this is probably the most durable and, therefore, the best of them all for feeding a regular diet of 10mm Auto of the power scale for which the cartridge was intended. (Although I'm sure that most of the internet would be happy to contend that claim -- please don't yell at me.) Any quick bit of internet research will reveal an unfortunate track record in the case of nearly any of its competitors: the Bren Ten, the gun it was created for, has been made nearly extinct by breakages; the Tanfoglio / EAA Witness is infamous for cracked frames and slides alike and internet forums are littered with tales of owners dealing with its maker's customer service -- some comedy, some tragedy, and some both; manufacturers of both the ammo and the gun itself warn against firing 10mm in a Colt Delta Elite past a certain power level; and even the one real challenger to the 10mm throne, Sir Gaston Glock, has developed with his unsupported chamber a habit of deforming 10mm brass and with his polygonal rifling an inability to utilize cast lead slugs, forcing many of his hand-loading adherents to resort to aftermarket barrels. No such tales of woe have been told about the various S&W offerings and certainly not about the flagship of these, the 1006. (PS, I have not read up much on Sig's recently released P220 10mm -- it's quite possible it is now the best choice for all I know yet. I have heard some ugly things said about SigArms customer service in general, however, so you might want to wait on buying one to be sure all its kinks are worked out. PSS, I have also heard CZ may be developing a CZ 97B in 10mm, which may be everything we all wished the Bren Ten could have been.) But back to the 1006. The 10mm Auto is a cartridge meant to be loaded hot, and this is a pistol meant to thank you for the punishment and ask for more -- as kinky as that sounds. On this subject, I personally recommend the custom ammo brand Underwood and their 180 or 200 grain load going 1350 or 1250 FPS. At 750 foot pounds of energy, that makes this gun a viable provider of protection even out among bear country, especially with those hard cast bullets you can't use in Glocks (though personally I think the best defense against bears is simply to avoid the places dangerous bears tend to hang out). And when exploring the even more dangerous jungle that is man country, this is still as reliable a manstopper as a .41 Magnum in automatic form when loaded with your choice of any advanced hollow point (my recommendation would be Speer's excellent Gold Dot offering, loaded appropriately hot by the aforementioned Underwood). This is a big, heavy beast of a handgun, I'd say about 15-20% bulkier than your standard 1911 of equal length, and its weight makes shooting big, booming, powerhouse loads pure fun. It's also an exceptionally reliable system of bullet-propulsion, relative even to some of the biggest names associated with the word--demonstrably able to cycle unfailingly through not just any ammunition I’ve tried so far, but even an entire magazine full of empty shell casings without a hiccup.If you've never shot one, I can attest that this pistol has at least a decently smooth trigger, about on par with any you'd expect to find on a factory DA/SA Beretta, Sig, or most any other top shelf maker that hasn't had professional trigger work on it, and the one on this example in particular is also very light thanks to an Ed Brown competition hammer spring, which does not appear to have affected its ability to ignite primers in the slightest (though you may want to go back up a few pounds or back to stock anyway if you plan to rely on it for defense, just to be safe). One way in which the triggers of S&W automatics are actually quite exceptional is in the reset; this pistol's is extremely short, as short if not shorter than my 1911 or Sig P210. The only automatic I own with a shorter reset, in fact, is another S&W (a stock, beat to hell $150 Model 59, which has shocked everyone I've shown it to). In fact I strongly recommend that you not hand this pistol with full power ammo to an inexperienced shooter except with an empty magazine, at least for the first time, as the sharp recoil and extremely short reset could have them firing multiple rounds more than they intend to –- a danger for anyone around -- if they don't know what to expect.This is a single-stack handgun, and despite its size its handle is actually exceptionally thin with the stock plastic grips -- thinner than a 1911 -- and I would recommend it to folks who prefer a thinner grip though certainly not to folks with smaller hands or specifically those with shorter fingers, as the trigger and controls do demand a bit of *reach* and despite its thinness, the handle is still quite large. Imagine a 1911 handle flattened by a truck tire is the best I can describe it. Many despise this combination of large yet thin, while some find it perfect for their hand. You would basically have to handle one to know if it is right for you; I suggest you do so, if possible, before committing to buying one. However, when wearing its much thicker *Hogue* grips, it feels no different than most double-stack guns. In fact, for fans of the Beretta M9/92 series, it makes an excellent companion as its controls are nearly identical in function and positioning and, again, when wearing its *Hogue* grips, it has a very similar handle in both width and shape. I imagine this to be the reason the LAPD offered it's .45 ACP cousin, the 4506, as an optional upgrade for officers demanding something heavier hitting than their standard issue 92FS. Update: I have obtained a pair of walnut grips from a Turkish gripmaker that are extremely ergonomic, with a palm swell you'd usually have to look back to the old master gripmakers like Sanderson or Fuzzy Farrant to enjoy. Seriously, these grips have completely changed the feeling of this pistol, from one of my least ergonomic to one of my most. They have taken it for me from a 8 out of 10 gun to a perfect ten in my estimation.Some might disagree with me when I say it is a handsome gun, but I think anyone would agree that it is a gun of considerable, eye-catching *presence,* which has made it or at least its .45-cal twin, the 4506, a favorite of Hollywood -- carried by Sonny Crockett of Miami Vice, Vic Mackey of The Shield, Sam Cole of Robbery Homicide Division, and utilized in a very menacing (if somewhat ridiculous) double akimbo style by Denzel Washington in the film Training Day. In a slightly shorter, slightly reconfigured form -- aka, the 1076 -- this pistol was the official FBI sidearm for several years. It's one of my favorite, most fun handguns to shoot and I wouldn't even consider parting with it except that I now own both a 1076 with documented FBI provenance and a 4505, which is the very rare, very beautiful high gloss blue version of the 4506, and I really don't need three versions of essentially the same gun. This is simply the easiest of the three for me to part with -- as a collector, of course; as a shooter, I imagine I will come to regret parting with this one.These came from the factory with either fixed, slanted Novak low-profile sights or much taller adjustable sights that are ensconced by some unique-looking protective steel ""ears,"" this one being an example of the latter. Interesting fact -- I have read that these ears originated in the Vietnam war, when they were added to the legendary, experimental ""Hush Puppy"" silenced pistol, which was a heavily modified 39 specially designed for the Navy SEALS, who needed a way to silence guard dogs and other sentries from a distance. The sights had to be raised substantially to clear its silencer, and so the ears were added to keep them from snagging and/or breaking off. If only for this reason alone, even though many despise them, I consider them essential to the trademark ""look"" of S&W autos.It comes with its original one-piece, super thin plastic grip as well as some alternatives: a palm filling, recoil cushioning Hogue rubber grip; a dressier, fully-checkered Hogue cocobolo grip (which cost $100 new, but feels to me a bit like trying to grip a 2X4); and, depending on how agreeable I find your offer, I may include the pictured Turkish custom grips--which I may also keep to put on the 4505. If they aren't purchased with the gun, I will provide a link to obtain a set of your own, which I strongly, strongly recommend you do. We can also nogtiate on how many magazines I will include -- at least one and a maximum of three. These being S&W factory 9-round magazines with brand new Wolff springs and the upgraded (white) followers. The recoil spring has been upgraded to a 22 pound Wolff spring for shooting full power loads and the hammer spring to an Ed Brown competition 1911 spring for a heavenly double action pull, but I am also including both of the original springs in case you'd rather go stock. For the right trade I may even include a Lou Alessi (one of the best makers in the business) leather shoulder holster for a right handed shooter that also holds two mags on the opposite side.(In summary, currently listed price reflects a puchase of a pistol, one mag, bunch of springs, original grips, hogue rubbers, and hogue wood--possible extras include three extra mags, Alessi holster, KSD grip, two boxes of Underwood 10mm, and potentially even another gun depending on what I'm offered.)Gun is in great shape except for some purely superficial hair thin scratches on the slide only visible in the right light -- inevitable with stainless steel you actually intend to holster and use. I tried to make these visible in the third picture; again, you can only see them if you tilt the pistol just right. Also, the black smudge to the left of the serial number wiped off shortly after I took the picture. The previous owner only shot the watered down Winchester offering and I've shot roughly four boxes of the real stuff (Underwood 180 grain, 1350 FPS) and the pistol shows little to no mechanical wear. Phew. If you've bothered to read all that, I can only assume you're in the market. Make an offer, cash or trade. Worst I can do is not answer -- if I don't have anything to say you'll want to hear, I tend to say nothing at all."
