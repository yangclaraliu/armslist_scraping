some serial numbers match, and from what I can tell it has a CHF chrome lined barrel. 
The furniture on it is a Balkan War battlefield take home set with trench art and notches carved on butt-stock, and a Yugo grip.  Included in the package is the original Romanian furniture set with the forward grip, one 30 round magazine, one 80 round magazine (untested), bayonet, Romanian leather 4 mag pouch and Romanian bakelite grip.  I also have 500+ rounds of 7.62 that I am selling for 23 cents per round.  This is not a top-end Arsenal, nor is it a WASR beater. I am asking $650 or best REASONABLE offer. I will send more detailed pics to those interested."

I have several sights I’ve taken off pistols over the last year.  These are either new, or near new (less than 2 years old).  I have the following:

SIG P-Series 9mm front sights (4) – Asking $10 each
SIG P-Series 9mm sight set (front and rear) – Asking $40
SIG P-Series 9mm rear sight (TRUGLO) – Asking $15
GLOCK 9mm Front Sight – Asking $10

These are all in top shape, they all have great Tritium glow remaining (except the TRUGLO which are not night sights).  I have more pictures I can send if you'd like to see the sights.  NOTE:  I have not used a punch to remove these, they were removed with a sight pusher tool.  All sights are factory SIG, TRUGLO or Trijicon Glock sights. 

If you would like any of these installed, please let me know - happy to do it while you wait, but for a few additional $$$ depending on the sights you choose.  

Thanks for looking."

The serial numbers match on a bunch of the parts, but not all. Bought the rifle back in December 2013, at a gun show. It was full of cosmoline (slamfired on me on the first trip to the range) so I ended up cleaned thoroughly (boiling water) and took it to the range again - no more slam fires. I've probably shot 200...300 rounds through it ever since and no more issues. The gun is very accurate, more accurate than my AK (shot mainly at 50 yards / iron sights but tried 100 yards and still good). I just don't shoot it much so it has to go (wife wants me to clean up a bit). The gun comes as you see it in the pictures below - just a sling as far as accessories. Asking $300 - open to offers. Please contact me at (248) five one three - 2851. Thanks, Dan"

The P30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The P30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE)."

The Combat Govt models fell at the end of series 70 production and were a limited edition affair. The basic modifications from a stock series 70 were a silver soldered on front sight (a lot was made of that at the time) with a partridge shape like a Gold Cup or late Service Ace. The rear sight was a taller standing leaf, the same as was found on series 80's but without the dots and white outline. The top of the slide is actually not parkerized, rather it's a coarse bead blast prior to bluing. The ejection port was lowered like a commander and had the improved notch. The trigger was a long current version of the original smooth faced 1911 trigger, but was crimped onto the stirrup rather than being a one piece milling. The mainspring housing was a flat Colt commercial steel housing like the Gold Cups had with vertical serrations. The mag well was lightly chamfered on the edges The gun came in a polished blue and the slide was marked Combat Government. It will probably have a 70B prefix on the serial and have a number in the 40,000 range or so after the prefix. There weren't a large number made and the original series 70 Combat Governments are considered collectable and highly desirable today. There were a few articles written about them during the period. They were Colts answer to the idea that they should sell a gun that was essentially IPSC ready right out of the box.

Thanks for looking.
Here is a blurb from the Springfield website about this pistol:

The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.

The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.

From the Emerson site:

I have a 1967 Chevy Camaro.  It is fully restored with a 350 c.i. engine and it screams like a maniac when I get on it.  In my opinion it is one of the finest muscle cars ever built.  The only thing I ever did to improve it was to put power brakes on it.

Sometimes a design in its pure, raw form is as good as it ever gets.  There is no need to change it and no way to improve it.  You can tweak it, you can polish it, but that original design is the core element and that savage beauty is best expressed when it is just left alone.
There was a time when I was building knives almost exclusively for the U.S. Navy SEAL Teams.  I was spending almost as much time in Coronado as I was at home.  I was also teaching and training with the Command Master Chief who ran the entire SEAL, BUD’s training program.  As a result of that, one of the best knives that I ever designed was for them.  And it was one of my favorite designs.  It was a simple, raw, powerful design called the SPECWAR.

Like the Camaro, you could say it was a perfect expression of “Elegant Aggression.” And the knife performed.  It stood the test.  The test of men far better than myself.  And that made me very proud.

We have found 3 boxes of SPECWAR Blades that had been lost in our move a couple of years back in a recent clean up and shuffle to make room for more machinery one of the guys moving some dusty boxes said, “What are these?” And there they were.  Some of the blades were logoed, marked and even sharpened.  Some were blanks waiting to be ground.  And some of the blades were in the original Hard Chrome coating.  I think some of the dates actually go back to 2001.  So, we are now re-issuing SPECWAR knives in both Model A (Clip point) and Model B (Chisel ground Tanto).  Since we were building new handles we changed them to stand-offs and we made some color variations never before used on the original SPECWAR Models.  Of course we have the Basic Black, but in addition we have Afghan Tan, OD Green and a few Dark Woodland Green.  I forgot how good they feel in your hand until I picked one up off the assembly table. These knives are awesome.

Do not miss this one of a kind opportunity to own one of these rare, vintage, retro knives.  They are as good now, today as they were when I was putting them into the hands of the warriors who were willfully heading into harms way.  You too can own a piece of Emerson military history by picking up one of these SPECWAR re-issue knives today.  The supply is extremely limited so don’t delay.  They won’t last for long.

My Best Regards,
Ernest R. Emerson

I have this airsoft rifle that I am looking to sell/trade. If you decide to trade, I am looking for trading for a G36k-style rifle, as I am trying to complete my Bundeswehr loadout. I am hoping to sell this for around 120 hundred dollars, but I am open to REASONABLE suggestions. (e.g. Don't offer me 50 bucks.) I have the right to refuse any offers. We will be meeting at a public area that I agree to. Under no circumstances will we be making this deal in your/your friends/my house. 

Now, to the gun itself. There are signs of light use on this rifle, such as by the selector switch, which is natural on any gun. There is also a small splotch where the paint rubbed off on the side of the front sight post. This can be easily repaired with a can of matte dark grey spray paint. I have removed all safety stickers from the gun. The orange tip is still attached. All accessories that came with the rifle will be included. (500-round hicap, long unjamming rod, mag winder, cheek riser, stock 8.4v 1500 mah battery, manuals, and blaze orange flash hider cover.) A proprietary bipod is attached to this rifle that can be removed, just make sure to watch out for small parts. You can also completely take the handguard and bipod off all at once by removing a takedown pin. By buying from me, you won't have to pay shipping, and you can make sure you won't get a lemon. The rifle will come in it's original box.

This rifle has seen about 1000 rounds through it, and hasn't been in the field yet. I have only shot GoldenBall proslick .20s thru it. Hit me up if you are interested, thanks.

Slightly smaller. Slightly lighter. Just as aggressive than the 0300. The 0350 is 10% smaller and weighs almost three ounces less than our flagship 0300. Yet it packs a lot of features into a size that some users prefer, especially for every day carry.

Like its larger counterpart, the 0350 features the patented SpeedSafe® assisted opening system. Deploy the blade quickly and easily, even in gloves, using the ambidextrous flipper. The ZT 0350’s blade is S30V stainless steel with non-reflective black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. S30V steel is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a non-reflective surface, the black Tungsten DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction.

This high-performance S30V blade is paired with textured black G-10 scales for a secure grip and excellent mechanical strength even under the roughest conditions. The scales are flat rather than 3D machined like those of the 0300. A locking liner secures the blade during use. The 0350 also includes ZT’s Quad-mount system for complete versatility. Mount the pocketclip in any of four ways: tip-up, tip-down, on the left side, or the right. There’s a pre-drilled lanyard hole for users who prefer to attach a lanyard."

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment.

Please note that it may also fit the older Remington 742 long action series, though I have not tried it in that rifle. Also be aware that I have not tried it in the newer 7600 or 7400 series either, but I can tell you that a magazine sold for a 7600 in 30-06 DID NOT fit properly in my old 760 rifle.

Nitrogen filled, multi-coated optics, standard duplex-style reticle. It is surprisingly bright & clear for a scope in this price range...I have read reviews that say otherwise but from my experience it compares well to the older Leupold VX II's that cost considerably more.
No lies, this scope has been used but not abused - definite ring marks but the glass is perfect. The scope held zero without any problems when I tested it on a 300 Winmag. It was actually used on a muzzleloader at typical U.P. December temps/low light conditions and did just fine there.

I'm in no hurry to sell this one - but I'm raising money for this year's hunting adventures, and this scope is an extra. $65 plus shipping makes it yours. Comes with the original box."

The SAM7UF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.

The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock
The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

SAM7UF-85 | SAM7UF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left-hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet / accessory lug, reinforced under-folding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel heat shield, cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine (accepts any mil. spec. magazine), sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Uses #11 percussion caps.  Drilled and tapped for a scope mount.

I bought this new in 1992 for $649 before tax and shipping – I still have the receipt.  Serial Number 17505.  This was a limited production gun called the “Grand American.”  I shot it at the range and took it on 1 hunt.  Cleaned, lubed and properly stored with anti-seize grease on all threaded parts of the action.  A true safe queen.  I’m not likely to hunt muzzle loading season again, so it is time for it to go to a new home to be used and enjoyed.  

No FFL is required since it is a muzzleloader.
Asking $595.  Sorry, but I’m not interested in trades.
I will ship within the lower 48 states for $30.

Or, get yourself a 30 caliber suppressor now that they're legal in MN!Also, if you pay my asking price, I'm happy to drive within the metro and also pay the FFL fee. Please feel free to respond to this ad. My phone is acting up, so I apologize if you've called or texted me in the past and got no response. Please try again by email.

It is the precursor to the 1897 and fairly rare.  I believe the 1893 was the first commercially produced pump shotgun, and it was John Browning's first slide action patent.  Aprox 34,050 were made during the period where the industry was switching to smokeless powder.  The 1893 had a reported mechanical weakness when used with smokeless powder which was reinforced with the 1897.  So Winchester offered anyone with an 1893 to return it and exchange it for a shotgun of their choice.  (possibly being the first American firearm recall) So it is hard to say how many 1893s are still in circulation.  Winchester may have data.  

This is a great piece for a collector.  The 1893 has a lot of history, and this one is a pretty decent survivor.  You can see by the pictures that it is not in 100% condition.  It was not locked in a vault.  It was used, taken care of, and aged gracefully.  I would like $600 for it.

It doesn't like bird shot, or target loads, usually jams, but slugs or buck shot are the way to go. The target loads are just to light of a load. I am trading/selling because I want something new. I go through guns quite a bit. I like variety. I know this gun is now banned from importation due to a certain someone, but I also know you can still pick them up off of gunbroker un-converted for around $800-$1000. I have honestly put roughly $800 into it with accessories. Here is the list.

I added the Chaos extended Quad-rail, the Magpul MBUS flip up sights, the Magpul angled forward grip, added an upgraded gas puck, upgraded gas adjustment knob, also purchased 2 extra 10 round mags and stuck on a SGm Sabre Boss muzzle device.
