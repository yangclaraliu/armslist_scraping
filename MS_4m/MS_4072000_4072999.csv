Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

The XD(M)Â® pistol from Springfield ArmoryÂ® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)Â® has everything you want and need in a pistol -- superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)Â® 4.5"" Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling.
The XD(M)Â® 4.5â³ Full Size is the perfectly proportional combination of a 4.5â³ barrel with a full-sized frame. The result is a service size pistol that's ready for anything. The XD(M)Â® includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.
Whether you're looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you're in the right place.

Additional Info: 

I am selling this barely used XD(M) at reduced cost with the inclusion of a box of 50 count 230gr FMJ Brass Blazer rounds. The firearm is like new and handles like a champ. I am only selling this firearm to ease my transition back to the lower 48. I WILL ONLY SELL IN FAIRBANKS AND PICK UP IS REQUIRED. NO SHIPPING!!! I will take cash or checks. Please allow time for check processing. All service members must comply with post registration if living on post. Happy hunting."

Ive got my Mossberg 817 up for sale.  Its a bolt action, magazine fed, rimfire caliber rifle in .17HMR.  One of the coolest calibers in my opinion because it is blazing fast and is so effective on small game/varmints.  People have hunted feral pig and turkey (and who knows what else) with this caliber.  

My rifle was well taken care of and I am only selling it because I have started a different project which will encompass what this rifles job was.  The rifle was Krylon coated matte olive drab.  The illuminated BSA Huntsman scope is a 3-9X40 power scope with Butler Creek flip-open lens caps.  The scope rings are Weaver rings.  This rifle is in great condition and shoots a lethal group at 50 yards.  I have taken the rifle out into the field a few times before and my furthest confirmed kill was at 80-100 yards on a windy say.  The rifle comes with 37 rounds of Winchester .17 grain ammo.  Has original paperwork.  I am willing to meet anywhere in the Santa Cruz county for the FFL transfer and I may be willing to drive a little further if it is appropriate for me.  Please don't low ball me, this price is a steal for a complete rifle with ammo and no tax.  I am very quick to respond to messages and if my schedule permits, I will be very quick to get the sale on its way."

Itâs loaded in 10-round stripper clips, individually sealed in plastic bags and comes neatly packed in a brand new 50 caliber ammo can, making it perfect for long-term storage. Includes two magazine loaders for easy loading from stripper clips.

Technical Information:
    Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO
    Bullet Weight: 62 Grains
    Bullet Style: Full Metal Jacket Steel Core
    Muzzle Velocity: 2985 fps
    Muzzle Energy: 1227 ft lbs
    Case Type: Brass
    Jacket Material: Gilding Metal
    Core Material: Hard Steel/Soft Steel
    Corrosive: No
    Compatible with all 5.56x45mm NATO weapons
    NATO Qualified: NATO Design AC/225-128A

Bullet Information:
Thanks to its unique projectile design this load possesses a higher ballistic coefficient than standard M855 ball. The noticeably longer projectile ensures it better retains both its velocity and energy over distance. The end result is it shoots flatter, drifts less in the wind and hits harder compared to standard M855. It also possesses greater sectional density for deeper penetration."

I am 19 now and all of the relevant laws pertaining to purchasing a firearm under the age of 21 are included below.

http://www.salon.com/2013/02/05/18_year_olds_can_buy_handguns/

O.C.G.A. Â§ 16-11-132
Possession of a handgun by a person under the age of 18 years

Georgia law only covers possession of handguns by those 
""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


O.C.G.A. Â§ 16-11-101.1
Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer. (http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2004/citizen%60s-guide-to-federal-firearms-law.aspx> 

O.C.G.A. Â§ 16-11-126
Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

A person of age 18-20 is treated as an adult who does not have a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and must abide by those same rules. Those rules, in short, mean that the handgun may not leave the confines of my home (property of said home included), motor vehicle, and/or place of business

I will answer any questions regarding these laws for clarification or what I am looking for in the ideal purchase."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1â overall length and an 18.5â cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3â rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

671,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4072671,For Sale:  NEW Sprint iPhone 6 International WorldPhone A1586 Never Activated,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 25, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new in the box Sprint iPhone 6 16gb, white/silver. This is the true world phone model A1586 that has the extra 4 TD-LTE bands for Europe, Latin America, and Asia, and can be unlocked for any carrier worldwide, including all US carriers. It would cost $710 with tax to purchase. It is brand new, has never yet been activated, and still has the plastic on it. I just got it at the Apple store myself, and I have the documentation. Once activated on an account, it can be unlocked for use on any carrier, anywhere in the world. If you want the most globally capable phone on the market today, this will save you over $100 on it. I will consider trades but they would have to be a pretty good offer. If interested you can call or text me at REDACTED.

The following quotes regarding this model of the iphone 6 are taken from tech/cellular sources on the internet.

""If you buy the Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile iPhone 6/6 Plus models (A1549/A1522, respectively), and unlock them, you will be able to enjoy them not only on all major US carriers, save for Sprint, but also across the globe, with the notable exception of China Mobile, SoftBank in Japan, and a few others that use TD-LTE. 

*If you, however, get the Sprint version of the iPhone 6/6 Plus (A1586/A1524), you get all sixteen LTE bands of the A1549/A1522 versions, PLUS the added benefit of four extra TD-LTE bands 38 (TD 2600), 39 (TD 1900), 40 (TD 2300), 41 (TD 2500), for a truly global LTE phone for the first time in 4G history.""

""A1586: This is the most versatile version. This model works on CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz), GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz) and TD-SCDMA 1900 (F), 2000 (A). Compatible 4G LTE bands are FDD-LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29) and TD-LTE (Bands 38, 39, 40, 41 which are corresponding to frequencies 2600 Mhz, 1900 Mhz, 2300 Mhz and 2500 Mhz). Along with the iPhone 6 Plus A1524, this model supports both TD-SCDMA bands of China Mobile and band 39 for TD-LTE. The bands 38 and 40 are also available, so you absolutely can use LTE in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The LTE will work on China Mobile Hong Kong, CSL, Hutchison, SmarTone in Hong Kong, Deutsche Telekom, O2, Vodafone in Germany, Optus (Virgin), Telstra, Vodafone in Australia, and 3, EE, O2 (Giffgaff), Vodafone in the UK."""

Well cared for M1A. Serial number indicates 2003 manufacture. I do not have a magazine for the rifle. A quick check on gunbroker shows these guys selling for 1250-1600 consistently. You can save some money on the rifle and avoid the expense of the FFL transfer. Original magazines are available for $20 online. Email or text: 5o5.75o.4745

The only trades I am really looking for at this time are pistols (one or more worth about $1100) or AR-15s / AR-15 parts or accessories. Not looking for any other long guns or any shotguns, although I guess you might have such an awesome trade that I would have to accept it. I will consider any reasonable offer. And, hell, if all the low-ballers want to send me your $312.50 offers, why not? All I can say is no. I won't be offended by low-ball offers or suggested trades that involve pet, baby alligators if you don't get offended when I decline any suggested pet trades or monetary offers outside the realm of reason. 

In case you are interested there is a great forum in which to discovery information about the M14/M1A. www.m14forum.com Find out why people really like the .308 caliber or what uses the military is putting M14s to now."

This revolver is about three months old, with a manufacture date of 12/14. A bit of background: I ordered a Match Champion from Tombstone Tactical in November of last year (11/14). When I received the revolver from my FFL, I noticed some cosmetic aberrations, but nothing too concerning. The action, however, was another matter.

The trigger was gritty and the single action sear actually produced a squeak during its ""creepy"" break. Needless to say, the revolver went back to Ruger with a strident letter of complaint. A few phone calls and two weeks later, I received a ""hand-picked"" Match Champion from their latest production run. The gun is what I expected it to be.
It has the ""built like a tank"" Ruger feel with a smooth and tuned action. Why do I mention all of this? Because you NEVER know what you are going to get when you buy sight unseen. Now, my story had a happy ending, but it was VERY frustrating and time consuming (an additional FFL transfer) with an uncertain resolution. If you elect to purchase this revolver, 
you will have a cream of the crop, GP100 Match Champion.

Why am I selling it? I'm just ready to move on to something else.

Details:

The revolver has had about 250 rounds put through it and most of these were 38 Special or light 357. I'm guessing maybe 50-75 moderate 357 loads -- not that it matters with a GP100. The gun is in like new condition and comes with the plastic case, paperwork, fired shell case (dated 12/15/14), and lock. I will also included a lightly used Hogue grip so you can mount that if you prefer cushy rubber over wood. Personally, I find the wood nice in esthetics and feel, but a bit punishing for magnum loads, hence the Hogue grip. The gun has been thoroughly cleaned and it is ready for inspection.

Price: $600
I am not interested in entertaining any trade offers for this firearm.
Lastly, I will split the cost of the requisite FFL transfer if the transaction is conducted on the Kitsap peninsula.

Thanks for reading."
