If you own a Mini 14 you know how expensive the Real Ruger Magazines are full retail ($50 for the 30 rounders and $40 for the 20 rounders) that is if you can find them. The pricing below is a steal considering the Presidential Executive Order that is about to pass, the only reason I am selling them is that I sold my Mini and no longer need them.

You can either buy one or two magazines and save some money or buy all 6 and save even more money.

The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.Easy Accessorization and MaintenanceThe most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.Integral picatinny railImpressive Firepower, Extra-Durable MagazinesAnother feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance.This Beretta 92A1 is in like new condition with very low round count. It is chambered in 9mm with a 4.9 barrel.
