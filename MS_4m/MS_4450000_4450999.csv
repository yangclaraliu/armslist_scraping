Most colt 1911s will interchange parts with no problems except for a few that needed special fitting, but the M45A1 is like the USGI pistols from the world wars. All parts will go in each M45A1 as if they originally came from that gun. If you had 10 of these guns, you could take them apart, mix the parts and assemble the guns and with none of the original parts in them, and they would work fine, Very few 1911s other than colt will allow this, but even colt will sometimes have a part or two that will not. Not so with the M45A1. The insides of this pistol have been coated, to make them very slick. All the parts are hand fitted, so they are very tight. Comes with custom, very nice pelican case, two wilson combat magazines, special Otis cleaning kit, factory target (showing how accurate it is), warranty card.

""""It should be noted that the early production examples (1953-1955) may have different parts from those listed above."""" Stocks for NM-1 Rifles were not glassed, but rather hand selected for tight fit and uniform wood grain.
Springfield Armory engineers and armors worked closely to prefect the Nation Match 1 rifle.  
The exact number of Type 1 National Match rifles made is unknown. There is a much-published chart purporting to give a breakdown of M1 National Match production from 1953 to 1963. 

This is a rare find for the shooters or collector. NM-1's are rare in this condition.

Note: Buyer Pays: Shipping and DOJ registration fees
I will consider reasonable offers. 

This is a nice accurate shooting rifle in excellent condition and all the marking as stated above.. For Shooter or Collector. Rare find!

(1) VERSA Mec which is the all steel version and yes, they still sell parts from the Mec web site if you ever find that you need parts for something built of that quality. I believe that it is set up in the .12 Gauge and it also has the additional Mec Primer feed tray as you will see in the picture. The other 2 are Mec 600 Jr's and one is in .410 and I believe the other is in either .16 or .20 gauge. They are all in great condition and I have them fixed to a pice of hardwood for a stand. This saves you from having to bolt it down to a table top and makes it much better to move around if you decide to set up a reloading line to relaod your ammo. I have had them sitting around collecting dust and feel that it's time for them to go to someone who can use them, save money and enjoy them. Skeet shooting, hunting, home defense or if you are into prepping, these would make wonderful ""must haves"". I will include approx 1,000 .12 gauge shells that can be reloaded along with some .410 and I believe either .20 or .16 gauge as well. The price is firm and I want to sell this as a complete lot. I live in the Anderson area but I am also close to Highway 69. I can meet with you off of one of the exits at the gas station or other public place close to whatever exit is close enough for us to meet at. I have in the past met with people off of exit 214, Lapel at the Gas Station/Subway sandwich shop but as I said, we can talk about a place that would be good for us both if that is to far for you. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience. I get out of work around 2pm and am open to meeting with you whenever. Please leave your name and a good time to call you if for some reason I do not answer the phone. I will get back to you ASAP if myself or my wife does not pick up. Please feel free to ask any questions and If I cannot answer them, I will do everything I can to find out. REDACTED"

CIA's Zastava PAP M85 NP is an improved version of the M85 PV. How can you
make an AK style pistol in .223 caliber even cooler than it already is? CIA
added a sexy Krinkov-style muzzle brake that actually improves the
functioning of the gas system, and a clever magazine well allowing the use
of common AR-15/M-16 magazines with no magazine modification or tinkering
required. It has a 10"" barrel, black synthetic pistol grip and wooden
foregrip.The Zastava PAP M85 NP pistol comes with two 30-round magazines

If you are looking for a shotgun you will be hard pressed to out perform a Mossberg!

 Looking for an easier way to transport your Mossberg 500? Easy - pick up the Mossberg JIC II and you will have the most travel ready 12 Gauge Shotgun available on the planet.

Asking $35.00You could store 50% more guns?Imagine if you could store all your rifles more efficiently, expanding the capacity of the safe you have right now? This is exactly what our friends over at Gun Storage Solutions were thinking when they developed the Rifle Rod Starter 10 pack.The concept was simple, create a solution to store rifles upright so they don't need a rack and effectively take up less space. After removing the gun rack from the safe's interior, just staple or tack the industrial grade loop fabric to the underside of the top shelf. Then stick the Rifle Rods down the barrel of your long gun and adjust the Rod so the velcro top reaches the fabric. Now there you have it, the guns stand totally upright - no more leaning, stacking or clutter. Installation is super easy and access to your guns is easier, too. Even the ones in the back."

The pistol comes with the original case, holster and 3 magazines (1-6 round, 2-7 round extended)

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts)
High capacity double column magazines
Hammer forged barrels
Ergonomic grip and controls
Unparalleled accuracy
Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control
3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available)
Smooth double action and crisp single action
Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials
Firing pin block safety

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols."

I have a nib/unfired EAA windicator 2' barrel 357. This would make a good ccw or a great truck/night stand gun. 
Why buy a 357 you ask? Well when you take it to the range you can practice with 38 and a few 357s to save money but still shoot some 357 shells from it.
For self defense there is really nothing better than a 357,AND this gun is a 6 shot whereas a lot of 38s are only 5 shot.
This gun is $349 @gander
Lastly, for backup you'll get a 6' bowie knife and sheath"

The guy who had this before me had the med size backstrap and must have put a little glue on it. Not visible at all but because I'm 6'4 and  have larger hands it's not that comfortable for me.

ZEV Technologies Match Grade drop-in barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.

ZEV Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.0002” for consistency and accuracy. The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish.

- 416R Gun Barrel Quality Stainless Steel
- 4.00 inch Match Grade drop in barrel
- Final dimension of +/- 0.0002” for consistency and accuracy

I have to shoot it at least one more time before it goes to a new home. The stag grips on this are nice and feel perfect to my hand. This is certainly 95% or better.

I'd like to sell this today, if possible, and please bring it in $100 bills. If you have questions or concerns, please let me know. This 4"" Python is one of the best I've personally owned. The trigger is buttery smooth, just like it should be...single or double, but if you pull that hammer back to fire it, it takes but the touch of a feather to unleash all the fire and fury that is the Colt Python.

I am interested in guitar gear as far as trades and old tube operated stuff like tube amps, old tube radios, would love to find someone with a ton of tubes they would like to get rid to in a separate deal because I need the tubes.  I have inoperable pancreatic cancer with lesions also on my liver, in my lymph nodes, in my spine and they have now also found something in my lungs.  They aren't doing anything except chemo to fight the pancreatic cancer because it's the most voracious, so these tube amps and guitar gear are how I'm spending my spare time.  Can you help?  Please let me know ASAP!!  Thanks for your time!  I also have other handguns that I'd part with as well if the trade was in my favor.

The SureFire M82 Picatinny rail forend replaces the original forend of M16 rifles with a MilSpec triangular handguard cap (and similar firearms), allowing the user to mount a variety of accessories.

The precision rails enable consistent ""repeat zero"" of any accurately dimensioned devices attached to them, such as SureFire WeaponLights."
