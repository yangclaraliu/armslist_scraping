An ARMS #40 backup iron sight tops it all off. This isn't a pretty gun. It isn't meant to be. This is a for a shooter who wants affordable quality, not a safe-queen.

LCP Cal .380 ACP  **LAYAWAY AVAILABLE**Condition: Used ( Like New and comes in Original Box with Soft Case and Owner's Manual )Price: $295.00Inventory Number: G-15763-1Serial Number: 371236387The lightweight, compact design of the Ruger LCP Semi-Auto Pistol make it an ideal concealed carry gun, that's comfortable to carry all day, and quick to deploy. The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency.Manufacturer: RugerModel: LCPCaliber: .380Barrel: 2.75""Capacity: 6Type: Semi-AutomaticAction: Double Action"

All are new bullets (or noted if Midway blems, etc). If they come in a ""box"" they ARE NEW SEALED BOXES (unless noted otherwise), some will also be NEW BULLETS in plastic bags. Some are OLD stuff from as far back as the 70s (but nothing corroded), but most is within 10 years new. All bullets are very clean except for a very few older ones (in odd lots) which are just darkened over years of storage. Pricing is for 100 bullets except for a few new boxes of 50 (i.e. the Nosler Partitions that sell NEW elsewhere for $35 a box of 50), or a few odd lots (noted). I'll ship for the cost of the $7 priority USPS box which can hold up to about 500 bullets (on average, but some boxes may need to be combined with remaining bullets put in bags to make it fit in this small box).  Larger boxes don't hold up so $7 per mailed box of approx 500 bullets is what you can expect unless you buy a LOT then I'll custom box them.  You pay insurance (at $1.50 per $100 in value) as you want and Paypal is accepted too (for about $2/$100). Minimal purchase of $50+ (total) please-- I don't have time to ship small lots ;) If you buy a large bulk lot completely (see bottom of each caliber's listings), the pricing drops some as I will pay the shipping on whole lots for the price (marked below the listings).

Need the ultimate in a nine-shot .22 LR? You've just found what you have been seeking. This wonderful revolver design with record-setting single/double action handles these favorite calibers just like you would wish. Taurus takes the proven Tracker design to the ultimate level with the introduction of 9 shots of affordable ammo. A casual day of plinking or more serious varmint hunting is offered to you in this nine-shot wonder gun!
Extended Ejector Rod: For positive extraction of fired cases.
Ribber Grip: Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Has been fired twice. It's is a great gun, but It's more rifle than I need. Comes with scope. I believe the scope is an unmarked Bushnell 5-9x. It's a good clear scope. The gun is stock, but the bolt has been cleaned up a bit. Burrs removed and the action worked to provide very smooth operation. Has a very crisp trigger with no creep and breaks like glass. Pretty impressive for an economy rifle. If it was a smaller calibre I'd keep it. Please contact me with any questions. Gun was over $400. Asking $300 firm. Buyer pays FFL transfer.

This gun works amazing!! Only about <60 rounds fired. Everything is in great condition and works great. Do not run cheap ammo through this for when I did it jammed, (I switched to some higher quality brass and it ran like a charm). Have fired sub and super sonic ammo through this, Such a fun gun to shoot and the muzzle blast is insane. Not for the faint of heart!

The SPHINX SDP Compact Sand is the multirole pistol that excels in self-defense, tactical duty use, and competition.  One tool, any job.

The SPHINX SDP Compact Sand is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Sand features a full anodized aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Sand is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control.  Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Sand.  Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

It comes with 2 extra mags aside from the two included with it, three types of holsters (IWB, Paddle, Griffon belt OWB). and everything that it came with in the box brand new.

The rifle action has the Savage Accutrigger which is super light and breaks like glass.  To further aid accuracy, the barrel is free floated into the Savage Accustock to isolate it as much as possible.  

Up top is a Millett TRS-1 4x-16x scope with Mil Dot Reticle.  It has a generous 30 mm tube to collect tons of light to keep the sight picture bright in all types of conditions.  It is mounted on a one piece weaver rail that is rock solid to hold zero after use.  

In addition to the factory 4 round mag, I have (2) of the 10 round Dark Eagle Custom high capacity mags.  These function nicely and give that extra capacity for shooting at the range or in the field.  To help steady your shots, there is also a nice adjustable bipod attached to the front sling point.  

To finish off the package, I have everything tucked away nicely in a Plano GunGuard hard sided case.  There are five every secure latch closures.  Two of the latches have built in key locks.  There are also two additional lock eyelets to allow you to add TSA or traditional padlocks for added security.

Overall everything is in great working order.  There are some small knicks and scratches but they are few and far between.  I am selling to make room for something new.  

i also have quite a lot of 308 ammo of various manufacture.  if you are interested in a package deal, I can make that happen as well.  If not, the ammo will end up on a separate listing.  

If you want to see additional images, please send me an email and I can forward them to you.  I can also answer any questions that you might have as well. Thanks."

Keep in mind this is priced at $400 less than you would pay out the door new at any gun shop. I bought this a couple of years ago for an armed security position I had at the time and after that just kept in it's case. I went all out on the Sig because I just had to have one, and then when I got it I just liked the idea of keeping it ""cherry"" and would rather just rent a 226 at the range and put rounds through theirs or shoot my Ruger and S&W, so basically it was either on my holster or put away the whole time.

I'm assuming I don't need to go on about the quality of Sig's, especially the P226 which is arguably the best all around hand gun made. The BTFO model has ""TruGlow"" titanium fiber optic night sights that glow regardless of needing to be exposed to light. The front sight itself is super bright. No polymer, steel slide and aluminum lower. Also, this P226 is American made by Sig USA, not the German made version.

Other than that it's been well oiled and maintained as I've cleaned it periodically even though no rounds have gone through the barrel. I'm throwing in my Serpa CQC holster with waist and leg straps as well as some cleaning supplies and a lock (if you want them). The only thing on the picture I posted that isn't included is the 4 10-round mags which I left in California when I moved up here but you'll be getting 2 18-round mags.

Pick up only, cash in hand. First come first served. I know the cost of this arm so please no fairy tales about how you saw it brand new for less at the gun shop down the street ran by the Easter bunny. This is a very good deal as is, the arm is PRE-OWNED, but not ""used"". Zero rounds have gone through this barrel other than the factory fire, and there have been no alterations performed, all original Sig Sauer parts. Prefer to sell by this weekend otherwise I'm putting it up for auction elsewhere. Feel free to email me any questions.

Have original case, paperwork and accessories. The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there. The  good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.

917,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4353917,For Sale/Trade:  1974 Honda Trail 90 - CT90 - Needs Nothing! Street Legal Daily Rider!,"SE Portland, Portland, Oregon","$ 1,695","Listed On: Wednesday, May 20, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my Honda Trail 90. I've put a lot of time into cleaning this bike up and getting all the little issues taken care of. I watch these on Craigslist all the time and its amazing how much people ask for hashed out bikes with no title, no street legal kit and barely running engines. This bike isn't going to win any shows or awards but I wanted to make it into the cleanest daily ridden CT90 you're going to find.

Cosmetically it has all the checking, spots, nicks and scratches that a 41 year old trail bike is going to have. I've scrubbed and polished the chrome, most of which is in really great shape. I re-taped the seat cover because the original tape job was crumbling. The plastics are a little rough, but they're all there. Overall this is one of the nicer CT90s that I've ridden. Fully street legal with working headlight, brake light, tail light and turn signals. Comes with the original toolkit as well as the locking extra gas can.

Mechanically it is a very strong runner. Typically starts first kick with no choke and runs strong until you shut it off. Shifts into first very strong with no slipping and shifts extremely well through all the gears. Recent valve and point adjustments, along with a brand new spark plug. Has plenty of 90cc power through all 4 gears. Throttle is responsive with no bogging/flooding. Transmission feels strong and grippy in both high and low. Suspension is a little soft for my tastes, but if you plan on a lot of trail riding you may like it that way. Rear tire is fairly new and front tire is brand spanking new. This is a solid, reliable daily rider.

I have the clean Oregon title in my name. Tags are good until December 2016. Comes with an Oregon Off Road permit that is good into 2017. Two keys. This bike literally needs nothing to be a legal daily rider on or off road. 4000 miles and plenty of life left. People on the internet regularly post about their 90 turning over the odometer. Treat these bikes well and they will always start first kick and run forever.

I'll consider throwing in the matching vintage cooler and cargo net if you don't low ball me."
