This is sometimes called a ""transitional revolver"" because it was made in a period before S&W started putting model numbers on their guns and after they had changed the side plate screws from 5 to 4. This transitional period was from 1955-1957. This revolver was manufactured in 1956. It has a shiny bore with good rifling and a tight lockup. It also has the 1/2"" wide target hammer. It has period correct diamond magna grips in good condition. The serial number matches on the cylinder, barrel flat and butt. It does show some holster wear on the muzzle and high points of the cylinder, like most revolvers that have been carried do, but most of the gun retains the high lustre blue finish. Pictures show glare from the lighting and aren't very good. I'll try to take some outside tomorrow. Will ship to your ffl for $30.00. Contact me if you have any questions."

I have put just under 500 rounds through it, and carried it as a duty weapon for quite a while. Rounds through it are mostly 158gr. .38s, with around 100 or so .357 Magnums. Gun is mechanically superb, just as good as it was when I opened the box. However, it retains a fair amount of finish wear. It was used, not abused. It has scratches, holster wear, etc. The wear is in accordance with that claim. It is not absolutely horrendous, but it is noticeable. There isn't anything wrong with it and I quite like it, but I'm moving soon and would like to cut down the collection for an easier move. Gun comes with the following items;
-Factory plastic case, paperwork, original rubber grips with wood inserts, and original fiber optic front sight
-Hogue fancy rosewood grips, checkered, no finger grooves, shows some wear ($100 value)
-Novak plain blade front post ($25 value)
-Bianchi Leather OWB holster, snap closure, has wear ($50 value)
-Garrett Industries Custom Kydex OWB holster, lined with leather, slide attachment ($100 value)
-Uncle Mike's Cordura Nylon dual speedloader case, snap closure ($20 value)
-4 HKS 10 Speedloaders ($30 value)
-Hornady Critical Defense .357 Magnum ammo
The finish wear does impact price, I'm aware, but I am giving quite a few extras with it, 
Trade or 600 cash. 600 is very fair to me, given everything the gun comes with.

This is a Shooter’s Arms (a Century Arms Import) “Elite” model.  I’ve had it for about 3 years.  It has about 400 rounds through it.  This was the first 1911 I’d ever shot, and I’ve learned that I really like 1911’s.  With that said though, I don’t get much time to shoot anymore and I need to downsize my collection.  

I realize it is a low end 1911. I’m not about to try to convince anyone it’s a Kimber.  It’s a good shooter.  It’s been reliable with all the ammo I’ve put through it with the exception of one box of Wolf soft points that I bought.  It didn’t like those, but I’ve never had a failure of any kind with Remington, Winchester, or Federal ammo.  I’ve also put a couple of boxes of Federal personal defense ammo through with no problems. 

I’m a lefty, so I had a ambi safety put on this.  The original safety is included in case you would want to switch it back.  I’m also including a full box of 100 Remington bullets and 15 Federal Personal Defense hollow points.  It will come with the grips that are on it and a set of Hogue rubber grips.  There are 4 magazines included.  Two mags are lower end (Act Mag and Pro Mag).  The other two mags are better (Ruger and Chip McCormick).  

I’d like to get $375 for all this.  I’d also be willing to trade for a small utility trailer (4x6 or 4x8).

I live in Louisburg, KS and work in Overland Park.  I’m willing to meet somewhere near either location.  Due to schedule constraints I'm not going to have much time to be travel far for a sale or trade.  If you would like to try the pistol before buying or trading, I'd be willing to meet at a range (like Centerfire) for you to test fire.

This poorly-written turd of a law known previously as HB 13-1229 and now known as CRS 18-12-112 specifically exempts antiques and curios and relics from the private-party background check requirement. It does not require the transferror or transferee to hold a C&R license for the exemption.

CRS 18-12-112:
(6) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION DO NOT APPY TO:
(a) A TRANSFER OF AN ANTIQUE FIREARM, AS DEFINED IN 18 U.S.C. SEC 921(a)(16), AS AMENDED, OR A CURIO OR RELIC, AS DEFINED IN 27 CFR 478.11, AS AMENDED;

27 CFR 478.11:
Curios or relics. Firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must fall within one of the following categories:
(a) Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof;
(b) Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and
(c) Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event. Proof of qualification of a particular firearm under this category may be established by evidence of present value and evidence that like firearms are not available except as collector's items, or that the value of like firearms available in ordinary commercial channels is substantially less.

I have for sale a Sig Sauer Nightmare 1911 .45 ACP 5 Inch Barrel WITH NIGHT SIGHTS. It has the box that it came in (it is not a hard cased box; just a regular cardboard box with Sigs name on it, the Styrofoam, and the manuals). I bought it new with a Wilson Combat Magazine (the original magazine was junk so I traded it off and bought a Wilson Combat Mag. 

The gun was bought about a month ago from Gunbroker for $900 Has had only about 4 magazines put through it. I love Sig (I own a P220 and love it) but I just don't really care much for this pistol. The reviews are high and she shoots great. I just don't like it honestly. I love my Kimber but it's the 4 in Barrel (so I think it's just longer than what I prefer I don't know honestly).

I would prefer to sell it (I might trade it) let me know what you have worst I can say is no but like I said I would prefer to sell. 

I am asking $850 (these are not a common type of 1911 and they are going for a little more than my asking price for USED. Brand new these are $1100-$1300 pistols. Trust me I looked everywhere around here I checked Cherry's, Ottawa Ordinance, Dunhams, Cabelas in Columbus, Tri-R Guns, etc and all I got with each of them is we have no used ones. They have to order new ones and the cheapest one was $1100. So please don't low ball me. I think that is a reasonable price.

The night sights are bright as all get out. Trigger is smooth and it's a hair pin trigger; does not need to take up much slack. I have ZERO Misfeeds, misfires, or duds even using cheap ammo in this. Well built and well worth the money. I don't like it. I cannot see the point in keeping a weapon that I do not really care for. 

You can contact me at 4 one niner - ate niner 0 - sixer 90 seven or by responding to this posting. 

Cash only if you are buying, you have to be of age to legally purchase this firearm, and you have to be legally able to own this gun (no felons, or court ordered against owning, etc).  N0 I will not ship either don't have the time and the patience to deal with it right now I apologize but life is hectic right now.

I am long winded I know."

This poorly-written turd of a law known previously as HB 13-1229 and now known as CRS 18-12-112 specifically exempts antiques and curios and relics from the private-party background check requirement. It does not require the transferror or transferee to hold a C&R license for the exemption.

CRS 18-12-112:
(6) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION DO NOT APPY TO:
(a) A TRANSFER OF AN ANTIQUE FIREARM, AS DEFINED IN 18 U.S.C. SEC 921(a)(16), AS AMENDED, OR A CURIO OR RELIC, AS DEFINED IN 27 CFR 478.11, AS AMENDED;

27 CFR 478.11:
Curios or relics. Firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must fall within one of the following categories:
(a) Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof;
(b) Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and
(c) Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event. Proof of qualification of a particular firearm under this category may be established by evidence of present value and evidence that like firearms are not available except as collector's items, or that the value of like firearms available in ordinary commercial channels is substantially less.

So for any firearm 50 years old or older, or on the C&R list can still be bought and sold freely, privately, just like before 7/1/13!"

- HK USP Compact .45 ACP handgun 
-2 eight-round magazines  (same as HK45 Compact magazines)
-- with both finger-rest and flat floorplates for each magazine (4 floorplates total)
-- I ordered the flat floorplates after-the-fact from HKparts.net, because I hate the finger-rest floorplates
- 1 ten-round magazine (same as full-size HK45 magazine, but different floor plate)
-- with grip extender floor plate
- factory grey molded plastic case 
-- H&K changed to a padded case c. 2008.  These original cases are selling for $30 - $50 by themselves

KH date code -- this gun was manufactured in 1997.  I bought it from a private party in 2013.  I never got around to shooting it until this year, and am selling it because (1) I am getting rid of my .45s to par down the number of calibers I need to keep and (2) I have more guns than I have time to shoot them.

I had the gun re-finished by Rocky Mountain Arms in Longmont, Colorado, with their ""Bearcoat"" finish.  The frame was done in ""urban grey"", and the slide was done in ""titanium"".  I had this done because it looked like the previous owner had made an amateurish attempt to re-finish the gun by himself, and it looked like crap.  A year later, I had them re-finish the magazines to match ; although the grey on the mag floorplates doesn't exactly match the grey of the gun frame -- I should have had them done at the same time, but I didn't think about that back then.

I then had Bruce Gray in Spray, Oregon, convert the V1 DA/SA action to H&K's LEM (""Law Enforcement Modification"") trigger.  He also performed an armorer's inspection.  The LEM can be described as the first shot being a long and light double-action pull, with every shot afterwards being single action, with the hammer automatically de-cocking when the trigger is released.  This results a pistol that has the advantage of a Glock-style striker-fired action -- no safety or other controls to manipulate in order to fire -- with a safe-er trigger.  Darryl ""nyeti"" Bolke has written an excellent article on ""The LEM As A Street Trigger"".  Read the whole thing at http://pistol-training.com/archives/8549

Of course, since this is a USP -- Universelle Selbstladepistole or ""universal self-loading pistol"" -- the action can be changed to any configuration at the armorer level, or even by the end user.  This modularity was the whole idea behind the ""U"" in USP.   The only other modification(s) I would make are (1) change the sights, and (2) maybe change the magazine release to H&K's extended magazine release ($20 from HKparts.net). 

The H&K USP was also the first handgun with an integral rail, when it was released in 1993.   During the rest of the 1990s, several firearms manufacturers produced handguns with proprietary rails.   While H&K's ""P"" series pistols -- P2000, P30, VP9, and HK45 -- use what is now the ""standard rail"", the USP still uses the original proprietary rail.  H&K's UTL (""universal tactical light"") for the USP are getting hard to find, but Streamlight does make a version of their TLR-3 with USP clamps, which are available at Amazon.com for around $100 : Amazon Standard Identification Number B0039D0KRS at http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0039D0KRS

Alloy frame, steel cylinder, no ejector shroud/underlug.

3000 were produced in two years, they were chambered in .22LR, .32 Colt New Police, and .32 S&W Long and Short. BBOG places a 10% premium on the Courier marking and another 10% on the .22LR version, and that was an edition from several years ago-- and there are none for sale that I have found.

The gun itself is in probably 65% shape. While it does exhibit wear on the finish typically found on the edges, as well as some fading because of its alloy construction, overall metal condition is ~85%. There are two scratches on the left side of the frame over the pony, and one lightning bolt shaped scuff on the barrel just over the forcing cone. I have tried to include pictures of these. 

Mechanically it is in perfect condition. Lockup is solid and trigger pull in double action and single action are great. Ejection is solid and ejector operates smoothly. Fires wonderfully and is an absolute joy. Totally ruined other revolver triggers for me. 

No pitting or surface rust anywhere.

Grips are original and are in okay shape. The right side grip has a crack in it near the bottom. It can be repaired but I am afraid of doing it.No pitting or surface rust anywhere.

No original box or papers unfortunately, though of course it can be dated using Colt's website or archive service."

Please take a look at all the info and research it. If your interested send me a realistic offer. Im just not sure what to ask. It actually has Spikes logo engraved on it. Coolest break I think I have ever seen. First picture below is the actuall part. The other three I found online because they showed it way better then the pics I took. Also, I posted all the info I could find on it as well. Thanks for looking and GOD Bless.



The Spike’s Tactical Adjustable Break is an adjustable muzzle break designed to be used in a short barrel CQB application. It directs the blast downrange! The most common problem with short barrels is the lack of back pressure they need to cycle. You can adjust the back pressure up or down until you find that “sweet spot” your 7-10 inch upper needs to cycle properly.
Machined from 303 stainless steel, while the cone of the the S.T.A.B is machined from an ULTRA high temp proprietary alloy. Adjustable by hand with no tools. Can be broken down for cleaning with no tools. Spring-loaded collar on the the S.T.A.B is wavy to achieve firm adjustment clicks. In testing, every 16 clicks decreased the rate of fire by 14 RPM. We have put thousands and thousands of rounds through the S.T.A.B. and have yet been able to burn one up! Coated inside and out (except for the cone) with Melonite, for corrosion resistance and durability. Size – OD is 1.37. OAL is 3.14. Weight is 10 ounces, or 284 grams. Made in the USA."

 Introduction
The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp Short is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil.

The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish.

NOTE: The Short model will not bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length when pinned.

 Introduction
The Smith Vortex G6A2 Flash Eliminator is based off the combat-proven Vortex 5.56 G6A1 system and is considered the best Flash Suppressor on the market today. The Vortex is designed for rifles chambered in .223/5.56 and features a 40% increase in structural rigidity over the A1 version due to it being manufactured from properly heat treated 8629 Chromoly Steel. The Smith Vortex G6A2 achieves the highest degree of flash suppression when using M-193, SS-109 (M855), and MK 262 service ammunition.

Features

    Patented 15-degree helix, guaranteeing a complete propellant burn and negligible flash
    Right-hand helical flutes will not loosen under sustained fire
    40% stronger than G6A1

 All the frame modifications were done by Chris Damato at Damato Custom Stipplings after a 8 week wait. This isn't some kitchen table hack job. Along with the 360 sunburst stippling, the small grip reduction, the finger groves being removed, and the trigger guard being undercut, there were also index marks added to the front of the polymer frame infront of the take down lever."

This is one of the newer WASR's that have been getting very solid reviews for a couple years now. They have the solid wood stocks, not the cheap,ugly plywood-laminate of the older ones, and everything is straight and well built (no canted sights, no hammered riivets, it's perfect). The newer WASR's are also built with all new parts, including cold hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrels, rather than the used surplus parts the older one's used. (You can look all this up).
I did the refinish on the stocks myself, and they look better in person than in the pic, where they look too bright and yellow.
It's got an after-market Ergo-grip and flash-suppressor installed, and I still have the originals. It also comes with the sling, bayonet, full cleaning kit and rod, and a couple magazines.
Also, I just dug up an AR-type,synthetic, telescoping stock that I'll include (for those that dig the modern, tacti-cool look over the vintage wood).

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

The S&W 649
This might be among the most politically incorrect of all firearms. At least it would be, if more people were aware of it’s design, and mission. To the uninitiated, this is simply an oddly shaped, sort of freakish revolver. The hump backed model 649 fires the .38 Special cartridge or the powerful 357 magnum, from a 2” barrel, and has a capacity of only 5 rounds. It is really too expensive, and well made to qualify as a Saturday Night Special (whatever meaning that phrase may happen to have at the moment). Like most specialized devices, the strange appearance of the Model 649 is a reflection of being narrowly designed for a particular function. In the case of the model 649, the gun has been designed to be carried, and even fired, from inside of a pocket. 

The strange hump backed shape is a result of a shrouded hammer. A small, serrated, and somewhat flattened nub, barely protrudes through a slot along the curve of the shroud. This permits the gun to be cocked and fired in the single action mode. Either during a draw, or while firing inside of a pocket, the shroud keeps the hammer from hanging up or snagging on the clothing. This is one of the best designs for deep concealment, and the only modern design, which allows firing from within the pocket. The slide of an automatic, or the hammer of a revolver would quickly foul, and tangle during this kind of shooting.  The hammer barely protrudes above the shroud, so that it can scarcely be noticed when the piece is viewed from the side. The basic gun, is the well regarded J frame, as is used in the Chief’s, and some other small, hideout guns. This is Smith’s .32 frame, proportioned to the .32 Special round. The frame can be used for guns chambered in .38, by reducing the capacity from 6 to 5. 
   Like most small guns, the M649 can be carried in a selection of hide out holsters.  Most people might ask why it would be necessary to have a holster inside of a pocket, but there are a couple of advantages. The most obvious advantage, is that the lines of the gun are broken, so that it does not “print” through the pocket to reveal that the owner is armed. The pocket holster also insures that the pistol is always properly positioned in the same place for a sure presentation (presentation is the politically correct term for what used to be called the draw). Without the pocket holster, these little guns tend to ride around in the pocket, and shift, to lie on their backs."
