Stock is beautiful, with only a few scratches and scuffs, which can easlily be remedied. Rifle was used by the communist era Polish army to train soldiers on the Mosin Nagant rifle. It is extremely similar to the good old mosin, but doesn't use a magazine It is designed as a one shot bolt action, which fires the inexpensive 22lr round. This particular rifle was manufactered in 1956, so a C&R license would work. Doesn't come with a sling or any accessories. This would be great for a Mosin Nagant collector, or for anyone with the need for a quality .22lr rifle. I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns.

Included the training suppressor, operating manual, original packaging, and an optional Surefire SFMB-7.62-5/8x24 Surefire Muzzle Brake and shim kit. 

The training suppressor can be utilized on your weapon system to get used to operating with a silencer prior to ordering a true suppressor, or while you wait for your NFA Stsmp to come in. I utilize a few different models of these at gun shows, picture shoots, operator training courses, etc. so nobody wil steal a real one or damage a real one in some combat operational training scenarios. 

They're great if you like to build weapon systems to sell and want to show a suppressor on your firearm without forking out $$$ and the wait time to receive the real deal. These SF-Training-Suppressors retail between $270-$300, I'm asking $200 just for the brand-new training can. The SFMB-7.62-Muzzle brake however is the real deal and retails for $150. This training suppressor fits on it perfect, but that's because it's an incredible muzzle brake/can adapter/flash suppressor that's utilized for true suppressor applications. These muzzle brakes drastically reduce the recoil of your firearm alone, but with even the training suppressor there's about a 95% reduction in first-round muzzle flash.

I'll sell the training suppressor alone for $200 ($210 shipped anywhere), the SFMB-7.62-Muzzle Brake for $110 ($115 shipped anywhere), or both together for $300 ($315 shipped anywhere).

The sights are Ameriglo Pro I-Dot night sights, with a black rear and a luminescent yellow ring around the front sight.  In the daylight, the luminescent paint absorbs light and allows for quick target acquisition with the plain black rear, and at night, the two tritium vials are stacked on top of one another for fast, accurate shooting as well.  The trigger kit and sights were both over $100, so I know what they are worth, plus the labor for installing them.  However, it is a used gun and I will listen to a fair offer.

86,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4757086,"For Sale:  GERMAN ""GUILD"" SPORTER ON G88 ACTION--NO FFL!","Southwestern Virginia, Roanoke, Virginia",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 7, 2015",Rifles,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,8mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a very dainty little German ""guild"" carbine built on a Gew88 action. For the collector of German hunting guns, or for those who like to hunt with something ""different,"" this is a real find. It's not highly ornate, as some of these guns tend to be, but rather plain; probably sold as a forester's or gamekeeper's gun. There are no proof marks that I can find.

Germany instituted a proof system in 1891, and guns that were in a shop's stock usually bear a mark to indicate they were ""grandfathered"" in when the law went into effect. This gun doesn't have the mark, leading me to believe the action dates from between 1888 and 1890, i.e., a very early Gew88 action was used to make this sporter before the proof system was set up. There is a proliferatton of marks on the underside of the breech but I have no idea what they mean. They aren’t proof marks. There is a Gothic ""T"" on one or two parts, and I was told by an advanced collector of German guns that this is a military inspector's mark. It's a virtual certainty this rifle came to the USA as a soldier's trophy after WW2, and of course there are no post-1986 importer's marks.

The Gew88 was a very popular choice for sporters due to its clean lines, trim appearance, and light weight. Many custom guns were made on surplus military actions, and this is one of them. It shows typical first-rate German craftsmanship, though it has no maker's name on it. It was probably assembled around 1910-1920 but it could be earlier, in light of the absence of a proof house stamp.  An identical gun is shown in the 1930 catalog of the famous firm of Burgsmüller und Sohne.

The caliber is “8x57J.” This is the pre-1905 variant of the 8x57 Mauser that uses a 0.318"" bullet. Even after the Imperial Army shifted to the larger diameter 0.323"" bullet, the older ""J"" bore was almost always used for hunting guns. Modern production ammunition must NOT be used in this rifle. ONLY ammunition with the 0.318"" bullet is safe. European milsurp 8mm Mauser is definitely NOT SAFE in this little rifle. Proper bullets and reloading dies are available but the fact is that this is a handloader's gun.

The 8x57J uses a round nose bullet of 196-200 grains at moderate velocity. Buffalo Arms sells 0.318"" bullets in various weights; ordinary 8x57 Mauser cases can be used if you size the case neck to the proper diameter to hold the smaller bullet. All other dimensions are the same as for the ordinary 8x57, and I load this caliber with a die set for the standard round. In deference to its age (all Gew88 actions pre-date 1897) I have kept my handloads about to the .30-30 level, as the Gew88 isn't as strong as the later Mauser 98.

THIS SALE INCLUDES PROPER AMMUNITION FOR THIS RIFLE. I WILL INCLUDE 22 ROUNDS OF LOADED HUNTING AMMUNITION WITH 175-GRAIN JACKETED SOFT POINTS; 20 MORE ROUNDS WITH 196 GRAIN CAST BULLETS; AND 20 CASES READY TO LOAD. BULLETS IN THE PROPER DIAMETER CAN EASILY BE OBTAINED FROM BUFFALO ARMS; A STANDARD 8X57 DIE SET CAN BE USED IF YOU ADD TO IT A NECK-SIZING DIE FOR THE 0.318"" BULLET. YOU WILL ALSO GET FOUR (4) OF THE NEEDED CLIPS FOR THE PACKET LOADING SYSTEM. TAKE YOUR NEXT DEER WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL OLD-TIMER!

The pictures show the condition. The stock is in very good shape, with the only serious flaws being a gouge on the left side near the magazine well, and a chip in the toe near the basket-weave butt plate. There are some minor handling and rack dings, but no cracks and no splits. It has a schnabel-type fore-end, very typically Teutonic and very elegant. There is a cheekpiece on the left side of the stock. The usual small German sling swivels are present, but these can be removed and quick-detachable swivels used instead. 

This rifle uses the ""packet loading"" Mannlicher system. Three of the needed clips are included in the sale as well. These are prevented from dropping out when the last round is chambered by a metal clip that closes the magazine well and keeps out dirt.
It has open sights: a 2-leaf rear sight and a ramped bead front. There is no provision for mounting a scope, nor should there be! (It would desecrate this little gem to scope it. One reason I'm selling it is that my eyes are no longer up to open sights.)

Like most custom hunting guns of the period it has a set trigger for a very light letoff. It can be fired with or without the set trigger being used. Military actions didn't have set triggers: this is one of the modifications made by the gunsmith who assembled it. The safety is the common ""flag"" type used on Mannlicher and Mauser actions: very positive and with a half-set position to allow safe manipulation of the bolt. There is a clip release in the front of the trigger guard to remove unused ammunition.

Overall length is 37-1/2"", with a 13-1/2"" length of pull to the front (firing) trigger. The round profile barrel is 16-1/2"" long. This short, handy, well balanced carbine would be an ideal rifle for a shooter of small stature. Weight is 5-1/2 pounds, another reason not to use full-house 8x57 ammunition in it!

The bore is very good. Not pristine, but with clean sharp rifling and no pitting. The barrel crown is intact. It shoots better than my eyes are capable of taking advantage of, and it has always been satisfactory for me. No problems hitting an animal at woodland ranges!

As mentioned, all Gew88 actions were manufactured before 1898, so this rifle is a legal ""antique"" not covered by the never-sufficiently-to-be-cursed Gun Control Act of 1968. It can be sent directly to your street address. Some states may have different laws, but if yours does, contact me BEFORE bidding. I am not an FFL holder, and this gun does not require that one be used. It will be shipped dismounted from the stock to reduce package size, and fully insured. I have had some major problems with the US Postal Service, and will ship via FEDEX."

It is a pre-1968 gun made by Hi Standard. It is in very good shape for its age and would make a great turkey gun or display piece.  The stock is in good condition and has a boiled linseed oil finish.  No cracks or bad dings!  It has an attractive wood grain, which is uncommon for such an inexpensive hunting shotgun.  It will come with a partial box of shells if I can find it -should be about half full. If I remember correctly it has a 5 shot capacity.

I will sell for $165 cash. I am mostly interested in cash, but will consider certain trades.

Please don’t waste your time trying to lowball me - this is a nice gun in very good condition.

I was going to keep and carry her, but I don't really like carrying anything under .380.

This is a 1955 made, Bavarian State Police issued PP. This was imported to the USA after Walther and Manurhin had their little falling out, so there are X's machined over the Walther name on the side of the firearm, and the Walther name has been machined off the grips. 

This is in very good condition, with backstrap wear (that all of them have) and some carry/holster wear on the slide/edges. When I bought it, the internals looked like it was fired MAYBE 10-20 times over it's lifetime, and I put 50 rounds through it last week with absolutely no problems. Gun shoots great, accurate and fun to shoot. 

Comes with black factory grips, and then green aftermarket, and orange/brown aftermarket. The orange grips I started to cut down the walther logo on the bottom to match how the gun is supposed to look, but I stopped after one side. Grips are factory molded copies dyed different colours from Vintage Gun Grips. 

Asking $600 obo for this. They don't come up for sale very often, but when they do they're pretty expensive. If you've seen these online, you know that it's a great deal because they go for $600-$675 in worse condition, plus shipping fees and FFL charges you're looking at $700+.

Willing to consider all trade offers, but first good cash offer gets it. Please don't try and lowball me. No I will not take $400, and no I will not trade for your $300 handgun.

This rifle is under 10lbs the way it's setup right now. Rifle comes with 5 20 round mags and one 5 round mag, also a Burris 3x9 and a Harris bipod. it is a shooter I can consistently ring steel out to 500 yards with the scope that is on it. With a nice scope I think it could easily be a 900 yard rifle. The things I would be interested in trading for are listed below.

I paid the following:
Harris bipod $54
Fnh mags $50 x 5
Burris scope $199
Rings $30
FNH FNAR $1500

Total money I've put in $2034. Trade value 1700. Trades possible I would be interested in FN57 , AR in 300blk, nice over under, nice 1911, or glock 17 or 19 + 550"

There is also a couple slots on the slide for mounting a reflex sight or pistol scope.  From researching before I purchased, the pistols made in Israel are suppose to be better built and more consistant when it comes to the operation, the trigger and the fit and finish.  You can also get the .50 barrel and mags that will allow you fire .50 AE, it just made more sense IMO to have one in .44 Mag. to start with due to ammo cost and if you can't put it down with a .44 Mag, you may have bigger issues, lol.  You can also fire .357 Mag by changing the barrel, mags and the bolt.  They also make longer barrels you can swap out.

Hey all,
I decided to change up my 45 load. So, to keep things simple I'm selling off all my other factory ammo. I priced these at lower than what I saw in stores. I would cut a little better of a deal if you buy all. This is all brass cased factory FMJ (no reloads). Only trades would be for 185gr FMJ or factory JHP 185grain ammo, perhaps for HP 7.62x39 ammo.

The new Walther Softcoil gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed firearm.The CCP’s Softcoil gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a pistol contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Features3 Dot Polymer SightsRapid Aiming and target acquisitionRear sight screw adjustable for windageLow profile – won’t snag clothingCustom Accessory RailPicatinny RailMounts optional flashlight or laserDynamic Trigger5.5 pound trigger pullShort .27” trigger travelSlide SerrationsFront and rear slide serrationsNon-slip surface to operate the slideDistinctive Walther StylingSlide Stop LeverSlide locks back on emptyMagazine ReleaseConveniently positioned for thumb operationAmbidextrous for right or left hand operationErgonomic Walther GripNon-slip, cross-directional grip surfaceBetter controlComfortable shapeSpecificationsOperationGas Delayed BlowbackCaliber9mmFinish ColorStainless SteelBarrel Length3.54”Trigger PullSA (Single Action) 5.5 poundsTrigger Travel0.27”Magazine Capacity8 RoundsOverall Length6.41”Height5.12”Width1.18”Weight (Magazine Empty)22 ounces"

This marlin is being sold as is and as a project gun and it will be my recommendation to have it checked out by a professional gunsmith before use. That being said, I took this in on a trade that I got screwed on about 2 years ago. It was dark and I couldn't see what I was getting,I trusted. Please see the pictures, its missing a screw or two and part of the trigger guard is broken. Also it appears the mag latch is broken off as the mag I had for it (now missing btw!!) would not stay in unless it was wedged with something. It was in a tasco ""tactical"" stock and appeared to be glued in (see the pictures of what I think is glue on the underside of the barrel forward of the stock). I did shoot it and it did function properly.

It does not come with a magazine, it appears to have been lost in a move. Sold as a project gun. Tasco scope included."

These SAR Arms K2 pistols are really nice. In your hand, they feel like a cross between a CZ-75 and a Sig Sauer!!!

If you look closer, you'll see the slide in the frame design which is a characteristic of the CZ-75 and Sig P210.

These K2's are all steel with a forged frame, have a 14+1 capacity, and have excellent quality adjustable sights. Both the front and rear sights are dovetailed and appear to be completely replacable or can be changed out for various aftermarket sights........which is a nice touch.

Comes with one mag, two cleaning rods, sight adjustment tools, lock, and all factory paperwork including manual.

These pistols are manufactured in Turkey by Sarsilmaz (means ""unshakable"" in Turkish) and were imported into the U.S. by European American Armory (EAA). The magazine is manufactured by Mec-Gar in Italy, the same company that makes mags for Beretta, and Sig-Sauer.

If you are wondering about this pistol, check out the NRA's September 2013 issue of American Rifleman. Long story short, Sarsilmaz is Turkey's largest firearms manufacturer, is thoroughly modern with the most up to date firearms manufacturing materials and processes, and supplies firearms to many of Turkey's governmental agencies including their military.

The NRA had some really positive comments regarding this firearm and reported many things..........such as the single action trigger on their sample broke at 3 lbs, 13.4 ozs and the double action trigger required 9 lbs, 13 ozs to operate. The mags are Italian produced Mec-Gar 14 round Para USA patterned. I'm not sure what this means but I would assume the same mag Para uses would work in this pistol as well. And lastly, the NRA states this pistol is a ""solid-shooting platform that should stand up to many tens of thousands of rounds of firing"". Sounds like one heck of an endorsement to me!!!

The RCBS ChargeMaster Combo takes the accurate ChargeMaster Scale and Charge Master Dispenser and combines them into one unit.

Average dispensing time of 60 grains of extruded powder is 30 seconds

I own a Kimber and thought I needed a Commander size 1911 to accompany it, but this pistol has just sat idle in my safe.  I bought it new in March and fired a total of 30 rounds out of it.  (Speer Lawman & Speer Gold Dot.  Yes, I keep track of that type of thing...)  That's four 7 round mags with 2 top offs!  One mag was only used for 7 rounds.  As a matter of fact, I just peeled the sticker off of it a few weeks ago.  It didn't have a scratch on it.  This thing is still like new and needs a good owner who will break her in right.  Comes with original box and all paperwork that came from the factory.  Manufactured in January, 2014.  I'm looking for cash to buy a Zeiss scope I've been wanting, but I'm always up for a trade, but only for specific rifles.  Not looking for pistols or shotguns right now.  See list below of the rifles I'm looking for.  I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart or downtown, whichever is closer for you.  *PLEASE NOTE*  I am a die hard 2nd Amendment guy.  For that reason, I require the buyer of my weapons to sign a receipt that stays between buyer and seller ONLY.  I require a TN driver license or carry permit for ID.  The State & Federal governments don't need to be involved in my gun trades, but I need to know who you are.  This requirement of mine helps to protect the 2nd Amendment and keep Armslist in operation.  If you are not willing to identify yourself, I respect your decision but I will not sell you my firearm.  $600 firm.  If/when you see this pistol, you'll see that it is mint.  When you factor in tax & background, you're saving $100-$120, depending on local dealer price.  Please call or text Matt with any questions or if you need more pics.  (732)213-seven nine four six.  Thanks for looking."

It's a good shooting, reliable gun, and accurage gun.  I switched out the stock trigger pad, which was a bit sloppy, for a Wilson Combat, which fits really nicely.  I also added a Wilson Combat mag well.  The trigger breaks light and crisp.  The sights are really nice.  The rear is a Novak style and is adjustable for elevation, and the front is a well- made red fiber optic that is easy to pick up.  The mag release is really nice, as it is extended, but unobtrusive.  It's very easy to hit, but you won't do it accidentally.  The grip safety and mainspring housing are checkered nicely, and the front strap is serrated.  The hammer and other internals look to be machined, not MIM, which is really nice.  I'm including upgraded magazines from what it came with.  2 will be 8 round Wilson Combat 47DE and 1is an 8 round Novak, which has been just as good as the Wilsons.  I'm also including a Safariland ALS/SLS holster, which alone goes for like $150 or so.  If you're looking for a good 1911 to really shoot, this would be a great choice."

I have been wanting to try one of these and JUST purchased this but have an opportunity to buy another piece I've been eyeing - so looking to let this one go.

This gun is supposed to be FUN to shoot. Accurate, reliable and INEXPENSIVE. Uses the most abundant, least expensive ammo (9mm) so you can shoot more! Good asset to any well rounded gun collection. 

[edit]
This gun IS great to shoot!  I've taken it to the range it it functioned flawlessly.  Inexpensive ammo and accessories and ACCURATE! Recoil is low, its easy to shoot, and FUN!  This is a gun that you'll want to take out and practice with and ammo for it won't break the bank!

I can include 200, 300, or 400, rounds of ammo in addition to the gun. Make offer.
