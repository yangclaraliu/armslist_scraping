I have for sale military surplus .30 ammocans for sale. They are Condition: Grade 2/Very Good (Grade 1 is new).

These GENUINE military cans have many uses including storage, geocaching, tool boxes, prepping, and of course, they can be used to store your ammo. They have a rubber seal on the lid that makes them virtually air tight and highly water resistant. This can also makes a great camera box on float trips. 30 cal. cans measure  10""L x 3 1/2""W x 6 3/4""D.

Don't be fooled by those new ammocans sold at Gander Mountain, Fleet Farm, Cabelas, Walmart, etc. Those ammocans are NOT considered MILSPEC and do not have the same gasket and sealing mechanism as the military models do.

Priced as follows:

$10 each if paid in cash.
$10.45 each if paid via Paypal.

Buy just one or one hundred. I'll likely have as many as you'll need.

For personal health reasons, I am selling this firearm, along with other items, for a very reasonable price.  Although this firearm is basically brand new and unfired, it is technically a used gun, and I have priced it on the low end of the used market.  Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to see the firearm.  I can be reached at 4zero5 five17 13seven9.  Call anytime day or night, first come first serve.  I can meet locally.  I have sold several firearms through Armslist before, and I understand the proper protocol and safety requirements necessary when transporting and presenting firearms.

Again, please call me anytime at 4zero5 five17 13seven9 to see this XDS.  At this price I don't expect it to last long, which is my intent.

Hello Everyone, 
I have for sale/trade a used but good shape great little carry gun. This is a AMT Backup 380 ACP. I just got this in trade and have not gotten to shoot it myself, but the previous owner said it ran good. It does appear to be tight and still action smoothly though. I would keep this, but i am getting away from 380 caliber and have already sold off all of my 380 ammunition. Need to be able to meet up in Norman if possible due to my schedule. 
Im mainly looking for cash on this, but i would consider trades as long as they are firearm related. For any offers or questions shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.
Thanks for looking and happy Hunting

Comes with 3 factory 15rd magazines. All paperwork, back straps, lock, and box included. Round count approximately 1000. 

When I originally purchased the Glock, I attempted to stipple my frame - unfortunately failed miserably. As such with my OCD, I sent it back to Glock to replace my frame. I have the paperwork from Glock stating that they replaced the frame. As such, the slide and barrel have the same SN, unfortunately, the frame SN is different.

Approximately 3500 cases of 40 caliber.  All Brass has been tumbled in walnut media for 3 hours followed by a ""polish"" tumble in corncob media for 2 hours.  These cases are NOT resized and are NOT decapped (primers are still in).   I'm selling because I reload pistol brass, but not 40 caliber.  I saved this for my brother who was planning on reloading, but opted out.  Being he has 40 caliber pistols, he was interested but now neither him nor I have a need for it.  I don't own a 40 cal, and don't plan on getting into that caliber.

Market rate for brass is around $3 per pound (and that's for brass that is not cleaned).  I'm asking $85 for all 35 pounds.  I hand sort all my brass and I'm pretty accurate in my process.  Not to say there isn't a ""straggler"" or two within this batch, but I bet you won't find very many.

I saved this for my brother who was planning on reloading, but opted out. Being he has 40 caliber pistols, he was interested but now neither him nor I have a need for it. I don't own a 40 cal, and don't plan on getting into that caliber.

Market rate for brass is around $3 per pound (and that's for brass that is not cleaned). I'm asking $85 for all 35 pounds. I hand sort all my brass and I'm pretty accurate in my process. Not to say there isn't a ""straggler"" or two within this batch, but I bet you won't find very many.

I'm sure this pistol shoots great, but it is too much of a work of art for me.

I'm pricing this to sell, and not just to have pictures of my great looking pistol on the internet.  It can be yours for $975.

The main reason for this folly is the false notion that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's. 
This is an all original unrestored Type 53.  It is an original military version meaning the stock is bare wood(no finish. the reason I am told is because we were killing the soldiers so fast that they needed new rifles quickly and didnt have time to wait for the wood to be finished. True or not I dont know.)
This gun is in excellent condition and the stock has no cracks, splits, no pits. I am asking $300.00 for the rifle, 140 rounds of ammo, ammo box, and sand filled rifle stand.

The slide received a logo delete, a deeper side pocket cut, front serrations added, sig equinox finished added, grey cerakote to complete the finish. The barrel and slide were given a port job on the top of the slide which makes for a very sweet shooter. The sights were changed out with a pair of xs big dot tritium sights.

You can check out the links below....but I'll summarize. That's like getting a SCAR 17 for $2300 and buying all the accessories at a discount. Price is firm and is a package deal, I will not sell the items/rifle by themselves, unless you wanna pay close to $3k for the rifle...;-) Feel free to contact me if you have the cash sitting next to you before 930 in the evening. Not trying to be a dick but this is a deal.... I'm losing atleast a grand. I will only do payments if its two or less and you'll see the rifle on the second full payment. My number is 619-3@1-1977.

Extremely reliable. This was my carry gun for the last couple of years. Cleaned and oiled weakly. Gun is in very very very good shape and it very accurate.

I honestly dont want to sell it but if I can get the right price I will let it go to help fund other projects. 

About the rifle - It is UNFIRED. The rifle has been sitting in my safe its whole time with me. I did swap out the original grip, stock, and forearm with all fde magpul just to keep them from any scratches and to keep them good looking. However since I recently moved from dallas the stock grip, forearm, and stock are all in a storage unit and im not exactly sure where they are and it would be im possible to find them until my house is finished being built and I unload the storage unit.. I have the original box and the original factory unopened plastic bag w/ the factory mags/manuals/sling etc. in a separate storage unit that is easily accessible. When I do unpack the original grip/stock/forearm in a couple months I would be more than happy to drive them to you or mail them. 

I have also cleaned the rifle twice with ballistol to keep away any chance of rust/weathering. 

I will provide the pics of the rifle w/ the factory furniture from the day I got it and a pic with the current magpul furniture."

I did all of the ""free mods"" including the auto bolt release and and polished hammer. Sweet trigger. I added the nylon bolt buffer to dampen the recoil in the bolt. Now it does not have a scope on it. I had a redfield scope on it but have decided to put that on a different rifle. So basically just put your favorite scope on this and you have a sweet little shooter.  Very accurate with cci standard velocity.  Also comes with the 10rnd factory mag.

I have a rifle for trade listed below. But I am also looking fr a nice wood stock set for an ak. I'll swap an arsenal all black us made stock set for your wood set. Text pics of your set if interested. 


Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

JHP (Jacketed Hollow Point) HI-SHOK revolver & pistol cartridges in 50 - round boxes. These are original manufacturer rounds that were part of the inventory of a gun shop up north that has gone out of business since the owner has passed away some time ago. I have a complete case of 1000 rounds or 20 boxes of 50 - rounds each for sale at this point. I do not own a gun to shoot these so we are trying to sell them at less that the current retail pricing to liquidate them as soon as possible. I have several pricing brackets depending on the quantity that is ordered as follows:
The current going rate for these rounds online is about $34.99 dollars cash after searching many sites to fix a price to start from. Then there are shipping charges on top of that so I feel our price structure is very good for someone looking for these type of rounds. These can also be shot out of a .327 Federal Magnum caliber pistol since they are shorter that the .327 Federal Magnum and are a rimmed round.

1.) $30.00 dollars cash per box of 50 - rounds which is about 15% below the current going rate for these rounds or 0.60 cents per round cost.
2.) $29.00 dollars cash per box of 50 - rounds which is about 16% below the current going rate for these rounds or .058 cents per round cost. QUANTITY - 5 BOXES (250) purchased at one time. Price = $145.00 dollars cash.
3.) $28.00 dollars cash per box of 50 - rounds which is about 20% below the current going rate for these rounds or 0.56 cents per round cost. QUANTITY - 10 BOXES (500) purchased at one time. Price = $280.00 dollars cash.
4.) Purchase the whole case of 1000 rounds which is 20 boxes for $27.00 dollars cash per 50 - round box or $540.00 dollars cash total. That is at 0.54 cents per round cost which is about 23% below the current going rate for these rounds online.

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. 

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot."

Description

The 3MR trigger assembly with a right-handed selector is compatible with small pin .154"" mil-spec style fire control groups. The right-handed selector paddle will be on the left side of the rifle. 

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

It's a 2005 Brute Force 650 that runs good. I just adjusted the valves and it starts on the first hit of the electric start or first pull of the pull start. It's lifted 2"" on 30"" silverback mud tires with 12"" ITP wheels, snorkel kit, wild boar radiator relocation kit, upgraded electronic box, and hmf exhaust.

While it does run and drive it does need some work. Currently the brakes are really weak, needs both front axles, and a 4wd actuator. About $500 worth of parts from ebay. The passenger side headlight is missing in the pictures but I do have one, just haven't installed it. While none of the plastics are cracked, they are scratched. You can search craigslist and if you did put the $500 in this quad you'd still be coming out ahead.  

This would make a good hunting or farm quad. Even though the 4wd doesn't work it will still go many places with the tires it has on it.

Trades I'd be interested in are: Combo packages equal to $2500, a name brand AR15 plus cash, .308's, .223's, anything really.  I also like handguns.

This gun has been well cared for and the metal is in 98% condition. Cleaned and oiled after every use. The wood has a few marks from normal use but they're nearly unnoticeable, I'd call it 95% or better. There is a small area on the metal near the cylinders of corrosion, but its very small. This gun is a GEM and has plenty of shooting left in it. I'm only selling to move up to a higher quality O/U with longer barrels. Comes in original packaging and box with manual, sleeves, and additional choke tubes with plastic case. Check out the link below for see CZ's facts and info on their webpage.

I was told this was an NRA sporterized fund raising rifle. Today it's in pretty rough shape. It's got some rust and a brown bore but it does function and shoots surprisingly accurately. It's numbers matching with some being arsenal restrikes. Not at all uncommon in the mossin world. This would make a great donor rifle for a custom build.
 Next up is a phoenix arms HP22A. I believe the slide is worn because after firing the hammer does not reset. Could be a worn hammer, I haven't got at it with a micrometer to check the specs on any of the parts yet. The gun fires fine in single action. Comes with the box and one magazine. It may even be able to be warranted I'm not sure I have not contacted the company to find out. If not any parts needed are able to be mail ordered without needing an FFL.
 I DO NOT make any claim that either gun is safe to fire until checked out by a licensed gunsmith. Sale or trade AS IS.

The ergonomics of this pistol are great and the sub-compact version I carry is exceptionally accurate and reliable. 

As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.

Purchaser must have valid IN ID and preferably a carry permit.  I have priced this firearm to sell. You can own this firearm in it's factory box, never used, with two 14 round magazines and all original paperwork for only $375!!  Purchaser must meet me in Evansville or pay to have it shipped to their FFL dealer. Thanks for looking."
