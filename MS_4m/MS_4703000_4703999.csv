The barrel's 20"" Length is great to keep a rifle reasonably maneuverable and lightweight while also producing good velocities in order to benefit from the 243 Winchester's long range ballistic performance. Whether building a new rifle from scratch, or simply to change calibers in an existing gun, this SST Barrel is an equally excellent selection for the hunter, competitor or recreational shooter with a need for accuracy at extended ranges. It is constructed of 416 Stainless Steel that's finished with an attractive Black Teflon coating for corrosion protection, and is compatible with any LR-308 based upper receiver. 
NOTE: This is the same barrel used in DPMS LR-243 factory rifles, meaning it will fit other DPMS LR receivers including the LR-260, LR-6.5 Creedmoor, LR-308 and LR-338. Barrel is not compatible with any AR-15 based receiver.

The barrel's 20"" Length is great to keep a rifle reasonably maneuverable and lightweight while also producing good velocities in order to benefit from the 243 Winchester's long range ballistic performance. Whether building a new rifle from scratch, or simply to change calibers in an existing gun, this SST Barrel is an equally excellent selection for the hunter, competitor or recreational shooter with a need for accuracy at extended ranges. It is constructed of 416 Stainless Steel that's finished with an attractive Black Teflon coating for corrosion protection, and is compatible with any LR-308 based upper receiver. 
NOTE: This is the same barrel used in DPMS LR-243 factory rifles, meaning it will fit other DPMS LR receivers including the LR-260, LR-6.5 Creedmoor, LR-308 and LR-338. Barrel is not compatible with any AR-15 based receiver.

I am the second owner. Prior owner bought it new to throw in his tool box and glove box. So that's what he did, with little regard to the gun. His neglect shows. The gun has a fair amount of finish wear. Nothing terrible, but you can't miss it. Mechanically, however, the gun is good. He shot it twice, with 30 rounds between the two range trips. I took it off his hands since he really wasn't using it and wanted some extra cash. I have had it for about a month, and have shot exactly 50 rounds of standard pressure .38 through it. Lockup is tight, timing is perfect, trigger is smooth (But a little stiff), and it is superbly accurate (5 shots in the same hole at 10 yards). It's just not as pretty as it once was. I did paint the front sight red with enamel paint. It can be removed with alcohol if you do not like it. I do not have box or paperwork. I can provide additional pictures upon request

This firearm has had about 400 rounds put through it since its purchase in 2012.  I have had no problems with it whatsoever.  I like the factory grips, which accommodate larger hands very well.  A Blackhawk OWB holster and extra magazine holder are included with the firearm along with a second 16 round magazine, original box and cleaning brush. I am asking $425 cash for everything.  No trades, please.

I encourage you to search YouTube and view Hickok45's video about this firearm to see its potential and capabilities.

Shivworks Disciple TRAINER $100
 The ShivWorks Disciple is designed for self-defense, and fulfills its design function with brutal efficiency.  Due to limited manufacturing runs, this is an extremely rare item.  This knife has never been used or carried.  It is a small defensive knife made by Trace Rinaldi and heat treated by Paul Bos.  The Disciple is ergonomically  designed for the reverse edge grip, is wicked sharp, and easily carried on the belt thanks to the included small Tek-Lok.  The design is the collaborative effort of the ShivWorks ""brain-trust"", including the law enforcement agent and trainer known as SouthNarc and knife-maker Trace Rinaldi.  The Disciple has a 3 1/2"" bead blasted blade of S30V steel sharpened on the top edge, but not the bottom.  This knife is designed with a reversed modified Wharncliffe blade suited for hooking and thrusting.  The handle is approximately 1/2"" thick with contoured G-10 scales fastened with hollow stainless steel pins.  The scales are gently textured and flow smoothly and quickly into the hands from the kydex sheath.

The Disciple is a fast moving and effective tool for self-protection.  It is just slightly handle heavy with a point of balance right behind the finger choil.  It is extremely fast handling, especially in reverse grip.  The sheath although new has small scratches near the Tek-Lok screws from changing the clip from one side to the other.

Product Details:

Blade Material:			S30V Steel - Paul Bos Heat Treated
Blade Size:			3"" cutting edge
Handle Material:			Black G-10
Overall:				7 1/2""
Weight:				5.5 ounces
Sheath:				Kydex Sheath with Tek-Lok

ShivWorks Clinch Pick $150
Combining a high-retention ergonomic grip with a reverse edge blade, the Clinch Pick Live Blade is compact, concealable, and incredibly effective. Crafted around a simple, point-driven methodology, the edge-in configuration in forward or reverse grip still provides tremendous leverage for ripping and tearing cuts.
Intended to be primarily worn between 10 and 2 o'clock, the Clinch Pick can be easily accessed by either hand and fits comfortably next to an appendix holster. This allows for an ambidextrous, locked-wrist deployment and remains accessible during entanglements and under stress."

This is a early build PTR 91 GI. Let me explain why you want this one. It's no secret that the early PTR builds featured more actual GI parts. This rifle by serial number, falls in production after the ones that experience cracks in the front trunion. It also falls before those that had a change in barrel design that prevents the shooting of most surplus 7.62x51! Why a GI model (the budget model) over say a 91F? I'll tell you! The 91 GI has a barrel profile that mimics the original HK design. That means the accuracy takes a slight hit, however it will feed damn near any ammo! The 91F while only a bit more accurate, will not fire most surplus ammo reliable! You can also add a port buffer (which this rifle has!) The 91F has a welded on top rail that prevents the addition of a port buffer. What the port buffer dose is save your brass from getting the trademark HK dent. It also keeps it from flying 30 ft away! Why am I asking 1500.00 for a used rifle that costs 995.00? Quite simply put, with everything on this rifle, it would cost you over 2k to build new! This rifle has the following upgrades, German wide handguard, HK bipod, HK Parts large charging handle (not yet installed), HK parts steel trigger housing, HK factory tuned trigger group (incredible difference in pull and take up), HK Parts sniper grip, MFI clamp on top rail (receiver is in spec, you can lift the rifle by the rail it's on that good), POF port buffer, and Magpul adjustable stock (for leangth of pull and cheek weld.) Top it off you will also get the original Navy trigger housing with trigger group, an additional HK GI style grip, 26 aluminum HK magazines, and all the original paperwork and case! Try to top this deal!"

Like the S&W41, the 208 evolved from the Walther Olympia of the 1930s, which itself was an adaptation of the Reising Target Pistol.  After an unsuccessful adaptation by Hammerli following WWII as the Hammerli Walther Olympia, the International saw the gun revised extensive with a far superior result.

Important note:  some have said the Armslist email system is NOT forwarding inquiries.  If you receive no response within a day, please email directly at REDACTED, or start by emailing directly.

The 208 is, in essence, the ultimate S&W41 that Smith and Wesson never made.

The barrel is a solid unit with the frame, with superb (close to 0.5 MOA) accuracy resulting.  The trigger is excellent for consistency, and readily adjustable from about 400 gms to about 3000.  In addition to having a ""fine"" adjustment, this gun offers a coarse adjustment system for rapid adjustment from heavy to light pull weights.

Gun weight can be adjusted by change in barrel weights (0-270 gm available).  The original Hammerli grip is one of the best ever offered for a handgun.

This gun includes the original box that is SN matched to the gun and one magazine.  Additional magazines (OEM Hammerli) available.

This gun has no safety.  One with a hammer block/trigger block safety also is available with 2 SN matched magazines, same price.

The images show BOTH of the guns available. One is with a SN matched box and 1 magazine, the other with 2 SN matched magazines and no box.  One has a safety, one does not.  Both have the rapid adjust for the trigger.

I just don't need this, it's not perfect and would be a terrific shooter or collector piece.
It does have a few minor handling marks and has been fired. Nothing serious. The wood is beautiful, really. I'm the second owner. I fired 2 rounds through it, cleaned it and put it back away. FIRM on the price, ammo only accepted in trade. Better than a pawn shop rifle, more expensive and worth it.This'll make someone VERY happy."

Being an early model it does not have a decocker. The pistol is used of course and shows plenty of wear from some carry and the years but is still functionally sound. Despite it's age I'm pretty sure it has still seen less than 1k rds fired. The locking block and springs are all still original and in fine working order. Overall it's a pretty good gun, made back when this model was one of Taurus's primary money makers and in my opinion their quality control was far better than many people seem to think it is today. I am asking $225 but will also consider firearm trades. Preferably a decent HD shotgun or handgun but if it shoots I will consider it.

Will trade towards the following (+/- cash):
1) Youth .22 rifle - something with a short length of pull like a Marlin youth, Cricket etc. either a bolt or a break action.

This gun has a serial number of 156-xxxxx and has been researched to be manufactured in 1980. The gun is in very nice condition for being thirty-five years old. The Original walnut wood grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the stainless finish. The condition of the stainless is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Ruger released this model as a lesser option variant of the Security Six and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 4"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model Service-Six function perfectly, and as with all Ruger revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed. This revolver carries a very rich tradition and has a strong following by those individuals that were looking for function over form. All business all day long. This Service- Six honors all those American servicemen and women who dedicated so much in the line of duty. $750 OBO. It also will come with some target grips as well. Will ship to you ffl please make sure they will receive from an individual. Thank you and God Bless!"

By used I mean I bought my AR 15, had it for about a week, and changed the furniture out for black. But hey, now my idiocy can be your gain!
It comes with the box that my new (black) furniture came in, so you'll have everything it would have come with new (to include the installation screw).

Make an offer! If you're looking to buy two or more of the items from my page, I am also willing to provide a discount.

The Twilight DLX comes with our famous adjustable multiplex crosshair system for accurate compensation for trajectory in precise 10-yard increments at any speed between 300 and 400 FPS, and our dual red or green color illuminated reticle to assist you in low light accuracy.

THESE ARE HIGH QUALITY ITEMS. We manufacture these 100% in our shop.  The body is a one piece design that is machine from 6061-T6 Aluminum extrusion. It will work with most lowers (except Olympic Arms) just the same as a dedicated 9mm lower.  It will work with the following magazines:

Colt / Metalform
Cproducts
Beta-C drums
Metalform
Modified Uzi


It has a last round hold open but the magazine must have one in order for it to work. The aluminum parts are black anodized 6061-T6 and the steel parts are phosphate coated.  The shell ejector can be adjustment as to prevent it from rubbing the bottom of your bolt and the block can be adjusted slightly up and down to properly set the feed ramp height.  It also has a unique locking system that prevents the block from moving after adjustment.  It requires no gunsmithing and no modifications are required to your lower receiver.  It can be installed in just minutes and includes all hex wrenches (3) required to set.  It is completely adjusted to factory setting that will work on most applications without any further adjustments."
