It's an Anderson ALUMINUM lower (No plastic or ""Carbon"" trash) with Anderson trigger group and Anderson aluminum flat-top upper with carpenter steel bolt carrier group. This gun has a 6-position tactical stock, and is a full AR with trap door, bolt assist, and full-length free-float handguard (in other words, it is NOT a stripped-down ""sport"" model). This gun has never been fired and is completely USA-made from all BRAND-NEW parts.

I've had several similar guns built for myself, my brother, my wife, and my friends, and they're all accurate and reliable. These barrels are very tight and will need to be broken in gently.

This gun keeps going up in value. If you check Gunbroker, there is only one listed, and it is already at $455 after a couple days, for just the gun. I am including well over 100 dollars in ammo as well as holster and no shipping or transfer fees.

Sometimes you need something a little different. A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.
From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.
Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle."

This gun looks to be in excellent shape and the one mag fired through it functioned flawlessly.  Bolt and carrier are stainless.

Stock is a Tapco six position adjustable and the mag is a 30 round Promag.  AK mags are cheap if you want something else but this one seems to work fine.

All numbers are matching and the bore looks excellent too. Thanks for looking, the Mak 90 is a solid rifle known to be an excellent buy in the AK world and they are getting harder to find.

The gun is in decent shape and fires good.  Both the stock and barrel have been painted back.  The serial numbers on the barrel and bolt do not match.  

If you are interested I can send pictures.  

Below is more information on the Brazilian Mausers:
The 08/34.30 started life as a contract short rifle built by CZ/Brno for Brazil. 
Original caliber was 7x57 and the contract began in 1934.
It's pretty similar looking to the VZ24 short rifle.
Some say that there were Brazilian-made actions used on some of the 08/34.30s since they lacked the usual CZ markings.

Sometime post-WWII, Brazil adopted the .30-06 as their service cartridge so these 08/34s were converted to this caliber. The original barrels were rebored/rechambered at the Fabrica De Itajuba Brasil arsenal...which later became known as IMBEL. These barrels had a "".30"" stamped at the end of the 08/34 to designate that they were .30-06 models."

This one is missing the bayonet lug (that front portion of the carbine stock appears to have been cut back) and the brass stock disk, but is otherwise all original and shoots great.  It even has the original distance calibration card on the stock.  I received it years ago with a partial box of old Norma 6.5x55 shells that I recently finished up and still have the brass.  It was made in 1918 and demonstrates why the Swedish Mausers were long considered the best for fit/finish and overall quality.  This little carbine with a 16.5” barrel is quick handling and just plain fun to shoot or hunt with.  The 6.5 is a hard hitting and flat shooting caliber.

The Model 25 was only manufactured from ’49-’54 as a way to keep costs of manufacture down compared to the slightly heavier Model 12. It offers the same milled receiver and was still too costly to build to compete with the stamped Remington 870. The Model 25 was only manufactured in 12 gauge and this full choked model has a 28” barrel and has a super smooth action. If you’re a Winchester collector, this is a must have in original condition. And if you’re not, this Winchester will last a couple more lifetimes because it is built to last and would make a great backup trap gun or hunting pump at a price they could never be made for again.

This is the commander series with the shorter barrel and is actually quite concealable for CC. The finish is black scandium frame (which is very light) with a grayish stainless slide. Trijicon night sights, rounded butt, checkered front and backstrap, and a very crisp trigger. Capacity is 8+1, I'll throw in a third magazine (Wilson Combat=$40) This is the sweetest shooting handgun that I've fired!  Priced for quick sale and is NON NEGOTIABLE. Try finding another for this price! Vance's didn't give it to me and I'm not giving it away either. If you offer a dollar less you'd be wasting both of our time so please no low ball offers, I don't NEED to sell. Not interested in trades and CASH ONLY."

Dear Steve,

We would like to thank you for your e-mail and contacting Smith & Wesson / Thompson Center.

Your firearm was produced between 1945 - 1948.

Unfortunately, we are not able to provide firearms valuations. The used firearm market is too subjective for us to make accurate determinations.

You may be able to find good comparison information on the Internet. There are a number of reputable online auction sites for firearms.

You may also consider a visit to your local gun dealer. They may be able to offer an option and likely have the Blue Book Value of Guns at their disposal.

Thank You for choosing Smith & Wesson / Thompson Center products. Have a great day.
Smith&Wesson values its customers and we are happy to have served you today. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require further assistance.

Regards, Steve"

The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. A bipod mounting rod is threaded into the stock, securing the oversized recoil shoulder and locking the recoil shoulder to the stock for increased accuracy. The Specs on the rifle are: Overall Length: 52"" / 1321mm
Barrel Length: 30” / 762mm
Barrel Twist: 1-15"" / 1/381mm, RH, 8 groove
Weight: 30.0 Lbs / 13.6 kg
Recoil: 19 ft/lbs / 2.62 kg/m / 25.7 Joules   No scope or bi-pod...     Will sell for $1500 and have 200 rounds of ball ammo for additional $...  Trades of Saiga 12 shotguns, or PSL-54c rifles considered... REDACTED"
