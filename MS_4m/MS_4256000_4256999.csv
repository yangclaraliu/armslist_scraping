$620 OBO

ASK FOR MORE PICS!

I have a VZ2008 with 4 magazines, each loaded with 30 rounds (120 rounds total) and comes with a great condition ammo pouch (with belt loops and shoulder strap). 

-I removed the slant break (which should never be on a semi-auto) and put a plain thread protector on which reduced felt recoil.

-I have had the bolt-carrier tabbed, which means the shooter will never have to worry about any trigger ""gremlin"" problem popping up (although I never experienced even before it was added). 

Originally wanted to trade for an FAL or L1A1 but none were offered, so I'm going to sell this baby to put the money toward an FAL.

Thanks for looking!

P.S. Leather was added by me to foreguard just to look cool (give it a kind of rebel look). Can be unwrapped, I used no glue or anything like that."

This holster gives you the best of both worlds by offering an inside the waist band (IWB) holster that converts to outside the waistband (OWB) by easily taking off our USA powder coated holster clips. When removed they reveal our molded belts slots for our famous close riding pancake. This holster has become one of our top sellers due to the versatility of having both IWB and OWB capabilities. We only use the finest bull hide and hardware on this holster to ensure the longevity and durable wear for years to come. We reinforce the mouth for easy one handed re-holstering and to prevent collapsing while carrying IWB. This holster by far is a great wearing holster both OWB and IWB. Also, this holster is tuckable, so you can tuck your shirt behind the metal clips and will accommodate up to a 1-3/4"" belt."

The Marshall logos are missing and the tolex has some scuffs and scratches but it's in pretty good shape overall. The cabinet has the original grill cloth with holes and wear as shown in the pictures. The cabinet also needs a speaker wire repaired but that's an easy fix. I've gigged with this rig and it's never let me down. I really hate to sell it but I'm not playing much any more and could use the cash instead.

I have a great 1911 for sale. it has never jammed up on me while shooting. Took good care of it. It Comes with hogue grips black and a extra set of aftermarket skull grips. It's the thinnest 1911 I ever held while the hogue grips are on it. And with the skull grip there not to bad if you have normal sized hands. There's only one scratch on it, and it's from the slide sliding back and forth. If your looking for your first 1911 and don't want to pay a arm and leg this is the gun for you!!!

This gun is a beautiful shooting 870 that will make you proud at the Trap Club. This gun comes with a fixed Full choke. This gun was purchased to be a spare gun that our friends and family could use. This gun simply never got used. I only shot 50 rounds through it myself. This gun is too nice not to be shot. This gun deserves to be shot more often.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

Ruger is one company that isn't satisfied sitting on their laurels. It seems like they're always out front, leading the way for others to follow. What else can they possibly do with their 10-22? The Charger Takedown is a fine example of their ingenuity. There's nothing on the market to compare with it and with the demand, it's hard to keep them in stock. The order, we just received, has the spent testing rounds dated just 2 to 3 weeks prior to arrival. Life is beautiful and beer is good.

Made in Italy. 

Same size and shape frame as the 92fs, just a little shorter in the slide length for the Centurion model. It's still a big gun, but is a little more concealable than a full size. Easily converted to 9mm by swapping to a 9mm barrel and mags.

This model is very hard to find as a double/single action model with a de cocker as this one. Most Centurians are double action only; this one has the crisp beretta single action trigger. The action is glass smooth. Functions fine. No excessive wear/stress/cracks, etc. In good shooting shape.

About 80-85% condition or better from holster wear. Most likely a law enforcement trade-in. Manufacture date of 1993.

Comes with an extra 10 round mag and houge grips installed.

Excellent truck gun or home defense piece. 

$350 cash firm. Not interested in trades. 

Will ship to your FFL out of state at your cost."

I agreed early in the week to meet on Saturday and sell a $20 item. On Friday, I received a trade offer for $35 worth of ammo for that same $20 item plus a pair of scope rings. Being a firearms instructor, ammo is better than cash. Since I had not heard from the original person since early in the week, I took the ammo.

I had only 1 loose carcano round laying around to test with and it shoots!

Already loaded with options, I find that most customers want it just the way it is. When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. Its designed  to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds. The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well."

Used only a couple of times. I bought it back in 2014 straight from Bullpup Unlimited. I have all original packaging, Instructions and even the box it was shipped in! 

I am including a Magpul RVG which makes running this bullpup easier. This kit does not include any sights. It comes with a flat top picatinny rail and will accept picatinny mounted iron sights and optics. I love this set up, but I decided to go a different route with my build. I had Vang Comp Systems install their front and rear ghost ring sight set and kit is no longer compatible, I really hate to see it go. I rather see it go to a new home than having it collect dust in my closet. My loss is your gain, don't pass this up. This kit is the real deal!

This kit fits Remington 870 with plain barrel bead sight or raised pedestal bead sight only.

This kit moves the trigger behind strong hand and shortens the Remington 870's profile from 38.5 inches to 28.5 inches!

NOTE: This kit will not fit vent rib or barrels with rifle sights. 3 1/2"" receivers or receivers with a picatinny rail. This listing is for the BULLPUP CONVERSION KIT ONLY NO FIREARM! SOLD AS IS....

Only 50 rounds through the barrel. I Purchased this a couple of years ago through Gunbroker (my first online purchase). It was stated that there was a limited run of these that were sent to Iraq. Being a noob to all the Idiotic Laws in California, I had this gun sent to Turners from West Virginia. Turns out the finish if this Glock was not on the CA Roster. Turners refused to do the Transfer so it had to be shipped back to W. Virginia. I finally found a non-chain FFL that would accept the transfer. Now, somewhere between the shipment to Turners and then to the Final FFL, Some brainiac decided to see if the finish was factory or aftermarket. Anyway, When I took it home I discovered a scratch about an inch along the right side of the slide near the muzzle. That's about the only imperfection with this nice looking Glock. Please see pics below.
