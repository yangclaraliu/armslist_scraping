This is a performance center revolver that has a hand tuned PC action. 7 shot 357 magnum, 3 inch barrel, compensated, trijicon night sight, and cut for moon clips. I love revolvers and have had many, but this one has been truly exceptional. will also come with a couple of moonclips and a triple K leather holster. Its in pretty good shape, but is not NIB perfect, its been carried and fired (about 500 rounds), so Id say its in 90-95 % condition. 

Love it, but I'm thinking of going back to a K frame revolver. Would be interested in a K frame S&W revolver in trade with a 3 or 4 inch barrel in 38 special, round butt highly preferred (Model 10, 13, 15, 64, 65, 19, 66, similar) plus cash or possibly other firearms depending on what you have. Trade value is $1000-1100 .

This is a very hard rifle to come across in unfired condition. This model is no longer imported and what makes this rifle so expensive is it is not stamped like all the other AK's but this rifle is made out of one solid block  and it takes 5 1/2 hours for those guys just to mill the receiver and then it is forged. I shot my buddy's arsenal Ak about 3 years ago and this gun is a crazy tack driver. Another thing that makes these rifles so solid are that arsenal makes and hand fits everything so this is something to admire. After shooting my buddy's rifle I ordered this one and it took over 6 months to get. I paid close to $1300.00 after is all said and done and if you can find one in unfired condition  anymore they go from $1500 to $2000.  It's time to let this nice piece go because  I need the cash for some bills. This gun comes with a 5 round clip for bench shooting, 2-30 round mags, the factory green sling, oil bottle and the factory Ty cleaning kit. Most of the accories are still wrapped in plastic. 
At this time i really want just cash and I have priced the gun for a great deal meaning less than I paid for it a couple of years ago and you cannot get this model any more. I may take a couple of cheap guns traded towards this rifle to lower the price. So let me know what you have and let's make a deal I need to get some cash. Cash price I'll take $1000.00 or trade price for $1250.00 about the price on the gun but let's see what you have and we will make a deal. Remember cheap guns in on trade and cash.

I have just reduced this revolver. It retails for nearly twice this amount. It is in great condition and comes with the Crimson Trace grips. Also has a Tritium dot on the front sight.(its the big dot XS sight on front) It is an excellent choice for legal concealed carry. With the Tritium front sight and laser grip it is great in low light situations. I can not find the original box but have included a box that I got with another S & W pistol. These ""J"" frame revolvers are great for pocket carry (in a good pocket holster) or work well in a belt / paddle holster. This one only weights 13.5 ounces and is rated for .357 Magnum. I have never shot .357's in it though. I have only used .38 Special and .38 special +P rounds in it. It is quite manageable with the +P loads. I have not carried it or shot it much..it's been shot under 50 times. The little place on the left side (in the pictures) is the trigger lock. (never used it) Thank you for looking and if ?'s please send message. Look these up on Google or somewhere, they are somewhat pricey and pretty rare on Armslist..especially with the Crimson Trace grips on them. I will ask to see a valid Tn. drivers license.

It's a sig, so it's really nice, but I don't need another pistol.  I want to build my wife an AR15 for Christmas, so I'm going to use the money for that.

I'm open to any trades that benefit me, or I will trade for any AR15 in 300blk or 223/556.  I will not add cash.   Thanks!"

Factory set at 8 ounces and breaking like a glass rod, it's the ultimate factory trigger. Gun is clean and in mint shape, having seen only range use and never hunted with in the field. Has the tiniest of handling mark next to the front sling stud, but otherwise as factory new. Comes with the box and all paperwork as new, including test target and manual (DVD). Factory retail price is just under $1200 with that optional trigger, willing to sell for $850. Selling to fund my new addiction for pre-64 Winchester rimfires, I'd possibly look at one of these on trade.

- Magpul vertical grip.
- BCM charging handle and BCG.

I painted this rifle in a desert configuration using 5 colors and fabric I found at a fabric store to give it a dry and depth look. I've had lots of compliments on it.  I also put a BCM decal on the stock.
I have roughly 200 rounds through it. The only reason I'm selling this is because I have been using a different AR more.
I have about $1,600 or more invested in this but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200. This is a great rifle and I know you will be happy with it! 
I would prefer local Colorado sales but I will ship to your FFL for an extra $50. If it turns out to be less in shipping I'll send you the change. More, please send me the extra.
For local sales you pay all transfer fees. 
I am not really looking for trades but will entertain a partial trade of a Ruger MK 3 stainless bull barrel pistol pulse cash.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. Also, no low ballers demanding I let it go for $600. I know what I have.

The AL 48 models are among the first to use a lightweight alloy receiver. An advancement of significant proportions, this new technology earned the company the ""Compasso d'oro"" award for excellence. The ""Golden Compass"" effort ""that improved shotgun style and performance"" was the first step toward the perfection of this highly respected shotgun line.Known for reliability, the bolt of the long-recoil action is raised into a locking position in the barrel to form a steel-to-steel chamber lockup. On firing, the bolt and barrel move back simultaneously and mechanically separate after the shot leaves the muzzle. The system is built to manage all 2 3/4-inch loads within gauge and to minimize recoil. An added feature is the overall capacity of five shells in the magazine and one in the chamber. The firing and chamber reloading cycle are tuned to optimize safe and reliable performance that gives the shooter quick response and positive handling for second and third shots.Designed for performance, an AL 48 semi-automatic shotgun operating system functions using only the bolt, barrel and spring. A completely mechanical system, it provides fast, positive response and years of reliability with little more than cleaning and routine maintenance."

There is a special pocket holster with the Viridian which allows the laser to turn on soon as the gun is removed from the holster....a very handy feature. The green laser can strobe or be on constant with simple touch of the on/off button. I have extra batteries for the laser as well.

You too will smile every time you fire this gun.  I will miss it, but when I came home with yet another new gun, she put her foot down and said to many. Of course if no one wants to buy it, then that's not my fault ;) I will include 6 or 10 misc rounds so you can go play with it immediately after purchase. The Hogue grip is not in the pic, I have to go dig it out of the safe..."

It is a Century international arms built maadi bull pup. They only made a very limited number of them. Most were built on the WASR this is the even more rare maadi build. Through weeks of research I have also found it has a real Romanian barrel not the US made barrel found on most AK variants today. I haven't shot the rifle much but the couple mags I have run thru it were accurate and the gun ran flawlessly. The only reason I'm trying to trade it is that I'm just not that crazy about bull pups. I picked this up to see how I liked it. It is more comfortable than I had expected but I'm just better versed with a standard configuration AK.
