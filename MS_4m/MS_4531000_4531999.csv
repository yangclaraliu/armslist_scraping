Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Heritage Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. 
Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Heritage Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR cartridge (and Heritage has .22 Magnum cylinders available for conversion), the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block safety lever mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action.  When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

I bought this wanting to make a SOHAH / FAST Helmet but I had the time or the money to do so. If you google CVC conversion or DH132 Conversion, or variest keywords you can see how it is done. I recommend using a OCC-Liner Kit either by the HK Air Soft Company FMA or getting the real deal Ops-Core one, but you can use a ACH/MICH . If you're a serious buyer I can send you links of what you'd need to do it, along with accessories like a ARC rail and VAS NVG Shroud.
