I, unfortunately, need the money. All German made, matching proof marks on barrel, slide and frame.

Gun holds 2 inch groups all day at 10 yards, and the recoil is very tame for a .45--less than my 1911 (which I'm also selling... check out my other listings).

Some minor holster wear near the muzzle and a minor ding on the end of barrel. Hardly noticeable, does not affect accuracy. Very little wear on the frame rails. I always lube with TW25b grease to protect the anodizing. Pistol has fed and fired flawlessly in my hands (about 600 rounds). And... it's DA/SA... because I think there are DAO versions of this out there.

Probably looking to do something this weekend, or sooner. NO TRADES, please.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."

Excellent Condition for 86 years old.
Nice original Blue finish 90% and Nice wood. This is a Take Down Rifle. This is quick to take apart and quick to put together. This is Made to Take apart and put into any small case.

 I fired this rifle today using a mix of Standard-velocity:  hollow point 22lr, Blunt tip Solid 22lr. I Mixed up Remington ammo, Winchester ammo, Aquila, and other off brand ammo 36 and 40 Grain. I fired 50 Rds with no jams, Misfires or any other issues. This rifle has not been shot very much at all.
Weaver Scope has March 1929 Manufacture date. Scope and rifle were bought new for my Friends Uncle in 1929. He was born in 1921. My kids are not into old Guns so here it is.
Not many were Manufactured in .22LR. Most were .22 short for Gallery Guns. Not Very many .22lr Bought during the Great depression.

I'm not interested in your above retail price for my wholesale price, if you found it cheaper then go trade your fantastic ar15, hk clone,  and your 600 dollar ak that you want 1500 for, and finally your 1000 gun that you put 400 in that actually devalued your gun even for this one, just because you really like it and so should I and take a 1500 loss. If you are a pawn star trader that think I am stupid don't waste our time.

Sorry for that but needed to be said. Here is my list.

Smith 952
Smith performance center
M1A will need two plain ones or a plain one plus other boot
Hk91 no clones unless two of them
Crate of mosin nagants
10 sks's
Arsenal milled ak's need at least two
Poly tech legend
Most revolvers
Most lever actions
223, 308 bolt actions
Scar 17
Uzi model A
Ps90 and FN 5.7
Will consider high end scopes as part of package, no a bushnel or Nikon is not high end
Nice 4 door truck or SUV
Tractor with front end loader
Rv or trailer 5th wheel

Don't want to part it out.
Have all factory parts. Has cardboard box i got from the dealer. Could throw in Glock box from my G27 if deal is right. Sights are a little over half life I'd say. Dim but can still pick them up in darker area. Used to be my carry piece before I put all the parts on it. I picked up a G27 which has become my daily carry. To be honest I've made this into a nice little target pistol that I have no use for. Stormlake barrel has standard rifling, and full case support. DPM spring kit makes it feel a lot like shooting a G17. Slide release makes it easy for people with stubby fingers like mine. I require that this be transferred over to you. I require you have  a CPL so you can make that happen. If it involves trade of another firearm, we each pay our own. If not, payment is your responsibility. That being said, shoot me an offer you think is fair. Worst I can say is no thank you."

Boyd's Tacticool Laminate Stock
Pillar/Glass Bedded w/Fully Floated Barrel
Bi-pod (Harris Clone)
20MOA Picatinny Base

After modification, the rifle was refinished in fluoroplastic, moisture/temperature/abrasion/adhesion resistant paint. Flat black on the metal bits, semi-flat OD green on the stock. I had intended to ""spider web"" the stock with flat black, but never got around to it. Looks good as it is.

This rifle was built to be an accurate sub-MOA bench rifle and light/mobile enough to be used for long distance hunting. It can perform both roles admirably.

No optics/rings are included at the asking price. It is not even fully broken in.

The legendary handling and quickness of the Model 70 Featherweight is justly famous among hunters everywhere.
 The Model 70 action offers Pre-’64 style Controlled Round Feeding, a Three-Position Safety and is highlighted by
 a jeweled bolt body with knurled bolt handle. Inside is the M.O.A. Trigger System, the finest trigger ever offered 
in a bolt-action with zero take up, zero creep and zero overtravel. Like the original Featherweight, the angled 
comb Grade I walnut stock still features the Schnabel fore-end and satin finish with elegant cut checkering.

This is a great all around ammo. It's re-manufactured ammo. It's quiet through a silencer because it doesn't break the sound barrier (subsonic). It's 131 power factor through a 4.25"" barrel so its legal to use in USPSA, IDPA, and three gun matches. This is not self defense ammo. This is for shooters who like to shoot. it's low recoil and is very accurate. Several years ago I was one of the scared ones who thought the ammo shortage was going to last forever so I purchased more than I needed. I would like to sell some off and get some of my investment back. I have very large quantity of this fantastic stuff. 
Here are the specs 
•	147 gn TMJ bullet
•	Subsonic

Great price with ammo.
I bought this for my girl friend to shoot and she was not interested after one range visit.  Just not a gun person.  It is just too small for my hand so it has to go.  I got extra add on grips for it for her and polished the barrel.  It has about 100 rounds through it.  One range visit.  I also bought two extra mags and added the extra length for 8 rounds.  So 4 mags all together.  
It also has a ghost connector and an extra stainless recoil spring.  
Not shown is a leather holster for iwb.   Winchester white box ammo along with 50 plus 4 mags of precision on HP ammo that is designed for the glock as it is a bit faster than thier normal hp 380 ammo.
Wih shipping the precision one ammo was 40 a box and the winchester 150 rounds is over 60.  Not sure exactly.  But the whole gun and ammo is 375.  Cash only.  No trades so please do not offer.

I bought it last year in the beginning of November, they usually go for around 360. The rifle has had about 500 rounds through it, it shoots pretty good. To break it in and for plinking I’ve been shooting Wolf Gold, which groups pretty good for cheap ammo at about 1.5 inches. HPR ammo with 55 gr. VMAX bullets shoots at about 1 inch. 24 grains of IMR 4198 with a 55 gr Sierra varminter bullet was really good; I shot one group at about a half inch but honestly I’ve never been able to replicate that with those bullets. It really likes the 53 grain VMAX. 
So the gun shoots really well. I put a Nikon 3-9×40 scope with the BDC reticle, the scope came off of a Savage Trophy Hunter XP.  The scope with the rings is worth about 150.
I glass bedded the action and the fore end of the stock to stiffen it up. It made it a little heavier but it shoots better. The X7 or XS7 is is a good gun, they basically just combined all the popular parts from all the guns into this one (Rem 700 safety, Win 70 bases and bold release, Savage trigger and barrel nut).
I'm selling this gun because I don't really shoot it much but I still like it so I'm firm on the price.

Up for sale I have (100) rounds of brand new match grade .50 BMG ammo, originally from 50 BMG Supply.  Only selling because, with a one year old, I cannot get the amount of shooting done as I used to, and I wanted to share the wealth.  I am asking $600, and the buyer will have the option to purchase up to 60 more rounds @ $5/ea.

Ammo is new brass with CNC machined 750 grain brass projectiles, with 1.07 ballistic coefficient (G7 drag function), and is capable of 1/2 MOA.  I have ballistic tables posted below, as well.  Please note, this ammo is optimized for single shot bolt guns, and is slightly longer than standard ball, so it will likely not fit in a magazine--might fit in DTA HTI mags, but I cannot verify.  Just maintaining transparency.

I will provide an excellent-condition ammo can and an unloaded projectile with sale, and am willing to either meet a buyer at a reasonable location, or deliver directly to your home/neutral location if reasonably close--I am in Layton (84041).  Prefer not to entertain shipping, but will consider for a serious buyer; buyer pays all shipping costs--100 rounds weights approx 30 lbs.  No trade offers please, prefer either Paypal 'gift' or cash face to face.  Please contact me (Art) at REDACTED or REDACTED with any questions or further info.  Many thanks, once again, for your time.  -Art"
