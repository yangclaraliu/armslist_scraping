German k 98 early Byf high turret sniper rifle . Gun was veteran estate find, all numbers match on the rifle, serial number matching parts include : stock , receiver, bolt parts , firing pin, floor plate. Butt pad is unmarked , along with front barrel bands. All patina and parts look to match except scope. I believe the scope to be a post war dialyton , along with the rings on the scope . It is my guess these were added sometime after the war , but I could be wrong. Bore is shiny and in great shape , gun is a tack driver. Furniture is in excellent shape except for a few dings from storage or perhaps from sling. The mounts show patina and wear that matches the rifle well. Mounts look to be soldered onto rifle. Overall this is an excellent real example of a German sniper rifle. The winner will receive name of the veteran and town where rifle was picked up. Thanks"

The barrel is a low profile lightweight 16.1” barrel threaded 5/8-24TPI with a 5R 1:7"" twist. The rifle accurately sends rounds down range whether feeding it heavy subsonic or high performance hunting ammunition. The phosphate steel action and barrel are complimented by the compact, lightweight super tough glass polymer filled black stock. All models are equipped with the H&R transfer bar system that makes the Handi-Rifle one the safest single shot platforms available today."

104,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4260104,Want To Buy:  Plenty of Extra Items for Sale for AR-15/Glock/Ruger,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, August 27, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello Everyone, 

I have a bunch of gun stuff that I need to get rid of. It's just sitting in my house in a box and I don't ever use any of it, however it's some pretty cool stuff. I am a recently discharged Veteran (Captain O-3) so all my things are well taken care of. I am just looking to sell it and get rid of it, and use the money for something else. 

To make this easy, I will just make a list of what I have that maybe you guys out there might want. So here we go: 

1. 1 Bushmaster A2 Upper- Rifle Length with Quad Rails installed. It is a fully completed upper with charging handle, magnesium phosphate bolt carrier group. Barrel is actually an HBAR 1:9 Twist with no threads for muzzle brake, 4140 chrome vanadium lined, with an A-Frame, so it is super accurate. You can mount a scope on the handle which I have done in the past, but I don't need it anymore. This barrel has seen about 700 rounds down the pipe which is break-in for HBAR's. For this complete upper receiver, I am looking for around $600 or trade me with a gun safe, not a crappy 100 pound safe, I'm talking something that is at least 400-500lbs. 

2. Various Magpul Stuff: 
2a. MOE Grip in FDE for AR-15 platform- Brand New
3a. MOE Mid-Length Hand Guard for AR-15 platform in Black- This is new and has never been used. 
3c. MOE CTR Mil-Spec adjustable stock in FDE. This one doesn't have the clamp to lock it in place. 
3d. Grips- I have a few unused mil-spec grips as well as A-2 birdcage flash hiders that you might want.

4. I have about 6 rounds of 270 Winchester Black Tip Ammo, 10 rounds of 44-40 Win HP rounds and some 20 gauge Bird Shot, maybe 30-35 rounds, but I don't even have my 20 gauge here with me, so it's pretty useless. 

5. I have an original fixed stock for an A2 AR-15, buffer tube and buffer spring. I have some stuff for the Remington 870, pistol grip stock, regular stock that I don't ever plan to use again. 

6. I have a .357 revolver made by Ruger, SP101, 2 3/4"" stainless steel. I have some Ammo for that gun also, maybe 300 rounds of .357 of which 50 are JHP, 70 rounds of .38 special- looking for about $675 for it just because it's in amazing condition. Comes with Hogue Grip which makes a huge upgrade in my opinion because the original grip is not that great. 

7. On one of my AR-15's I have a 12.5"" Seekins Keymod 2 Handguard in FDE. I don't want that on my gun anymore. It's a great Handguard being that it's light and everything, but I want something else. Something shorter, something different, quad-rails are okay but I have seen some sweet ass keymods that are 8""-9"" and that is the longest I would want to go. Please keep in mind that this particular gun has a Mid-Length low profile gas block which will must be covered up if you are looking to trade me your handguard or whatever. Also, these are fairly pricy for a KeyMod, roughly about $225-$250 so just keep that in mind. I don't want someones heavy ass quad rail that they got off amazon for $45.00 that will just fall apart. No offense, but there is a reason I only have a few guns. One, because I am not rich by any means. Secondly, I like to put the best stuff on my rifles ALL THE TIME. You will not see any cheap shit on my guns, so please keep that in mind. Sorry, I don't mean to be a dick... 

I could pretty much type all night of what I have, so if there is something that you are looking for, just email me, I can usually answer my phone, but just in case, send me a text with what you are looking for and chances are I might have it. I do have a lot of stock Glock Parts for the Glock 22 such as the OEM Barrel with only 50 rounds through it. I have a ton of small springs, detents, and just all kinds of Mil-Spec parts for the AR-15 platform. 

Lastly, 

I have a ton of AMMO!!! I have cases or 9mm JHP 115gr, reloads, expensive ammo, all kinds of calibers, tons of .223/5.56 NATO. Let me know what caliber you are looking for and the amount you are looking to spend and and I will see what I can do for you. There's no way that I can capture all of it with a photo. If you are interested, just send me an email 
Thanks for looking,

I'd like to trade these for the Glock equivalents if possible.  Looking primarily for a Glock 19 or 17 and a Glock 27.  Would consider a 22/23 and a 26 as well, or a 17/19 and a 26.  One of them must be a 9mm though, not looking for two .40's, but both can be 9mm's.  Might also consider other quality handguns for the mid or full size gun but must be in 9mm or .40 and I would still like the subcompact to be a Glock 26/27.

What can you do?

Gun is assembled but never lubed or fired.

Parts list are as follows:

Lower:
Anderson Lower
Anderson parts kit
Generic no-name Stock Kit
Hexmag 30-round Magazine

Upper:
Anderson Blemished upper .223/5.56
SMI .223/5.56 BCG Black Nitride
Anderson 16"" M4 .223/5.56 Carbine Length Barrel 1-8 Twist
Ground Zero Precision Steel Gas Block , gas tube, and flash hider
Generic Red Dot
TacVector Optics Free Float Rail

Also included are 10 inert .223 training/testing rounds, trigger lock (2nd key not picture but floating around the house somewhere) and some stickers (A real deal breaker, I know).

Issues to note:

During my installation, I damaged the finish in several spots: small mark on lower receiver while installing roll pin, scratching on birdcage flash hider, scratching on stock castle nut, scratching/dents on aluminum free float barrel nut, and lastly I mangled the gas block roll pin.

I had a tough time mounting the red dot to the hand guard and ended up just putting it on the upper receiver. I don't know if this is because of a cheap red dot or a cheap hand guard.

Do not get me wrong, it is a tack driver with a good scope, I just flinch like a sissy when the thing goes off. The recoil is a lot more than I expected. Compared to the .308 I own, this one is amazing where recoil is concerned. 

It has the lightning trigger, which in my opinion has no peer. It is adjustable, you can add more weight to the pull or lessen it. Right now, it's feather light and out of the box it was perfect for me. It is one of those rifles you'll enjoy shooting. I simply can't afford to take it to the range as much as I'd like.

I have put about 40 rounds through it, and have a box of Privi Partisan 150 grain to go with it. It is like new in box, as shown. I had a scope on it, but took it off as I think people have their own preferences as to what scopes they like, and the one I had was a cheap one anyway. 

I paid $400.00 plus tax for it. It's like new, in box with all the stickers and everything. It would be an excellent hunting rifle. Especially if you are hunting larger game, like dinosaurs, or hostile aliens from another planet. I figured if I got my time machine up and running, I would head back to the pleistocene era to take down a sabretooth tiger, or a direwolf. I could head back further to the Cretaceous period and maybe take down a Tyrannosaurus. I have always wondered what what a Triceratops would taste like. 

The upside to owning a time machine would be the hunting. I worry I may have already gone back, as it seems nobody knows how to use the words There, Their and They're. I need money to fund my time machine construction so I can not only go back in time and hunt, but to go back in time to undo what my future self may have done to screw up everyone's spelling. 

If I can stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president, I'll fix that too. Just saying. I can see a connection to stupid people who can't spell, and a Hillary Presidency. Tell me I'm wrong. Anyway, $300.00 will help me move forward with my time machine. In exchange, you get the rifle, ammunition, and the bragging rights to meeting a time traveler who is stranded here."

Only trading/selling because I have a couple other mid size short barrel 38s I have more of a sentimental attachment to and want something else to change things up. Transfer on EFA10 or at a FFL.

Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades.

It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines it can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment. Chambered in .25 ACP, the Bobcat is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design. 

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

Keeping an eye on uncompromising quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics ahead of the pack. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize a tough forging process for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock and frames from solid aluminum forgings. Beretta employs the finest and toughest metals, making it exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable. MSRP: $410

Has original plastic grips in very good condition with no cracks.  Gun has a decocker.  This thing sounds like a 357 when you fire it.  The rounds are going around 1600 fps muzzle velocity. It makes a great fireball too.

I researched all the markings and came up with the following: the phosphate instead of blued finish indicates it wasn't a refurbished pistol. The crossed swords and number 53 indicate it is Czech Army and made in 53, the ""rid"" also incidates it was army production, not civilian.  The circled T on the barrel inside the chamber indicates it passed military inspection for safety and the de-cocker passed.  The various other marks are for the workers who might have assembled it and the circled vot or vor is probably the plant that did any refinishing or work on it before it was sent back out into the world.

There are no import marks that I can find. They should be on the bottom of the frame between the trigger guard and the end of the barrel. Oh well, it is simply a very nice looking and shooting pistol.  Kinda looks like what the desert eagle might have been imagined to look like in the 50's for some sci-fi movie.

It comes with the factory case, two magazines and the factory barrel nut removal tool. It has had the feed ramp polished and the hammer reprofiled to overcome issues relating to failures to feed/eject bulk ammo (the 500 count bricks you find at Wally World). It has also been back to Walther fairly recently for inspection and had the extractor replaced and other components adjusted at that time.

Its a fun little gun, but too short of a sight radius for accurate 25-50yd target shooting, which is what I'm mostly interested in at this point in time. Very fun out to 15 yards. Threaded for a suppressor (1/2-28) if you're interested in that.

Prefer in person sale/trade to NH concealed carry permit holders. Otherwise, buyer will be responsible for arranging for a FFL to handle the transfer and will be responsible for all costs relating to the FFL's services.

I would love to trade this gun for a Ruger MkIII or similar .22LR target-firearm in good condition, age doesn't really matter to me.

From Sig Website: 
The P220® Carry Elite is an 8+1 capacity carry-sized pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

It only has about 200 rounds through it and has many upgrades:
 -Timney 3lb competition trigger (very smooth and made my groups very small)- worth $230
 -Nikon monarch 4-16x scope specifically calibrated to the .223 / 5.56 round and Leupold single piece mount - worth $600
 -Bipod - $45
 -Foregrip - $25
 - Laser/light combo - $70

 - Magpul adjustable stock - $45
 - rubber pistol grip - $15
 - Aftermarket sling and sling mounts -$50
 -Also, rifle comes with nice a blackhawk soft carry case- $40
 As you can see, there is over $1200 dollars worth of upgrades on this rifle. Also, this model of AR-15 is not the crappy ""sport"" model offered by S&W. This is a step above that with a better barrel, dust cover and bolt carrier group. It was $1060 brand new. I'm also going to throw in 800 rounds of ammo for free, which is worth an additional $300. So, you're getting almost $2600 dollars worth of stuff for $1600. 
I would be willing to sell the scope and rifle separately, I would take 1100 for the rifle and I'll still throw in the free ammo. The price is negotiable, but please keep the ridiculous low balls to yourself. Please feel free to call or text anytime, day or night: 586 354 7597."

Holster #1: Safariland Leather Paddle Holster (Right Hand). Fits Beretta 92/M9 Color: Plain Black $30

Traditional leather has been the mainstay of the law enforcement community for decades. The SafariLaminate™ process allows us to offer an extremely durable product that is easy to maintain. The classic semi-gloss Plain Black finish offers a leather-like grain texture and is widely popular among police officers and departments. Like new condition.

Holster #2: Bladetech Black Kydex IWB Holster (Left Hand). Model UCH, (Ultimate Concealment Holster), Fits Beretta 92/M9. Brand New in Wrapper. Color: Black $30

With an injection molded loop, this Ultimate Concealment Holster is an inside the waistband ""tuckable"" holster, allowing the user to completely conceal the firearm. IDPA approved and fits belts up to 2"" wide. Notes:

-This is an inside the waistband holster with a loop for a belt of up to 2"" width.
-Holster is adjustable for FBI cant (muzzle slightly rear) or straight drop.

The design of the holster and the belt loop allows the holster to fit inside the pant wastband and the belt loop attachment goes up over the belt, leaving a space between the attachment and the holster body. This is done so that the shirt can be tucked in over the firearm and holster to conceal them beneath the shirt. What remains visible is a black kydex band on the belt.

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.
 
The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity (10+1 in .40 S&W) and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The ‘B’ designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.
 
CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

GUN TRUSTS,"Tarpon Springs, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 219,"Listed On: Saturday, January 16, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Are you thinking of buying a gun suppressor, silencer, fully automatic rifle, short barreled rifle (SBRs) or other Title 2, or Class 3 weapon? If so, I am an attorney in good standing with the Florida Bar, with over 22 years of legal experience, and a Federal Firearms License holder (F.F.L.). I will personally draft and customize your N.F.A.firearms trust for purchasing such Class 3 items. A Gun Trust is a revocable trust, which you may revoke, or amend whenever you wish. No additional charge for up to an hour in-office, or telephone, consultation. As I will not simply be inserting names into a template, the usual turnaround time for completion is four (4) business days.  If circumstances require, for no additional charge, I probably would be able expedite the process to as little as 24 hrs.   Owners of Class 3 items should avoid relying on boilerplate forms, trust software, or trusts that are not drafted by an attorney, because they may not comply with the unique issues involving suppressors, silencers, fully automatic rifles, SBRs, and other Title 2, or Class 3 weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA). A N.F.A.Trust will allow you to: avoid Chief Law Enforcement officer sign offs; Avoid having to get finger printed; Avoid having to get photographs taken; Have the capability to file electronically; Allow more than 1 person to LEGALLY take possession and use your N.F.A.devices;and Streamline inheritance, and passing down of firearms to future generations. The majority of Gun Trusts are prepared for a total price of $219.00. Sure you can probably find an online $29.99 form, but having a trained chimp lawyer wannabee prepare your N.F.A. Gun Trust, if done improperly, can result in your firearms being confiscated by the ATF, a $250,000.00 fine, and your potential exposure to felony violations of the National Firearms Act. “Intent” is not a requirement for being convicted of a violation under the National Firearms Act. Contact Elliot Goldstein, Esq./J.& G.
