It has TRU-GLO night sights that were recently added, rear sight lost some paint in the process (I assume, like that when I got it). It also has an extended slide-release lever and an extended take-down lever (I have an extended mag-release, will include that and all original parts except sights). Don't have the original case/accessories/ paperwork, but I do have a new PLANO lockable hard case. Comes with one 9-rd. magazine with PEARCE extended base (original base included) and one 13-rd. magazine with X-GRIP sleeve (PUNISHER logo). I will also include a new BLACKHAWK SERPA paddle holster. Asking $425, seems fair, but will reply to all reasonable offers. I live in Garland, but I'm willing to meet within a reasonable distance. Please be prepared to show a picture ID (DL or CHL)."

The gun has about 500 rounds through it at this point but is still in excellent condition. Cash is king, but I will entertain trade offers. Primarily I am interested in an M&P Shield in 9mm, a Springfield XD-S 9mm, or a Sig P320 Fullsize in 9mm. I am located in Newport News.

Buyers must be 21 years of age or older and must be willing to sign a bill of sale. Buyers are also required to have a valid Virginia Driver’s License and a CCW or a Voter Registration Card to demonstrate that you are not a felon. For active duty military, I will not need a Virginia Driver's License, but I will need to see your Military ID and a copy of your orders showing that you are stationed in Virginia on PCS orders."

I bought a rifle from Guns N Ammo in LA for my son's birthday. BEFORE I purchased and made my order I called to make sure it would be shipped in time to receive it on or before his birthday. This was on a Wed. I was told it would ship either Thurs., Fri the latest. I was given a tracking number and told it was shipped on Sat. by monday the tracking number was dead so I called. The rifle still had not been shipped. They then proceeded to charge me an additional $20 in order to ship it that day, 5 days after I had ordered and paid for it! When I received it the stock was cracked. This did not happen during shipping, the box it was shipped in was in mint condition. They never checked it before shipping and shipped me and unsafe and damaged gun.
When I contacted them I was told that I would have to deal with the manufacturer. I was understandably upset at being sent a broken gun after being milked for an additional $20 because they failed to ship it on time like they said they would. When I called them out on it the owner Nicholas Christian sent me an email stating that ""Well I did order a another Rossi that I was going to remove the stock and send to you. We are gonna cancel that now."" Mind you I was firm in calling them out on ripping me off (not once but twice in this one transaction"" but I never was insulting or swore (which was very difficult to control my temper after being being ripped off for over $500 and having my kid's birthday ruined)

German framed SIG P220R w/ night sights, four (4) magazines, ammo, holsters, etc.
It is a used weapon, (I bought it used) it has a few nicks here and there (not from me), but otherwise is in good shape, the nicks require a close inspection.
I purchased the new SIG spring kit, and I have already installed the new recoil spring. Since purchase on 12/27/2014, I have put only 100rds through it.

If you are not interested in the extras listed below, the basic package would consist of pistol w/ factory SIG Blue box, papers, etc., (4) mags, night sights.
Eligible extras:
- New AmeriGlo NS (plain rear, tritium front with yellow outline) installed 1/7/15.
- Four (4) magazines, two of them are the factory supplied magazines, and the other two are the OEM ACT brand (no ProMag garbage)
- Tucker & Byrd RH-OWB leather holster (purchased 12/27/2014)
- Bravo Concealment RH-OWB kydex holster (purchased 1/5/2014)
- Safariland ALS paddle holster (brand new, never carried/used) coyote brown
- Two (2) Safariland horizontal carry magazine pouches (brand new, never carried/used)
- Factory case
- 50rd box of Freedom Munitions range ammo
- Two (2) 20rd boxes of Hornady Critical Duty 220gr+p
Here is what I am looking for:
- Vicker’s G17/19
- RTF2 w/ gills
- All FDE, FDE/OD framed G17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23
- G21/30 (prefer Gen4, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at a SF)
- Any interesting Glocks that have visual appeal (cerakoted, etc.)

I am not against stippling (I have two stippled Glocks myself); however, I am not interested in trading for a stippled Glock because I plan on shooting GSSF with this one (along with the others), and I do not want to limit the divisions in which I can compete with it. The same goes for any aftermarket parts, unless it is Glock OE, I am not interested.

Let me know what kind of trade you are interested in (just basic package, some extras, etc).

Feel free to make a cash offer.

I bought a rifle from Guns N Ammo in LA for my son's birthday. BEFORE I purchased and made my order I called to make sure it would be shipped in time to receive it on or before his birthday. This was on a Wed. I was told it would ship either Thurs., Fri the latest. I was given a tracking number and told it was shipped on Sat. by monday the tracking number was dead so I called. The rifle still had not been shipped. They then proceeded to charge me an additional $20 in order to ship it that day, 5 days after I had ordered and paid for it! When I received it the stock was cracked. This did not happen during shipping, the box it was shipped in was in mint condition. They never checked it before shipping and shipped me and unsafe and damaged gun.
When I contacted them I was told that I would have to deal with the manufacturer. I was understandably upset at being sent a broken gun after being milked for an additional $20 because they failed to ship it on time like they said they would. When I called them out on it the owner Nicholas Christian sent me an email stating that ""Well I did order a another Rossi that I was going to remove the stock and send to you. We are gonna cancel that now."" Mind you I was firm in calling them out on ripping me off (not once but twice in this one transaction"" but I never was insulting or swore (which was very difficult to control my temper after being being ripped off for over $500 and having my kid's birthday ruined)

Both have been used and do have scratches and are not NIB.

The Mark II bull barrel is a nice pistol with Pachmyr grips. It has adjustable sights and shoots very good. I shot these yesterday.
The Other Pistol ( Mark III) Had an issue when I shot it yesterday. The second round would not fire and the trigger felt weird. After clearing the round the next one fired fine and then it happened again.
I came home and watched some Internet stuff and found the disconnector was slightly bent. Basically it was hanging up on the frame instead of operating freely. I fixed it and it seems to cycle fine on the bench. I have not taken it to the range but I am pretty sure I fixed the issue.
Either way, this is a great deal for Two used Ruger pistols.

I have the box and original grips for the Mark III as well as the paperwork that came in the box.

No box for the Mark II.

This scope has (2) different adjustable turrets, used to dial in your long yardage (200+ yard) shots for your 223, or 308.  It also has turret adjustable windage.  It has very clear glass, great light gathering capabilities and for the money, I don't think there is a better scope out on the market today, especially for an AR.  I bought two of them and have one on my coyote hunting AR right now.  I have shot my AR mounted Battlezone scope out to 300 yards with exceptional accuracy.  I was saving this one for another AR build, but now I'm not going to be building another AR for a while, so I will just sell this scope.  Go read the reviews on it.  Way better reviews than the adjustable turret Nikon 223 scopes get and this one costs a lot less.

I believe it to be an Alexander Arms barrel, but it has no markings I can find. Its barrel extension has three damaged lugs (as shown in the picture) and should not be used without replacing the barrel extension -- but it's a huge bargain if you are up to that task. Aside from that damage, it is in great shape, has had a few hundred rounds through it, but the bore, chamber and muzzle are in great shape, ready for duty. As shown, the muzzle is threaded 49/64-20 (also known as 0.765-20), which is the standard thread for this caliber. It includes the barrel nut, front handguard cap, and railed gas block with sling swivel. I do also have the rear delta ring setup and a railed handguard from this barrel if needed.

FYI, the barrel extension needed for .50 Beowulf is the same as any other barrel extension, so it's readily available as a part, but the feed ramp area has been machined a little to suit the large cartridge -- probably less than an hour's work with a Dremel or similar tool -- and of course you'd have the factory original part currently attached to the barrel as a guide to work from.

It appears to be in original condition. Barrel and bolt match. The old bolt number has not been scrubbed and has the traditional Finn matching number stamped on bolt knob. There is strong and shiny rifling throughout the bore. The barrel is not ""D"" stamped and should be considered .3085 in diameter. The last two digits of the butt plate match the barrel which indicates the stock is original to the rifle. It incorporates the ""jamb free"" HV  magazine which does not have any indication of previous numbers stamped, lined out or scrubbed. This rifle sits in a well worn one piece Russian stock. It has a couple of arsenal repairs and some minor bumps and bruises that are shown in the photos. The handguard has a fine crack about one-third it's length as shown in photos. The blueing is a nice patina and I would rate as 60-65 %. The band screws tighten as they should and are not stripped out. This rifle has shims in the bedding area and the barrel sleeve which is typical for a 28/30.

I am interested in selling my Glock 30 SF .45 ACP. I purchased this gun to use as my off duty weapon. I have shot it through two qualification courses only so the weapon only has 200 rounds total through it. I had the grip custom stippled as well which does wonders for sweaty hands. The trigger guard was also undercut which allows a very high grip on the gun. You can literally cover your hands in dish soap and this will not even think about leaving your hands. I also have several accessories going with it. It includes everything needed for duty/off-duty/range use. All items included are as follows with the prices that I paid for them:

Glock 30 SF - $545.00
Extra flush fitting glock 30 9 rd magazine - $24.99
2 Glock 30 SF magazine grip extensions - $19.90
Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights - $86.99
Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster - $24.99
Desantis Tuck This II inside the waistband holster w/ attached magazine pouch - $28.49
Convertible inside the waistband/outside the waistband light bearing holster made by Statureman Custom Holsters - $104.98
Original Soe Gear 1.5"" Rigged Cobra Duty Belt w/ velcro liner (best belts money can buy) - $70.00
Total spent - $905.34

My only reason for selling this is that I currently carry a Glock 19 off duty and this has since become a safe queen. I figure I would sell it and use the money to finish one of my Ar projects. This is practically NIB. I am asking $500.00 FIRM. As I am sure you know, you must have a valid New Jersey Handgun Purchasers Permit. Any additional questions about this gun please contact me. Thanks...

The Target Man, LLC has spent countless hours and research on developing effective fragmentation/spall protection for our AR500 Spartan Armor steel trauma plates. We have tested various types of bedliners, kevlar sleeves, and plastic coatings and have found our best fit. We are pleased to now be offering Rhino Lined coated plates. The Rhino coating, combined with our non-traditional primer (standard primers don’t work well), has proven extremely effective in containing the fragmentation and spalling during our testing.
These Plates are 10X12
Single curve
Weight 8.5 lbs ea.
They are rated at NIJ Level 3
(High-powered rifle). This armor, normally of hard or semirigid construction, protects against 7.62mm full-metal jacketed bullets (US military designation M80) with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr.) impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s (2,750 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56mm FMJ), 30 Carbine FMJ, and 12-gauge rifled slug, as well as Level I through IIIA threats. Level III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection, such as barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles.

I'd like to sell them all, to fund new guns. I'm not really interested in trading, but shoot your trades anyway, I'm a sucker for cool guns. Only firearms though.

RIFLES
1.Mossberg 715 t in black, in 22lr, with a bushnell 3x9 scope, a red or green dot sight, a foregrip, a laser pointer and a flashlight wired to the foregrip, two 25 round magazines, and a sling. Its zeroed at 150, and is a tack driver at 150. 450
2. Hi-point 995 in stainless, in 9mm, with 4 extended (15) round mags and 2 factory mags and a sling 350 SOLD
3. I just came into owning a Smith & Wesson m&p 15-22 in new condition, with the papers and lock/keys. Asking 400
SHOTGUNS
1.Ithaca Model 37 Featherlight pump action, in 16 gauge, holds 4+1, ejects out the bottom, original orange sight,  manufactured in 1956, with slight fading of the bluing, but it was rarely shot and is in spectacular condition internally, and good condition externally and everything works like a dream. This is a rare safe queen, but still a great hunting/fun gun for kids/women/men. 300 obo SOLD
PISTOLS
1. H&R model 676 convertible 22lr/22mag made in 1978, with a twelve inch barrel. I just don't have the 22lr cylinder. This is a true collectors item as they just don't make them like this anymore. The bluing is unique and is made that way from the factory. The rifling and bluing and all mechanisms are in spectacular condition especially thanks to it never being shot by the last owner, ever. He didn't even know it was a 22mag, and not 22lr. This is super rare and super fun. You could bird hunt if you liked or drive 75 yard tacks all day from what I've been told. For this one, with no 22lr cylinder, I'd take 300 obo. SOLD

2. Smith & Wesson m&p 22, in 22lr. Its in fantastic shape and is light as a cloud. It comes in the box with the original papers, and tools, and a 12 round mag. 500 obo (being held)

3. Taurus Tracker in 22lr, in stainless steel, with a 7 shot cylinder, and a brand new Hogue grip and a nice leather holster and the safety key to lockup the gun, and a copy of.the breakdown diagram 550 obo (being held)

4.Taurus Tracker in 22lr/22mag, in black, with both a 9 round 22lr cylinder, and a 9 round 22 mag cylinder, Hogue grip, in pristine shape, with the original box, and all the original paper work and safety key to lock up the gun. 700 obo

5. I just came into owning a Taurus judge, in like new condition,  capable of 2 3/4"" .410/45LC, with a full barrel! Asking 650 with the extras I have for it


Mostly looking to sell, may be open to trades. 

Id take 1700 for everything remaining, that isn't being held, and is in the picture. 
Including the judge and m&p 15-22, id take 2650

And she was not happy.  This is Russian gray wolf. I brought this back a few years ago 1999 if I remember right , and don't know if customs overlooked it or just didn't care. It is hand made actual gray wolf, with a French lining inside.  I watched them make it. In the eastern part of Russia  100% real gray wolf. Not worn other than when I first showed my mom, and now for pictures.   I am not sure if this is legal in all 50 states and frankly don't care.  If you go to these mountain man retreats or just want to wear it around town to piss off your wife..you need this.  It is so cool.    But I need a Smith model 60 so listing it. There are no tags, no nothing other than French lining. And the old gals who made this had several bolts of French and German cloth for that.  If you where it in the rain I am not sure it wont smell like wet dog, but you will be the envy of your friends. Especially if you get it for a good price,   I think 800 is crazy. but that's what I have seen them go for.

It has a mossy oak 3M camo wrap on it but this can be easily removed to revert to black synthetic stock if you want to and won't leave any funky residue. I personally liked it way more than the generic black stock and used the gun for turkey hunting so i wanted it to be camo.

 This is a two bladed folding knife and is in great shape. The lettering on the knife if real nice and full. If you wish to have this knife sharp...it will need to be sharpened. I am not too sure of the date but most can judge from the printing on the knife handle. 
he knife handle reads ""Loyal Order KKK"" and has a ""Hooded-like Figure on the handle as well. I personally disagree with the words etc on it but this knife is VERY COLLECTABLE and RARE from what I have been told by numerous rare knife dealers. I figure even tho it may be offensive/distasteful it is collectable and there are many out there that may wish to own this knife even tho it ma be offensive to some....even if its offensive to themselves. But it is a rare and collectable knife and I honestly do NOT feel you have to have those specific feelings in order for it to be ok to own the knife...I don't agree with that kind of thinking whatsoever but I still own the knife and feel just fine owning it. Definitely a knife to add to a serious collector's collection...or really for anybody's collection.  I am willing to ship. If that is the case it will be shipped USPS with Signature Confirmation and payment would be made to me via PayPal Gift for $70.00/$65.00 in person. Any offers, please dont hesitate!!

Tikka 695 in 338 Winchester Magnum with factory synthetic stock. Gun is in excellent condition with only the lightest of blemishes on the metal or stock. Barrel is what I believe to be truly Magna-Ported with four trapezoidal cuts near the end of the barrel. I have shot this gun a time or two and it will consistently shoot 1 1/2"" groups or better with the cheaper Winchester 200 grain ammo I used. I suspect with a little time and experimentation that could be beat. Recoil is stout but due to quality factory stock and porting it is manageable.

It is 48""W x 28""L x 7""H, and has bars mounted on the bottom of the vault to raise it up over the lip of the rear cargo area. I could fit this vault and the kennel for my Belgian Malinois with no trouble. This requires NO DRILLING in your vehicle. . .the 2 mounting bolts go in the same holes as the tie-down brackets closest to the rear door in your Tahoe (you can mount in any appropriate vehicle, but I have experience with this in a Tahoe).

To make sure you're getting a steal on this, check out the website below. This vault retails for $699 plus tax and shipping. This is a no-brainer.

When I bought this SKS it had an after-market receiver cover scope mount on it so the receiver cover does not match.  There are no serial numbers on the gas tube or piston.  The serial number is stamped horizontally on the butt of the rifle and on the hand guard.  In front of the serial number is what appears to be the upper part of a triangle stamped into the metal but no number 1 is visible. The horizontal numbers and triangle with a 1 were thought to be indicators that the SKS was leased by the USSR to the former Democratic Republic of East Germany.  This SKS was imported by KBI and has a second serial number etched into the receiver.  Looks like original varnish has shrunk and been rubbed off in places."

One owner gun, and a real safe queen, never carried or abused. Only shot at indoor ranges. This was the first firearm I ever owned and I treated it as such, she really got babied. Cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range, always kept in the padded box, etc. She looks as good as the day I bought her brand new.

The only reason I'm selling is because I'm moving from being a casual shooter to wanting to a CCW and I'm partial to the Glock .40, but the G22 is just too big for concealed carry. I need to sell this to get the funds I need to buy a new G27 baby Glock.

I went to Gander Mountain today to check out their selection of used Glocks and man, are they beat to hell - and they're still asking $375-$475 for them! If you want a Glock that looks and shoots like it's brand new, this is the gun for you. 

This G22 comes with the Glock foam-lined hard case and two mags, 2 (two) standard 15-round mags and one 10-round mag. The reason for the 10 rounder is because I lived awhile in California and couldn't legally use the gun in a case of home defense if it had a 15-round mag in it. But if you do a lot of travelling, it's nice to have the 10-rounder for those times you cross into Nazi states like New York (or California).

I took some really nice close-up pictures but Armslist says they're too big to upload with the ad. If you want pictures, just email me and I will send them to you. 

This will be a legal sale at an FFL dealer to do a proper background check and transfer of ownership. Emails containing requests for anything other than a legal sale will be ignored and reported."
