I purchased it from a family member and it's only been between the two of us in the last two years. It's in great condition for its age and how much it's been used. There's been approximately 2500 rounds through it, but it still operates perfectly fine. I clean it after every shooting and usually do a 100% disassembly when doing so. 
I've added a recoil buffer and replaced the stock buffer spring with a metal buffer spring. Inluded accessories are three 17-round magazines, one 31-round magazine, a glock speedloader, safety snap caps for storage and practice, a cheap outside-the-waistband holster, and a good AlienGear inside-the-waistband holster designed for concealed carry. I stil have all the hardware required to adjust the holster as well as the original package.

The reason I'm selling this handgun is because I don't have the time or money to go shooting with it as much as I'd like and I could use the cash right now. It's been a good, fun gun to shoot but I think it can find a better home.

Asking $450 OBO with all accessories included. Only selling to those who are 18+ with either a valid ID and backround check or a valid CCW permit. Either you can provide the backround check or I'll do it and add that to the price I'm asking. Thanks for looking and contact me for more info or questions you may have."

93,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4764093,For Sale:  All Matching Swiss Vetterli M78 A BEAUTY! + Rod 13 Shot Repeater,"Davie--Central, Broward, South Florida",$ 285,"Listed On: Saturday, October 10, 2015",Antique,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This listing is for one of the lowest priced and finest looking Vetterli M78s I have seen in a long while. For those new to this rifle, these fire a .41 rimfire round that is all but impossible to find. So right up front, you will likely not be shooting this one unless you get lucky and find 1 or 2 rounds as they are sold that way (and for a LOT). If you know what this rifle is though, you probably already know a lot about it and realize its collector appeal. Many owners have converted the rifle to fire a centerfire version of the cartridge that you can reload BUT it involves permanent changes to the bolt so many used extra bolts. This means that a pretty rare rifle has become even rarer in original condition as many have been ""ruined"" in this way, and extra bolts sell for a LOT of money and are all but impossible to find. In fact, this rifle is listed for just twice what an original bolt can sell for, and you get the rest of the rifle too! Here is a little info on the rimfire design and round--*** Although a rimfire round, it shot further and flatter than most of it's contemporaries. The Vetterli striker has a forked firing pin which passes through two firing pins holes in the bolt face for a double strike on the rimfire cartridge, improving the likelihood of ignition*** 
The basics are------ Weight: 10.1 lbs empty Chambering: 10.4x38 (.41) Swiss Rimfire Rifling: 4 groove, RH twist, 1 in 26"" Velocity: 1425 fps Capacity: 13 (12 round tube magazine +1 in the cartridge elevator)
 Total Production: 15,770 Manufacture Dates: 1878-1881 Eidgenössische Waffenfabrik, Bern.
 In the 1880s, 15,000 or so were made and in the last 130 years, many have been lost to time, corrosion, fire and hundreds (or perhaps thousands including private collections)reside in museums and permanent collections around the world. Out of the remainders, 1000s have been converted to centerfire meaning there are just a few thousand of nicer unconverted M78 rifles left, with not all of them in the USA. Many who collect no-FFL antique rifles, or Swiss rifles, or repeating rifles from this era desire a fine condition Vetterli M78 as it is the ultimate design and firepower from the era. There is a long tube magazine in the front wood which is similar to other designs of the time (My Kropatschek I will be listing is another) and gave this rifle a rate of fire of over 20 rounds per minute in trained hands. With 13 rounds on hand, that is serious firepower for the 1880s.
 The details for THIS rifle are- All matching numbers, including the little pieces which is typical for these as the Swiss never used these in any war. ** The underside of the barrel has a 35 and another 4 digit number but these are not the serial number which is on the top..those are other codes that you can look up online**The metal finish has a mottled patina and I did not attempt to rub or clean it.  It is very good overall and as I got this as a part of a trade and do not collect rifles that they do not sell ammo or brass for, I am selling it exactly as I received it. That is pretty fine looking on the exterior. The wood is superb for these and is free from cracks and splits. I did remove the front wood piece to check the numbers and markings (in the photos) and as usual, the metal finish underneath is far superior to the exposed areas which are pretty nice too. The barrel does not have the same mottling and is a pretty even and dark original finish. The rifle functions perfect with the bolt retracted, it pops the elevator and lifter up carrying another round from the tube magazine. No internal rust or corrosion on the mechanism which would really not even need a cleaning as it is pretty darn exceptional. The DOWN SIDE, and there has to be one or I would list this at $450 and still be lower than many others. This fired a black powder round and the inside of the bore looks crudded. I am not going to attempt cleaning, rather sell it as I received it for a couple hundred less. As I will not be keeping this for my collection, I don't want to spend time on it, just pass it along. It may clean up nice or may require heavy scrubbing and still be fair or poor, I do not know BUT!! as the chances of this being fired are quite slim, it may not matter to a collector as a fully functioning and nice condition Vetterli may be what is important. If you are planning to convert this to centerfire, it may not be worth the effort, besides the fact that you would need another bolt or have to ruin the value of this one. So check the photos, ask any questions and I priced it well below any other to make up for the bore needing attention, which may not even matter to many buyers. Ships direct to you for $38 as it is long and heavy. 36 inches long packed and probably a bit over 11 pounds, and don't forget that Fedex adds $4 to deliver to a residence. If you have a business address and it does not cost $4 I will deduct $4 from the shipping. Also, if you are closer and the shipping is significantly less, I will also refund the extra. Paypal add $5 as we will split the fees. ***I have MANY more photos, so if interested, ask and I weill send you 10 or so other photos that show every angle and part"

All four guns have exactly one box of ammo through them. All shot on one range visit. All guns perform flawlessly. I took the Beretta to a gunsmith after a fail to feed on the first clip. He polished the ramp and feed muzzle and I took it back to the range the same day. No problems.

Will sell each for $450.  Will discount for more than one purchase, but not much.

Will also trade 1, 2, or 3 of them for a QUALITY electric guitar.  American or Japanese preferred.  No Floyd Rose tremolo's or the like... prefer hard tail with 2 humbuckers.  Guitars must be of equal trade value.  Trade value of all guns will be considered at $500 per.

Will also consider trades for other firearms.  If it's something I'm not interested in I will politely decline, but it never hurts to try.

The sale or trade of the guns must take place at an FFL.  You pay transfer fees.

All four guns come with factory boxes and the clips that came with them. The Springfield XD does not have the holsters and XD equipment you can get with some of them. Also, the Springfield will come with 2 disassembled 17 round parts kits for clips.

All CO laws apply.

22 LR (still cheap to shoot)

Two magazines – one 10 round flush and one 10 round extension

3 and 5 inch barrels

Small enough for conceal carry.

Some say a 22 is not a good self defense caliber, but I guarantee, a shot or 10 quick shots will deter even a bear.

I've seen these shoot through a two by four and half way into the next two by four.  That shoud do the trick.

What's better?  This or nothing. Or, something that you or your loved ones won't or can't carry (like a 9mm).

This pistol is great for teaching due to its low noise and no recoil (not snappy) pain and it's easy to rack the slide for those with weaker or painful hands.

Nickel finish is better than black and looks better.

Includes: HP22A Sport/Target pistol with 3'' barrel & 5'' extended VR barrel & black checkered grips, one extended 10-rnd. magazine & one standard 10-rnd. magazine, pistol lock, and custom-fitted, locking, transport case. 

Some websites offer this at good prices, but you'll still have to pay taxes, ffl cost and shipping.

Selling an enhanced bushmaster ACR multi-cal assault rifle.  It can be set to 5.56, 6.8 and 7.62   It's current configuration is set to 5.56.  I've never had the privilege to fire this weapon due to a decline in my health from injuries suffered in the line of duty in the US Military.

If you looking for the perfect assault rifle, then this has your name all over it.  It has everything on it you would want or need and is a few pounds lighter making the weapon that much more perfect after being modified.  Below is a breakdown of what this weapon has or has been modified to.   Also I have the stock parts that were swapped out for lighter and modified Parts (unique folding butt stock, trigger, hand guards etc). 

I have the stock Barrel currently in the weapon.  For the other barrel, the ATF stamp/engraving is done on the outside of the trigger guard in a very small font.  So yes, this comes with two barrels and the other barrel is NFA stamped/approved as it is 12 inches.  The current barell is 16 inches

All together I have over 5500 into the weapon alone.  The ammunition and other miscellaneous items is over 1 grand.  I am throwing the ammunition and miscellaneous items in it for FREE.  Yes I said that, the miscellaneous stuff to include the ammunition is FREE with purchase of the weapon.   I still have all the packaging, boxes and receipts for everything and will send the boxes and packaging to you if you like.  

I have a number what I will take for the weapon and currently I am taking all offers.  Please make a serious offer and don't waste my time as I won't waste yours.  I know realistically I'm not going to get what i paid but keep in mind, everything is still unused, brand new and in the box. 

Once we agree on a price I will send the weapon in the original case and ship it to your local FFL dealer.  I will send the remainder items to your local address standard shipping. If you would like to contact me about a certain piece or have any questions on anything please feel free to contact me.  Thanks for stopping by and don't miss out on this rare opportunity.

I will get those on here if I can edit this ad later. I believe that I purchased this R10 back in 1984 give or take a year. I have used it occasionally over the years and it is a sweet shooting accurate airgun and is in excellent mechanical shape. The report when firing sounds like a dull rap on a firm mattress. No buzz or twang etc. Cosmetically it is in good condition for its age. It has its original sights. The red dot and muzzle brake are not included. The only reason that I will part with this beauty is because the .20 pellets cost twice as much as the .22s and I plan on doing a lot more shooting in the future. So I suppose you should consider the pellet cost before you decide to buy this one. If  a .20 cal R10 is not your dream gun then you should probably look for something else, but if you have been on a quest for this rare out of production fine West German made meisterstuck you are so close to achieving your goal. The thought just occurred to me that maybe I could get it rebored in .22 hmmmm off to the search engine........well the reboring is going to take some more research so I will continue with this ad."

This is another RARE Revolver from our Dad's estate and looks to be New in the Box as you can see by it's finish. It is one of Ruger's Recall guns that were put out in 1993/94 and came with BOTH 22LR (.223) and 22Mag (.224) Cylinder's from the Ruger Factory as you can see by the Conformation letter from Ruger. These had special barrels also as the bores were .224 to accommodate the 22 Mag Ammo instead of the standard .223 for 22LR. We also have a recall letter that came from Ruger letting the people that bought them know that they were being recalled. From what the estate was told there were under a 1000 built but most were sent back to Ruger with there 22Mag cylinders and then Ruger sent back the guns WITHOUT the 22Mag cylinders. Story being the timing may be off too far for the 22MAG cylinder and might raise the cup pressure over the maximum limit. The firearm absolutely has to be transferred to you and the paper work done as I Prefer to sell FTF at an FFL only. Don't really want to ship but if you absolutely need to it would be shipped from my FFL to your FFL ONLY! The Gun Broker in Oregon on 82nd is where the fire arm will be sent from.

I have for sale an Arsenal SAM7R. Built on a milled receiver, 16.3"" chrome lined barrel. I have invested much time, money, and effort into getting this rifle to where she's at. The only reason I'm selling is because I want a SAM7K-03 AK pistol. Approx round count so far is under 700, cleaned/lubed twice after every shoot. I have everything that came with it, except for the original furniture. Mods pictured:

-Hogue Foregrips
-CAA pistol grip
-Magpul STR buttstock
-CAA tube (for milled receivers)
-Truforce side mount
-UTG Laser/light combo
-Eotech 512
-Sling (came with rifle)

Not pictured;
-2 Bulgarian mags (I believe Circle 10)
-Oil bottle
-Cleaning kit
-Owner's Manual

I am asking $1800 for everything, $1300 with out the Eotech and Magpul buttstock. I'm taking a bite on my end considering what I spent on the rifle alone ($1600 right after Sandy Hook). I understand I'm not going to get my entire investment back, but I know what I have and I'm not about to give her away. Also note that I did not remove the lower tange on the rear of the receiver, so should one desire to return to stock it would be no issue.

Need to sell FAST due to a deal I dont want to pass up - this way we both win! Considerably less than 100 rounds through it, flawless function and with the 10.5"" barrel it is just really really loud and slightly deafening unlike the auditory terror that is brought with a 7"" barreled pistol, not to mention increased function from a carbine length gas system. I was going to use this deer hunting on the coast, but a deal came along that I will just hate myself if I pass (hate myself more than normal that is). I havent had time to clean it since a trip to the range today but consider the poor pics a small trade for a heck of a deal.

Easily one of the most concealable Kimber 45s that I've ever handled. After all, RCP stands for ""refined carry pistol"". Kimber did everything to make sure this gun was snag-free when coming out of your holster, including the one of a kind trough sights. There are a few aftermarket parts on here either Wilson Combat or Kimber and VZ grips. Also, I have most of the original parts including the low profile grip safety, safety, grips and the flat bar hammer. She has also had some trigger work done and I promise you that it is the most crisp break you've felt on a 1911.  There is a little carry wear on the gun but definitely no idiot scratch. I did not buy this gun new so I do not have the original box. I can throw in a soft case though. Kimber recently started making this gun again but put Crimson Trace grips on it, which in my opinion takes away from the desired thin feel of a carry weapon. The new version is ~$1600 msrp.

With the aftermarket parts and the trigger work I'm asking $1200 or best reasonable offer. When you see this gun you'll have no problem paying that. I'm not sure if my pictures will add or not.

Caliber is .308. Rifle has well under 200 rounds through it. The rifle is near perfect condition. It is extremely accurate (pictures of 3-shot groups included).

Very clean and bright bore, little to no wear at the crown. about a quarter inch between the crown and the casing when checking with a live round. Has a great Petina. The swastika's have been peened and the barrel is import marked. Don't think it was Russian capture gun, in fact I can't figure out who captured it. Receiver is marked AR 44 on the top. Which is the Mauser Borsigwalde factory in Berlin. Serial number is 3930*. Absolutely no rust of any kind, most of the bluing is still there and in nice shape, especially under the wood. The bolt is the only number that doesn't match, but it looks to be original. I'm no K98 expert, but all the internet commando's out there seem to know everything, and I'm tired of reading all the blogs. The front sight hood is not correct, but it's been on the rifle for a long time. Original hoods are easy to find. This was made just before the Kreigsmodel (late war versions that they cut corners on to save time and money) but it does have some of the features, like no locking screws on the trigger plate, no numbers anywhere on the rear sight. The follower is marked 135, or at least I think that's what is says. The serial number is on: The receiver Both Barrel bands Both pieces of the stock, upper and lower and it's only visible on the inside. The stock has no external markings that I can find. I based my price off of k98's that have actually sold recently on other sites. I left some meat on the bone (priced it lower than the comps I referenced) Not really looking for trades, need the $$ to take care of some flood issues. I have several photo's on my phone that I can text or maybe email to you. But like anything old and expensive, it's better to hold it in your hands so you can make a better decision. Just my 2 cents. Call or text is best. My response time on emails is pretty slow and my spam filter is very aggressive. 843 six seven zero 9636"

This is a legit posting and will be updated as sold or removed when all are gone.  First up for sale is a HK P9S four inch barreled single stack 9mm with three factory mags.  The pistol is in really good shape barrel and slide finish are nice.  There are a couple scratches in some spots on the polymer frame and trigger guard.  Comes with factory box albeit not in very good shape.  I have owned it four several years and have never fired it.  Next up is an HK 4 that has Harrington and Richardson markings.  This one is chambered in 9mm Kurz or .380 and does not have factory box and only has a one mag.  These also have barrel swap kits to change to multiple calibers and are getting extremely hard to find if you want to complete your collection.    The P9s is $950 and $550 for the HK4.

Because it needs it.Dead Air Armament is new, and better!It was founded by Mike Pappas, and if that name rings a bell, it’s because Mike co-founded another silencer company back in 2008. Among others, Mike is also teamed up with silencer designer Todd Magee. Mike and Todd have set out to build the best suppressors on the market! There is no substitute for experience.It’s in the Design!Look at any Dead Air Armament product and you’ll see attention to detail and aesthetic choices driven solely by engineering performance. No gimmicks or short cuts – just pure performance. As Mike puts it: “I’m finally building the no compromise suppressors that I’ve always wanted to make. No corporate bottom lines. The only thing that matters to me is how it sounds; and the Sandman sounds awesome…”The Materials!There is no substitute for materials and no shortcuts with Dead Air. Every Sandman baffle is 100% Stellite. They cost three times more than stainless steel and they work better than Inconel under the hardest use and conditions. As for the tubes, Dead Air Armament could have used the material that most of their competitors use, but instead Dead Air Armament went with high-performance precipitation hardened stainless steel because lightweight strength does not come cheap. Only with the Sandman Ti, Dead Air Armament forgo’s the use of high-performance stainless steel and that’s because they use Grade #9 titanium. Why does Dead Air Armament do it? Because their precision rifle direct thread suppressor is designed for professional Law Enforcement applications. The old adage “close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades” could not be truer when a professional has to make an accurate shot in difficult conditions.It’s in the Manufacturing!Design and materials are part of the equation, but there is no substitute for thirty years of manufacturing excellence and that’s what BPI brings to the product. Every Dead Air suppressor is manufactured in Lawrenceville, Georgia by highly trained Americans intent on manufacturing the best suppressor on the market. Dead Air Armament standards are simple, “good isn’t good enough” and if a product comes off the line not up to par, then the can gets canned. It’s that simple.7.62 Sandman-SThe “S” is for short. And that’s what it is at 6.8 inches in length with a weight of 17.3 ounces. The Sandman-S delivers performance in a small package. It’s the perfect cross-over can for your 5.56mm, 300 Black, and 7.62 platforms.The QD system is design perfection. It features easy one hand removal in just seconds without the wobble or seizing that can often times affect performance. Easy-on-easy-off with minimal point of impact shift or loss of precision. The baffles are manufactured from Stellite and welded into a solid core for added strength and durability. The tube and mount are manufactured from precipitation hardened and heat treated stainless steels.As an innovative 7.62 design first, the front cap is detachable and features an integrated flash hider. This affords better performance, particularly in low light conditions. The detachable front cap also provides some level of insurance when that “accident at the range” happens and the can gets dropped or abused. The front cap can be replaced trouble free without the need of sending it back for time consuming repairs. The Sandman-S features a lifetime warranty.SpecificationsLength6.8 inchesWeight18.5 ouncesDiameter1.5 inchesRatingUp to .300 Winchester MagnumFinishCerakote body, Nitrided Muzzle DeviceMSRP$1049.00"

From sig's website: 
The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips.
