Would like to trade for a nice m1 carbine possibly a garand.

very presentable spreewerk manufactured p38 9mm pistol . ""cyq"" as can be seen on the left side of the frame indicates this P.38 was manufactured at Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin, Germany. CYQ was simply the code the Germans used for that factory so that Allies could not target specific small arm factories (similar to ""ac"" for Walther and ""byf"" for Mauser)
all matching with original magazine, serial numbers on frame, barrel, slide, & locking block match correctly' this is not a russian capture frankenstein pistol', rather being an original wartime nazi issued pistol possibly being used for post war police/military having replaced walnut grips. Minimal internal wear, shiny bore with strong grooves. decocker works fine as well as loaded chamber indicator, crisp break on the trigger, all in all a rock solid piece!
holster reads wunderlich berlin 1963. only issue being import marked very discreetly on the backstrap under the beavertail. 'very minute you wouldn't even notice' 


orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.

Great gun, but I have several ARs in similar configuration and this is the one I am least attached to. 

Description from the website:
The Stag Arms Model 3 is chambered in 5.56 NATO with 30+1 capacity. It has a mil-spec collapsible 6 position stock and A2 style grip. It has a 16"" 4140 steel chrome-lined barrel with 1:9"" twist and an A2 flash hider. It has a picatinny railed gas block and no sights.

I have replaced the handguard, grip and stock that it came with from the factory with Magpul MOE parts. I added a set of iron sights as well. 

This is a great rifle with a lifetime warranty and a forever guarantee on the barrel

Link to Stag's website with their warranty information:
https://www.stagarms.com/warranty/

The short version is that this gun has one of the best warranties in the industry. Completely transferable, they will replace a worn out barrel, and they pay shipping both ways for warranty work. 

I paid a bit more than $800 for this rifle when I purchased it new (after tax), then added the sights and magpul furniture, putting me about $900 in on this gun. 

Cash price is $650, it will come with two 30 round magazines and the factory hard plastic case."

HSP Incog Eclipse
Single clip, mid-line carry, offers enhanced placement of the mount so as to take full advantage of the rigs natural center of gravity. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry and the position of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting point of the holster. Introduced here is the patent pending Super MoJo adaptor that is used both to place the clip in the correct orientation and to provide multiple angle adjustments. The mounting clip Incorporates a patent pending negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the security of the holster during use. This facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. 

The INCOG Eclipse is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, concealment holster. Each of its distinctive features improve the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while aiding the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Combined, these features maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics, level of training and personal preferences."

For those who don't know much about the PT92, I'll give you a quick rundown.  In 1980, Beretta sold one of their factories to Taurus. This factory made the Beretta 92. Taurus kept all of the equipment, the design, even the workers, etc and started making their own Taurus PT92/99. They made a few improvements, including a frame mounted safety/decocker instead of the slide mounted one that Beretta had. In my opinion, the frame mounted safety/decocker is a HUGE advantage over the Beretta design. 

This gun functions flawlessly, I've never had a single issue with it. It's fun to shoot, and very accurate. 

Gun is in good shape, original wood grips are in very good shape also. 

Price on this one is $300 FIRM.  Beat up blued ones usually go from $300-$350, the stainless ones I haven't seen anywhere under $400. People who have done business with me before, know that I always try to give fair prices in order to sell my stuff quickly, and give someone else the chance to get a great deal on a great gun. I'm not in a huge rush to sell, so please don't offer me any less than my asking price.

It's pump action. This one is in decent condition, a little rust on the barrel and the receiver is dirty. I took it out and it shot fine. I would like to get around $225 for it. 

The second is a Winchester Ranger model 140, semi-auto. About the same condition as the first, except that it is missing the safety. As far as I can tell, it uses the same parts as the 1400 model, so the safety cost about $15. I haven't gotten around to buying the part (http://www.midwestgunworks.com/page/mgwi/ctgy/1400-trigger-pin) since I don't really plan on using the shotgun too much. I took it out and it shot well too. I'd like at least $250 for this one. 

If you buy both, I'll take $450. However, I would be more interested in a trade. I'm not looking for a handgun right now. Depending on what you offer, I may be willing to throw in some cash, not much though. 

I will send more pictures if you need them, but neither gun is really anything special.

I am going to the Wanamacher Show this weekend, I'm not desperate. I value the gun without the laser, riser, holosight and sling at $340.00. It's $329 at Buds with a plain handguard. I've also added rail covers and a custom sling mount. With the accessories my value for trade is $460.00. The add-ons are new, I have the boxes. Just the laser (green) was $100.00 at Academy.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.


1 PMAG® 30 AR/M4 GEN M3™ Window  5.56x45mm NATO 
1 PMAG® 30 AR/M4 GEN M3™  5.56x45mm NATO 
 While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

 In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

 Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

 Made in U.S.A.

Really nice, but I'm not a huge fan of Duck commander and have decided to let it go.  Original plan was to refinish it similar to a regular 930 since I couldn't find a plain 930 anywhere in town, but can't bring myself to sandblast it.  I bought this on 10/31 at Academy for 879.99 plus tax.  On 11/1 I shot 5 shells through it to test function, then two rounds of 5 Stand at 25 shells per round.  Functioned flawless just like my 930 tactical.  I just don't like the duck commander stuff on it.  Too flashy for me.  It is used and I am not expecting to get my money back out of it, but I'm not losing my tail either.

It is the 5 screw model with an adjustable rear target sight. It has Pachmayr grips and has a trigger shoe added on. It is a piece that fits over the stock trigger. It is wider than the stock trigger and has finger grooves on its face. It is held on by a roll pin that I assume goes through the original trigger, but I have not removed the Trigger shoe, so I am not sure. This is a shooter grade gun, not a safe queen. It has bluing loss at all of the normal places. It has been shot, but always well taken care of. The cylinder has a tight lock up and the bore is bright. There is no rusting or pitting on the gun. It will make someone a fantastic competition or target gun.

Asking $450 cash or I'm open to trades for other Smith revolvers. 

EDIT: upon closer inspection, it looks like the trigger shoe could be removed with a tiny Allen wrench."
