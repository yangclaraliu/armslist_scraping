I have looked everything up and gun based off Buds $380 to be fair though there retail is $430ish. The LaserMax is $129-$149 so went $120 extra mag is $34 and holster was $28.
So would say around $525 is fair. Retail for this is around $638. No issues and laser is spot on from what shooting I have done around 8-15 yrds. Just not for me wanting to trade for an XDs 9mm 3.3/4"" prefer 4"" or a Shield 9mm for CC.

The SF receiver is reduced at the rear, or ""backstrap"", which will appeal to shooters with smaller hands and offer increased comfort and control to all.
The “big bore” .45 caliber belongs to the United States like stars and stripes. Americans have always had a very special relationship with this timeless caliber. The GLOCK 21 gives you everything you would expect of a .45 pistol. Countless law enforcement units swear by this superior pistol for more than just its above-average magazine capacity of 13 rounds

	Hello Everyone, 
	This losing is for a used but good shape Para Ordnance P13-45 Limited 1911 in 45 ACP. This is a True Para-Canada gun, not the US type. This gun is used but is in great shape. I got this in trade recently and would keep her, but I have too many other 45s already. This gun will come with the gun, factory grips, Hogue rubber finger grooved grips, factory box, factory paperwork, factory Lock, and 5 total magazines. two magazines are still sealed in cellophane (unused). Two magazines are stainless, and three are blued. I would keep her, but I’ve been so busy lately that I haven’t even been able to take it to the range. She is still tight and doesn’t look or feel to have been shot much at all. (its probably still in its break in stage haha)
	I would also consider trades on this. Looking for 9mm/45 ACP carbines (no hi-point), CMR30, Underfolder AK47, 22/45, Ruger Mark 3, etc. Would also consider other items, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. No Bows or non firearm related items. Some items will need boot on your end, some will on mind. Need to meet in norman on this.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

My cowboy days never happened and so it's time to move this to another fun loving wannabe cowboy. Side by side/ break open 12 Ga. with 20 inch barrels (36"" overall length), it shoots both 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells cushioned with a recoil pad. Hard to see in this picture but yes, it uses the much preferred double triggers. It was even once loved upon by a smith who made it much easier to break open; additionally he smoothed out the bores so spent shells would spill out easily, cowboys preference. This shotty has the upgraded nickel finish and two chokes (3 & 4 notches). It's truely a beauty, Riding shotgun.  I've test fired it with 30 rounds of birdshot and 6 rounds of 00 buckshot (2 3/4 "", divided equally thru the two barrels); otherwise she sits ready to greet unwelcome guests."

Original Browning locking case (with original unused key) in truly stunning condition--it is also original to the firearm and has its “nauga-hide” hang-tag. 


There are no repairs and no cracks and the bluing is terrific on the gun and both barrels, but there are marks on the stock that tells you it’s has been out before (and got a few clays and ducks).

No rust, no issues whatsoever, oiled and cleaned regularly. It was last fired six months ago. The only condition issue would be the original purchaser's social security number on the underside of the firearm behind the trigger guard (family member).

It’s a 1958 model, as are both (made in Belgium) barrels. They were all purchased together in Sunnyvale, CA at a Coast-to-Coast hardware store in the late 50s.

Please, local Oregon or Washington residents in-person and face-to-face. The legalities and pain-in-the-butt of shipping these things is not something I'm interested in (unless you're having a gun shop do it).

I’m in downtown Portland, Oregon and am more than happy to let any potential buyer fully examine, insepct, and check out this firearm before any funds change hands. Cash-only, local-only, no trades, and (please) no shenanigans.

I’m happy to send more detailed images of the barrel markings and the serial number, but please only ask for this if you’ve cash in-hand and are very serious about purchasing this wonderful light twelve.

Best,

I picked this up off an AK collector that was moving and needed extra funds. This is a standard Legion/Arsenal marked SGL21, but with a tasteful addition.

Legion USA installed an early 4.5mm Russian trunnion and I added a KVAR USA folding stock; everything looks stupendous. It is the toughest milspec folder available in the American market today. Also installed is the GRIP REINFORCEMENT PLATE which is a necessity for folding AKs.

Nothing is canted or out of spec. Mag lockup is tight. With my experience of AKs & Saigas, it looks like it had a max of 30 rounds fired through it. Bolt carrier, bolt and piston all have minimal wear marks/no carbon content. Probably only test fired at the factory and dry fired a couple times.

Price is firm, thank you. Rifle will be sold in stock configuration, with standard 5-round magazine, two stage polished trigger, and milspec pistol grip.

Over 30K rounds in Government protocol endurance testing did not wear the coating off. The Matte version of our BCGs is our same NiB-X coating in a bead blasted look.

The WMD Bolt Carrier Group is precisely machined from high-grade steel to M16 specs before receiving WMD's proprietary NiB-X nickel boron coating. This coating results in super-smooth action, extreme corrosion resistance, and a harder-than-chrome surface that prevents carbon fouling from adhering, making this an ideal choice for any one who does high-volume shooting.

This gun (and the 4-4.5lb TRIGGER !!) is really amazing. SUPER accurate and smooth shooting pistol. Just got it last month and the ONLY reason why I am selling it because I just bought Grand Power flagship – the K100 X-Calibur.

Comes with two 15rd magazines and the original box. Excellent – LIKE NEW condition, no scratches or dings of any kind, could EASILY pass for a NEW GUN!! Purchased only last month – less than 200 through. Also comes with 4 exchangeable back straps, fully ambidextrous, 4.5"" barrel, VERY smooth 4-4.5lbs trigger.

MSRP on this gun is $629 + tax. Internet deals are about $100 less, but by the time you pay for shipping, CC charges FFL transfer fees, you are in it for close to 6 bills.

My price is ONLY $475 !! Not interested in any trades or ‘offers’ at this time. Price is FIRM at $475, ....and no –”$450 will not take it”, so please save your or my time. Thanks for your understanding. Only ‘face-to-face cash deals anywhere in greater Tampa Bay area.

M16 Full Auto Style for increased mass and lock time.
Our new BCG is precision machined from 8620 Steel with a shot peened bolt manufactured from Carpenter 158 and Magnetically Particle Inspected.
The entire carrier assembly is NiB, Electroless Nickel Boron coated with the patented, advanced UCT EXO process, unlike standard NiB coatings.
This offers extreme lubricity with a friction coefficent of .02 and surface hardness of 82-85 Rockwell C.
The carriers patent pending design features unique shrouded and forward facing gas ports that have also been re sized so that gas is vented differently to a standard carrier.
This results in a system that runs flatter with a smoother energy pulse.
In addition the system also runs cooler and cleaner, there is also less pressurization of the upper receiver when running a suppressed barrel.
The flared boss at the tail of the carrier enhances the BCG's lock position within the upper and makes it more consistent, resulting in an accuracy improvement.
All critical dimensions are hard turned / ground after heat treat and the bore of the carrier and gas key have been hard chrome lined for the best possible wear resistance.
All E-BCG's feature the LANTAC CP-R360 patent pending domed cam pin that is machined from 17-4PH Stainless Steel and hardened to H900 condition (45RC approx).
The ultra smooth head reduces wear within the upper receiver.
The BCG's 11.7oz weight helps to increase lock time and smoother operation.
Gas keys are properly staked at four points and only grade 8 fasteners are used in assembly.

The E-BCG's forward porting and unique shape assist in reducing pressurization inside the upper receiver that can be caused by short barrel rifles running suppressors. 
However, it should be noted that the E-BCG is not a complete solution for this issue and all rifles are different. 'Over Gassed' guns will suffer to a larger extent from this problem.
