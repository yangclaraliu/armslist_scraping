Take your lightweight AR hunting with a much more effective caliber upper!
Not much to elaborate on, this upper has been afield, to the range and in the safe so it's not pristine but it is in very good shape. Accurate and heavy hitting rifle pins right on your AR-15 lower and it is sighted in, for me anyway ay 100 yards.
Upper complete with BCG, handle and new 25 round mag, in bag!
OK, the A2 front sight makes it very easy to add an appropriate rear sight for iron sights shooting. I do have a rail height gas block and a float hand guard. Not included but if you want these then we can talk about it and either you or I could swap these parts IF you do buy them.
See pics and feel free to ask!

I’m including (3) new, unused 30-round polymer magazines as well as a scope rail/mount that attaches to the side of the receiver – all you need to add is an optic, though the rifle is equipped with iron sights.

•	Tapco G2 Trigger Group
•	16.25” barrel, 1:10 twist
•	Threaded barrel with slanted muzzle break
•	Double stack bolt
•	7.9 lbs

What you get:
•	Yugo M70 N-PAP AK-47 Rifle
•	(3) New 30-Round Polymer Magazines

The lowest price I have seen for these online starts is and auction starting at $980 with a buy now price of $1050.

For sale is a brand new Sphinx SDP Compact Alpha w/ threaded barrel. The gun comes with 2-15 round magazines and adjustable polymer grips.

The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box."

What you can learn with me:
-First and foremost safety. This is really important for younger shooters to learn early.
-Rifle, carbine or full length. AR platform is my bread and butter. I can also do shotgun, crossbow.
-Basic weapon handling, maintaining, and comfortably engaging from distances of 5 yards to whatever the range has. Usually they max out at 3-500 yards.

If, for some strange reason, you have another nicer gun that you are willing to trade, let me know. The worst I can do is say no thanks. (ex.. AR-15, Saiga 12, Mini 14, 50  Cal, etc).  :-)  I would also be willing to trade for 1000 rounds of good quality 5.56 (brass shells, no reloads)."

Ready to raise the “bar” on value, quality and accuracy? The CRX – 16 does that and more with high-end quality features and solid competitive components.
We raised the bar by including things like a match-grade, air-gaged, “Managanese-Phosphated” 4140 Chrome-Moly steel 16” mid-weight barrel. And a gas-operated original direct-impingement system to guarantee accuracy as well as a Colt Competition “twin-port” muzzle brake. We also included features like a 6-position adjustable carbine buttstock, a Colt competition match-trigger, an enlarged Magpul trigger guard and many other features that will delight all competitive shooters out there. Check out the specs – you’ll see them and wonder how incredible this rifle must be.

You may not know this, but Miami Shooters Club has two women that are self defense experts: Vicky Fernandez and myself. I was the first Canadian to score a medal in the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu World Championships in Brazil and Vicky is the first female cagefighter in the Freestyle Fighting Academy history - having also won numerous submission wrestling tournaments. When it comes to firearms, we're both certified instructors under the NRA and Vicky has trained in multiple trips out in Missouri at Asymmetric Solutions, training with former Green Berets, Security Experts, and Navy Seals.

Vicky and I are going to be teaching our first NRA Basic Pistol Course - but for women only! I'll be assisting Vicky as she heads the class. From my knowledge, there are no other female firearm instructors in Miami that are also experienced cage fighters that are teaching a women's only NRA Basic Pistol course.

This is a great opportunity, the class is on Sunday, November 1st, from 9am to 5pm. It is a very comprehensive course that is 8 hours long and also includes live fire at the range. The class covers the fundamentals of owning and safely using a pistol.

You don't need any experience - and you don't need to own a gun either (we have loaners).

Completion of this course meets the state of Florida concealed carry permit training requirement.

My first and favorite handgun is up for sale as I am hoping to switch it up a bit and don’t carry this full size SIG everyday like I used to. She has about 3,500-4,000 rounds through her and is like new in regards to performance. Regularly cleaned and maintained and always cared for. The TacOps is slightly larger than a normal P226 with the magwell grips and beavertail but this handgun works well for shooters of all sizes. Also comes standard with SIG’s rear night sights and Tritium Tru-Glo Fiber Optic Front Sight. Sad to see her go but it is that time. Very much hoping to sell to someone in the Pensacola area or nearby, Florida CCW holders preferred. I will require a copy of driver’s license and CCW if applicable upon purchase. Thanks for looking!

I never had a light strike the 100 rounds I did with the 2 #, but some might feel better going 3# and without the worry. 200 through it total in all, 100 with the stock parts. Also have the 5.5 pound stock firing pin spring. All that comes in the basic Zev kit is there as well. An extended slide lock/release is installed. Also TFO tritium and fiber optic sights, green day or night and less than 1 year old. I have an EFK Firedragon recoil assembly that reduces recoil much like the gen 4 dual springs, plus the stock polymer recoil assembly. I did duracoat the the lower frame magpul FDE, but a new lower frame can always be put on or one of the new colors Glock is using. Then there are the optional Streamlight TRL-1 tac light (the 300 lumen, 8000 candela newest C4 version) in brand new condition and new batteries (I couldn't have a home defense weapon or any other primary without one, the flashlight always gets lost) which has inserts allowing it to fit 1913, Glock , 92 (assuming beretta), or S&W99 type rails and a Gundo light bearing custom retention holster (must have light on to retain). I'm gonna make this easy at $700 for the Glock minus TRL and holster and for all of it $800 ($1000 was put into it, but I feel the price is what it can reasonably be sold for). Any questions, feel free to message me or text at REDACTED. Feel free to make an offer, but there's really not much room for haggling, $750 for everything, 650 without TLR tac light and holster.

I am selling my excellent Springfield XDS in hopes of purchasing a new motorcycle! This is an absolutely perfect EDC gun and a nice easy shooter for such a small package. It undoubtedly packs a punch but the 3.3” barrel handles the .45 very well. I have put no more than 250 rounds through it as it’s  been a carry gun for me. Very much hoping to sell to someone in the Pensacola area or nearby, Florida CCW holders preferred. I will require a copy of driver’s license and CCW if applicable upon purchase. Thanks for looking!

The rifle is in very nice shape and shoots well.  It has a 20"" barrel, the fleur de lis, stamped checking and original sights.  It was a family gun that may have been bought new, but I'm not really certain.  I do know, it has been owned (by my family) at least 40yrs.  I think it was to be a Pennsylvania deer gun and was used at least once for that but was stored most of it's life.  I do know my Dad had the butt pad replaced long ago and I had the bolt handle TiG welded back on.  The solder joint broke loose.  I Also had the smith hot blue the bolt with the intention I'd polish the middle to make it look original again, but kind of liked the dark look and left it...Other than that, it's a cool little gun.  The short barrel makes it nice to carry, though it has a fair bit of kick for a .243; it's pretty light.  I recently added the scope and weaver mounts.  Nothing fancy just a 3-9x40 tasco.  I'm really just thinning out the collection.  It's a bit too nice to carry or worse yet to drop and I don't have a good use for it currently.   I'm asking 600.00 for the gun scope with the sling and swivels.  If you don't want the scope and such I would come down a bit.  I can ship, but only to an FFL and with prepayment via a USPS money order.  I would prefer to sell in person to an OH resident.  You'll need to show me your drivers license for a cash deal.  The 2 guns I would evenly trade for are:

1. Marlin 336 lever gun in .35 Rem.  JM stamped, gold trigger, full length mag tube, no checkering.  With sights, good blue and good wood, like mine.  
or 
2. Remington SPS stainless in 300 win mag or 7mm Mag.  Only stainless please.

	Hey all, 
I have available for trade/sale a used but great little brush gun. This is a Rossi Puma 44 magnum lever action rifle. This is ready to be a great gun for you! I would keep it, but my eyes aren’t as great as they once were so i need to move more towards scoped weapons. I also have a good amount of ammo available for this as well if you re interested. This will come with the LRR paracord sling, rubber butt pad, and hunter’s specialty round holder on the butt stock. Most of the bluing is gone from the barrel and tube, but it actually looks really good th way it is worn. Gives it a real rugged patina. Pictures don’t do it justice. 
	Im open to trades, but really just need the funds freed up to finish a couple other projects that I have going. Would also consider trades for most gun or multiple gun deals. Could do full or part trade, and would trade down or up (but to go up, it would have to be really really good). Either way, shoot me a message on here or a TEXT ONLY at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in norman on this due to my schedule. 
Thanks

From ""truth about guns""
The Russian Tokarev was a military service pistol produced in Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, North Korea, Egypt and China. The Tokarev typically chambers the powerful 7.62x25mm bottleneck cartridge. The Chinese made a unique variant chambered in 9mm—the Norinco 213— for the civilian market. The State Factory 66-manufactured all-steel 213 is nearly identical to the Russian TT-33 Tokarev with one key difference: an additional frame mounted safety. (Given the similarities. some gun guys speculate that the Hungarian Tokagypt 9mm pistol inspired the 213.) The 213 is pleasant to shoot, remarkably accurate and extremely reliable."

The frame is from a like-new, German frame P229 (sold the .40 slide some time ago).

The folded carbon slide/barrel is from a Made in Germany P228. The serial number from it is a 2001, with approximately 100 recent rounds through it total, and has been a safe queen part. The guide rod and spring are like-new as well. It also has brand new night sights installed by Sig Custom Shop.

The 9mm locking block insert was just purchased. I replaced the .40 insert for it so that it could be properly converted to 9mm. I have the .40, too, so if you need that, I'll throw it in.

Comes with 1 OEM P228 13-round magazine. Essentially there is no real difference in this version versus the last run coming out of Exeter around 2009, I believe, except maybe the price. Need to sell to fund an upcoming November trip. Will come with original (P229) owner's manual and gray plastic hard case.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

.40 caliber Taurus 24/7. This is the handgun that won multiple awards in 2005 for its craftsmanship. 

Unlike more modern Taurus weapons, this gun has NEVER jammed on me. I love this gun so much I used it as a duty-weapon during 2-years as an armored car security officer. I have personally put over 1000 rounds through this gun and have rigorously cleaned it after each use and during 2-3 month inactive periods. 

The previous owner was also an armed security officer and to my knowledge maintained the gun very well. Comes with two 16 round magazines and original case.

Taurus maintains a lifetime warranty on their products regardless of ownership transfer.

The XD(M)® 4.5″ Full Size is a perfectly sized pistol that’s ready for anything. The XD(M)includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.
