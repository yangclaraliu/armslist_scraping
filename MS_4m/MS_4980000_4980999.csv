The Bernardelli P-018 pistol appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, as a police and civilian side-arm. The 9mm version was intended mostly for the police use, while 7.65mm version ws intended for European civilian market, where in some countries such as Italy or France, civilians are prohibited to own guns in ""military"" calibers.
