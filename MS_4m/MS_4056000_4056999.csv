Low cost, extremely reliable rifles coupled with equally low cost imported ammunition assured that the SKS would become a favorite. Once the budget-minded shooter has laid down his hard-earned cash for the SKS, he’s rewarded with a rifle whose quality is very disproportionate to its cost. If for some reason some manufacturer decided they were going to go into the business of building SKS rifles, new ones would undoubtedly be 6-8 times the price of what we’re buying now. Simply put, this kind of quality costs money.

I might still consider a trade, but only if it is to my advantage, your trade worth around $500.00 +/-.  The FNP and FNS were updated to create this latest generation full size from FNH-USA. FN was the maker of Browning Hi-Power and the FAL battle rifle. Their American factory makes the FNX. It is in great condition, no wear or blemishes on the exterior and has typical light barrel finish wear for a lightly used semi-auto. It is chambered in 40 S&W, and comes with original case, and manual, and three 14 round factory mags, all in great condition, gun is all black. It is a four inch barrel and it has an ambidextrious slide release, ambidextrious decocker / manual safety, true ambi gun, and can be safely decocked and carried in double action mode with safety on or off, or cocked and locked, 1911 style. Clearly the most versatile DA/SA pistol out there.These come with nicely checkered grip, undercut trigger guard,  and accessory rai, all factory original. Selling to raise some cash for other interest. Priced to sell, I have to be pretty close to firm on the number, but will sell in a discounted package deal with my decked out Nova Tactical 12 gauge.

SPECS
The Whiskey-3 Chassis (W3C) (Generation III Chassis) is a highly functional, feature laden stock for the Remington 700, and other rifles. The W3C combines precise aluminum ""V"" bedding with tool-less adjustments, (length-of-pull and cheek piece height), durability and excellent ergonomics. Right out of the box it allows the use of AICS style magazines in your rifle without any special bottom metal. Numerous types of accessories can be added to the many attachment points, including handstops, sling mounts, rails, bipods, monopods, and more. Our modular grip panels allow the shooter to tailor the fit of the stock to his/her hand which, combined with the other adjustments, yield a stock set up exactly as it needs to be for that particular shooter.

Meprolight night sights
EB Perfection sear
WC Bulletproof sear spring

Gun is very tight, extremely accurate, smooth operating, and 100% reliable. Trigger is very crisp and breaks at 3.5 lbs. Comes with factory box & papers, a box of 230 gr Win Ranger SXT (the LE Black Talon & fresh – note the new black/blue box vs the older tan one), and at least 5 magazines which are all stainless & a mix of Kimber, SA, & CMC brands. I should have a few more mags for it here somewhere but I know I have at least the 5 in the photo shoot. This is a great 1911 that’s small enough for EDC, but crazy accurate for target shooting at the range – best of both worlds.

I came to $925 as:
$700 for base gun ($900 new is online discount FFL price, $1,052 MSRP)
$75 for the Cerakote (1/2 what it cost)
$60 for the NS (1/2 what they cost)

$35 for the ammo
$30 for the extra magazines (1/2 what they cost)

1. What's my BOTTOM CASH PRICE? $924 if you must haggle. In all seriousness, email me with any all cash offers but not a lot of wiggle room on this one. I don't need to sell/trade and will be content hanging on to this gun.  Lowball offers will be ignored so save your time.

2. Will you meet me half way to BFE? Will meet within 20 min drive of W-S max. I've sat waiting for people who no-show after driving 1-2 hrs to meet one too many times to let that happen again.

3. I have a CCW so can do pistol trades on the spot. If you want to go thru an FFL that's fine, but you cover all transfer costs for all firearms involved and we do it at my local FFL (he's cheap for x-fers and has good shop hours).

4. Trades. Either you or I can add cash to even up a trade if needed. Multiple gun trades are fine. Not a comprehensive list but these are some things I like:
Sig, HK, SA, Glock (full size & not 45GAP), Beretta, Colt, Nikon Monarch scopes, Dillon 650XL press, stripped AR lowers, EAA Witness Elite or Match 10mm, nice DA/SA S&W revolvers larger than a J-frame.

Things I have no interest in: Shotguns, hunting rifles, things in .22 or .380 caliber, complete AR-15 rifles/pistols, anything you mall ninja'ed, tacticooled, Tapco'ed, or bubba gunsmithed all up. Not interested in anything made by Jiminez, Charter, Rossi, Taurus, HiPoint, SCCY, Diamondback, Rock Island, Stoeger, TriStar, etc. I'm sure they're all very nice brands, just don't want them.

If you want new Gander Mountain value for your trade I'll want it for my trade value as well.

5. You are welcome to put a few rounds downrange with it before buying. Must meet at my range in N. Davidson Co. to do that and show cash & CCW/PPP first."

It is an older rifle made in the 1950s and is in beautiful shape. This is much higher quality than the rifles built today. You will not find one with a nicer looking stock (not sure if it was refinished) or metal. There is a small repair to the stock at the front underside that looks like a hole was drilled and then filled in. It is in the third picture. It currently has a Barska 6-24 scope on it sighted in at 100 yards and it shoots very well. The 300 savage round is still available at Cabelas and the like. I would take $450 for the rifle itself. $550 to include scope and windage adjustable rings and $575 to include 50 loaded rounds, rcbs dies, Lee case length gage and shell holder and 50 pieces of brass converted from lake city 308. I paid $50 for just the 100 pieces of brass.  The cheapest rifle on gunbroker in nowhere near as good shape is buy it now for $750. I am not looking for trades but will listen to offers.

But please be realistic. This is a super nice one owner rifle. Trade value is 1800 cash 1600 however if you have something that Im interested in I will be happy to work with the value if you will do the same. 
This model 70 was special was special ordered from the Winchester Custom Shop in January of 1964 and has been with the same owner ever since. It was ordered with the following upgrades.
Grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 that was standard on all Super Grades.
Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari Sights.
Kickeez recoil pad.
The rifle comes with the orginal dealer hanging tag and owners manual. The wood has fantastic figure and color and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is mint except for one small rub on the floor plate. The rifling is perfect and looks like it was cut yesterday. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new and has been very well cared for.
Also comes in a Browning model 1915 hand fitted safari case that was purchased from the same dealer as the rifle in the early 70s. The case is in mint condition and comes with both locking keys owners manual and care card. I have seen some of these for sale before but never one like this with both keys and all paperwork. Also comes with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case. Will come with one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's. This is the nicest Model 70 Super Grade African and most complete and cared for you will ever find. Thanks for looking."

As of 9-11-15 I only have 20 boxes left.

This is the very rare and hard to Pre-Ban Norinco 7.62x39 Green Box rifle ammo. It is very effective and accurate! This is a very expensive ammo if you can ever find it. The box reads that it is steel case and non-corrosive. The bullet attracts a magnet pretty strong, so this is likely a steel core penetrator round, however I do not know for sure. See Photos. 

Some packages are better than others, but they are all new and unfired. I checked a few boxes and the head stamps reads ""61"" indicating it was made in ""Peoples Republic of China"" . And the bottom number is ""89"", indicating it was made in 1989, prior to Bill Clinton banning this type of ammo in 1994."

The Beeman P3 is the first quality air pistol to join the ranks of the now elite polymer firearm pistols now being produced in Europe and America. That is, it is a marriage of the finest ordinance steel critical parts wrapped in super strong, fiber-reinforced, space age polymers like the famous Glock and the latest Walther firearm pistols. The very reasonable price of this gun represents a manufacturing shift to a more efficient, better method of construction, rather than any reduction of quality.

This pistol is simply in a much higher league than the lower grade plastic and/or pot metal air pistols, even ones of higher price that depend on gadgetry features, such as inaccurate rapid fire, for their sales appeal. Not only does the P3 embrace a quantum leap in material technology, but it benefits from the functional evolution of valves and other key internal features. It looks and feels like solid German quality, and it is!

Pulling back what appears to be the hammer allows the top frame to be swung up as a charging lever. Just swing it forward, insert the pellet, and then swing it back to compress the air charge-an easy, natural action. An automatic safety prevents ""beartrap"" closing or accidental discharge. This top frame contains the beautifully rifled steel barrel and the front and rear sights, all as a single rigid unit. The sights cannot get out of alignment with each other during cocking.

As a single stroke pneumatic, the P3 has absolutely no recoil or spring jump. A functional, built-in muzzle brake prevents any tendency for muzzle flip. Couple this steadiness with its wonderfully crisp trigger and you have a pistol which just naturally shoots accurately offhand - not just from special testing clamps. The P3 allows you to practice very quietly and inexpensively. With the P3 you can place all your shots well and will help you shoot even more accurately with a good firearm pistol. The P3 is not only a practical pistol, but it is a joy to shoot!"

Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip"

Description

--Barrel, action, trigger guard and other metal surfaces feature matte Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion.
--Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions
--Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
--The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
--Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
--Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
--Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
--Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
--60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and --allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
--Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
--Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
--Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
--Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.

Smith & Wesson 10-8 - this has a 4"" barrel, square butt.  Was professionally tuned with trigger job, orange paint on front sight, and military issue wood grips.  Super smooth trigger, great shooter.  Hasn't been shot since I had the work done. Comes with generic plastic case.

Ruger SP101 in .357 Magnum with the 2.25"" barrel.  Custom maple grip inserts, will come with original black plastic ones too.  A great .357 for carry, one of the most durable guns ever made.  Comes with Ruger soft rug case.

North American Arms .22LR.  The smallest production gun ever made.  You can carry this where you can't carry anything else.  Comes with larger grips (in pic) as well as smaller stock grips.  My suit gun, fits well in the change pocket of blazer.  Notched so you can carry safely without hammer resting on a round.  Comes in full factory box, papers, etc.  I have both an IWB and shoulder holster that I'll let go for a very reasonable price.

For all guns, I'll travel a reasonable distance to sell at an FFL."

Description

--Barrel, action, trigger guard and other metal surfaces feature matte Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion.
--Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions
--Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
--The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
--Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
--Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
--Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
--Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
--60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and --allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
--Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
--Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
--Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
--Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.
