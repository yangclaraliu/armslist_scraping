Included also is a practically new leather belt holster. The ported barrel really helps reduce barrel flip allowing for quick target acquisition and follow-up shots which is very important with such a light, compact revolver. It is very light because it is mostly made of titanium. And titanium won't corrode. It would make a nice, small self defense gun for a woman or a man. I have carried it concealed in my pocket an it practically disappears. Other than needing a good cleaning, the only flaw is some scratches on the cylinder.   I will not ship and I accept cash or a money order for payment. All Idaho and federal laws apply to this sale. The best way to contact me is to text or call me at 2o8- 35two-2413. I love this gun and the only reason I want to sell it is I need the money. Not only are you saving money over a new one, but tax as well. Thanks for looking."
