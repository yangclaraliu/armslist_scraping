The advantage of this lightweight holster is that it fits in the back pocket without the person standing behind you, seeing your weapon eather by looking down at the of your pocket or if standing further back looking at the pocket. Does not print at all, it has a uniform thickness. This holster has a curved shape that conforms to the body covering the top of the weapon. Sticking out of the pocket and looking like a wallet. This solves the problem most other back pocket holsters have, because the LCPs are as tall as the pocket and this allows the top of your gun to show just by looking down at the pocket, very unsafe! Especially when standing in line at a store with your arms and hands full. Other holsters can leave you with that uneasy feeling -can everyone my gun? I never that way anymore with this holster. This holster allows for the use of all 3 types of factory magazines. Having talked about concealment, let's talk about drawing the weapon. By leaving your center finger on the outside of the holster , insert  the forefinger between the weapon and the center panel of the holster and thumb on the other side of the gun just flex your finger and thumb upward releasing the gun from the holster, the holster remains in the in the pocket, email me to see photos on the link. This is handmade of the highest quality and not sparsely to keep cost down, it is the holster you will carry and not end up in the junk drawer. My thanks to you for looking at this add. Price is for one holster and you have to supply your own weapon. Free shipping USPS first class package in the continental United States only. A key fob is included, to proudly display to your like minded friends."

I already have a new barrel and it is chambered for 30.06 so it is just a matter of honing the inner face of the receiver and properly mating the barrel to it. I'd probably do it myself if I had a lathe and the go-no go gauge. I have an idea as to how much it should cost but I dont know any reputable smiths down here so I am looking for recomendations if you know of a good smith in the Jacksonville area or if you are a smith if you could quote me a price and perhaps provide information as to where to find some of yor work.

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7022993,For Sale:  New Version of the Army Duffel Bag,"Merriam, Kansas City, Kansas",$ 35,"Listed On: Sunday, July 2, 2017",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a US Army issue duffel bag. These have a full-length double zipper that allows one to access the whole bag. For anyone who has used an Army duffel, there are times where what you need is at the bottom of the duffel, and essentially one has to dump the whole duffel to be able to get at it. These duffels don't have that problem, you can unzip the bag to see what is in it from top to bottom. However, the hasp where you can put a lock to prevent others from getting into the bag is retained and the zips can be situated so that they are under the hasp when closed. Also, these duffels have backpack straps, just like the old ones, so that the bag can be carried on the back. There are also handles on both ends for pulling the bag in and out of storage and a handle on the top for carrying with one hand. On one side of the bag there is a clear document holder that can be used to slip in either the name of the owner, or perhaps the contents of the bag. Essentially one can put whatever one wants in the document holder, presumably to idenfity the owner or contents of the bag.   This bag is new, but may show some storage marks from being in a tote. It originated with the US government, and is the same bag that they sell at AAFES clothing and sales for $40. I have more pictures if needed."
