Put it together over the last couple months. The rifle was assembled by PK Firearms down in Shelbyville and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Problem is, I'm moving to California for work and I can't really take it with me. So instead of bastardizing it I'll just sell it and get a nice bolt action or something for while I'm out there.I'm an incredibly picky person and it probably shows with the parts in this rifle:Noveske N4 Light 16"" barrel, mid-length gas and the Noveske block has been pinned. Muzzle device is a Silencerco Saker Trifecta three-pronged flash hider.The rail is a new Geissele MK8 15"" DDC (mine is a darker brown color, looks nice). It has magpul type 2 rail covers, a hand stop kit, and a MVG.Upper receiver is a Rainier Arms Ultramatch A4 forged upper with dust cover and forward assist.  Charging handle is an AXTS Raptor.Bolt carrier is a Cryptic Gold BCG. These things are super expensive, but carbon buildup just wipes right off. Didn't get to test for myself though.Lower is made by Royal Arms. It is a billett lower and the rollmark is on the bottom of the integral trigger guard. No markings on the side besides safe/fire.Lower parts are from a Palmetto State Armory premium lower build kit. There is a Magpul ASAP QD base plate installed. The grip is a Magpul MOE-K in FDE, and the stock is an MFT Minimalist in their SDE color which matches the Magpul stuff.Rear sight is a KAC 600M Micro, and the front is a Magpul MBUS ProPrice out those parts and you'll see you're getting a fair shake. I'll include some of the Geissele swag pack that came with the rail kit, a few loaded PMAGS and a new Viking Tactical padded two-point sling to get you started. This really is a beautiful rifle and I'm sad to sell it. But Work is taking me to the land of neutered AR15's and I'd rather not deal with it. No hurry to sell and if I don't get a reasonable amount out of the rifle I'll just keep it in the safe here. The only trade I would probably jump at is a SCAR 17S with a little cash on my end. No other trade interests at all, sorry. If you have any questions just let me know. All IL laws to be followed to the letter."

The bluing is aged and has minor surface pitting. The wood stock is heavily worn (the French beat these things up over the decades) yet the action is smooth and the base plate swings open easily. The bore is in good condition with clear rifling grooves. All serial numbers match on bolt, bolt head, trigger guard, and butt stock. ""N"" stamped on both barrel and receiver. These are hard to find in the US and there are no import markings. A great gun for anyone interested in World War One weapons or military history. US African American troops under French command would've had opportunity to use this arm along with its three-shot predecessor. More pictures available upon request. Must have SC license for local trade. Asking $400 or will trade for an m1917 rifle (can be WW2 rebarreled, not picky) or other World War One era gun. Let me know what you have. Thanks for viewing!"

A barrel nut. This rifle turned out amazingly light weight!It has never been fired but some of the parts were obtained used (see the parts list). The barrel has less than 50 rounds. Parts list and pictures below. Please feel free to ask questions and/or send offers. I really want to trade this for some decent glass to mount on my Mega Arms SPR. If I have to sell Id let it go for $900. I'll pay the transfer if we do it at Sound Loan & Pawn in Everett. What I'd really like to trade this for is a decent scope with variable magnification from 1x or 2.5x up to 10x or 12x. The scope would be going on a 223/556 SPR build and I prefer mildot illuminated reticles in FFP. I am particularly enamored with Horus reticles.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.
