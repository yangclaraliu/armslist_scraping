I have never shot it, lol. My father-in-law gave it to me several years ago while I was visiting family in Colorado. I've got a box of lead round balls he gave me. There are 95 left in the box. Also a tin of Black Rifle Powder GOEX FFFFg (not a typo) that is almost full. He also gave me a bottle of Pyrodex RS, the equivalent to FFg. The bottle has about a quarter to maybe a third of powder left. He had a percussion rifle he was shooting, but he wanted me to try the flintlock out when I got home so he gave me the partial bottle of BP. As I said, I've never shot this rifle. It does have some chingering or something around the lock area. When he gave the rifle to me I noticed he had the flint adjusted so it actually hit the barrel. So I adjusted it so it would clear and only hit the frizzen.  I'm not sure if my in-law shot this several times before giving it to me or the previous owner did. Anyway, I just wanted to be clear about the slight damage. These sell for anywhere from $400 to $500. new. On several sites I saw used listed for about $270 and up.I'm not asking much for it. The FFFg sells for about $30. and the lead balls for around $15. I don't have any patches or other peices/equipment for it, as I've never fired it. Asking $200 for the whole lot. I've got a flexible cover for it I'll throw in too. I think it's a smoking deal, lol. If you want to dicker the price, bring me a printed copy of an add with what is listed here for less than $200 and I may come down on the price, or offer me a reasonable price wihtout being an idiot and I might say ""done deal"".If anyone is going to email me with low-ball offers without even looking at the gun, I will not reply. I don't have time for tire kickers and will not suffer fools."

It comes with factory installed night site by Trijicon (H3 10) with nitron finish & a quantity of two 15 round magazines. It has a standard DA/SA Trigger. Both of the special GADSDEN 9MM Luger, Sig Sauer P226 handguns are brand new as is from factory & never shot. Seller purchased when original run of these were made & was told at the time there were only 750 made. I heard since then there were around 1200 made. These New Sig Sauer GADSDEN 9MM Luger firearms are being sold due to funds needed elsewhere & these would enjoy being out of living in a safe. I set a minimum price fairly based on my purchase price. Upon completion of paperwork purchasing firearm seller will be happy to supply my original purchase paperwork. REMEMBER both these firearms are brand new & never shot. It is an excellent firearm & quite beautiful (Pics do not do it justice). Sale has to be MONEY ORDER or CHECK. If mailing check it will cause a delay in shipping due to necessity of check clearing bank before shipping. We work with a licensed FFL dealer who will be handling the paperwork between your FFL Dealer unless buyer is a FFL holder. Thank you for looking."

It is a very low round-count firearm that is very acurate. Unlike a WASR, this is a double-feed magazine original receiver that was not modified when it came to the US. Chrome lined barrel. It has been said that this is the truest AKM copy you can get....or I should say COULD get. These have not been imported since early 2004.
This rifle has not been monkeyed with in any way. All original parts and it also has a wooden vertical forearm grip (dong) which can easily be changed-out
These guns are widely considered superior to WASRs in fit and finish, and this example certainly is. They will do nothing but increase in value. It comes with the magazine pictured

Purchased this recently but have decided not to keep it. This is a bullet-button rifle. If sold to a CA buyer, it must be made featureless first– open to limited custom request on this.

Have several other CA compliant factory magazines to sell – some ten and some pinned 20s. All like new.  I am willing to work out reasonable price on magazines as a package.
**However only the one original and two bonus 10 round factory magazine are included included in the price listed above.**
This rifle is in mint condition.  I can't call it ""new"" because it's mine, but it has NO dings, scratches, finish issues, or functionality issues whatsoever. Fully factory original - no modifications.

This Glock is fitted with a few extra features to make it particularly good for concealed-carry, or SHTF situtations. This is an Austrian-made Glock.
It Has: 
Nib-X slide finish
What appears to be a hard-chromed Glock-Made barrel, with traditional rifling
A Haley Strategic Partners/G-Code INCOG holster, included with the purchase. This holster has been the love of my concealed-carry life since I bought it a few months ago; it carries well, has great retention, and is very convenient to adjust, as well as to remove and put on. The INCOG is adjustable for height and carry angle. 
Tru-Dot metal tritium night sights, VERY bright glow from all three dots. 3 Extra 15-round magazines, one of which is an older (still completely functional) Gen 2 magazine. Glock backstrap set of threeAlso included is the Glock case, factory-fired round, Glock backstrap holder and replacement tool, as well as some documentation for the firearm. This pistol has functioned flawlessly through hundreds of rounds while I have owned it. It is accurate, soft-shooting, and everything good that you could expect from a well-made custom Glock. As far as the condition of the pistol is concerned, it is in very good condition. There is general holster wear on the slide, with some scratches here and there. VERY MINOR pitting toward the front of the slide, from previous owner. 
NOTE: Ammunition in the pictured magazine is not included

It was an improvement over the earlier Frommer 29M. It was made in 2 chamberings. The .380 ACP (9x17mmSR) chambered version was used by the Hungarian Army, while the .32 ACP (7.65x17mmSR) version was supplied to Hungary's German allies during World War II. The former, was known in Hungarian service as the M1937.[1] The latter, in German service during World War II, was known as Pistole 37(u), pistole M 37 Kal. 7,65 mm or P37. The main difference between this and the other variants is that the ""German"" version had a manual safety (which the Hungarian issue did not have) and was marked ""Pistole M 37 Kal. 7.65"" and the FEG code ""jhv"" and date, along with the Waffenamt markings. Though it was produced under more strain due to the rate by which they wanted them produced, it was still a reliable pistol. 150 - 300,000 pistols were completed this way. Some partially finished post war models were also issued, and there was an attempt to produce the gun after the war, but without success.This is a VINTAGE firearm a will be a great addition to YOUR collection!CLICK HERE TO BUY DIRECT>>>Femaru"

Sig Sauer Tango6 Scope 5-30X56mm MRAD Dev-L Scope SOT65014
 
 
 
Features:
 
First focal plane
HDX optics- extra low dispersion glass (HD) combined with high transmittance glass (HT) provide industry leading light transmission and optical clarity for any situation
MOTAC (Motion Activated Illumination System) powers up when it senses motion and powers down when it does not to provide the optimum operational safety and enhanced battery life
Dependable waterproof (IPX-7 rated for complete immersion up to 1 meter) and fog proof performance
Lockdown Zero System technology featuring turrets that pop-up and lock in place
LevelPlex Anti-Cant System utilizes an integrated digital level that is visible in the users field of view and accurate to ±0.5°
 
 
The TANGO6 5-30x 56mm riflescope is complete with Sig Sauer's HDX optical system for extreme clarity and low-light performance, glass-etched illuminated reticles, first focal plane design, innovative LockDown Zero System turrets with zero stop and reset and an intuitive rotation counter for extreme long range shooting.
 
 
 
Powered by MOTAC (Motion Activated Illumination), LevelPlex appears to the shooter in the form of illuminated arrows on the horizontal axis of the reticle, informing the shooter of firearm cant, direction of cant and severity of cant. The illuminated arrows guide the shooter back to a level hold until the cant is corrected: No more taking your eye off the target to check a level.
 
 
 
Includes voucher for one FREE SBT (SIG Ballistic Turret) custom lasered elevation dial calibrated to your unique ballistics and environmental conditions. Once you provide the required information (caliber, muzzle velocity, bullet/BC, atmospheric information, etc) SIG can create a custom dial matched specifically to your rifle and cartridge. This dial will take the guess work out of adjusting your riflescope for long range engagements.
 
 
 
 
The Sig Optics Tango 6, 5-30x56 is a premier 6x zoom rifle scope built to the highest standards. It features LevelPlex, an integrated digital level that is accurate to +/- .05 degrees, T120 high speed turrets with LockDown that offer 120 clicks per rotation (12 MRAD), resettable zero, zero-stop, HDX extra-low dispersion and high transmittance glass, MOTAC (Motion Activated Illumination) that powers down when it does not detect motion and back on when it does, fog proof and waterproof down to 1 meter.

If you go to the Ruger website you'll see that the model number is 5719. The gun has a shrouded ejector, can be shot SA or DA and has a great weight to it giving it a good balance. The gun can be used for home defense or concealed carry. I'm including a Ruger gun case with the gun but I do not have the original box. I have no doubt at all that you will agree that the gun is in perfect condition. I've shot two 50 round boxes of ammo through it. I'm interested in buyers who are 21 years or older, who can provide positive proof of identification and who understand the importance of a Bill of Sale which I will provide. I'm not looking for any trades and don't bother contacting me with a goofy story about taking your bank check and shipping the gun to you. Cost is $450.

Less than one hundred rounds through the firearm (these usually take about 150-200 rounds to fully break in), in great shape. I purchased this pistol to be my primary concealed-carry handgun, but still do not have my CCW and do not plan on getting it any time soon. It is very thin and concealable, and after three magazines, I was able to become very accurate with it. Recoil is what you would expect out of a subcompact single stack .40 caliber pistol, but I put an aftermarket LimbSaver grip on it, which helped a good bit. Pistol comes with two interchangable backstraps, a 7-round and a 6-round magazine, original case, LimbSaver grip, and Crossfire holster. Not interested in any trades, and the price is firm."
