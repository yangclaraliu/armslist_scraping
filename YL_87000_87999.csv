The one I have is manufactured by Smith Corona, and many were also built by Remington.

As you can see from the picture, my rifle has a newer wood stock, recoil buttpad, sling, and is drilled and tapped for a scope and has a Bushnell Sportview scope mounted on it with Weaver rings (you can still see part of the Smith Corona etching).  Sorry if you're looking for the A3-style stock- I don't have it and the guy who sold it to me didn't have it either.  It's probably been lost to the ages.

It's in 80% NRA grade condition, and is still a shooter.  I don't have use for it now since I already got a nice Remington 700 in 300 Winmag for Christmas, ought to be great for the deer out here.

This is the target model P-22, with the 5"" barrel in nickel. It has about 4-500 rounds thru it, and is pretty accurate. It comes with all the accessories that cane with it, icluding the case. I cannot find the gun lock that came with it, but have extras. I am selling it to fund another project. 

I purchased the flash hider for it from Arfcom a while back. one of the members was making them and selling them. I will include it in the price for $235. I believe I paid around $60 for it. I think its SS, but for some reason titanium is coming to mind. Either way, it is SS or better material. 

I will sell it without the flash hider for $200 FTF. Buyer pays actual shipping either way.

Anyway the rifle is in overall very good condition with minor handling marks. The most notable mark is on the flash hider, which looks like someone put a tool on it. I suspect the previous owner may have used lock-tite on the flash hider as I cannot get it to move by hand. I have not tried to use a tool on it. 
The rifle will include the correct sling and 2 chinese 30rnd. mags. I don't have the box or manual, I bought this used from a gun shop in May of 2008.
Round count is unknown, I have put about 400 rounds thru it, it ran flawless, with both steel and brass cased ammo.
Nice AK and a little on the un-common side.

The Stevens Company produced an extensive line of smaller, 
single-shot rifles chambered for small calibers and intended 
primarily for use by young shooters. These firearms have become 
quite collectible and are considered a field of specialty by 
many modern collectors. 
NOTE: There are many variations that were available with a 
number of options that would affect their value. We supply information 
and values for the major variations but would recommend 
securing a qualified appraisal if in doubt.

a knurled knob underneath the frame. It is a lightweight rolling 
block, with a thin operating knob on the breech. The finish is

As stated by the original owner the gun had only had 20 rounds fired through it until today when I put two magazines through it(22 rounds) for a total of 42. This gun looks to be new or very very close to it. Target is shown in one picture which was shot at 12 yards...I'm a bad shot to!


The gun functioned 100% unlike a lot of compact 1911's, has a great trigger is a lot of firepower in a small package!

This is a neat old gun hanging on the wall!  Very rough missing some parts as the pics show.  It is a wall hanger at this point.  The most valuable thing about it is the serial number.  It is in the 4800's.  Very low! If you had another one for parts to restore it...  the low serial number would enhance things.  It has been hanging on my wall since 1977.  It needs to move to your wall! It is a really neat wall hanger.

I don't know the caliber... It has a very faint 32 or 38 WCF stamp on the barrel right in front of the receiver.  I am assuming that identifies the caliber. But which it is I do not know.

I like the versatility in being able to use either the 2 3/4 inch shells or the 3 inch shells. It has the dual action bar design and a single large locking lug to secure the breech.  Has 28 inch vented rib - double bead barrel - Fancy hand select Walnut stock and forend.

Finish is 99%, function has been 100% flawless for the ~500 rounds I've put through it. It comes with the standard ""bar dot"" sights. The only apology is the grip screws -- my first attempt to remove them was... ham-handed. Their surface finish is marred slightly in the slots. You may wish to replace them with aftermarket screws. I've never seen the need.

The original carrying case, manual, trigger lock and two 10rd magazines are included. Also included are three, full-capacity, 13rd factory magazines. They were bought used after the ban expired, and their finish is slightly worn. All magazines are 100% fully functional. There's also a pair of Hogue Rubber Overmold grips included in the case.

Overall, this gun is in excellent condition. The photos speak for themselves, but I'd be glad to email you high resolution versions of any details. Just ask.

NOTE: The last three digits of the serial number have been removed IN THE PHOTOS with a re-touch tool. The serial number HAS NOT been filed or altered in any way.

I'm in the Denver metro area, and would prefer a FTF transaction. But I will ship to your FFL if necessary. No trades."
