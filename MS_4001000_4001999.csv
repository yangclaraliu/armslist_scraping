A couple months ago I moved from Kansas City to New Orleans to enroll in school. I am currently living in Southern Midcity/ Northern Uptown area. While I'm not too concerned with break-ins and such, I've decided that it's better to be prepared for the unknown. Now my financial situation is somewhat strained so cash isn't a very viable option, but I'm currently in possession of two laptop computers. I was actually given a computer from an old friend before I made the move to N.O. Seeing as how I only need one, I'm more than willing to make an exchange of sorts. The computer is an HP Envy. I've only had this computer for 8 months so it is in almost new condition. The retail price of this laptop is in the neighborhood of 700-800$. I'm very willing to accept a slightly less valuable firearm to compensate for the nature of the exchange. Pictures, along with any other information deemed necessary will be made available upon request. If interested, contact me and we can discuss a possible exchange in greater detail.

The second insert has been put to use in my crack open 12 gauge, and run several hundreds rounds, estimate anywhere from 200-500.

The only wear on the used adapter is it has become blackened with soot!
The bore is fine, and come to think of it, it may or may not be cleanable. I've never tried being it was for fun, it really was nice to being able to shoot .410 as opposed to the menacing 12 gauge rounds. It's great for a quick switch for birds.. or beer cans. I'm joking but you get the idea.

I'm asking $15 for the pictured insert, $25 for both, 
or $15 for just the dirtier one.

These are meant for crack-open shot guns, but if it will fit, you can manually work it in a pump gun. Would NOT recommend it for a semi-auto only shotgun (unless you can disable the action, as that kind of gun was not designed for the added weight).

York Rite Masonic Sword,"Alpharetta, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, February 6, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am Selling my 100% authentic Ames Company Knight's Order (Masonic Knights Templar) sword. This sword belonged to the York Rite Knights Templars. In 1857 the Ames Company started marking swords marked ''Ames Co, Chicobee, Mass'', then were bought out by the Henderson Company in 1893, changing to Ames-Henderson, dating this sword between 1873-1893. The sword has a remarkable nickel scabbard signifying it was for a Sir Knight. The black handle, which still has the original chain attached, states the owner was an officer, or among the highest degree within his order. No one has been able to shed light or information on the acid etching on the blade which leads me to believe it was an uncommon etching used by Ames in the narrow window of time before being bought by Henderson. 
One side depicts a knight holding a religious banner and two knights jousting with the Temple Dome in the background. The opposite side is mainly a floral depiction. The blade is marked with the knight's name, Ernest Alfred Anthony. The sword has it's bumps and bruises but is in amazing condition. 
I purchased the sword 25 years ago at a reputable antique gallery. While it has been extremely well cared for, it does, as to be expected, have a few cosmetic blemishes. The blade has some minor nicks, but the etching is still very vibrant. The scabbards nickel plating is outstanding with only light surface marks. It appears not a single scratch is deep enough to scar the scabbard. To my untrained eye it seems to be as good as it gets for its age! The black wooden handle has the most wear with a shallow chip smaller then a dime as well as some minor general wearing of the black paint, most noticeably on the backside opposite the emblem of the cross. 
Again, I'm no expert but those who judged my sword said it's 100% together. It isn't even missing a screw and has the original chain connecting the knights head to the cross on the hilt. I could describe it all day but I will let the pictures talk and can elaborate more if you have any questions. 
This sword is in superior condition compared to all other examples I came across while researching it. 
Placing it's age within a 10 year window is remarkable."

They use standard PA-63 magazines and grips, though I have misplaced the magazine for this pistol when we moved recently. Surplus can be found online anywhere from $10-30, so I have adjusted the price accordingly. If I find the magazine after a sale I will mail it at my expense to the buyer.
Good little compact pistol, I just don't shoot 380 and am thinning the herd of calibers I don't use.
Unfortunately, all laws will need to be followed, even idiotic ones.

Right hand. Model #114-16. Made in the USA. It’s sized for a 6 1/2” Ruger Single-Six or Heritage 22LR/22WMR SA revolver.

Comes with (2) 17 rd. OEM Mags. NO BOX. There is a cut in the frame where a previous owner had installed an aftermarket thumb safety, but it does not affect the function of the gun in any way. Picked this up a couple weeks ago and after putting 300 flawless rounds thorugh it, realized it just isnt for me. After doing some research on the gun it has a frame recall that has never been taken care of. I called Glock with the serial number and they said indeed it was eligible for a free frame. They said they will also replace any worn internal parts for free as well as include a free factory extended slide release and free factory extended mag release. (GLock always throws in a couple free mags as well)You just have to overnight it back to Glock via FEDEX. Called FEDEX and the total cost to overnight gun back to Glock would be $25-$30 bucks. So for basically the cost of the gun plus $30, you will have a brand new gun in a model that they dont make anymore. Turnaround time per Glock is approx 2 weeks to replace the frame. 


Will  trade for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 19 or Gen 3 or 4 Glock 17.

They are blank guns only for training purposes.  Great for training dogs for hunting, horses for crouded events, or even children or beginner shooters to get accustomed to safe firearm handling without handing them a real firearm.  They are double action, 5 shot, blank .209 primer pistol with the strength to stand up to frequent use and for those who prefer a larger, more hand-filling pistol. These deluxe blank pistols have the heft and balance of many conventional pistols. A solid barrel with a red plug identifies that the barrel is safe and is not a real gun. The cylinder swings out for loading of five 209 shotgun primers.  209 primers are louder and tons cheaper than 22 blanks.

The gun has a bipod attached and comes with a magazine pouch, over 100 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo, an original sling , an adjustable cheek riser and a few other miscellaneous items. Overall a great gun. Feel free to text or email me with any questions. Thanks a lot.

Very Good to Excellent condition. This rifle is sweet, and she's a shooter. Excellent bore, very shiny with strong and defined rifling. No flaws on the crown. All of the hard work has been done. I degreased the entire rifle. I sweat all of the cosmoline out of the stock, stripped it, lightly sanded, and refinished it with three coats of Minwax Red Mahogany. It's one of the most beautiful Mosins I've ever seen. Butter smooth bolt functions effortlessly, unlike many Mosins you will see on Youtube. I will include everything you need: Pin depth gauge/wrench, bayonet, brand new sling with dog collars, and 340 rounds of Soviet steel core 147gr. Get this honey of a Mosin before it's gone. $200!!

 If you're in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area, I can meet you or deliver. Email me, my name is Leif.

PLEASE DO NOT FLAG THIS LISTING AS OVERPRICED! If you don't want to pay $200, go buy a Mosin out of the crate with a crappy bore and crappy stock, soaked in cosmoline, with no ammo included at the local gun store for $190...then go spend another $95 on a spam can of ammo."

""Man, I'll tell you what. There was two walkers coming towards me but I knew if I used my revolver I'd attract every walker for 10 miles, so I just pulled out my Gator Machete Pro and sliced ones head clear off it's shoulders and cut right through the others head, straight into the brain. It's still just as sharp too!! I don't regret this buy not one bit! 5 STARS!!""

The P-11 is the pistol that propelled Kel-Tec to respectability and even stardom in our Industry. It works, it’s garbage-mouthed; it will feed anything from Russian steel case ammo to the finest Remington Golden Saber on the market. The P-11 is accurate, too, note the similarity of the barrel’s muzzle collar to the Smith & Wesson 5906. Though not as flat as its descendant PF9, the P-11 is still a thin-enough pistol with lots of firepower. Manufacturer is Kel-Tec CNC of Cocoa, Florida. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts, assembled into a polymer frame with polymer magazine release for right hand shooters; and .280 smooth faced combat trigger. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Dimensions are: barrel length 3 inches; maximum height 5 inches; overall length 6 inches; frame thickness 1.05 inches; weight empty with magazine in battery 17 oz.; 3-dot sight configuration. The P-11 is, of course, double action only. It has a hammer, but the hammer never stands. Herein lies its safety feature: in addition to the firing pin block safety that prevents firing if the pistol is dropped, the only way the pistol will fire is by a stiff deliberate pull of the trigger, 1 inch travel double action pull with pressure of 5 to 6 pounds. The Kel-Tec is good pistol. Out of several hundred we have sold over the past three decades, we have sent fewer than 20 back to the factory for repair or service. This small pistol, however, may not be suitable for people unfamiliar with automatics. New gun owners and arthritic folk with weak grasp capabilities should stick with the simple, safe, double action revolvers. This one comes with its original Mec-Gar factory issue 10-shot magazine. This Kel-Tec will accept any Smith & Wesson 59, 669, 6900 or 5900 type magazine, even the 20 rounders. We're offering the P-11 in the photos, or one of its identical mates for only $ 239.00 2% Discount if payment is by USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card.

It is full time double action; every shot has the same trigger pull; the hammer does not stand for single action. Safety system depends on that double action pull, and each Kel-Tec also has a firing pin safety. Barrel length is 2.68 inches, and the cycle cants the barrel so that each subsequent round injects straight from the magazine into the chamber. Frame thickness is .795; overall length is only 5.2 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut. Height is 3.5 inches from the magazine floorplate to the top of the frame integral fixed notch rear sight. Front sight is post type. Each P3AT comes with its single blue steel 6 shot magazine, manufactured by Mec-Gar for Kel-Tec; capacity 6+1 rounds of .380 ACP ammunition. Trigger is hard polymer .250 width molded smooth face combat, with only a molding crease in its center. Trigger pulls in the 5 pound vicinity. Finish on this basic P3AT, factory sku P3ATGRNGRN, is durable OD Green Cerakote® steel slide with matching military coloration OD Green polymer frame. Weight empty is only 7.2 ounces. Each Kel-Tec comes in its lockable plastic case with trigger lock and factory papers. Own one of these good, flat little pistols for only $ 239.00.

It is NOT transferable to California Civilians because its barrel is threaded. Close scrutiny of this innovative SU22CA Rifle by Kel-Tec reveals its close kinship to its larger, more powerful sibling chambered in .223 Remington. This one is .22 LR Caliber, but its specs are very similar to the .223 SU16 Rifle. As usual, the current hype over .223 and even .22 Magnum pistols ignores the formidable nature of the .22 Long Rifle Cartridge. The venerable long rifle operates more economically than any other cartridge, and loads like CCI Stinger and Aguila Super Max approach Magnum Velocity, 1600 fps vicinity. Manufacturer is Kel-Tec CNC of Cocoa, FL. The SU-22, writes the factory, operates by blow back action and has a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded 1/2 inch by 28 to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake. Specs are semi-automatic blowback action rifle, caliber .22 Long Rifle, capacity 26 + 1 Rounds, and the PLR22 comes with One polymer AR-15 size magazine; construction of steel and polymer; weight empty 48 ounces. The SU22CA folds at the middle into a very compact 23 inches overall stored length. Lenth assembled is 34 inches overall, with 13 1/2 inch length of pull from the trigger face to the end of the buttstock. This rifle is ideal for owners of the PLR-16; or for those who respect the PLR-16; or simply for recreational target practice, given the inherent accuracy of this one's 16 inch barrel. We're offering the SU22CA in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 339.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, or any jurisdiction where threaded muzzle rifles are restricted to law enforcement only. For buyers in jurisdictions where the rifle is civilian legal but the 26 round magazine is not, $15 off with no magazine or we will sub a Black Dog 10 rounder if we have any.

Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are West German police surplus magazines for the Sig P-6 pistols, same as the Model 225, that we've all enjoyed for the past few years. Evidently German mothers teach their children hygiene very well at a young age, because all the German Police Officers had kept their pistols clean and well maintained. That is in sharp distinction to many of the firearms and equipment we run across, these are exceptional items. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Eckernforde, Germany. Construction is all steel, matte blue finish, and note the dovetailed construction on the backs of the magazines; note also the steel floorplates and followers. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm ammunition – 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. From the dates of the firearms we had between 2006 and 2009, these magazines were manufactured by Sig Sauer in Germany in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We test fired no fewer than 100 of the parent pistols ourselves, with no hitches at all on full metal case ammunition, or on Remington round nose hollow points. Please understand that we nor anyone else guarantees any magazine, new or used, to lock the slide back on the last shot all the time, and that is not a legitimate reason for a return, fewer than 10 percent of our test pistols failed to lock the slide after firing dry. Stretching magazine springs is easy to do, and it is a routine part of good gun maintenance. Photos show specimens from the lot that we have, buyers will receive one of the magazines in the photos or their identical mates. We rate them all as Very Good, 75 percent vicinity finishwise, but we have included sufficient photographs for shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves.

Type is double action only revolver, with completely enclosed internal hammer that operates against a floating firing pin. Like all S&W Revolvers for the past century, it has a transfer bar internal safety device to guard against accidental discharge if the revolver is dropped. This -2 variant also carries Smith & Wesson’s internal lock with two keys. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, including .38 Special +P loads. Barrel is 1 7/8 inch, nominally 2 inch, with black serrated blade front sight against a frame integral fixed notch rear sight. Trigger is .312 smooth faced MIM combat type, with 12 pound vicinity pull. Finish is matte blue with closely matching black matte anodized frame. Grips are factory boot type, with stippled lateral surfaces and groove indention for two fingers. Weight empty is 15 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger, 17 ounce vicinity loaded.

This Trophy Grade ammunition is loaded with Nosler's AccuBond bonded core bullet. Through a proprietary bonding process that eliminates voids in the bullet core, AccuBond marries Nosler's traditional copper-alloy jacket with its special lead-alloy core. The result is a bullet that flies true, penetrates deep, won't cause extensive barrel fouling, and will retain 60-70% of its weight. The white polymer tip helps protect against deformation while initiating expansion upon impact.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 25 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Do the math. Most High Performance Ammunition comes 20 rounds to the box. Remington Golden Saber comes 25 to the box, that’s exactly 20% more ammo for the same money, at least in this case. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the .38 Special, its Golden Saber 125 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint +P Proof Load whose velocity approaches the .357 Magnum. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Remington's Golden Saber High Performance Jacket (HPJ) ammunition is designed for law enforcement and personal defense, and it successfully combines match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion, and near 100% weight retention. This HPJ handgun ammunition was built around revolutionary hollow-point bullet design, and the jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distances while mushrooming. Primer and mouth-waterproofing are standard, and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The cases are nickel-plated for reliable feed, function, and extraction. This load is the 125 grain +P BJHP Load, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 4 inch Model 10 at 975 fps, and delivers a magnum-grade 246 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These fine cartridges come 25 to the box, enough to charge four 10-A or 586-A HKS Speedloaders with a round to spare. Similar loads fetch $1.50 per cartridge, $30.00 a box. We’re offering our Remingtons, however, at only 63 cents a round. A 5 box lot, total of 125 rounds, is only $15.80 per box. Own 5 boxes for only $ 79.00.

Since the earliest Armscor .22 rifles, to their long produced .22 Magnum ammo marketed by Fiocchi, we have had positive experience with Armscor products, and that is especially true with their Rock Island Armory series of Government 1911 style pistols. We admit that the Taurus Revolvers are winners hands down over Armscor’s; but the Filipino Gunsmiths have many more years of experience with their 1911A1 pistols than the Brazilians do. This offering is for Armscor / Rock Island’s top of the line 1911A1 Tactical, a pistol that holds its traditional looks and lines while incorporating custom features. Construction is all steel, with traditional military parkerized finish. Barrel is conventional 5 inch, and note the full length stainless guide rod. Hammer is modified Commander skeleton style .272 wide, and with matching skeleton serrated face black anodized trigger. Felt creep is minimal on all specimens we have handled. Sights are non-snag dovetailed in Novak style, black ramp front. Grip safety is Beavertail type, and with extended ambidextrous main safety. This pistol comes furnished with a total of one 8 shot blue steel magazine. Grips are nicely grained Filipino hardwood.

Buffalo Bore Ammo - Heavy 30-30 Winchester Ammo - 190  gr. JFN @ 2100 fps (1860 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box











Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."
