Whether you take it to an upland hunt or to the clay range, the Silver Pigeon I gives you the flawless performance and the classic looks of a BerettaThe Silver Pigeon I is built on the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordinationWhile not as elaborately decorated as our premium shotguns, the Silver Pigeon I has all the elegance that you can expect from a Beretta. The oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under. The scroll-engraved receiver is a functional work of art in itself, with its interesting geometry blending perfectly with the stock and contributing to the gun’s graceful lines.

In the envent you clicked the link and have no idea what the Superlative Arms Piston kit is, in short this kit will convert your AR 15 from a direct gas impingement to a piston operation. From the Superlative Arms webite. 
The Superlative Arms patented “Bleed Off”, Gas Piston System for the AR15 platform adjusts the gas flow by bleeding the gas out of the block instead of restricting the flow like conventional adjustable blocks.  Results:
- The pressure used in the block is reduced only to the amount required to drive the bolt carrier. The remaining gas / pressure are bled out of the block allowing the system to run much cleaner and cooler.-Reduction of felt recoil.
- Patent pending adjustment detent is located outside of the block and therefore no contamination.
- The gas adjustment screw does not restrict the gas flow; therefore there is no erosion or seizing of the screw / no loss of detent due to carbon build up.  Although it is removable, we have added a safety mechanism, which stops you from unintentionally backing the screw all the way out.
- When using SBR’s and / or suppressors the bleed off port allows the excessive pressure to be exhausted out of the block reducing blow back.

When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible."

But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver. The A400 Xplor Action defines performance and versatility in a semiauto.The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.With its bronze-colored receiver, its classic Beretta blue barrel and its select walnut stock, the A400 Xplor Action is an elegant piece of gear that will figure very nicely even next to a premium over-under. The checkering is fine, giving you secure purchase while pointing and shooting, and on the fore-end it features the Beretta Trident logo for an updated look. Keeping this shotgun as good as new after a long day on the field or at the range is quick and easy: you can field-strip the A400 Xplor without any tools, and it comes apart in only five components that are a snap to reassemble. All these features make the A400 Xplor Action the best and most versatile wood-blue semiauto shotgun for a variety of hunting and sporting purposes."

If you are wanting to trade please work out details before coming, and if you are coming to buy let me know you are on your way so I will have it ready for you to look at. We are in the process of setting up a large yardsale with tools and man items with a lot of our personal vehicles and trailers. There will be something for everyone, but while we are setting up, we don't care to pull a few firearms out. We are thinning out our collection some. I also have a way to accept credit cards at a 3.5% charge (what it charges me)Don't contact me unless you are legal to own a gun."
