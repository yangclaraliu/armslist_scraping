Never missed....until? Then you're snake bit? Well, this set will SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. When this trigger's pulled, something drops in its tracks. Sure cured my yip. If it's time for you to change equipment, change to this. With the heavy barrel, you won't pull up. And the acutrigger feature helps with the slow squeeze. Has detachable mag. The Zeiss scope is the REAL DEAL. The primo glass. Not the newer, cheaper stuff. Diavari Victory 2.5 x 10 x 50, with adjusting reticle lets you pick the nose hair you want to shoot at twilight. Once you've used this scope, you'll never want another traditional reticle. As you zoom in, the crosshairs enlarge. Single point from the bottom, with two squared-off side hairs. Nothing obstructing your view from the top. I've seen this scope alone, on ebay, listing at $1300 or more. Selling with case, strap, scope cover, cleaning kit, and a case of Hornady 165gr ballistic tips it was shot in with. This gun and scope are going to be very hard for me to part with, but it's time to buy some fishing gear, and our hunting lease ran out. When it's time to get zeroed in every pre-season here in the South, take one shot at fifty, one shot a hundred, and you're probably good to go. I was this season"

I got this brand new @ Gander mtn for $1050.00 (I still have the receipt). I've only put about 50 rounds through her.  It's the 3"" barreled SS version and she's a beautiful handgun!  This firearm fires 45 long colt, up to 3"" .410 shot shells, and the most spectacular 454 casull!  There is no modification requited to change between calibers, you can mix and match all 6 chambers at once!
 
I am also selling all the ammo I have for it and is as follows:
-17 rds Federal 454 casull 250 Gr (these are $55/box of 20 rds, I have the receipt)
-about 2 boxes of Winchester PDX1 3"" .410 shells which contain 4 plated disc projectiles and 16 plated bb's in each round
-about a half box of Winchester super sport 2.5"" .410 shells of #8 shot
-65 rds of hand-loaded 400gr 454 casull hollow points.  That's not a typo, they are 400gr hollow points and put out a fireball the size of a basketball!!!  These were $3 a round
 
That's over $250 of ammo included in the sale making the value of the sale at about $1300 BEFORE TAX.  I'm only asking $1000 for everything.  You'll have everything you need to get out and shoot including original box, manual, both locking keys and warranty card.  Buyer must have valid Ohio state ID and be at least 21 yrs of age.  No felons!!

Comes with one mag and rifle is in like new condition. Its 100% reliable. 
This rifle is based off of a Czechoslovakian Vz. 58, has a milled receiver and looks similar to an AK47.
During the Cold War, the Soviets allowed the Czechs (unlike other Warsaw countries) to design their own rifle instead of forced adoption of the AK- as the Czechs have a long history of small arms design and innovation, thus creating the VZ58.
However, this rifle being designed about 10 yrs after the AK and has some advantages.
Including a shorter and lighter weight milled receiver, a simpler striker fire trigger, last round bolt hold open, slightly less recoil due to short stroke gas piston and the bolt has less mass than an AK. The total weight unloaded w/ mag is 6-1/2 lbs. The furniture is similar to mil surplus bakelite.
The VZ2008 are no longer being made; the original Czech rifles are still being imported in small numbers and go for $1k+. Plenty of after market parts are available to customize, if desired.
I'm looking for cash only. I may trade for an AK47, or possibly something unique.
Send me an email and I'll respond in 24 hrs or less."

Our Special Edition rifles includes: A PSA Premuim BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) and Tactical Charging Handle; a 3x Prism Permanent-Etched, Dual-Illumination Recticle, Spitfire Vortex Scope; one custom Don't Tread on Me Dust Cover; a single Rear Window 30 Rd Hera Magazine; and the Custom Service-Replica rifle finish. The package comes with an offset mount for an Ultrafire 1300Lm CREE XM-L T6 C8 LED Torch Flashlight + Remote Pressure Switch; a mounted UTG Slim Keymod Handstop/Barricade; and a UTG Angled QD Sling Swivel Adaptor. All these accessories are of great quality and speak for themselves; but as for the rifle itself you'll never find one more reliable and more accurate. We chose a Stainless Steel barrel typically because of their incredible accuracy, since the internals of the barrel typically do not carry such linings as a chrome line coat. This rifle is certainly one to consider in a Life or Liberty situation and definately one any gun enthusiast should have in their personal collection. And lastly, as for the spray finish of the rifle, we admit to it's unconventional style and/or look; however, we feel only attest to the ruggedness of a true service weapon. Thanks Guys and Enjoy!!Please People ... NO TRADES. However, I could be interesed in a trade involving a DBAL-i2."

563,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5189563,For Sale:  Harrell's Precision Premium powder measure with stand,"Falcon/Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 250,"Listed On: Friday, February 19, 2016",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling a BARELY USED (less than 200 loads) Harrell's Precision Premuim Powder Measuer with the aluminum adjustable stand. I bought this last April, but never really got to use it much. Now, I dont have the time, or resources to reload as much as I would like. This is the most accurate, and consistent powder measure on the market. Of the 200 loads I did, after I each load, I would weigh the powder to verify. 95% of those were on the dot, the other 5% were maybe +/- 0.1 grains. You can't ask for anything better!
 
I first found out about this measurer at a competition in Texas. A guy had his stand set up hand making custom ammo on the spot. I talked to him about it, he showed me how accurate and consistent it was. He despensed 10 45.5 grain loads into little cups. He then weighed each one (without the cup of course) and all 10 were exactly 45.5 grains. I was sold! I sure couldn't do 10 like that with my RCBS powder measure
 
Here is the website info about the measure:
 
Our new PREMIUM Culver type measure is the finest measure we have ever made. It has two precision roller bearings, one on each end of the metering device, to reduce vertical play to a few ten thousandths of an inch. They also make it incredibly smooth, for a much better feel.
 
OTHER NEW FEATURES:⦁ Left or right hand use ⦁ Four cutting edges, two left and two right hand ⦁ Brass metering device encapsulated in a stainless steel bushing ⦁ New space saving design with 16 ounce bottle ⦁ 120 grain, 200 click, 6 clicks between numbers, .1 grain per click adjustment, easily converts to 4 clicksAlso included, is the Harrell's Powder Measure Stand. This has adjustable height, and clamp distance, so it can be mounted exactly where, and how you want it.
 
Here is my purchase info:

This sale will include the Powder Measure, 2 dispencer tubes (for small and large loads), the brass collar for attaching the tubes, the 16 oz powder bottle (I am missing the plastic stopper that goes in the top, but I will either find it, or something to replace it), and the aluminum stand (black).

For sale is my Para Warthog 1911 with two 10rd mags and a 13rd extended mag.
I bought it a few months ago and have put less than 100 rounds through it. It has been very well taken care of. It was cleaned after every firing and stored in its case.
These are getting to be pretty rare and are no longer in production. They're pretty hard to find in a retail environment.
