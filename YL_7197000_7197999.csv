This is not a British used piece, as evident by the lack of WD War Department proofs. The Barnett lockplate has a Crown without the VR, and instead has Tower and another B stamped to the right. The sight leaves are still present, and original to the gun. The barrel has the correct proof marks for Barnett, and the stock still has the correct saddle ring and assembly for mounted use. The ramrod (replaced with a period style that is often seen on the p1856 and p1853 Artillery Carbines) and swivel arm has been broken off, which was probably done by a trooper whom was tired of the awkward movement to return the ramrod. The civilian patch box is most likely post-war, and supports the notion of being a Southern piece. But unlike most of these carbines that became bored out shotguns following the war, this carbine has very strong rifling still! A wonderful piece to have in your Southern Cavalry display or English Import collection!"

The magazine is reinforced with stainless steel in three critical areas, the feed lips, front locking lug and rear locking lug. Testing has shown that polymer feed lips fail when faced with multiple impacts or extreme loads. Imported magazines use a thinner, lower grade, of steel in their feed lip reinforcement causing them to deform and remain deformed when when a heavy load is exerted upon them. The stainless steel rear locking lugs durability is such that during impact testing the trigger guard and magazine catch on rifles have been damaged without failure to the magazines locking lug. In other reinforced magazines steel spines are used as an attachment point for the steel reinforced front locking lug, the spine it self does not require reinforcement as it is inherently durable due to the fact that its cross sectional thickness is greater than any other area of the magazine. Toth Tool & Engineering has designed our stainless steel front locking lug so that it is integral with the feed lip reinforcement (Patent Pending), eliminating the need to attach the front locking lug to the spine of the magazine. Don't be fooled by the marketing hype from the competition or the nostalgia of import polymer magazines, only Toth Tool & Engineering offers an affordable fully reinforced polymer AK magazine.This magazine is made entirely in the USA, and when installed in your rifle, counts toward three 922(r) compliant parts.Features Include:300 series stainless steel reinforced feed lips with integral front locking point (Patent Pending)300 series stainless steel rear locking lug and floor plate17-7 stainless steel magazine spring for improved spring life and corrosion resistanceProprietary polymer composite magazine body constructionAnti tilt follower design"

F, M, IC are included. The gun looks pristine, and I can't tell if it is original and hardly ever used, or if it was restored by an expert gunsmith. It has a few hard to discern handling marks, but otherwise looks unfired. Blueing perfect, no blemishes or repairs on metal, pheasant and duck engravings sharp and clear. A nice light gun, but with more swing weight than the 26 inch barrels you often see. It is yet another safe queen because I do not do upland hunting, and I need to finance a major project in 2018 that involves some activity with one serious big bore rifle. FTF in the Ann Arbor, Chelsea, or Manchester area. Meet my price and I willt throw in a couple of boxes of both lead and steel shells. Small game season is coming, and these do not come up for sale that often."

Smaller, lighter and thinner than XDS-45 and M&P-45 Shield!!
Highly praised double action trigger.
Match Grade rifling for increased velocity and accuracy.
Extremely high quality. 100% American Made #MAGA.
Up for sale is a Kahr PM45 with less than 1000 rounds fired through it for only $500! It comes with the original case and two 5-round magazines, plus, I will throw in an extended 7-round magazine and a box of Hornady hollow points for free! That is a $65 value. This firearm is in near mint condition, it has no hidden issues, no rust and the rifling is mint.
This is the “P” series, not the economical “C” series. The P series is extremely underrated and outclasses all other pocket .45’s in terms of size, quality, performance and value.
The Barrel: The most important feature on the P series is the Match Grade polygonal rifling, which increases velocity and makes this tiny powerhouse extremely accurate at longer distances. It is machined from a 30” long by 3” diameter proprietary steel billet, and can easily handle +P ammo.
The trigger cocking system is unique to Kahr. Pulling the slide back cocks the firing pin half way, and then pulling the trigger brings it back the rest of the way, which gives this gun the smoothest double action trigger you have ever fired. Guaranteed! And the brushed stainless steel trigger is a dream compared to the plastic triggers on lower quality competitors.
The Slide: An astounding 1.01 inches wide is machined from a 416 stainless steel bar stock, and laser engraved in beautiful detail.
The Slide Stop: is machined from proprietary steel instead of metal-injection molded making it stronger and more durable.
Other Specs:
Barrel length: 3.24 inches
Height: 4.49 inches
Weight: 17.3oz
Caliber: .45 ACP
Capacity: 5+1
Operation: Double Action Only Striker fire
 
This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to test the gun. Please include your phone number when replying to this ad and I will get back to you same day. Thanks for looking."

CZ's newest and first striker fired pistol. It's in MINT-LIKE NEW condition in factory case w/all paperwork. Only put one 50rd box of Federal American Eagle 115gr FMJ and one 25rd box of Hornady Critical Duty 135gr +P Flex-lok. Ran flawlessly and one of the most accurate pistols right out of the box I've seen. This gun was built to compete with the Glock 19 which it does extremely well and then some right out of the box. Really nice trigger, smooth with clean break at 4-4.5lbs and nice crisp positive reset much shorter than factory Glock. About the same size as the G19 so many aftermarket accessories like holsters made for G19 will work with the P-10C. Came with 3-dot phosphorescent sights (glows when exposed to light) and 2 15rd magazines. Ergonomics are fantastic with this gun! Includes 3 swappable backstraps for custom fit to your hands. The frame grip texture is fairly aggressive, I added a set of Talon custom grip overlays that feel great and guarantee firm grip traction during long range sessions or with wet/sweaty hands. They can be easily removed, leaving no residue whatsoever. Also added Arachnoid Grips Slide Spider which provides that same grip texture to help racking the slide with wet/sweaty hands. Also easily removed leaving no sticky residue. Will throw in an extra 15rd magazine along with a like new Comp-Tac Infidel Ultra-Max IWB Holster that gives nice solid click when inserted for excellent retention yet very quick and smooth to draw. Not looking for trades at this time.With well over $120 in extras, price is firm and more than fair."

It also feels identical to a 1911, which is why I purchased the gun to begin with. Night sights are also super bright and fun to look at and play with at night. It comes with a Gander Mountain extended warranty which gets signed over to you from me with the paperwork, the case, the factory holster, 2 magazines which are 7 round and a 6 round, the instructions, I'm also throwing in a clipdraw(a belt clip you can mount under the handgrip to carry without a holster), and an Uncle Mike's IWB nylon holster. Please email if interested, serious inquries only. Keep in mind the gun looks brand new, not a single scuff or any discoloration even on the barrel and slide."

Has approximitaly 100 rounds through it from the sighting in process with both the aftermarket iron sights and the Trijicon. Also installed is the Overwatch DAT trigger. From the Overwatch website:""The broad, flat face of the trigger allows a uniquely self-correcting, straight rearward press. Trigger reach is shortened by 0.24"", making this an ideal option for smaller statured shooters. Pre-travel has been reduced as much as possible without compromising firearm safety features, resulting in a clean, crisp break, and reduced overtravel. Robar's NP3 plating provides virtually impermeable corrosion resistance and smooth, grit-free operation.""I am willing to uninstall the trigger for a $100 dollar subtraction from the asking price and will reinstall the factory trigger. I am also willing to subtract 300 for the removal of just red dot, or for just the handgun itself without the trigger or red dot I will sell for 500. What's included are: Glock 17 G4 MOS edition           ($600)Overwatch Precision DAT trigger ($135)Trijicon RMR06                          ($450)Outlaw kydex holster                 ($40)Magpul 21 round 9mm pmag      ($20)Three factory 17 round magsGlock box and mag loader All in total is over $1200 dollars worth of gun that is fully sighted in and has an already installed trigger package. At 900 asking I won't be negotiating price unless you really want the trigger removed. Also please don't gripe if you can get some of the parts for a couple dollars less online as you still get 200 less than the NIB value and that's not even counting shipping costs."

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round and another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.Features:Caliber: .380 ACPCapacity: 6+1Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnectBarrel: 2.58"", Conventional Rifling, 1 - 16 right-hand twistLength O/A: 4.96""Height: 3.9""Slide Width: .75""Weight: Pistol 10.2 ounces (w/o magazine) Grips: Textured polymerSights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sightFinish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slideMagazine: 1 - 6 rd, Stainless"
