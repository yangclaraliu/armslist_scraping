This pistol is like new , in the hardcase with (3) magazines included, and factory marked Trijicon night sights!  If you know anything about FNH, they are nothing but quality! Not only does FNH own Winchester, and they own Browing as well.. But They supply 70% of the worlds millitary and LE with FNH firearms. The FNS-40 is a commercial, Law enforcement,  and millitary tested pistol at over 400,000 rounds without a single failure through a single pistol. There is a reason why, the FBI believes in the .40 caliber round, it shoots faster then most, specially designed to shoot through barriers, cars, planes, and houses. But still tracking straight to stop a suspect but without losing power. It was developed in 1990! Not the 1900's.

I own (2) FNH FNS-40's, and I really only use one of them.  This specific one has been shot exactly 350 times.  It remaines in mint condition without a single scratch. I have documented, and have documentation of all of the types of ammo shot through it, with dates.

The Firepower of the “Spencer” Carbines was apparent in the action at  Parker’s Store in the densely wooded area of the Wilderness on the morning on May 5, 1864.
The 500 members of the Fifth New York Cavalry dismounted and formed a loose skirmish line, and there they were attacked by a division of Confederate infantry. 
For three hours the men of the Fifth held off the Southern attacks until they started to run out of ammunition for their Spencers, which forced the Federals to pull back. 
The Confederates with Single Shot Sharps opposing them believed that they had been fighting an entire brigade. The Fifth New York suffered about 80 casualties in the action.
The Seven Shot ""Spencers"" made the Single Shot ""Sharps""Obsolete. 
The Same way the ""Sharps"" had made the Muskets Obsolete.
 The field reports from 10 officers of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry rated the Spencer Carbine the Best Firearm in Cavalry service. Brevet Maj. Gen. James Wilson felt that the Spencers were the Best Firearms ever put into the hands of the Soldier. 
He stated the Spencer Excels all others in use durability, rapidity of fire, and effectiveness.
Then came the New Model 1865 Spencer Carbines
Fall of 1864 and the early months of 1865 saw major changes to the Spencer Carbines being delivered on existing Army contracts, resulting in a nomenclature change to the Model 1865. In November 1864, the Ordnance Dept. directed that the carbines be chambered for the new standard rimfire round, .56-50, replacing the .56-56. 
The new .56-50 ammunition could chamber in the older M1860 carbines, but the earlier .56-56 would not chamber in the new carbines. The .56-50-chambered guns were stamped on the receiver “Model 1865,” and the barrel length was shortened to 20 inches.

I am not willing to break the package up. The package comes with:

-HK USP .45 V1 (a HK armorer can easily switch versions - DAO, SAO, decock only, etc.)
4 factory 10 round magazines (new these mags are $55 ea at Midway)
-UTL (marked HK and made by Insight specifically for the USP) - you can see it is working in the photos
-Safariland 6004 holster (only holds USP)
-factory cases for both USP and UTL and factory manual for UTL
-Original factory 3 dot sights (Installed MTM night sights are faded)
-1 set of surefire batteries (batteries were only used to take the photos)

For a while, this was my night stand gun. I bought the holster as an impulse purchase. I probably put the USP in the holster a handful of times to try it out, and that was about it. It has never been carry weapon and has only been shot at a range using factory ammo.

The UTL has been stored with the batteries removed so there is no corrosion in the battery compartment. CR123 batteries have a 10+ year shelf life, so the odds of a 123 battery corroding in the compartment is pretty slim anyways.

I am the first owner of the pistol. I never thought I would sell it so I never kept a round count. This USP is a safe queen, and I've never even come close to dishing out what it is capable of taking (although there really aren't many people in the world that are physically capable of doing that). In short, I don't have the $ to have safe queens anymore (wives will do that to you), so to get something new I've got to get rid of something. Since I haven't taken the USP out in a very long time, it is the one to go.

If there's anything else you want to know about the pistol (date code, etc.), let me know and I'll see what I can do. I could go on about how this pistol was ahead of its time when it came out (and in many respects still is).  
you can reached me @REDACTED.

This pistol has had between 200 and 250 rounds fired through it. Function has been 100% with the factory magazines. When I used the magazine extensions I got consistent double feeds at first.

BERETTA 1955. The gun has seen heavy use but fires, cycles and functions with no problems. It comes with 1 single stack original Beretta Mag. This gun has some history and is a fun gun to shoot.  

The pistol was Beretta's first locked breech design on the market (previous semi-automatic pistols were all blowback-operated) and was in limited production circa 1953 and in full-scale production in 1956 until 1980. The initial production batch featured a lightweight alloy frame, which proved to be unable to withstand the shock of the relatively high-powered 9mm Parabellum round in the long run. This was replaced by the 'second series' model with a steel frame that proved to be totally adequate in endurance. The steel-framed version was nearly 250 grams heavier than the alloy version, but the balance was improved. A special version of this second series (the ""Egyptian Contract"" model 951) was modified according to the wishes of the military of the Egyptian Arab Republic. Approximately 50,000 Egyptian Contract 951s were produced. Its particular modifications included larger sights, a simplified, narrower grip and external ""thumb-spring"" magazine release, rather than the push-button release in the lower-right grip of all other 951 versions. Beretta was in competition with Tokarev to become the primary supplier of sidearms to the new Egyptian republic. Despite intense pressure and incentives from the Soviet bloc, the Egyptians appreciated the 9mm Beretta's accuracy, power and uncanny reliability in desert conditions, and consequently, the Hungarian ""Tokagypt"" was produced in comparatively small quantities.

I think this pistol is also known as or cousins to the M951 ""Brigadier"" on the civilian market."

The ACOG's are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG's combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although the ACOG's have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions -- without failure-prone batteries.

This model has the highest magnification in the series, with performance just below the well proven 4x32 or 3.5x35 models in a more compact unit. The magnification significantly aids in detecting and identifying partially hidden targets out to 300 m or beyond.
