READ THE AD.Read the entire ad before contacting someone. This should be self explanatory.2. LOWBALLING.Negotiating a fair price with someone is one thing, offering them half their asking price is just disrespectful. Do your research and be reasonable with your offers.3. BOTTOM DOLLAR.Refer to #2. Asking this basically means ""stand by for lowballing."" Don't waste people's time with this.4. NO TRADES.When someone puts this in their ad, it generally means they are not interested in trades of ANY kind. Assume that your item is no exception. While ultimately harmless, unsolicited trade offers are still rude and irritating.5. ""I SEEN IT CHEAPER.""We're not stupid. If you had in fact found it cheaper, you would have bought it there. Armslist is not a Wal-Mart, there is no price-match guarantee. 6. PACKAGE DEALS.If someone is selling a gun, optic or other item with accessories specific to their item, do not expect them to sell the main item separately for a reduced price. If you don't have a use for it, they probably don't either, especially if they sell the item it goes to.7. FOLLOW THROUGH.More of a common courtesy thing, but worth mentioning. If you tell someone you're interested and then change your mind, please let them know. It only takes a few seconds to send an email or text and tell them you went a different route. Telling someone you want to buy their stuff and then just blowing them off is not cool.Thanks for reading, stay safe and have a nice day."

The soft armor vest is XL and covers front and under arm sides with 15% more coverage then any other xl soft vest on the market. The Kevlar panels Will stop a 44 magnum and a 12 gauge slug and buckshot. Heavy duty Velcro straps 2 on each side and one on each top ( shoulders). Breathable mesh fabric inside. Removable cover for easy cleaning and has front and back hard plate 10x12 pouches which when installed brings it up to level 4 protection which will stop a 30-06 armor piercing round and stop spalling which very few hardplates do. Spalling is what happens when a bullet hits a piece of steel. The bullet explodes into tiny extremely sharp pieces of brass and lead and spreads straight around the plate moving very fast around the plate These pieces ( spalling) will spray right up into your neck, arms, legs, face, which will cause severe injury, if not death. this plate can take multiple hits from a 30-06 while holding every shard of the bullet. Both the hardplate and soft armor are brand new never worn purchased last year. Manufacturing dates are  7/21/2016 for the soft kevlar panels and 9/14/2016 for the hard plate. . Also the company safelife will replace the vest/ hardplate for free for life, yes free for life if you are ever shot while wearing it. They are the only company that will replace any body armor product for life for free if it ever saves your life. You do have to include a police report to receive the replacement so don't take it to the range and shoot it. No trades cash only. Body armor hard and soft is fully legal in mass as long as you are not a convicted felon. There is no way for myself to tell if someone is a convicted felon so buyer must have a FID or LTC to purchase."

This rifle is a milled reciever with a *straight* barrel. This rifle does come with the original wood furniture as well as the Primary arms advanced Micro dot (50k hours battery life). The two best things honestly about this rifle is the trigger (which feels amazing) and the mag release. If you are looking to get into the AK game this is a perfect place to start. This rifle will also come with a BattleComp USA muzzle devise. Ask around or look it up. It is a top tier muzzle devise, and makes recoil dissappear. This rifle is sighted in at 100 yards and is extremely accurate for an AK (1-1.5"" MOA) consistant on a bench rest. I will include two 30 round magazines.  I will only sell this rifle to valid CCW permit holders.

I belive this to be a Smoot No. 2, as the loading rod is held in by  pin rather than a screw, and it does not have the rotating loading gate. The finish is worn, but the rubber grips are quite nice. The biggest issue with the revolver is postentailly a broken mainspring. THe revolver locks up, and cocking the hammer will spin the cylinder, but there is no force to bring the hammer down. A neat little piece that could be a fun project to work on, or possibly used for parts for a nicer frame smoot. I've had this piece sitting on my shelf for quite a while now, and I'd just like to move on to a different project. Right now I am really interested in trades, I am particulallry interested in older military pieces. But feel free to make me an offer, the worst I can say is no. I know this won't fetch anywhere near the grand that some of the smoots seem to go for on gunbroker, but I also don't want to give it away. Shoot me an email if you have an questions. I am not an expert on the poiece, but I can try to figure it out! I also have other pictures, but it only let me post one."

They are mighty and heavy, like the heroic armies of the great Stalin!  The tripod is is sturdy, but not so mighty as the great ZSU Anti-mean-flyingthing-device, so it does work, but don't expect miracles, you capitalist dog!Truly, this is a nice piece of militaria, and in it's own right can be used as a passable spotting scope for medium range target shooting, or bird watching, or commie neighbor watching, or whatever. Don't try to mount it to your .22, it'll probably bend the barrel down toward the ground under it's great weight.  It is armored against puny western handgun fire and explosive flak of the weak and anemic variety favored by western imperialst capitalist pig militaries, when they can be bothered to get up from their TV Dinners and pull the trigger on inferior weaponry made by H&K, over on the other side of the wall.  I SPEET ON THEM!;)I'd be interested to hear what you might have to trade, but I'm really looking for a high magnification riflescope, Preferably something in HD glass, 20+ magnification preferred, but yes, I'd be open to many other offers, especially if you have a cheap pickup I can drive.   I can add trade up a few hundred by throwing in a shotgun this, or ammo that, or something, but not really into giving more cash out at the moment.812447868O (don't call after 8pm, and especially don't call if you wish to slander the great Heroes and macroaggressors of the Fatherland-- Vlad Stalin, Vlad Lenin, and Vlad Dracul ) !!!!  P.s.   It is okay if you wish to Text your vile dog vomit, as all such decrepit western tricks are immediately traced by KGB and GRU, to be followed by non-immediate (possibly non-eventual) Spetznaz deployment to your safespace! Spasiba!P.s.s.  The Infertile western capitalist pig software called Armslist cannot orient a simple russian picture correctly, probably because they hired French  programmers, and so the last pic is laying down.  Thees ees vy ve vil triumph in ze end, and you will kneel before the manly Putin!  HA!"

This is a Mossberg 500 Combo, but with an additional barrel so you can leave your favorite choke combo and sight setup alone. I used it for deer, turkey and upland bird, no problem. Includes sights, scope ramp, chokes as shown in photo. This is a really nice piece - you can own the three barrel setup for the cost of two. 
I have had the trigger professionally honed and the spring replaced. It is very clean and light, yet still safe. Because of unpacking from my move, I do not have the factory trigger spring in hand, but I will forward it to the buyer when I do locate it.

(Invested $800+ with all the work and supplies at gunsmith/FFL cost. You can't buy a reliable 1200 yard rifle on $4xx-ish with glass at a store, so jump on this!)
Rifle has hit the steel at over 1200 yards.More stuff from my safe that I'm selling because I'm not going to be using it in my new home here in Washington:
This is a custom Remington I built when I was in the Marines with my friend who was an armorer so we could compete in the 1760 yds (ONE MILE) shooting competition. The furthest we ended up scoping and shooting to was 1250 before I moved, but it was still quite fun!
Rifle is based on a new Remington 770 -- barrel is floated off the stock, the torques are set properly, the stock is filled for vibration dampening, it has a nice trigger job, removable muzzle break, polished bolt, bolt was fitted to barrel and lugs, spaced and timed, barrel is crowned, there is a 20moa scope ramp (you can take this off) on QD rings, the scope (U.S. Optics or U.S. something, I don't have the box and can't find it, as I'm moving and unpacking right now) is a nice three-color mil-dot reticle 4 to 16 power 60mm objective with sun visor and caps, 9-11"" tilting bipod, wheeler scope level bubble, Voodoo ammo pouch and cheek rest (set up for south paw shooting, but is easily swapped to right hand with a few velcro straps).
The muzzle break is AMAZING. There is nearly zero recoil on this rilfe. I have owned three 7mm Rem Mags and never tamed it down so much. That's why I used this break. I heard nothing but zany reviews about it and they were all right. 
Super-low round count, all reloading and ballistic data is available. Reloading measurements, logs, recipies, supplies and materials are available for purchase separately. Logbooks will stay with me - the zero will change with the new shooter anyway. The ballistics tablet and software are available for purchase.
I also keep getting trolls asking to part this rifle out piece by piece for the optics, this-or-that, or the muzzle break. NO - IT WON'T happen gents, just buy the whole thing please! Wow, it's cheap and I just want to unload this extra stuff from the safe because I'm not using it to someone who would enjoy it. I can't sell someone else ""most of a rifle"" if I sell you some of this rifle on the side."
