This 10/22 with a scope was acquired in the early 90’s, used for rabbits and squirrels for a couple years and then has been stored since. I haven’t used it for years so I figured it was time to sell it. I did take it to the range the other day and found it still to be the tack driver I remembered. The barrel and action are in excellent shape and the stock is in very good condition showing minor field use, with no major scratches. Comes with two 10 rd mags and one 25 rd mag. One mag is in great condition, the other two need springs. The scope is a 2x6x32 All-Pro. Got it when I acquired the Ruger. It isn't a high end scope, but always held zero and worked well for me. At the moment, it is zeroed for 50yrds. Comes with a soft carrying case."

In addition, it has a full set of Invector Plus Extended choke tubes, a custom modified stock, and unmodified figured walnut stock.  The stock was modified to increase the drop at the heel which is much more comfortable for taller or ""long neck"" shooters.  I have actually had many compliments on the mod, people think it looks cool.  I just liked it cause it fit me better.   This gun has been well cared for but I have done a lot of upland hunting with it so the modified stock and forend does show some wear but I haven't done much target shooting so the round count is pretty low.  The unmodified stock has hardly been out of the case and is almost flawless with nice figuring."

The cocked-and-locked single action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.   - Microcompact Frame   - Slim and Lightweight 9mm   - Single-action Only   - Ambidextrous Safety   - Sig Lite Night Sights   - 7 + 1 round capacity   - Stainless slide with black frame/grips   CalibersUSA.com"

This was my first (and only) rifle and has spent most of its time just in a case, but it shoots great and is good for a first rifle.

A new retainer can be acquired from Century Arms or other gun retailers, I do not like the gun enough to go through the hassle though.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

I was very excited about the gun, as it had only one previous owner, had fired fewer than 50 rounds and is a terrifically expensive pistol, priced when new at about $1,800. Functionally it's a perfect pistol. Look up the Grand Raptor 2, and you'll find nothing but lavish praise online. It's about as reliable a pistol as you could ever hope to find, and it's incredibly well built. But to me, form doesn't always follow function, so I'll tell you what I wasn't told in advance of my trade: The gun was carried and suffered some holster wear. There are small scratches on the slide and frame. It doesn't look brand new. I should've expected that from a gun made of highly polished stainless steel, but I didn't. That shouldn't matter, right? But it does to me. When I look at it, all I see are the cosmetic flaws (which you may be able to see in the close-up photos above). So my perfectionism is my loss and your gain. Somebody's going to get a killer pistol for a reduced price. Here are some of the things I overlook about it because I'm so short-sighted and stupid: Tritium sights, mostly all steel construction, skeletonized trigger (with a perfect, perfect 4- to 5-pound pull), raptor ""scales"" incorporated into the design of the slide and frame and backstrap, three magazines, all the stuff from the factory, a match grade 5-inch barrel, ambidextrous thumb safety, grip safety, two sets of grips (original rosewood and a pachy set), two holsters, about 75 rounds and all the Kimber American-made know-how that we've all come to love and expect from the brand. I'm asking $1,400. If I don't get that much or something really close, I'll send it back to Kimber for refinishing ... and keep it. I'm mainly interested in cash because tax season has left my accounts lower than they've been in a decade or more, but I will consider trades that are advantageous to me. Just because all I focus on are the little scratches, it doesn't mean I don't know the value of the weapon underneath. Want higher quality photos? Have questions? Send me an email. I don't give out my cell number in public ads, but I'll send it to you at your emailed request. Thanks."

The frame is made of polymer with an aluminum insert, and the slide and barrel are steel. It is the lightest production .380 ACP pistol in the world,[1] weighing only 8.3 oz (240 g) empty, and is roughly the same size as many .22 and .25-caliber pistols. Design  The P-3AT cartridge capacity is 6+1, and trigger pull is 5 lb (22 N). These attributes have made it popular for citizens with concealed carry permits and with police officers as a back-up or off-duty pistol. The P-3AT lacks any sort of slide stop—it was omitted in order to keep the size similar to the P-32. The similar size and weight of the P-3AT results in increased felt recoil over the P-32 due to the more powerful .380 ACP cartridge (the P-32 fires the smaller .32 ACP cartridge). The first generation has a traditional external extractor parallel to the side of the gun, while the second generation has a button-head hex screw to the rear of the extractor, which is at an angle to the side of the gun. In a Guns & Ammo review, Wiley Clapp said, ""Ingenuity is often nothing more than a combination of existing principles applied in unique ways. Kel-Tec's new P-3AT has no single feature that is not established in modern pistol design, yet it has no competition in its niche."

The bolt has had the ""hold open"" modification and is, therefore, not in its original configuration. This is only a problem for the purists. The bolt functions fine and the number still matches the rest of the gun. One spiral connector on the sling is bent.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.This CCP comes in stylish Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.FeaturesFront Sight with White DotPicatinny RailSmooth TriggerReversible Magazine ReleaseThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The gun comes with two magazines, the gun lock, the safety and instruction manual, cleaning brush and the original hard plastic carrying case."
