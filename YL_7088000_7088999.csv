Chambered in .223/5.56×45 and using the ubiquitous STANAG magazine from the AR15/M16, it easily accepts optics and lights on its top and bottom Picatinny rails. An effective two-port muzzle brake helps keep the pistol solidly on target and reduces recoil and muzzle flip.UPC: 806703913629"

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa. The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before.UPC: 806703910864"

The Glock I've had less than a year and always treated it well, never dropped, always cleaned, and, you know, it's a Glock so there's virtually no ""wear and tear"" to it regardless. It looks new, and functions perfectly. Funtionality with the threaded barrel is different, mainly slower slide recoil. I haven't tested to see the difference in acuracy between barrels but with the original barrel you can easily shoot a target acurrately about 70 meters give or take (I didn't measure distance, but much further than any shooting range) away consistantly on a windy day within the radius of a torso with decent marksmenship skill. If you want to snipe with a handgun, this is it. It will also come with an adjestable holster that funtions well enough if you don't have one. P.S. if you want a holster for this gun specifically, you may have to get a custom one because it's huge. Best use is for target shooting, or hunting."
