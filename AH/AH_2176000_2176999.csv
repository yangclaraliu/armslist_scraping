It's an early RGuns imported rifle in a beautiful post war laminated stock. It's rare to find a round receiver PE sniper as by 1937+ they had moved on to the PEM and by 1942 the PU sniper rifles. So most PE snipers are Hex Receivers and this is a Round last year PE Top Mount sniper. All the serial numbers are stamped matching and the action is smooth in cycling the bolt.

 BERETTA NANO 3"" COMPACT 9MM
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

    I can refinish those stocks and make them look better than they did new, I can use a polyurethane finish in a High gloss, Medium gloss, or Satin, this finish will be beautiful and will stand up to anything you will reasonably put it through. I do not add stain unless the customer asks for it, I don't recommend stain because it can make the grain cloudy.

     I can also do a Hand-Rubbed, Boiled Linseed Oil finish, while not as durable as a Polyurethane finish, it is very good looking and will make the natural grain stand out. this finish is not recommended for hunting guns or any guns that will be exposed to excessive moisture.

     Pricing starts at $100 for a base polyurethane finish for an uncheckered stock, this means I will chemically strip the existing finish and apply a poly of your choice, the grain will be unfilled, but still visually appealing and durable. additional add-ons are as follows:
for stocks with checkering, add $20, for a total of $120.
for stain, any color of your choosing, add $5.
for filled grain (this makes the surface as smooth as glass), add $20.
or if you don't want a polyurethane finish, a hand rubbed BLO finish is $100. 

     If you send me pictures we can discuss pricing if there is heavy wear on the stock and it needs repairs.

Original photographs from ww2
 You simply can not go somewhere and buy one of these like a lot of military collectibles
 I am relinquishing parts of my ww2 collection so that others may enjoy them.
 This is an alligator skinned leather photo album from the tours of the very first anti aircraft/anti tank unit that Germany created for world war two
 I Flak/Regt 5 
 Alligator skin/leather is in really good shape for it's age and you have to see it to appreciate it.It has a leather strip tied that is binding the pages to the album.Pages are in great shape and still have the onion paper dividers so the pictures don't stick together.
 I have all of the photos removed so they can be viewed without man handling the album it self.(almost 100 pictures)
 There were only six of these units created and they never existed before ww2.This was the very first unit created and remained in service the longest (unit created 10 January,1935 and remained in service until the end of the war in 1945)
 http://www.ww2.dk/ground/flak/flargt5.html
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_corps 
 This album chronicles the units tours through the war.

 Some of the pictures are nicely captioned and dated and include pictures of bombed and burnt out vehicles,artillery,soldiers digging graves and trenches,the huge range finders they used and also a lot of candid shots of the soldiers smiling and having fun playing soccer in the dirt,stacks of wine bottles,playing music ,hanging out in their field tents,etc

 Anyway,i have decided to let this piece go.This is a must have for anybody who is a ww2 buff.Like I said before,this is simply not something you can go out and buy and there will NEVER be another one

 I have added a few pictures here but can take and email more although it would be best to meet and let you see it in person.

The target was shot off hand and at 20 yards. Gun is deffinately capable of shooting way better than me. Since I have been hounded to ship this I will ship but shipping will be a bit costly due to the ammo weight. For me to ship this it will be 45$ to ship the gun and accessories only. Ammo will be  close to that I gues. To be safe if you want it all plan on 100$ for shipping. If it is less I will include a refund in the boxes you get. For those of you that live near Erie or meadville. I have family near there that I see fairly frequently and could meet you near those places.

I am selling my VERY lightly used Sterling .25acp mouse gun. I have put about 50 rounds through it total since having it. I picked it up when i was on a very tight budget as a last ditch HD pistol My collection has since outgrown it. It has never not gone pop when i have pulled the trigger. The pistol comes with a box of .25 (easily $20.00 by today's prices). One grip is slightly loose, but other than that the pistol is really in great shape. If you would like additional pics just ask and i would be more than happy to oblige. Comes in original box, 1 mag, and 1 box S&B .25ACP. Must have valid FOID and be willing to sign bill of sale.  I am pretty realistic, i know this is no Sig, Glock or Beretta. If you are on a budget and would still like to be able to protect your homestead (.25 is better than a sharp stick), or even a BOB gun to throw in the trunk(what i used it for) this is one of the more cost effective options."

I am selling another of my mouse guns, I also have a separate listing for a Sterling .25. I picked this up a little over a year ago new. Surprisingly accurate for a little gun, and this would make an excellent CC gun for those on a tight budget.  This pistol comes with the original box, 1 Box .22lr and one factory mag. Just like my other Mouse gun this one just really does not fit my collection anymore. If you would like additional pics or info please feel free to ask."

The Bushmaster Carbon-15 is a light weight modernization of the standard AR-15 utilizing space age composite material for both the upper and lower receivers. Stronger and nearly 40% lighter than aluminum, the Carbon-15 receivers are also nearly impervious to weather, moisture and the usual scuffs, scratches, and dents for improved durability as well.

The TAC-WARFARE SOPMOD(1A) is fully equipped! INCLUDES: a complete sight/optics system that adapts instantly to any shooting situation for maximum versatility: In addition to the security provided by a flip-up back-up sight, this system also incorporates a rugged, battle-ready red-dot scope co-witnessed on matching twist-off mounts with weatherproof 3x magnifier for improved target acquisition and accuracy at medium to long range. Further enhancing CQB capabilities: included; the center-line mounted high-powered light/laser, within easy reach of the Magpul AFG2 (angled fore grip), allowing for lightning fast activation engaged via constant on/off button, or via momentary on/off pressure switch. The XM15 ""TWE"" has also been adapted for a single-point sling with an ambidextrous attachment end plate and includes a high quality adjustable single-point bungee sling. To decrease weight and improve comfort and handling the Tactical Warfare Edition also features a Magpul MOE Plus grip, Magpul XTM enhanced rail covers, and a Magpul polymer 30 round PMAG.

Includes case with lock and 20-rounds of Federal Premium Low-Recoil Personal Defense hollow-point ammo.

ONLY 100 ROUNDS DOWN THE BARREL!

NOTE: Picture #3 shows everything except one of the 10-round magazines. I was planning on selling it separately, but have decided to bundle it with this sale. So this sale included 3 mags: two 10 round mags and one 8 round mag.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Features & System Characteristics:

o Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
o Grooved target triggers
o Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
o Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
o Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
o Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
o One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
o No snag, bobbed hammer
o Flared recurve trigger guard
o Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
o Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
o Ambidextrous magazine release lever
o Contoured, extended slide release
o Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
o Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

It can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" (see photos) to facilitate secure storage or concealment. The Red Lion Precision (RLP) items are EXTREMELY hard to come by and took me over 6 months on a waiting list to receive. The rifle now includes a brand new Madhouse Design DSS Dual Sight System ($140) which is a scope riser and carry handle in one. This allows for true co-witness functionality utilizing the Red Lion hard sight for close quarters and the Vortex sight for long range shooting. The Vortex sight is both a red-dot reticle and includes a 2x multiplier attachment. May be interested in part or full trade of Springfield EMP, CZ 75 BD or P09 pistols. Possible trade for high quality target rifles in .338 Lapua, .308 or 300 Win Mag calibers. Call Mike @ REDACTED - *UPDATE* I can now take credit cards for full price only!

I can refinish those stocks and make them look better than they did new, I can use a polyurethane finish in a High gloss, Medium gloss, or Satin, this finish will be beautiful and will stand up to anything you will reasonably put it through. I do not add stain unless the customer asks for it, I don't recommend stain because it can make the grain cloudy.

I can also do a Hand-Rubbed, Boiled Linseed Oil finish, while not as durable as a Polyurethane finish, it is very good looking and will make the natural grain stand out. this finish is not recommended for hunting guns or any guns that will be exposed to excessive moisture.

Pricing starts at $100 for a base polyurethane finish for an uncheckered stock, this means I will chemically strip the existing finish and apply a poly of your choice, the grain will be unfilled, but still visually appealing and durable. additional add-ons are as follows:
for stocks with checkering, add $20, for a total of $120.
for stain, any color of your choosing, add $5.
for filled grain (this makes the surface as smooth as glass), add $20.
or if you don't want a polyurethane finish, a hand rubbed BLO finish is $100. 

If you send me pictures we can discuss pricing if there is heavy wear on the stock and it needs repairs.

I can refinish those stocks and make them look better than they did new, I can use a polyurethane finish in a High gloss, Medium gloss, or Satin, this finish will be beautiful and will stand up to anything you will reasonably put it through. I do not add stain unless the customer asks for it, I don't recommend stain because it can make the grain cloudy.

I can also do a Hand-Rubbed, Boiled Linseed Oil finish, while not as durable as a Polyurethane finish, it is very good looking and will make the natural grain stand out. this finish is not recommended for hunting guns or any guns that will be exposed to excessive moisture.

Pricing starts at $100 for a base polyurethane finish for an uncheckered stock, this means I will chemically strip the existing finish and apply a poly of your choice, the grain will be unfilled, but still visually appealing and durable. additional add-ons are as follows:
for stocks with checkering, add $20, for a total of $120.
for stain, any color of your choosing, add $5.
for filled grain (this makes the surface as smooth as glass), add $20.
or if you don't want a polyurethane finish, a hand rubbed BLO finish is $100. 

If you send me pictures we can discuss pricing if there is heavy wear on the stock and it needs repairs.

813,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2176813,For Sale:  Professional Stock Refinishing,"KS, Denver, Colorado",$ 100,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 29, 2013",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Have an old stock that has seen better days? or maybe you are disappointed with your brand new rifle, most new stocks come with a cheap finish from the factory, this finish consists of a stain mixed with a sealer which hides the beautiful grain underneath, they are also weak and prone to chipping and scratches.

I can refinish those stocks and make them look better than they did new, I can use a polyurethane finish in a High gloss, Medium gloss, or Satin, this finish will be beautiful and will stand up to anything you will reasonably put it through. I do not add stain unless the customer asks for it, I don't recommend stain because it can make the grain cloudy.

I can also do a Hand-Rubbed, Boiled Linseed Oil finish, while not as durable as a Polyurethane finish, it is very good looking and will make the natural grain stand out. this finish is not recommended for hunting guns or any guns that will be exposed to excessive moisture.

Pricing starts at $100 for a base polyurethane finish for an uncheckered stock, this means I will chemically strip the existing finish and apply a poly of your choice, the grain will be unfilled, but still visually appealing and durable. additional add-ons are as follows:
for stocks with checkering, add $20, for a total of $120.
for stain, any color of your choosing, add $5.
for filled grain (this makes the surface as smooth as glass), add $20.
or if you don't want a polyurethane finish, a hand rubbed BLO finish is $100. 

If you send me pictures we can discuss pricing if there is heavy wear on the stock and it needs repairs.

Barrel is stamped Made in Japan. I traded for this; the rifle had a broken fancy VGX walnut stock. The bore is bright and clean but it looks like the rifle was put in a gun case damp at some point as the barrel exterior is rough in some places. There is some gunk buildup where the scope mounts were also. If a person was going to leave the barrel on, I believe the exterior metal could be cleaned up enough for re-blueing or it could be dura-coated with no problem."

I can refinish those stocks and make them look better than they did new, I can use a polyurethane finish in a High gloss, Medium gloss, or Satin, this finish will be beautiful and will stand up to anything you will reasonably put it through. I do not add stain unless the customer asks for it, I don't recommend stain because it can make the grain cloudy.

I can also do a Hand-Rubbed, Boiled Linseed Oil finish, while not as durable as a Polyurethane finish, it is very good looking and will make the natural grain stand out. this finish is not recommended for hunting guns or any guns that will be exposed to excessive moisture.

Pricing starts at $100 for a base polyurethane finish for an uncheckered stock, this means I will chemically strip the existing finish and apply a poly of your choice, the grain will be unfilled, but still visually appealing and durable. additional add-ons are as follows:
for stocks with checkering, add $20, for a total of $120.
for stain, any color of your choosing, add $5.
for filled grain (this makes the surface as smooth as glass), add $20.
or if you don't want a polyurethane finish, a hand rubbed BLO finish is $100. 

If you send me pictures we can discuss pricing if there is heavy wear on the stock and it needs repairs.

 I am not trying to make a dime on these, I got a GREAT DEAL and I just want to see if I can get my money back out of them. 

 I am told that the Orion Orbiter was their upper line for the two years that they made it. It was replaced with the Pro M line. I am not that familiar with Mapex drum lines. I was told that it was about $1000 when purchased new in 2006 or 2007. The drum shells are in really good shape. The only cosmetic blemishes that I have found were on the floor tom. Just a few minor dings. All the other shells are in really good condition. It has not been moved around much, The first owner did not take it to more than 3 or 4 gigs. Here is some information that I found online for the drum kit.

 The Orion Orbiter kits were a short production run of drums that Mapex used to test the waters for a series called Pro M which eventually replaced the Orion Orbiter series about a year later.
 Construction is all nine-ply maple shells and they have all professional-grade hardware, including the isolated tom mounting system, the spring-loaded feet on the floor tom, the ""virgin"" bass drum (no hole in the top for tom mount), etc.
 This is a very nice, professional level drum kit. The set is in very good condition and comes with all new Evans G2 coated heads (batter).

The serial number is 48204, which puts its manufacture in 1906. All serial numbers are matching. 

This is the Type 1 variation. It has the early Type 1 style lettering, 4"" barrel, and the fired-blue barrel takedown bushing. Grips are correct and in perfect shape.

The finish is probably 70% overall. The derioration of the bluing is most obvious on the left side of the slide, as shown in the pictures, and looks like holster wear.The right side retains around 90-95% of the original blue. All of the finish that is intact on the gun still has the same high luster that it had when it left the factory 107 years ago. I havent polished this gun at all (to keep patina), and you can still see my reflection in the finish on a cpl of the pics. A very small amount of slight pitting.

The gun is in pefect mechanical shape, and is still very tight. Action is still very smooth, and no rust inside or out.

Includes original magazine.

The bad--some minor scratching, and damage to the slidelock area. Both of these are to be expected from a 107 year old pistol though. The screw opposite the slidelock is damaged.

Overall this gun is easily a 7-7.5 out of 10. It is the lowest serial number Type 1 in this kind of shape that I have seen for sale under $1k.

There is no room for error. In twenty one hundredths of a second, the outcome is decided. In no other police encounter are the stakes this high. You get one shot. It has to be perfect. No questions. Skill, rifle and ammunition must work together to obtain the maximum result. The police marksman must know, time and again, exactly where the round will impact. That's why you choose Gold Medal® Centerfire Rifle - legendary for extreme accuracy, shot after shot, lot to lot. It has become the choice of police marksman and competition shooters alike - and for good reason. Gold Medal is made specifically for the most demanding situations. The aerodynamic design of the legendary Sierra® MatchKing® bullet helps overcome wind resistance and wind drift. This means flatter trajectory, higher downrange energy and more accurate placement. Gold Medal's brass cases, stick powders and match primers are specifically selected and engineered to deliver consistent accuracy and performance. The results speak for themselves.
