Winchester/FC/R-P - 192 pcs decapped/cleaned
Winchester/FC/R-P - 36 pcs. with spent factory primers, look to be lightly cleaned
LC69  Military         - 24 pcs. decapped, crimp removed, lightly cleaned

Large bag: 493 pcs. by my count.
Marked in pics with blue 1-F RTS (once-Fired, ready to size) otherwise unprocessed except that all have been decapped and they have been polished nicely after decapping (probably a few years ago as the shine is starting to darken a bit). These are all in great shape. These consist of the following headstamps: 
Winchester/FC/R-P - cleaned, primer pockets brushed, polished...ready to size and load.
Military - also a few LC69, WCC56, TW54 with the crimp removed, also ready to size and load.


These two bags-o-brass total ALMOST 750 pcs (745) and even though some of the prep work is done, I will sell these at current range brass prices.

$90.00 CASH takes all this nice 30.06 brass home, OR $60 for the large bag and $30 for the smaller bag.
I will ship all in a large Priority bulk rate box for an additional $16.00 conus (insurance extra) if you live outside of the area.


Nice brass, really nice price. Thanks for looking."

The SR40c is the compact version of the recoil reducing, striker-fired SR40 pistol, one of the slimmest and most ergonomic full-sized .40 caliber pistols on the market today. The SR40c is based on the same high-performance, glass-filled nylon frame as those used on the popular SR9, SR9c and SR40 pistols, offering the same, great ergonomic features, including a slim frame, short trigger reach, reversible backstrap, and ambidextrous controls. The SR40c features a through-hardened, stainless steel slide or alloy steel slide with Nitridox Pro Black finish. Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9c, the SR40c's custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. Its raked-forward front sight allows for easy removal from the holster and the rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable while the front sight is windage adjustable. Other features include an integral accessory rail, retraction grooves, an ambidextrous thumb safety and d-shaped magazine release, and a reverse backstrap. Retail Price $549

Keep in mind if you don't already know most of your camouflage when wearing a ghillie suit comes from your surroundings and is added to the suit on site. The suits main purpose is to break up your body shape. This suit is ideal for woodland but works great in many environments. Burlap can always be removed/moved/or added to fit your situation.  This suit has been sprayed with flame retardant but it was several months ago and I am not sure of the effective shelf life. Made by my good friend from 10th Mountain after he completed sniper school, I've played around with it a couple times to test it. Its comfortable and very effective when used properly!

 TOP/BLOUSE: Medium/Regular, BDU base with added armpit and back ventilation. Water proof duffel bag fabric was sewn to cover the front torso and elbows/forearms for extra protection and durability from the environments. The duffel material has been painted to further break up your image. A high strength thread was used and covered by a less visible Shoe Goo like material to further protect the stitching. The burlap covers from base of the collar to the bottom of the butt depending on your height for a smooth transition to the pants. A chest pocket has been sewn on at each cuff/wrist for easy access while laying in the prone.

 BOTTOM/TROUSERS: BDU base, I believe them to be Medium/Regular but they fit a little long on the legs so they could be M/L which isn't a bad thing as they don't crawl up on your legs when laying in the prone, and can be worn higher on the waist with the use of suspenders. These where made same as the blouse in regards to the duffel bag fabric and painted. The duffel material covers full front as well as the cargo pockets but was cut and sewn around the entrance of the pockets so you still have full usage of cargo's. Burlap covers from just below the belt loops to the cuff of the boot and hangs to ground level ""the length of burlap can easily be cut to accommodate how low you want it to hang to the ground. 

 HAT/Boonie: Size 7 1/2 BDU base. Net has been added at the top for extra ventilation. The veil drops down to about mid shoulder blade length and can be turned around to cover a rifle scope.

Model: Makarov

Caliber: 9mm Mak (9x18)

Location (city or county): From Ontario to Redlands/San Bernardino County

Trade: Compact/Sub-Compact semi-auto handgun

Will ship (Y/N): No

Other info: This is a Bulgarian Makarov with 'Circle 10' Military Proof Mark, made in 1980 according to the date code (HK 20 1724), and is listed to have been a limited or interrupted production year. There has been approx. ~300 rounds down the pipe and have not had a single FTF/FTE. It's in great condition with the exception of one noticeable blemish which is how I received it, caused by holster wear I imagine. 

This firearm is one of the most accurate handguns I've shot being that it has a fixed barrel (like the Hi-Point's). I have been able to key-hole targets with ease. The recoil is that of a .380 ACP pistol and is in no way 'snappy' like the Polish 64. The size of this Makarov is comparable to the barrel length of a Glock 26, but the grip length of a Glock 19 and the slimness of a Kel-tec or Ruger LC9. Makes an excellent and reliable CCW gun. 

I'm looking to trade this well kept and in good condition Bulgy Mak for a similar stature firearm of either 9mm Luger or .45 ACP, as these are my common calibers. The reason for wanting to trade is my desire to standardize my calibers, however it must be of similar size. 

Included in the trade is:
- Bulgarian Makarov
- Makarov Fobus Paddle Holster
- Five (05) Magazines (2 are brand new and need breaking in)
- Four (04) Spare Grips (Total of 5)
- Ammo: 353rnds

*122rnds Sellier & Bellot 94gr
*25rnds Hornady FTX 95gr

Not only do the pictures on here not do it justice, but they almost have a negative affect on it's appearance.   
-This Stainless Steel .22 LR Browning Buckmark comes with 
- 5 BROWNING MAGAZINES
- TRUGLO Fiber Optic Front Sight 
- An UNOPENED 400 ROUND BRICK of WINCHESTER M22 AMMUNITION. 
Even though most center fire ammo is now fairly easy to find at retail prices, 22LR rimfire is not that easy yet, but availability is definitely improving.
-I'm asking $430 so before I'm told, ""that's more than I can get a new one for"" I want to point out that additional magazines after the new one that comes with it, will cost $25-30 each. So I feel that 4 additional mags, the fiber optic front sight and 400 rounds of quality ammo makes $430 a very fair price. 

-I don’t mind shipping domestically from my FFL to your FFL, but will do so at buyer’s expense.  Should be around $35 give or take $5 for my FFL to process the transaction and ship the gun and ammo.

Have a couple of 12ga, but they are just a little more kick than I want for them.
I prefer the Remington Wingmasters or Remington 1100 models, but will consider others. I will not pay some of the crazy prices that I see on here for a used gun, but am willing to pay a fair price, or I do have some interesting gun trades that I might consider.

It was made in the early 1970’s and is valued at around $1200.00.  It was made in Finland from Bofors steel.  It also has a 5 digit serial number and is pretty rare.
As you look at the photos, you will note that the wood is flawless with beautiful checkering on both the stock and forgrip and has a mirror like finish.  The high gloss Blue finish of the metal parts can only be described as similar to the high gloss bluing on a Smith and Wesson or Colt Python.  The bluing is without damage as the gun has always been kept in a hard case and stored inside the home.
The action is tight and smooth and this is a rifle that any hunter would be proud to carry into a hunting camp and could expect many positive comments from his envious hunting friends.
Don’t miss this opportunity to own a very exceptional weapon that will be the pride of your collection and your first choice when heading to the woods.
This rifle comes with 50 rounds of ammunition so you will be ready for the woods."
