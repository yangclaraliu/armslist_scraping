SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is operated using delayed blowback principle, which is rather unusual for shotguns. It employs roller-delayed action with two-part bolt and two rollers in its head, which enter recesses in the barrel extension. This action is very similar to that found in many older weapons by Heckler & Koch (such as G3 or MP5) based on WW2-era German Stg.45(M) design.Model 1216 shotgun is built using bullpup layout, with polymer housing / stock and steel upper receiver, connected by cross-pins. Ejection ports are located on either side of the receiver, with one which is not in use being closed by removable ejection port cover. Normally Model 1216 shotgun is set up to eject to the right, although user can disassemble the gun and set it for left-side ejection, if required. One of most unusual features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is its feed system. It employs detachable rotary magazine with four channels, each containing its own spring and follower. Each channel can hold up to four rounds in the same manner as any common tubular shotgun magazine. When magazine is inserted into the gun, it is located below the barrel. To feed the weapon, magazine should be rotated until one of its compartments is in topmost (12’o clock) position and aligned with feed port in the gun. Once it is done, cartridge retainer in the topmost compartment is disengaged, and first cartridge is pushed rearwards from magazine and onto the lifter platform in the gun. Once all four cartridges from topmost magazine are expended, bolt hold-open device engages the bolt in its rearward (open) position, indicating that magazine compartment is empty. After that, user shall push the indexing lever(s) at the front of the magazine, and manually rotate it 90 degrees to either side, until next full compartment is aligned with the feed port. Once it is done, fresh round is automatically fed from magazine and bolt hold-open device is released, chambering the round and making gun ready for the next shot. Once all four compartments are empty (or firing is done), rotary magazine cam be removed from the gun by pushing magazine release button, located in front of the magazine, below the muzzle. Empty or partially loaded magazines can be topped up only when removed from the gun.Other features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun include conveniently located manual safety, which can be set on left or on right side of the gun, and set of integral Picatinny type rails, which can be used to install variety of sighting devices (Red Dot or iron sights), as well as laser aiming modules and/or tactical flashlights."

Nicknamed the ""Devil's Round"" by the Afghans, this weapon and round quickly became popular with elite Special Forces units around the world and still is to this day.

Las Vegas, NV - September, 2009 Arsenal, Inc introduces its own AK-74 rifle chambered in 5.45X39. Combining 21 century technology with original Mil-Spec design features, Arsenal has succeeded in producing America's first ever AK-74 built on an original Russian Kalashnikov platform. Bringing the flat shooting, superior ballistic characteristics of the5.45X39 round together with the world's most reliable battle rifle ever made, Arsenal is sure to re-invent history with the addition of this rifle to its product line.

Each SGL31 will come standard with Arsenal's own AK-74 muzzle brake that uses modern day CNC technology to improve upon an already highly effective brake. Also, every SGL31 will have Arsenal's upper and lower handguards that are said to be the world's most effective heat dissipating AK handguards on the market due to its stainless steel heat shield. The SGL31 features a hammer forged chrome lined barrel that is built to stand not only the test of time but against any environment or situation encountered. And, with Arsenal's exclusive two stage trigger design, the SGL31 provides a clean and crisp pull when shooting. Available with optional accessories, like the KV-04S scope mount and the four-sided aluminum picatinny rail, the battle tested and battle proven design of the AK-74 becomes the battle rifle of the future in the form of the Arsenal SGL31. Combining these features and many more, like the different stock lengths and colors, the SGL31 sets the standard as the most reliable and accurate battle rifle ever. 

Starting out as a small manufacturer and importer on the west coast, Arsenal, Inc. developed a reputation for building and importing only the highest quality parts. Then, when Arsenal, Inc moved to Las Vegas, NV they transferred that same passion and attention to detail spirit into manufacturing and importing firearms. Now Arsenal serves as full line manufacturer, importer, and developer of the best combat rifles available and the accessories for them.

I'm not sure how many are aware of this, but Starbucks Coffee has been in the news lately. It seems their corporate policy is that if local ordinances allow it, they welcome open carry customers in their stores.
This weekend, particularly Saturday, the gun control group ""Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America"" is attempting to stage a boycott of Starbucks. We have the opportunity to push back. Let's all quietly walk into the nearest Starbucks,  and buy a couple of coffees. It'll be $10 bucks well spent.
We should support any businesses that support us. Just an idea."

Shoots the hot 7.62x25mm round.  These were a russian version of the Browning 1911, however if you know Russians, they take a design, make it simpler and usually improve on it in some way, particularly the cartridge it fires.

Gun comes with 2 # matched magazines,  a cleaning rod, and a undeniably durable leather holster which holds all of these components. 

These guns feature a crisp trigger, manageable recoil, and a whole lotta bang in a semi auto platform.

You have to see it to appreciate what a fine yet very simple firearm these are. 

I have taken it to the range once and ran 1 box (72 rounds) of ammo through it, took it home and cleaned it thoroughly to prevent corrosion.  It has been a safe queen ever since.  I have come  across the opportunity to get an original Russian TT33 and could use some extra cash to put towards it.

Upgraded with sweat shield & tuck option. If you are unfamiliar with this holster, the outside is a rubber-like material that keeps the holster in place. I prefer this for warm weather carry due to the sweat shield. Also very handy if I’m going to be going anywhere that prohibits carry such as picking up the kids from school. It’s easily and quickly removed before leaving the vehicle and easily put back in place when you leave. No clip getting stuck on your belt. Can fit other similar size pistols as well.

This one turned out beautiful although it was much more work than I anticipated!

It has been sandblasted, cleaned, cemented seames, new brass hardware installed, painted with 1,200 degree heat paint, and ready to go! =) And I would like it to have a good home. It is a Box King No32, 2-8"" burner plates, and should be rated to heat about a 1,200 square foot area. I am not sure when this one was produced, but believe that the company is no longer in business.

I am looking to sell (possibly trade - see below) my Springfield M1A Socom 16. To hopefully prevent any further issues, I am not looking to part this out, but I will under the right circumstances which I will list below.
This rifle has many accessories, upgrades, etc and I will only be considering reasonable offers. Please do your research on the gun/parts/acc/upgrades/etc before making an offer. I am more than happy to answer any questions.

This is a Socom 16 made in 2007-8. I am unsure of the exact month/year but that is what the previous owner told me and my research shows that to be a close timeframe for this rifle's production. According to the previous owner, I am now the third owner of this rifle. According to how many rounds the previous owner shot through it and what (supposedly) the original owner put through it along with how many times I've shot it I'd say its had right about 4-500 rounds through it. The rifle itself is not in perfect condition, it has the normal rubmarks of a used M1A, however it is completely rust-free, has no glaring marks other than the normal wear marks, and has a very nice and shiny barrel. With the exception of the internal upgrades I've added this rifle, which I'll explain shortly, is all SAI parts other than the trigger group which is a GI HRA that probably originally came with the rifle. 

As you can see from the pictures, the rifle has been heavily modified with accessories and parts, however it can be completely returned to the original configuration it was in when I received it which is as such: A stock Socom 16 (w/ HRA TG) in a GI walnut stock with a GI fiberglass handguard (scout mount not attached but included). The previous owner sold off the original synthetic black stock and put it into a GI walnut and removed the scout mount, which I still have. There is nothing wrong with the rifle/parts, I'm just looking for something else right now. 

Here is a complete build list/part list of what I am offering if someone wants all of this stuff:

1. SAI Socom 16 
2. GI Walnut Stock w/ GI cleaning kit in stock and M14 tool
3. GI Fiberglass Handguard
4. GI Fiberglass Handguard cut out to allow for the scout mount attachment
5. All original parts that were carefully removed to install upgrades/Troy chassis/etc, i.e. rear sight, handguard clip, forward handguard retainer, original SAI socom brake, guide rod, piston, gas plug, etc. 
6. Troy MCS Chassis in FDE, originally purchased as a bare chassis
7. Magpul UBR Stock in FDE
8. Limbsaver - Magpul Precision Fit Buttpad - including the original Magpul Buttpad as well
9. Magpul MOE+ grip in FDE
10. Troy Micro sight set in FDE - not tritium
11. Rail ladders - not sure of manufacturer
12. Magpul XTM Enhanced Rail Covers in FDE/BLK
13. Gear Sector QD Sling Mount in FDE
14. Precision Muzzle Device Alignment Washers - originally purchased from Brownells
15. SAI 20rd magazine
16. 3x 20rd magazines from Thermold
17. Troy Claymore Muzzle Brake
18. Folding Mech that can be used in conjunction with stock/chassis to make the rifle have a side folding stock
19. AR Receiver End Plate - not needed for the UBR stock due to design but suggested for most others
20. 308 Tromix Shark Brake
21. Sadlak Cleaning Drill Set (3 drills)
22. Sadlak Gas Cylinder Wrench - Aluminum
23. 30 cal Boresnake
24. Grease - White Lithium and Shooters Choice
25. Blue Loctite
26. Magpul AFG2 in FDE
27. Vltor Modpod in FDE
28. Buffer Tech Recoil Buffer
29. Wolff Extra Power Recoil Spring
30. Sadlak NM Guide Rod
31. Smith Enterprise Chrome Piston
32. Smith Enterprise Socom Gas Plug
33. Pelican 1720 Rifle Case
34. Sadlak Extended Magazine Release
35. Smith Enterprise Extended Bolt Catch/Release

I also have 40 rounds of Winchester 7.62x51mm 147gr FMJ, 160 rounds of Hirtenberger 7.62x51, and 300 rounds of Radway Green in Bandoliers/Ammo Can

There is well over $4000 invested into the stuff listed above. If someone wants a very nice, upgraded, and accessorized M1A with all that stuff I just listed then awesome! If not let me know what you're interested in and we can probably work something out. There are a few stipulations however.
1. The point of this is to sell the rifle and hopefully most of the stuff listed or work out a trade, if I have to part out the stuff after selling the rifle then fine but the goal is to sell the rifle. 
2. The ammo will not be sold/traded until/unless the rifle is sold/traded.
3. If you don't want/are not interested in the Troy MCS or other upgrades/accessories then I can put the gun back into whatever configuration up to current and all the way back to how I received it.
4. I know what the stuff is worth/selling for, please do not lowball me or contact me unless a serious potential buyer or have a trade I'm looking for. 

Here is the ONE AND ONLY TRADE I am looking for: An FNH PS90 in Black or OD - doesn't matter, but must be in excellent, working condition. Trade offers can be supplemented with ammo, mags, accessories, optics, other guns, etc. but this rifle must be part of the trade if a trade is to occur. I am willing to adjust the list above to offer something fair in trade, but I will not be considering trading a used PS90 with one mag and original box for the entire list above - sorry.

Other Things I will consider in addition to the PS90, other than what I already listed in general:
1. Concealed Carry Guns - pocket carry potential preferably
2. 1911s 
3. Shotguns - Pump preferable
4. Anything reasonable, definitely gun related

I know this is a long listing, but I'd like to have most questions answered before they need asked so I'm trying to be as thorough as possible.

I am looking to get $3500 out of everything listed above, without the ammo. I will do $3700 with the ammo. Obviously due to the size/weight of some of these items I would prefer to sell/trade FTF in Central Ohio (preferably close to Columbus), but if you'd like to pay for shipping then I have no hesitation to ship it to your FFL, but the cost of shipping will be covered by the buyer - I can provide an estimate if desired, if the final cost of the shipment goes over my initial estimate for shipping then I will cover the difference. I will consider shipped trades over state borders on a case-by-case basis. 

Thanks for looking! Please either send me an email at REDACTED, message me on arfcom (slowest), or call/text me at REDACTED (fastest). I am located in Westerville, OH."

Two each (6 inch and 10 inch) in each designated Caliber with an additional 10 inch 50AE barrel. (Total of 3 barrels in 50AE). 7 Barrels have never been mounted. 2 Barrels have only had 3 rounds through them. These barrels are preferable to the new ""picatinny"" railed barrels for the experienced operator and DE collector.  The 440 Barrels are the original rare FACTORY STAMPED BARRELS.

Please notice the custom fitted MP5 TYPE Forearm which fits all the long barrels, including the laser when the laser is mounted on the long barrels. The MP5 fore-grip is ""quick"" off and on as needed. The strong RED laser is extremely rare, brand new in the box, fits the pistol frame with any mounted barrel, and was custom made for the Desert Eagle as shown. Also, I may include the holographic water and fog proof site.
The package includes Ammo> 50AE (6 Boxes Hornady XMP and 80 rounds FMJ), 100 rounds of Rare 440 Magnum COR®BON factory built ammo, and high quality ""Silver Plated"" FMJ 44 Magnum Ammo. Custom $250 ""Cross Shoulder"" or ""over the Shoulder"" Black Leather Quick Draw Holster (you can aim and shoot the DE from the holster without having to draw the weapon!) with an Additional DE Emblem Factory tactical holster and separate custom made tactical DE leg holster. Includes a full set of rare .440 COR®BON Magnum RCBS reload dies with rare custom factory made .440 reamer. Includes 44 Magnum RCBS reload dies. Also comes with the 357 Bolt and assembly tool and original owners manual. Notice the HOGUE rubber grips with unique D RING. Original grip included. A heavy duty two layer dual key lockable aluminum ""strong box"" holds barrels and accessories.  High end BOYT Black Waterproof Case with sheepskin lining (as shown) customized for the DE Pistol and Mags. Six Magazines, two in each caliber (the 440 rounds use the 50AE Mags) are included with the package. The 400+ rounds of ammo and reload dies also come with their own lockable aluminum case. I have seen the ammo going for as much as $8-10 a round on Gunbroker if you can find it. This is the Ultimate DE Collection that took over 5 years to build and complete and is EXTREMELY RARE and one of a kind. The individual items, along with the design and fabrication of the MP5 fore-grip, add up to considerably more than my price. 
So to recap: 
DE Mark XIX 50AE Pistol with 9 Barrels including TWO Extremely Rare  FACTORY MADE AND STAMPED COR®BON 440 Magnum in 6 and 10 inches/ 400+ ROUNDS OF AMMO/ 3 Custom Holsters/ 3 High End Cases/ Custom DE Red Laser/ Custom MP5 Forearm_Fore-grip/ Hogue Grips with D-ring/ and Reload dies for the 440 COR®BON and the 44 Magnum. Also, I may include the holographic water and fog proof site.
If you are interested in buying just the 440 Barrels, ammo, and reload die set with custom 440 reamer I would need to get a premium of 3k to break up the set. This amount is firm and intended to discourage less than serious inquires. Please don't contact me IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY AT THE TIME YOU CALL! I have received many offers but I'm simply not interested in breaking up the collection for less than a premium. The best deal for the buyer is the whole collection as a package. Breaking out the 440 collection from the package reduces the overall value of the remainder of the collection by a considerable amount. My Direct email is Hk51(at)post.com ... replace (at) with @. 
This Package will be transferred through my Colorado FFL and is not intended as, advertised as, or should be interpreted as a ""Private Sale Offering"" in Colorado. If you are reading this it is still for sale.
Please know your local, state, and federal laws. Thank You."

I will sell the rifle with just scope mounts/bi-pod and fore grip for 1800.00
I will consider separating the aimpoint p.r.o. and magnifier from the package (have all boxes etc...)

I am very interested in trades/part trades and just plain old cash
Feel free to make a reasonable offer on whole package.Can't say I will agree but the worst I will say is ""No thank you""
As far as trades go,try me.My interests vary greatly

MARLIN 1894. Cal. 44 Magnum, 20"" Ballard rifled barrel, 10 shot capacity.
Ser. # 9420XXXX puts date of manufacture at 2006. This is a JM stamped rifle made by Marlin, NOT by Remington. It is in ""as new"" perfect condition with not a mark on it.  No dings, dents, scratches, or wear anywhere on the wood or metal. It's only had about 40 rounds of cast bullet reloads through it, and is very accurate. The only reason for the sale is I finally found a scarce 1894P (trapper length ported barrel) that I'd rather have. To find a nicer one than this, you'd have to buy new, and that means Remington - and you don't want to go there.

In my opinion the carvings are not so deep that you couldn't sand them out. That said, I'd be totally comfortable leaving this as-is, the existing finish is good enough to protect against moisture or premature wear. Will work well as a BFPU or refinished to 'like new' status. This DOES come with the lower HG tension spring as pictured.

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 
SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. 
This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 
The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select 
one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change 
everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance."
