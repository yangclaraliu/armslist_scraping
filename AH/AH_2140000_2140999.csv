I got it in a trade and it functions flawlessly. The action is nice and firm when you pump it. The barrel does have a 2 inch long scratch that someone tried to cover up but its not too noticeable and it is a hunting gun that has been carried in the woods based on the light scratches. The wood is kind of dull but no big scratches on the wood or rest of the metal and its in overall really good shape. The bore is rust and pitting free and has a lot of life left in it. Its really clean and not bad looking at all for its age. Cash price is firm and fair at $160 non negotiable. I can meet anywhere within 15 miles or so of Idaho Falls. I am not interested in shipping this or holding it for you.

Here is a beautiful, all matching numbers, 1950 Long Branch No4 Mk1*. This rifle looks stone cold mint. It has a very discreet import stamp on the barrel just forward of the front sight. 1950 was the last full year of production for this model and this rifle has the very desirable 95L serial number prefix which is the last full serial number run on this pattern. All of the metal has been professionally cerakoted in armor black by OC Custom Coatings and the wood has been lightly sanded and tastefully refinished. The barrel is bright and free from pitting and this rifle is a real tack driver. You're not likely to find a better example of this legendary battle rifle. Included with the rifle is the correct ""Winkle Pin"" spike bayonet and scabbard which have both been professionally refinished to match the metal on the rifle. The weapon also includes a correct cleaning pull through and oiler, the correct sling, two correct bandoleers, 20 chargers, and 50 rounds of PPU 174grn FMJ.

The The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. Scope and bipod not included.  NEW!!!

Based on his previous M1890 design, this rifle was manufactured in Austro-Hungarian Empire at state arms factories in Steyr (Austria) and Budapest (Hungary). More than 3 million of M95 rifles were produced between 1895 and 1918. This rifle was issued to Austro-Hungarian army, and, after the fall of the Empire, to the Austrian and Hungarian armies.  Since 1930 Austria converted most of the M95 rifles to the more powerful 8x56R M30 ammunition, using the same Mannlicher en bloc clips. These rifles were designated as M95/30, and marked with the letter ""S"" on the receiver ring. Hungary started to convert their rifles to the same 8x56R ammunition in 1931, with the upgraded rifles being marked with the letter ""H"" on the receiver ring. Many of the M95 rifles were used during the Word War 2 by the Hungarian, Bulgarian and Italian armies, as well as by some German police forces.
Steyr Mannlicher M95 bolt has a separate head with two frontal locking lugs; bolt head was inserted into the bolt body from the front. Bolt body had internal spiral-shaped ribs, with matching spiral-shaped cuts in the tail of the bolt head. These ribs and cuts forced the bolt head to rotate on the pull of the bolt body, locking and unlocking the action. Box magazine contained five rounds in en bloc clips; as the magazine emptied, the clips were ejected from the opening at the bottom of the magazine. Non-empty clips could be removed from the top with the bolt open, by depressing the clip catch inside the triggerguard. One specific feature of this system was that the clip has specific ""top"" and ""bottom"" sides, and could not be loaded into the rifle upside down. The safety was located at the rear left side of the bolt. Large ear-shaped cocking handle at the rear of the bolt served as a manual cocking handle, to re-cock the action without operating the bolt. M95 rifles were issued with detachable knife bayonets. Other than basic rifle, M95 also was issued as Stutzen (short rifle or carbine, with bayonet lug), and slightly shorter cavalry carbine (without bayonet lug).
These rifles are generally considered as a reasonably strong and accurate, but somewhat sensitive to mud and dirt, as most others military straight pull bolt action rifles. There were several downsides, inherent to these rifles. The straight pull bolt lacked the powerful initial extraction, provided by most rotating bolt actions. The en block clip loading system does not allow the partially full magazine to be refilled without removing the non-empty clip first. The use of rimmed ammunition resulted in the non-symmetric clip which could be inserted into the action only with one side down; upper side of the clip has stamped serrations to hold it while loading (this particular problem was cured in Italian Carcano rifles, which used rimless ammunition, and symmetric clips).

This rifle also includes 200 rounds of ammunition.

If you're looking to add a nice rifle to your militaria collection, this rifle will fill that bill."

Trijicon TA31RCO-A4 ACOG 4x32 USMC Rifle Combat Optic for the A4 w/ TA51 Mount provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. Trijicon TA31RCO-A4CP ACOG 4x32 Scope with BAC USMC Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) for A4 incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Trijicon TA31RCO A4CP 4 x 32mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Trijicon 4x32 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Rifle Scopes TA31RCO-A4CP have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.

I have for sale or trade a Daewoo K2 (DR-200).  She is a 223/556, South Korean modern day battle rifle.  She uses M16/AR15 Magazines, has a FAL adjustable gas system, cycles using AKM gas piston technology.  The K2 basically took the best parts of the M16/FAL/AKM to make an outstanding battle rifle.  I added a $250 ACE stock to her that gives her the ability to side fold and deploy.  These are pretty rare now and I haven't seen any at any gun shows.  She has only had about 400 rounds through her total.  She was cleaned after each shooting and never abused.  I took her shooting last month (100) rounds and she fired flawlessly.

520,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2140520,"For Sale/Trade:  BNIC AR15 in 6.8 SPCII, MagPul, Trijicon, + 640 rounds of Ammo.","NW, Albuquerque, New Mexico","$ 3,400","Listed On: Tuesday, April 14, 2015",Rifles,Yankee Hill Machine                                                                                ,6.8mm SPCII                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I’ve never spent more cash building an AR15 up to this point. This is a Yankee Hill Machine complete Specter Black Diamond upper on top of a YHM lower that includes a $230 Timney drop-in 3lb trigger group and $260 MagPul UBR stock that I‘ve upgraded with their $25 Aluminum Strike Plate and $20 Enhanced Rubber Buttpad. There’s also an ambidextrous selector and enhanced bolt release. The upper has a Young Manufacturing bolt carrier group (the best BCGs on the market) and Bravo Company Gunfighter charging handle. The MAID grip, AFG and multi-color XTM rail panels are all from MagPul and the BUIS are YHM’s low profile Q.D.S. sights.

The optic is a $765 1.25-4x24Trijicon TR21 AccuPoint. This Trijicon combines the best of ACOGs and zoom scopes. Like the ACOG, its dual-illuminated triangle aiming point glows at night from tritium, and during the day from the fiber-optic system. There is also a feature for dimming the fiber optic in really bright days. Advanced, multilayer coated optics permit excellent light transmission without parallax and the quick-focus eye-piece gives users rapid clarity adjustment. It also has a wider field of view and longer eye-relief that accommodates large caliber rifles and being mounted farther forward on flat top uppers. It’s mounted with a $100 Burris PEPR one piece mount.

Included with this package is the $200 Pelican 1700 case shown, $45 VTAC sling, 14 magazines and 640 rounds of fresh factory ammo. All but 4 of the magazines are brand new, one is a $50 Barrett that holds a full 30 rounds, three are 25 round $45 Precision Reflex, one is a 10 round $38 also by Precision Reflex, seven are cheaper 25 round and two are 10 round by C-Products. Each 25 round mag has a MagPul Ranger Plate installed. That’s over $360 in mags alone. For ammo there are 24 boxes of Hornady 110gr V-Max, three boxes of Double Tap 110gr Rifle Defense, three boxes of Remington 115gr HPBT. There is more than $800 in ammo here which saves you the trouble of hunting some down (if there is any actually available).

I have more than $2900 in the firearm and optics alone, another $360 in mags, $250 in the case and sling and $800 in ammo. That’s more than $4300 invested all together but I’ll take $3400 for everything. THE SCOPE HAS NOT BEEN ZEROED SO THAT WILL NEED TO BE DONE BY THE PURCHASER.

I have no interest in selling the ammo, optics or magazines alone, it goes as a package unless someone first purchases the AR by itself.

This is a A-2 style CAR-15 in 5.56. The rifle has less than a thousand rounds through it. It has Magpul furniture, Professional trigger job by DPMS shop. The trigger work was 200$ and the furniture cost is about 140$. The price is a firm 625.00. I would consider a trade but I need some cash since I am only selling it so I can pick something else up. The rifle comes with one 30rd new magazine. This rifle has the 11.5 inch barrel and came from the factory with the 6"" flash suppressor. They are not legal without it. I would also consider just selling the complete upper for 350$ since I really like how this lower works and might want to build another gun later. The prices are firm. If you want the complete upper or the gun I have priced what I am willing to take. With a scope attached this rifle shoots a dime sized group and 100yrds with 55grn ball ammo for me every time. If what I am trying to buy sells before this is sold I will then take it down and not sell it."

Will separate. 
I have two beautiful Polish AKM/AK47's that I would be interested in selling. I am in no real need of the money or to sell them but thought I would offer them up at a fair price and apply the money towards other fun dude toys. With that said, I may consider other firearm trades. As far as AK's go, they do not get any better than these. As the title say's these are numbers matching rifles built in the USA from unissued Polish parts kits. These are also outfitted with the original chrome lined barrels. A combination that has become very hard to come by. May consider a trade/partial trade for another rifle."

1.  As-New / Pristine 10"" T/C-made barrel, Octagon, .218 Bee - Purchased New by me - Exactly 19 rounds through this barrel total by me.  Nice deep blueing.
2.  Fair-Plus Condition T/C Contender frame - Blued.  Works great; not too stiff.
3.  Fair-Plus Condition Wood Pistol grip
4.  Excellent condition wood forearm for 8-10"" barrels
5.  Nikon Omega 1.65-5x36mm scope - this scope has 13-14"" of actual eye relief on 1.65x, so works perfectly as a handgun scope at arm's length... you can go up to about 2.0 power at arm's length.  If resting the pistol on a rail or tripod, you can go up to 3 or 4 power and still have 6-8"" of eye relief.
6.  Scope base 
7.  Weaver rings - high quality.
8.  Chest/shoulder holster rig, with quick-release thumb snap.
9.  RCBS reloading die set for .218 Bee
10.  58 rounds (two full boxes plus 18 more) of HSM ""Varmint Gold"" ammo - with 40 gr Berger HP-FB Match Varmint Bullets.  This scope/gun is sighted in with this ammo.
11.  19 rounds of once-fired brass
12.  13 rounds of gun-show reloads - 40 gr soft points
13.  Thumb extension on the hammer

This is the perfect lightweight concealed carry rig for when you are hunting big game with a bow, or when hunting turkeys with a shotgun (for coyotes, feral dogs, feral pig head shots, varmints, etc.).  

.218 Bee is more powerful than a .22 Hornet, so this will definitely allow the long 100+ yard shot, and .218 Bee has much longer brass life than .22 hornet.   But it's got a lot less muzzle blast than .223 rem, so it's the perfect cartridge for this 10"" barrel, to have a lightweight pistol for this use without blowing your ears out.  This would be a good deal considering the ammo and scope, etc., at $700+, I think -- but it's all yours for $570.
