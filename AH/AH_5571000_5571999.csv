Not much, but some. Again, this is not some cheaply-made kit of inconsistent qualitythat Century Arms and other distributors sell and ask way too much for. This company focused on ALL the problems thoserifles have, addressed them all and did each one right. They've been more about quality than quantity. I'm second owner. Less than 100 rounds total have been fired through this rifle.$800. Local sale only. Woul like to sell it, but would maybe do partial trade on cash and silver coins and silver bars. Depends on what you have. Can make an easy deal that works for both of us. Cash is king, but wanted to give you that option, as this AK is a great investment as well as a great rifle. I don't own a store or specialize in either, so not trying to take advantage of you. Just want to see a great rifle go to a good new home! Thanks!"

This Rifle is in good condition and accurate.
Asking $300.00
Selling because I don’t use it. It is a great rifle and think it should be out in the field taking down deer or what ever else it is you hunt.
Looking at what other people are asking for rifles just like this, I feel $300.00 is more then a reasonable offer. I priced it to sell!  
I do have a scope to go along with it for extra.
This is a private sale, but I expect the buyer to be at least 21 years of age, no criminal record, and have a valid CCW permit from any state.

Whenever this gun is handled, I wipe it down with a silicone impregnated cloth and it is stored in a gun safe with dehumidifier. There are absolutely no signs of wear on this pistol other than a couple small blemishes on the outside of the Sig Sauer case itself (most guns don't even come with a case on here it seems). I take meticulous care of my guns and this pistol means a lot to me but student loans + graduate school is expensive!Hoping to get around $800. The pistol comes with 2 magazines, slide stop, unused lock w/ key, all original manuals/receipts, and the Sig Sauer case. The pistol has a 4.25"" barrel so not as large as the typical 1911 platform so it could be concealed with the right holster and outfit or stored as a car carry gun. The match grade barrel is actually incredible and was maintaining palm-size groups at 20 yards with very managable recoil for a smaller .45. I am open to trades for a Glock 19 + Cash as well. Please email or text me at 41nine–56nine–57nine4Thanks!"
