The only detraction to this gun are two small cracks in the butt stock just forward of the cheek piece where the receiver tongue meets the wood (I'll forward the pics to those interested).

Gun and Ammo Review:
IMO you'll find that anyone who's shot a model 67 is a fan. To put it simply, the 4 inch tapered barrel K frame is notable because it's the finest balance of features you can find in a revolver. Be it the balance of power and recoil, balance in the hand, or the balance between sight radius and practical accuracy, the tapered barrel 4 inch K frames are the pinnacle in terms of balance. As a result, if you need a handgun that allows you to get it into action quickly and allows you to shoot it effectively, the  67 will be the easiest to master and get up to speed fastest with. History reports it to be a real man stopper."

The Silver Tipped 149 grain Boat Tail bullet in this ammunition is unique in that it has a steel shank in the center of the projectile beneath an exterior coating of lead that is bonded to the bullet jacket. This allows the projectile to stabilize in flight and provides the accuracy and penetration of a steel core round while not being harsh on the barrel or bore as is the case with a full hardened steel core. It is the absolute best of both worlds.

Also, the Boat Tail Bullet is more aerodynamic and allows for a flatter trajectory and greater accuracy over a long distance.

This ammo has a copper washed steel case and is berdan primed. The case neck and the primer are sealed for moisture protection. It comes packed in 20rd. military packs, 440rds. per sealed spam can. As with most surplus 54r ammo this ammunition does have some mildly corrosive components so remember to clean your weapon after firing."

I purchased this gun this spring and really like it, but I am looking to consolidate handgun calibers.  This gun has performed flawlessly and is the only pocket pistol I have ever owned that has never had a failure of any kind.  It has been fired 206 times exactly and cleaned after every range trip.  It is in near perfect condition with only very minor carry marks.  It is just barely broken in and is a fantastic carry gun.  This gun will come with everything I have for the gun as well as all of my .380 ammo.  Included are all papers, box, and factory case, an extra magazine, 719 rounds of factory new .380 ammo (1 box of 100 round winchester white box not shown), and a galco tuc n' go inside wasteband holster.  This is everything you need in a complete self defense package

Value of items included.
LCP $379, Magazine $35, Galco Holster $33, approximate value of ammo with ammo priced around $20 a box of 50 (which is as cheap as you will find it) and rounding down to 700 rounds: $280.  This adds up to $727 dollars. With tax this adds up to just shy of $800 dollars.  I am asking $500 firm for everything you save over 300 off purchase price.  I will not seperate the gun and ammo unless you are offering a trade for a single stack 9mm.  Trades I am interested in are listed below.  These are the only trades I am interested in.

Buy yourself a great dependable handgun and have plenty of ammo to start with as well!"

It's also an early light barrel version. Currently it runs great. HOWEVER! There is a crack where the pin attaches the upper to the lower. I AM SELLING THIS FOR PARTS ONLY! Is the crack critical? I don't think so, but liability being what it is and everyone being an armchair Perry Mason, YOU WILL SIGN A RELEASE FROM LIABILITY. After that you can shoot it, you can use it for spares for your other Tec9. U can put this upper on one of those goofy post-ban lowers...whatever.

Excellent walnut stock and fore-end, bluing has thinned some with minimal speckling, but it's hard to see.   Nothing wrong with this rifle, it came to me in a trade.  I did a complete disassembly, cleaned, lubed and reassembled. I have fired it and it shot well fine and was accurate. Since I had several other lever rifles, my wife suggested I should sell one. Bore is bright and shiny with crisp rifling. New it is not, but it's still a very nice rifle. Has the white detail.  It's my understanding I can sell this to Ohio and Indiana residents in addition to Kentucky. More pictures available."

I'm only selling this to free up some funds for another project.  This gun is currently selling for $1199 plus tax at the shows, and it only comes with two 10-round mags and the crappy hard case.

I am looking for smaller compact or sub compact pistols. If you are going to offer one of the pistols listed above, PLEASE include how much cash or what extras will be included to make up the price difference. I can text pictures. You can Email or Text me any offers and any time and I will respond ASAP. REDACTED.

Shoots .308/7.62x51 and accepts standard FAL magazines. Controls are completely ambidextrous and the charging handle can be swapped to either side. Didnt come with any iron sights or optics, I had an Eotech on it but decided to use it for my AR instead. It comes with three magazines one plastic, two metal, the box it was purchased in, owners manual and sling. The only reason I'm looking to sell it is because .308 is getting expensive since I already have an M1A. One downside to this gun is that every time you shoot a different type of ammo you have to adjust the gas settings to that round. Asking $1800."

Picture Descriptions:

#1 [overview picture] - The yellow spots in the wood are from the lights above. They ARE NOT light spots in the actual wood. The wood is all a constant coloring.

#2 [receiver] - Minor rub in the bluing from use. This can easily be touched up. NO RUST and the metal is not damaged. It is a used gun and meant to be used! This is something that a small amount of bluing will easily fix!

#3 [buttstock] - This small chip in the wood was there when I purchased the shotgun. It appears to be underneath the clear coat, which makes me wonder if it was a factory default (I cannot confirm, nor can I disprove this). I have never heard the story on the chip, but it is under the clear coat and the wood is not exposed."

I have done some trigger work to it, Extractor, WC extended rear facing mag button, Nighthawk custom mainspring housing and mag well, Wilson Extended slide release.
It has the Trigicon night sights, Bull barrel, Factory recoil reducing guide rod, Ambi safety's. Its a little dirty in the pics. It is a very nice gun and comes with factory mag pouches and holster. Also has two factory mags and two Wilson 8 round mags. Only trades considered are 9mm EMP. Price $1100 Firm. No low balls, Price is firm.

In US service it was largely known as the ""Swedish-K"" or ""K-Rifle"".[3] The US Navy was so impressed by the m/45 that when Sweden embargoed the export of weapons to the USA in 1966, Smith & Wesson was given the task of producing a copy. This was designated the Smith & Wesson M76. However, by the time when the M76 was ready for combat deployment, the US Navy had ended most SEAL missions in Asia. Many of the m/45s used by US forces and agencies were ""sanitized"", which means that they were devoid of any markings, implying clandestine use.
One variant used by the Navy SEALs used a modified M3 suppressor. Heavy, cumbersome and lacking in service life, it was soon replaced by a Swedish made suppressor.""

Opinions vary as to whether or not these can be used in handguns. I am recommending they are not.....

For a semi-auto rim-fire that zips out rounds with speed as fast as you can pull the trigger, you don't need to look any further than the Remington Model 597 for your .22lr rifle, this Remington semi-auto with a 3-9 x 32 Factory Scope will fit the bill. 

This rifle features a bolt guidance system with twin tool steel guide rails, a drop-out, staggered-stack 10 + 1 metal detachable magazine, and a last shot ''hold open'' bolt for added safety, ready for a full magazine to be pushed up, flip the blot and the first cartage will upload.

Now you are ready to shoot again. This is a very fine rifle in ""like new condition"". (You will not be disappointed in its looks or performance.) 

I will not reply to low ball offers.
This rifle retails for $240 at the retail gun stores without the scope. 

Here you don't pay taxes or a background fee. 
***My price of $175 cash is firm.***

The Model 597 also features Teflon®/nickel-plated sear and hammer, along with a non-glare matte carbon steel barrel and gray synthetic small stock, (no glare in sunlight or flashlight.) Light weight, well balanced and user friendly.

Excellent for anyone who likes to hit what they aim at with the cross hairs on your target, squeeze off the round and it will be dead center every time. 

This would be a great rifle for the young man who enjoys going hunting and fishing with you, you may need to teach him the safety guide lines of handling a firearm safely and properly. The 30 round magazine is for show, it is not legal.

I have very nice S&W model 36 revolver bobbed hammer, 5 shot, J-Frame in EX shape.. great carry gun... Small, light weight but not so light weight it cant be managed. It will get the job done.. 
:
I wanted to add some notes to this because of some of the questions I'm getting... 
:
Note: 1
The Mod 36 had the option for a bobbed hammer, This one was removed by a gunsmith. It's not a basement hack job... It stilll cam be treated as a single action, just take 2 hands to do it..  The book value is still in the 425 range I have priced it with the hammer in mind 

Note: 2 if the add is up it's still for sale. it looks like the spammers have made it to arms list with the ""Hi do you still have this Email."" I will not answer any Email asking me if I still have it.. Thanks for understanding..
