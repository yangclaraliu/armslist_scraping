It’s a straight-forward carbine that should appeal to a wide user base looking for a hard-hitting tactical rifle.

The SRC-308 is a direct-impingement rifle with a 16.5-inch carbine-length barrel and a mid-length gas system. For the buttstock and handguard it uses common A2-style parts but for the magazine and grip they go up a step with a 20-round Magpul PMAG and Hogue over-molded pistol grip.

It is an “optics ready” rifle, meaning it does not come with any sights installed. Optics and iron sights are often a personal preference so this will help keep the overall price down. The SRC-308 has a receiver-height railed gas block and standard flattop upper receiver for mounting iron sights and other optics.

The railed gas block is another Windham design that features an accessory lug and a 12-o’clock quick-detach sling socket built in.

Windham appears to have developed the receivers in-house with lines and contours similar to their carbon fiber rifles. Appearances not withstanding, the SRC-308 is built on hard-anodized 7075-T6 receivers, upper and lower. The lower receiver is reinforced at the buffer tower and has quick-detach sling mounting sockets on both sides of the rifle. The design sports an integral trigger guard for simplicity.

Even with the beefed-up receivers the SRC-308 is fairly lightweight at 7.5 pounds unloaded. Other specifications include an overall length of 32 inches with the stock collapsed (38 with it completely extended), a one-in-10 right hand twist and of course, the barrel is chrome-lined 4150 chromoly-vanadium steel for a long life.

The controls are standard and familiar to anyone with experience with AR-type rifles. While they are right-handed, the lower receiver is marked on both sides for users who prefer to use left-handed or ambidextrous safety selectors.

Just Released!,"Spokane Valley, Spokane, Washington","$ 1,399","Listed On: Monday, January 13, 2014",Rifles,Windham Weaponry                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Windham Weaponry is the latest company to break into the AR-10 business with an upcoming .308 Winchester/7.62 NATO rifle, the SRC-308. It’s a straight-forward carbine that should appeal to a wide user base looking for a hard-hitting tactical rifle.

The SRC-308 is a direct-impingement rifle with a 16.5-inch carbine-length barrel and a mid-length gas system. For the buttstock and handguard it uses common A2-style parts but for the magazine and grip they go up a step with a 20-round Magpul PMAG and Hogue over-molded pistol grip.

It is an “optics ready” rifle, meaning it does not come with any sights installed. Optics and iron sights are often a personal preference so this will help keep the overall price down. The SRC-308 has a receiver-height railed gas block and standard flattop upper receiver for mounting iron sights and other optics.

The railed gas block is another Windham design that features an accessory lug and a 12-o’clock quick-detach sling socket built in.

Windham appears to have developed the receivers in-house with lines and contours similar to their carbon fiber rifles. Appearances not withstanding, the SRC-308 is built on hard-anodized 7075-T6 receivers, upper and lower. The lower receiver is reinforced at the buffer tower and has quick-detach sling mounting sockets on both sides of the rifle. The design sports an integral trigger guard for simplicity.

Even with the beefed-up receivers the SRC-308 is fairly lightweight at 7.5 pounds unloaded. Other specifications include an overall length of 32 inches with the stock collapsed (38 with it completely extended), a one-in-10 right hand twist and of course, the barrel is chrome-lined 4150 chromoly-vanadium steel for a long life.

The controls are standard and familiar to anyone with experience with AR-type rifles. While they are right-handed, the lower receiver is marked on both sides for users who prefer to use left-handed or ambidextrous safety selectors.

Up for sale is my Grade 1 Remington Arms 12ga Double Barrel 1889. A local shop was liquidating it's inventory and I bought this for it's aesthetic appeal. That being said, I have not fired the gun and have no intention to (I am not a gun nut by any means so I'm not sure what I'd even need to shoot it). The serial Number is 74771 and I believe the production year to be 1889-1890. See the pictures for details. The bottom rib is slightly undone at the end of the barrels. Also the screw for the right hammer appears to not be the original. It has a small ding in the barrel, not sure if it would affect shooting or not? I can try to answer any quetsions but I am y no means a gun guy. I do know what this gun is worth though. It is one of the few online that hasn't been modified. MAke me an offer.

At least if i was buying it that is what I would say it is.

I found another item at sols i liked so the sale of this would go for that. I also have a trade offer for this I have to respond to by the 4:30 time line when i get off work.

I got it Friday 12272013 and tried her out december 29.

This Weapon is Brand New In Box (Never been fired).
Also included is a New Serpa Tactical holster with belt loop and paddle, and a mag pouch
Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety. 

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, military, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics. 

Characteristics:
Bull pup configuration. 
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer. 
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts. 
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system. 
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant. 
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing. 

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability."

The rifle is very nice. It has a nice piece of wood, engraved receiver, floorplate and scope rings. It has been hunted with, so it has the normal handling marks and the here and there scratches. It is topped with an older (good and tough as nails) Weaver 2-7 scope. I put 6 rounds through it the weekend after purchase and shot two groups of 3 that both measured in right at 1 inch. 

You are welcome to make offers of gun related trades and you can make a cash offer if you'd like to purchase instead of trade. I can add or accept cash to make up trade differences. I don't need money, so please don't lowball me. I can be an asshole, too. :)

PRODUCT INFORMATION:
The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. 

Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. 

Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year personal use warranty.

This is a Carl Gustav made rifle from the year 1911. It has a Boyd thumb hole stock, Mojo Reflex sights, Huber concept trigger and a Limbsaver recoil pad. I traded for it as is so all the modifications were done by the previous owner. The rifle is in very good condiditon for it's age and doesn't appear to be fired much. I have shot about 50-60 rounds through it and the previous owner gave me his brass, which was only about 100 rounds. 

I also have 230 rounds of 6.5x55mm 139gr FMJ bullets which travel at 2460fps. Non-corrosive, boxer primed brass cases. They are safe to shoot in a surplus rifle. 

Price for the rifle: $350

There are three firearms I want to get.  As listed above, they are the S&W Bodyguard, a full sized M&P 9, or MAYBE a Glock 19 or 17.  Please let me know what you have.  I will be more inclined to buy if you have a holster to go with it (preferably an IWB holster). 

Please let me know what you have, and how much you want for it.  Either of the Smiths will take priority over the Glock.  Thanks for your time everyone.

PS: If you have an M&P 9, my preference would be no thumb safety or mag release safety.  However, to my understanding, both can be removed, so I'll consider all offers."

Springfield XDM Competition Series Pistol, .40 S&W, 5.25″ Barrel, Black Polymer Grip, BiTone Finish, 16 Round- Springfield XDM95254SHC

Springfield Armory’s Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

The XDM 5.25 has the same spirit of innovation that fueled the successes of the XD. This is now captured in the XDM 5.25 line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, The XDM 5.25 series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be. Featuring minimal reset trigger, match grade barrel, melonite finish, major grasp slide serrations, contour frame, and mega lock texture on the grip. Slide features lightning cut.
