34,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2884034,For Sale:  Custom Gen 4 Glock 17 w/ EXTRAS!,"Daytona Beach, Florida, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, March 31, 2014",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"Hi there, I have cut back on shooting quite a bit and had been setting this gun up for USPSA Open division. It's literally all done out minus the cmore slide ride that i had plans to put on it.

This is a gen 4 Glock 17 purchased roughly 5 months ago. Round count is relatively low. I would estimate around 3k rounds down the tube. This gun is an absolute dream to shoot. I set it up with the intention to make this gun the best it could possibly be.

This is a list of the modifications and i'll put the price i paid for each part to give you a better idea of how much actually went into the gun.

Gen 4 Glock 17- $550
Dawson Precision Adjustable sights w/ Fiber Optic Front- $140
KKM Barrel- $230
Jager 4 Chamber comp- $80
Jager lightened firing pin w/ extended tip- $100
Zev Fulcrum Ultimate adjustable trigger group - $275
Zev Brass Magwell w/ Brass insert - $130
Stainless Steel Guide rod w/ Gen 4 adapter - $35
10#, 11#, 12# 17# Recoil springs (all included) -$30
Dawson Ext basepad - $35
Plus case, hearing, and eye protection and ammo, we'll just round way down and say $50.
The point is there is well over $1000 extra dollars worth of add ons, but i'm going to be realistic and understand that i'm obviously not going to get that money back, i would just like the buyer to see how much actually went into this pistol.

The gun includes 4 mags total. It will come with three stock 17 round mags and one more mag with a extended Dawson Precision base pad allowing the mag to hold around 24 rounds.

I'm also included the case shown in the picture, eye protection, hearing protection, and i have about 50 rounds of misc. 9mm jacketed hollowpoints. I will include all of the original parts except for the stock barrel. I no longer have that.

There were a few modifications made to the gun to make it a little more ergonomic and fit the hand better. The trigger guard has a double undercut on it so you can get your hand up higher for more control. The finger grooves were taken off and the grip has a grip tape wrap. This allows for a much more solid and comfortable shooting grip.

If you have any questions please feel free to text me at REDACTED.
This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic pistol at a great price. I'm only asking $700.00 for everything.

Thank you very much, God bless.

OK it appears i'm having difficulty getting my phone to upload pictures to my computer. I''ll try to edit this and post pictures when i can, in the meanwhile, if you think you might be interested text me and i'll text you pictures."

97,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2884097,For Sale:  Custom Gen 4 Glock 17 w/ EXTRAS!,"Daytona Beach, Florida, United States",$ 650,"Listed On: Monday, March 31, 2014",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"Hi there, I have cut back on shooting quite a bit and had been setting this gun up for USPSA Open division. It's literally all done out minus the cmore slide ride that i had plans to put on it.

This is a gen 4 Glock 17 purchased roughly 5 months ago. Round count is relatively low. I would estimate around 3k rounds down the tube. This gun is an absolute dream to shoot. I set it up with the intention to make this gun the best it could possibly be.

This is a list of the modifications and i'll put the price i paid for each part to give you a better idea of how much actually went into the gun.

Gen 4 Glock 17- $550
Dawson Precision Adjustable sights w/ Fiber Optic Front- $140
KKM Barrel- $230
Jager 4 Chamber comp- $80
Jager lightened firing pin w/ extended tip- $100
Zev Fulcrum Ultimate adjustable trigger group - $275
Zev Brass Magwell w/ Brass insert - $130
Stainless Steel Guide rod w/ Gen 4 adapter - $35
10#, 11#, 12# 17# Recoil springs (all included) -$30
Dawson Ext basepad - $35
Plus case, hearing, and eye protection and ammo, we'll just round way down and say $50.
The point is there is well over $1000 extra dollars worth of add ons, but i'm going to be realistic and understand that i'm obviously not going to get that money back, i would just like the buyer to see how much actually went into this pistol.

The gun includes 4 mags total. It will come with three stock 17 round mags and one more mag with a extended Dawson Precision base pad allowing the mag to hold around 24 rounds.

I'm also included the case shown in the picture, eye protection, hearing protection, and i have about 50 rounds of misc. 9mm jacketed hollowpoints. I will include all of the original parts except for the stock barrel. I no longer have that.

There were a few modifications made to the gun to make it a little more ergonomic and fit the hand better. The trigger guard has a double undercut on it so you can get your hand up higher for more control. The finger grooves were taken off and the grip has a grip tape wrap. This allows for a much more solid and comfortable shooting grip.

If you have any questions please feel free to text me at REDACTED.
This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic pistol at a great price. I'm only asking $650.00 for everything.

Thank you very much, God bless."

This is a very shiny and desirable Colt MK IV, Series 70 Government Model .45 auto, finished in Colt’s beautiful Bright Nickel. The pistol has polished slide flats, and matte slide top and undercarriage. The pistol has factory checkered wooden grips with gold-colored Colt medallions that look really nice against the Bright Nickel finish. The grips are fixed with hex screws, and the right grip has a black grain running through the brown. The nickel factory magazine is Colt-marked. The pistol has a small but noticeable “idiot mark” below the slide stop, it also has a few tiny service marks here and there, and the front grip has a noticeable area of wear. Otherwise, the gun is in very nice condition with a shiny bore and a very smooth trigger pull – overall condition is 90%+. Series 70 Colt 1911’s keep going up in value, and the nickel finished guns are quite desirable."

The optics are beautiful and crisp. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. The rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

Also, I am willing to sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, and rings for $625.00. My price is firm and Im not in the market for anything else.

These rifles are fully ambidextrous and come with 500 rounds of Federal Gold Dot 6.8 SPC ammo These are the only burnt bronze rifles LWRCi is producing. This rifle accepts the new proprietary Six8 Magpul magazines which were developed for the Six8 platform. Let the pig killing begin! INFORMATION FROM WIKIPEDIA When the LWRC Six8 was being developed, Alliant Techsystems was contracted to develop a new 6.8x43mm round for the weapon. Unlike smaller commercial firms, ATK is a large ammunition supplier that delivers products for the U.S. Army, so it had large resources and manufacturing capabilities at its disposal. Commercial cartridges varied in case capacity and thickness, but LWRC wanted a thick and durable case for military uses. A 90 gr (5.8 g) load was developed specifically for a high muzzle velocity and low felt recoil from the Six8's 8.5 in (220 mm) barrel. Effective range would be over 300 yd (274 m) and the bullet would still have enough energy to penetrate intermediate barriers. Three 90 gr loads were constructed for testing that included Gold Dot, Monolithic Hollow Point, and FMJ. The Gold Dot bullet was selected with a .035 in (0.89 mm) jacket and a bonded core. The propellant was designed for reduced muzzle flash stable performance at temperatures between -29.2 to 125.6 degrees F. Muzzle velocity averaged at a 200 ft/s (61 m/s) difference at the required temperature extremes from the 8.5 in barrel. From a 24 in (610 mm) barrel, the round produced a group of 1.56 in (40 mm) at 200 yd (183 m).[16] Barrel length Muzzle velocity Muzzle energy 8.5 in (220 mm) 2,450 ft/s (750 m/s) 1,199 ft·lb (1,626 J) 16 in (410 mm) 2,900 ft/s (880 m/s) 1,680 ft·lb (2,280 J) 24 in (610 mm) 3,050 ft/s (930 m/s) 1,858 ft·lb (2,519 J)"

I bought every single thing Carolina shooter supply sells for this shot gun.  Cost me over $1000 from there in just parts. I also just bought the nice magpul stock for it the one that's like the vltor.  It has the vltor stock tube on it as well.  Caos rail system the nice one with full single rail across the top.  Chaos sights as well.red jacket mojo muzzle break. I have over $2500 into this gun.  I bought all the internal stuff as well. Certain things did not work well so I took some of it out. Tested it out to make sure everything worked with each modification.  Maybe 5 or 6 different times as it was being built to insure the mods were done properly. Has quick detach points on the stock and rail system. The only thing not done is the bolt. People tend to polish them. I did not have that done. Different things were polished up. I don't know a whole lot about this stuff as you may be able to tell lol. But it works great and I am the original owner.  The stock is od the rail and muzzle break is od green. I do have one ten round drum for it as well that was fitted for it and the original stick mag. Looking to get $2500 for it. I think that's a good deal seeing I have more than that into it. Email and let me know if you have any questions.  Potential buyers must have foid. Transaction will be done at ffl dealer only.  No exceptions sorry. In person face to face. Don't waste your time low balling me I am not interested in giving it away. The only reason I may sell it is I don't really see myself using that often and I would rather buy a duck gun.

It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly. . The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested “Safe Action” system Durable exterior finish Cold hammer forged barrel Durability Reliability Light weight ... that make GLOCK firearms famous! • Not for sale where prohibited Specs: Caliber: .40 SW Length: (slide) 6.85 in.

It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly. . The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested “Safe Action” system Durable exterior finish Cold hammer forged barrel Durability Reliability Light weight ... that make GLOCK firearms famous! • Not for sale where prohibited Specs: Caliber: .40 SW Length: (slide) 6.85 in.

I was going to reload for it and I bought a LOT of brass, bullets last year... but I'm giving up and so I'm selling it all off here:  

http://www.armslist.com/posts/2882913/topeka-kansas-ammo-for-sale--25-06-brass--dies--bullets-and-cartridges--and-offer-with-rifle-

This rifle has killed about 20 deer and 20 more hogs and it rarely was shot more than once for the kill.  90% of the ammo shot through it was dad's reloads (which he ran a few before deer season down the barrel to check the zero).  Dad had some bench shooters and bigger rifles-- but this rifle was used for hunting.  I got it 18 years ago and haven't gone through two factory boxes since then (there are 6 bullets left out of box #2 bought in about 1999).

I later bought the extra cases and bullets (last few years) but never got to loading it and so just to say-- this rifle has had about 200 bullets down it it's entire life (and this is important to know when buying a used gun)  Although this rifle is a great varmint rifle to some, this rifle was only used to feed the family and shoot an occasional coyote (or politician's sign out in the pasture) every so often.

I have some very close-up, detailed pictures I'd send a sincere buyer and they will show light wear in all the places a 26 year old gun should have it.  The barrel and action are super clean with no scratches the camera can catch (and there is one ""spot"" the size of a pin's head right under the barrel forward of the stock about an inch) otherwise it would be called ""near mint"" by some.  The scope rings have some wear on the edges, the bolt has a shiny spot on the tip of the ball (again, the camera can't see it but I have a pic to show what I can).  The scope caps have the most noticeable wear (the scope is older than the rifle-- about 40 years old-- so more wear).  While the scope body is still pretty clean, there is a spot or two showing wear close-up (again I have pictures).  There are a few light scratches in the stock, but nothing more.

The scope is a 4x32, ""Valor"" scope form the 70s which has been on it since the rifle was bought.  Dad took it from an older gun and put it on this Ruger when he bought it new in 1989 (from ""MadDog's Gunshop"" in Roswell, NM).  The Valor scope is a long gone brand, but is a decent (Japanese made) scope with good glass and last January 2013, I shot a deer, in 5 degrees at early dusk, and it didn't fog.  It has an ""old school"", thin haired reticle (picture available).

I'd take $800 (obo) for the rifle and this INCLUDES about $350 in reloading dies, bullets, cases, etc.  I don't have the press, powder or anything else left for sale except for what is listed above.  The Rifle by itself can sell for $550 (obo).  I'd prefer a face-to-face meeting for cash in East Kansas (on a weekend I could get get away your direction) if 30 miles or further away from Hartford, KS (near Emporia).  But I'd sell it mailed for shipping and FFL fees to any legal US state (in the 48 states) but it will take time as I live in the country and go to town a few times a week-- so no rush jobs please.

Sincere offers will each be responded to and if I sell off the reloading items, I'll update this listing.  But please send a name and number to receive the same in kind; as I won't be able to reply to anyone less than sincere.  Thank you."

How do I KNOW this is a RUSSIAN capture?

First off these weapons were captured by the Soviets on the Eastern Front and every one taken forcefully from the German military. These rifles were then taken back to the USSR where they sat in storage until the 1950's when they were all pulled out, rearsenaled and put into reserve due to Soviet fears of an invasion during the Cold War. THESE are the weapons an invader would have faced from the Soviet Homeguard had such a war occured. Many of them were sent to hotspots all over the world including to Vietnam and Palestine during the sixties and seventies as ""sterile"" weapons that could not be traced back to the Soviets.

I take exceptional care of my weapons.

What I have to go with it:
-Original Case w/cleaning rod and tip (never used, cause I have my own cleaning stuff)
-Original Paperwork and receipt
-Pelican 1170 (Im sure you know this brands reputation on protecting stuff)
-(1) Full box of FMJ qty 100
-(1) Almost full box of FMJ qty 38
-(1) Full box of Tactical Hallow Points qty 41 (only missing one clip of ammo)
-(2) Original Mags
-(1) Mag Loader (not needed anymore due to break in of Mag)
-(1) Raven Concealment IWB Holster (I have tried many holsters this is most comfy)
-(1) Cheap holster (I used this when the gun was open carried or in a bag) 

I am only selling this so I can buy my bow for hunting this year. I will require a Bill of Sale and a photocopy of Current Drivers License, a CHL is also a plus, because this isn't much of a target gun. It's a great everyday carry. Not super firm on price, but I know what everything is worth.

**The pistol only has one wear spot on the slide release from EDC, could be fixed with black paint, but never really bothered me.**

I have a gently used Slide Fire Stock SSAR-15: SBS for sale. It will come with everything needed to mount to your AR-15. This thing is the real deal and was awesome but serves me no practical need other than slinging more ammo down range than needed. I am looking to sale for $250 or $200 and a Magpul stock.

This is for the stock only and is not the entire weapon. If you are not familiar with the Slide Fire product it is a ""bump stock"" it is placed on your AR-15 to simulate fully auto. NOTE THIS IS ATF APPROVED AND REQUIRES NO ADDITIONAL LICENSING OR STAMPS FOR USE. Installation takes all of 5 minutes.

I pulled the trigger too quickly on this purchase (no pun intended) and later found my perfect weapon elsewhere.

http://www.mcnett.com/Frontier-Pro-Portable-Water-Filter-System-P207.aspx

Filter 50 gallons (190L) with the Frontier Pro Water Filter! The Aquamira porous, plastic, micro filter removes 99.9% of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and other contaminants down to 3 microns. Only the finest quality coconut shell carbon is used in the production of the Aquamira micro filter to absorb chemicals, odors and improve the taste of the filtered water.

Connect to almost anything, using the universal connectivity adapter system. The Frontier Pro filter will connect directly to any water bottle with a 28mm opening such as a Platypus or standard bottled water container.

Using the tube connection feature you can connect directly to your hydration system, drink tube, or drink directly from any open container or water source. Since you drink directly from the unit there is no chance of confusing inlet and outlet tubes resulting in possible cross contamination.

The Frontier Pro can also be set up in ""gravity flow"" mode to filter water unattended while you pursue more enjoyable uses of your valuable outdoor time.

Frontier Pro Features:

Compact Size: Fits in the palm of your hand or in a small pocket (1 ¼"" OD x 5 ½"" L, 6.75in3)

Light Weight: Weighs less than one half of a typical pump system (dry weight = 2oz.)

Strap Grip: Protects the Bite Me Valve from contamination and secures cap when in use.

Two Stage Filtration: Replaceable pre-filter removes larger particles. Aquamira porous plastic microfilter removes 99.9% of Cryptosporidium, Giardia.

Pump Free Design: Eliminates hoses, reduces size, weight, and cross contamination potential from hose mix-ups.

Miraguard: Suppresses the growth of bacteria, algae, fungus, mold and mildew within the filter media.

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

I have brass, bullets, and powder, I am just looking for the tools.  For cost reasons I am looking at getting a single stage, but if you have a progressive at a good price I am all ears.  Ideally, if one of you has everything needed including a workbench all ready to use, I would like to get an offer.  If you have such a setup, I would be willing to drive out of Columbia to pick up since it would be so bulky.  I am willing to look at used kits without a workbench as well, but only in the Columbia area.  I'm not picky on brand, but I want a sonic cleaner, so if you have a media tumbler I am not interested in including it in the package.

As it is modeled after a Glock 17 and I am not a Glock fan because of how they feel I should have guessed that I wouldn't get used to this one. The gun has no issues and is very clean. I have the box, lock, manual, two 16 round magazines and the initial shot that was fired through it. Basically what you would get buying one at the store without paying over $340. 

Looking to get $290 or best offer. Make me a reasonable offer and let's talk. I work second shift but could meet you at your lunch break with a bill of sale. I would need to see a purchase permit or Concealed Carry Permit to make certain I am not endangering anyone."
