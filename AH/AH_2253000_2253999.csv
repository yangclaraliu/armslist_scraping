Description: MPA 57
The firearm I have for sale was purchased new (receipt) about 6 months ago for $650. Comes with a decent case, then I bought 2x 30 round mags, an undermount laser (sighted in) an adapter for adding a cheap silencer, and a rubber overmold Grip to make it comfortable to shoot.  THIS THING SHOOTS DAMN STRAIGHT, POINT THE LASER AND FIRE.  Accurate as they come.

I think I am into it for about $850-$900 but Im selling it for a very reasonable $500 with every accessory PLUS 100 rounds of ammo!

I will give a deal on the rest of the ammo as well if you buy the gun.

I have a quantity of ammunition (roughly 200 rounds) in 150 gr and 180 gr that I will include for a fair price. I also have a set of full length reloading dies, as well as a neck-sizer for fire-formed brass. It has a set of Leupold steel optic bases properly installed, though the scope and rings are not included. Since the chambering has been discontinued, this rifle will make a better long-term investment than something more common. I have fired less than sixty round through it, and found that it fired a variety of bullet weights and loads very accurately. The barrel is 27"", so the ballistic performance of the round is marginally increased as a result. I purchased the rifle new while I was home on leave from Baghdad, Iraq in the winter of 2006 and used it to take several deer. I am in the process of eliminating the firearms I no longer use, and though I really like this one, it just doesn't see much use. I will entertain honest offers that consider the value of included ammunition, as well as the rifle. I don't expect full-retail, but I do expect fair market. I would prefer to trade, at least in part. I hate to leave an empty spot on the rack."

242,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2253242,"For Sale/Trade:  M10A Remington, Martially marked WWI Trench Shotgun","Madison, west, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, October 31, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is the real thing, not a replica somebody made from their grandad's goose-gun. The weapon was acquired by a friend's grandfather when he worked at a local post office and the postal service stopped keeping weapons in inventory. It is missing the wooden heat shield, sling-swivels, and bayonet adapter, just like nearly all of them are. All of the mounting points are in perfect condition. I can manufacture and install replica pieces for a price, if desired. The gun is fully functional, and has been perfectly maintained in a mechanical sense. The takedown mechanism works perfectly, and the barrel/receiver fit is tight and square. The bore is mirror-bright with no scratches or pitting. The muzzle is concentric, and cylinder-bore. The exterior is well worn with little remaining bluing/parkerizing (parkerizing on parts of the receiver indicates issue to the USMC), with the exception of the areas that were protected by the aforementioned missing accoutrements, which retain most of the original bluing. There is a serious blade-strike in the end of the magazine-tube, though it has no effect on the function or disassembly of the gun. It looks to me like defensive damage from warding of an edged weapon. I was told by the previous owner that his grandfather had used it occasionally as a grouse-gun, so the bulk of it's use was likely in military service. These guns were retained by the USMC until 1936. The barrel assembly and receiver assembly do not bear matching serial numbers, but both are in the correct range and configuration with correct markings for the emergency-purchased M10A's. The buttstock is a replacement, which is nearly uniform on these guns. As a combat vet, I consider weapons like this to be semi-sacred objects. I have no doubt that this weapon was used in combat, and likely saw some pretty ugly action given the nature of the exterior wear. I am not including any pictures given the extreme rarity of the item. I have some spare parts including a spare bolt and trigger/housing assembly I can include if you're interested. I will entertain serious offers only, and provide pictures on request to interested parties after a tentative offer is made. Most of the ""blue books"" don't even list this weapon, and those that do consider pricing to be speculative given the rarity of sale. I do not need to sell the gun, but feel it would be better-off in a more specific collection where it might be appreciated more. If I do not receive any attractive offers, I will likely donate the gun to a museum for public enjoyment. This is likely the only chance you'll ever have to own and original Remington M10A ""trench"" gun. Any sale or inspection will be conducted in person at a licensed dealer's premises in the Madison, WI area. I store my collectible/high-value items in a secure off-site premises, so some planning will be required."

If you do the math, there is about 2k invested here-and others on armslist want 14-1500 just for the gun.
I'm asking 1250 for everything.
Cash only, please-no trades.
This was a display gun, thus the wear on the beaver tail. It has about 200 rounds through it, but all the brass is new."

Built on the Smith & Wesson N-Frame, the Model 25 is chambered for .45 LC ammo and is designed to use half-moon clips for loading. While they don't have the same mystique as the .44 Magnum, .45 LC rounds carry almost the same power at a lower weight and with less pressure required. The Model 25 is undoubtedly one of S&W's best shooting pistols and is known for its accuracy. The cylinder specs are tight and the rear sight is adjustable for precision shooting. Made to pay tribute to the legendary number 43, this revolver has Petty's portrait and signature embossed in gold on the frame and each one of his seven Winston Cup championship seasons listed on the cylinder. A factory display case is included. The handgun's wood, metal, and bore are all in very good condition.

Have only shot 2 50-rd boxes of federal FMJ amd the partial 50-rd box shown in the picture. 124 rounds total.  Cleaned and lightly oiled before and after both trips to the range. 

There are also TEN 13-round extended magazines (pictured), 7 of which have the XDm grip extenders and THREE 9-round compact magazines for concealed carry.

The pistol is equipped with a CrimsonTrace laser and also includes a custom fit Crossbreed inner-waistband holster. I also have the Crossbreed custom gun belt (with velcro kit), J Hooks, and the receipt and original boxes etc.  I have not carried with the holster yet. I ordered the belt and holster and have just tried it on to make sure it fit.  It is literally brand-new. These are very high-quality components and were not cheap. The holster and belt were 180 $.  The CrimsonTrace custom laser was 170 $.  

Reason I am selling is because we're broke. Mortgage must be paid this month. Would not part with otherwise. 

I'm a little over 1200 $ into this gun with all the extras, even tho I got the mags for pretty cheap when they went on sale about a year ago.

I'm including 129 rounds of ammo as seen in the pictures. One 100-round brick of Winchester and the remnants of a 50-round box of ""Independence"". 

Not pictured but included are the XDm gear that came with the gun. Case, paddle holster, speed loader etc.

FYI, the belt is a 41"" by crossbreed's standards. So should fit a 38-44 inch waist size. You can always have length taken off or add holes (crossbreed will shorten for a fee of 10 $+shipping, but they cannot make it any longer.

About 28 veterans per day commit suicide. A large percentage of those suffer from PTSD. Defensor Tactical in Valley Park, MO opened it’s doors one year ago. With the idea to be a local ammo and firearm manufacturer and gun store with great customer service and innovative ideas. The business was started by two veterans, one being a disabled combat veteran. The business has already raised several thousands of dollars to help various law enforcement and veteran charity groups. A few months ago, Defensor Tactical decided to build and raffle off an AR-15 for the A.M.M.O. Foundation and Randy Couture’s GI Foundation which help Veterans with PTSD get treatment and assistance. Defensor Tactical painted the AR-15 like an American Flag, the American AR-15 has since gained popularity on social media and Cerakote’s website. Randy Couture will be making a special visit to Defensor Tactical to autograph the AR-15 and visit with fans. Raffle tickets are $5 or 4 tickets for $15.00. Randy Couture is also hosting an MMA fight event on Saturday at the Chaifetz Arena for the AMMO Foundation. We would like to invite you to our event, if you have any questions please call us at REDACTED."

The CZ 75 SP-01 was the first full size handgun (4.61” barrel) from CZ to featuring improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the world famous and NATO-approved CZ 75. It features a 1913 accessory rail, rubber grips, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 pistol is based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand and to offer a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry has checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil, and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Weighing 1/3 less that a steel CZ 75, it is great for extended carry.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. Due to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling, the CZ 75 SP-01 is also popular with target and competitive shooting. 

This gun has been lightly used, always stored in climate controlled conditions, and is in excellent condition. It comes with two 18 round magazines, the original box, manual, lock and speed loader.

The Phantom has a 18+1 round capacity in 9mm and also accepts all previous CZ 75 model magazines.

Jennings / Bryco Arms which is not full of ""slop"" thus this piece has not been fired very much at all.

The barrel is stationary while relying on the blowback system to actuate slide upon firing, ejection of spent casing, and feeding of charged round.  

Here is how one can make the gun jam:  never clean or lubricate it; use cheap / dirty ammunition; or limp wrist the weapon on recoil.

The visible ""cartridge in chamber"" is a great feature.  to prevent slide bite - use common sense....use you thumb to hold down your other thumb, thus keeping the ""web"" of your hand away from slide in motion.

I have no reservations at all relying on this gun.  I do my part well, the machinery performs well.
