Its in perfect condition. I have fired about five magazines through it so 50 rounds total. It comes with everything i.e. case, extra magazine, lock, manual, extra fiber optic sights. This is the long barrel 6.88"" fluted hunter version. I would like $500 for it.  I may take partial trades but not really sure what I would be interested in. I am planning to build a custom version so a basic 22/45 and some cash would work.

The write up from Auto Ordnance's website is:
Here is a .45 caliber semi-automatic version of the world's first and most famous military rifle. The Thompson M1 was used victoriously in battles throughout the world, inscribing its place for all times as a legend among military firearms. We offer the same attention to craftsmanship today that made the original so highly regarded. The look and feel are authentic, right down to the side bolt action. The frame and receiver are milled from solid steel or aluminum, the wood is genuine American walnut and the overall finish is a blued steel.

This is a very nice, barely used rifle.  There are two very faint scratches in the stock that are not really noticable unless you are looking for them but i want to make sure you understand the complete condition of this well firing, well cared for rifle.

It comes with a 20 and a 30 rd magazine, a longer charging handle (original is included) and black soft case.

If you've never fired one of these, it is a very smooth firing gun that is supremely forgiving.  I'm only selling it because I have way too many and the wife says something must go.

1100 or best offer.  The gun will be at the Fredericksburg Gun show this weekend (14 Sept)."

In a Split Second, The Eliminator
Ranges... Calculates...Illuminates.

No more guessing yardage or fumbling with a shaky handheld rangefinder. No more losing sight of your trophy. No more guessing holdover. The Eliminator knows the precise horizontal distance to your trophy and exactly what your cartridge will do. Eliminator lights a 1/3 MOA illuminated aiming dot showing exactly where your shot will go. With The Eliminator, just Range, Aim, and Fire.

Starting with the field-proven and bright crystal-clear optics of the original Burris LaserScope, The Eliminator provides a sophisticated yet very simple and accurate means of tailoring the scope’s trajectory compensation to virtually any cartridge.

Sophisticated Technology Made Simple, Simple, Simple.

Simply enter one of the 123 drop numbers into the Eliminator. In a split second, the Eliminator factors in the distance, the angle of the shot, and the ballistics of your cartridge or load, and presents a lighted dot for the perfect holdover.

Ive owned an extremely high number of pistols and have yet to see a better trigger on anything other than a custom series 1 kimber. Very slim; posted below is a photo next to a zippo lighter for a size comparison. It has been praises by many experts for having a grip that fits the hand well without sacrificing concealability. I dont even want to sell it but i just received word of a deployment on short notice and need the money to move my daughter and wife back home before i go. I have a hard case, manual, and the integral lock keys. Has a rail to mount lasers/lights etc. and uses a glock rear sight and a sig front sight; gives you options in a more affordable pistol. its a great cwp gun, got it less than a week ago and i regret letting it go, but need the money."

Just because you put on a new stock or are adding a holster does not make it three times the value that it is worth. When you see a Mosin Nagants because it has a new plastic stock on it for $350 it makes me sick. When I see a ruger mini 14 ranch rifle that's a thousand dollars because it has a different style than what we were put on its disgusting.I truly am sorry if you guys got suckered in and deals where you bought these guns at such a high prices when things were going ape shit.but things have settled down animal is starting to slowly show up at the shop on the shelves and prices have returned to almost normal. I understand people wanting to get their money backon these investments. But when I send an email with a more than fair price $200 for Mosin nagat are you kidding me the $100 rifle day long don't respond with what a horrible lowball offer I'm not dealing with asshole in scum like you.instead realize that you made a bad investment as it happens to all of us in life and just politely say no thank you. I am NOT a guy on here looking to take advantage of people who overpaid for items months ago. If I see something that sparks my interest and I think I might like to buy it I always offer a more than fair price. I try my best to be extremely polite I try to show you what they're going for now and I always try to beat that price. I know that there are a lot of us like that like this on the site we are not trying to screw you we're not trying to take advantage of you we are simply offering a fair price for fair item. And I really don't think that deserves the rude and disgusting comments that I received regarding them.   now for you guys with the ammo you should just be ashamed of yourselves. Asking 60 an $80 for a brick of 22 is just insane. Again guys the the ammo is coming back slowly the prices are coming back down get with it man no one wants to pay your high original price just because you think you can make a greedy buck.

559,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2094559,For Sale:  I.M.I.  Uzi,"Columbus, Atlanta, Georgia","$ 1,400","Listed On: Friday, November 22, 2013",Rifles,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm selling an authentic I.M.I. ( Israel Military Industries) UZI, the civilian-legal, semi-automatic version of the classic sub-machine gun. These have been (and are still) used my military and police agencies around the globe, as well as numerous ""special operations"" types, including even our own Secret Service. 
This rifle is the UZI B Model, imported by Action Arms, and is chambered in 9mm., and features a very sturdy collapsing stock, fully adjustable sights, Parkerized and chrome-lined barrel, both a traditional safety located on the receiver, as well as a grip safety (like a 1911) . It also has a ventilated barrel shroud that I put on it (just 'cause they look so cool !!) 
I've owned this rifle for about 10 years, having purchased it from the original owner, one of my oldest freinds, who originally purchased it around 1980.
 The rifle is in excellent condition, has always fired flawlessly, and is surprisingly accurate.
 Included are 7 Israeli magazines ( one is a 25-rounder, the rest are 32 round mags), 4 of them are virtually brand new. Also included is the original canvas sling and mag pouch, as well as the original ""dummy"" barrel ( short presentation barrel, for looks only.) The heavy-duty,nylon case seen in the pic is included as well.
 For what it's worth, I also have the original owners manual, but I can't find the damned thing !!! I would happily drop it in the mail if/when it ever pops up again.
  Asking $1400,firm, and this price is right in the middle of the range that these have been going for since well before any of the recent Assault-Weapons panics, so it's not an inflated price at all  ( in fact, I did a Google search, and found a page of Armslist sales for these from the past year, and all but one was priced considerably higher).
 Any prospective buyers must be Georgia residents, over 18, and able to prove it with valid Ga. drivers license. 
I'm a legal Georgia resident with my Georgia concealed carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
 Please respond via e-mail with any questions........thanks for looking."

This is a full power+ 300 Win. Mag. load that is designed to shoot targets such as deer and sheep well past 500 yards with precision, yet the bullet will give ample penetration for large elk and moose. This load can also be used for such tasks as 2,000 lb bison, but only if you stick with broadside/double lung shots.

As always Buffalo Bore derives it published velocities from real world firearms and refuses to get involved in the industry wide duplicitous practice of advertising velocities that can only be achieved in extra long laboratory barrels, which the customer will never realize with stock rifles in the field. Notice our below velocities.

3100 fps -- Kimber Montana, 26 inch barrel
3064 fps -- Savage Mod. 116, 22 inch barrel
3021 fps -- Mauser Action with 22 inch Lilja barrel
You’ll notice that my 26 inch Kimber gives only nominal gains over the two other 22 inch barrel. This particular Kimber barrel is a “slow” barrel for a 26 inch barrel and should be generating velocities of roughly 100 fps faster than it is."

Hipoint says they will fix any gun that they manufacture, for any reason.. no matter how many owner's it has had. No box is required, no receipt is required...period. They ask no questions, that is their policy. If you melt it, they will fix it. If you run over it, they will fix it. Their customer service IS the best.
It is 100% reliable..never has had a failure or error of any kind and it looks and feels like a million bucks. It shoulders better than any weapon I have...it's just a natural fit when you bring it up. Muzzle brake is also installed. It has two magazines and is designed to shoot ""9mm luger"" or ""9mm +p"" or ""9mm NATO (hi-power round)"" I'm just seeing what trades are out there. I prefer to trade versus selling. I need a carry pistol...a good one. I would also trade for a Ruger single six revolver with extra mag cylinder. Would trade for a Golden boy in great condition. Will consider other trades"

They ask no questions, that is their policy. If you melt it, they will fix it. If you run over it, they will fix it. Their customer service IS the best.
It is 100% reliable..never has had a failure or error of any kind and it looks and feels like a million bucks. It shoulders better than any weapon I have...it's just a natural fit when you bring it up. Muzzle brake is also installed. It has two magazines and is designed to shoot ""9mm luger"" or ""9mm +p"" or ""9mm NATO (hi-power round)"" I'm just seeing what trades are out there. I prefer to trade versus selling.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this 15-round .40 caliber pistol.
