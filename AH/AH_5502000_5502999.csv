Trailer is great and pulls like a dream. I've had this boat and trailer for about 16 years, and it is great. Only reason for selling is that I needed a bigger boat for my growing family.   The only issue with this boat is that the motor needs a new stator. I had it diagnosed by JNT marine pros in whitewater last fall, and they provided a diagnosis and quote for repair. New stator should be around $350 installed. Otherwise, the motor runs and idles like a dream. This is the perfect fishing boat, and save for a new stator and battery, is ready to hit the lake or river. Here's a link to the part that needs to be replaced. It is available, and in stock. http://www.boats.net/parts/detail/mercurymarine/M-86617A17.html  I prefer cash, but would also consider trades (full or partial) for a nice flatbed utility trailer.

My father had told me that this was part of a set at one time. He said he traded a microscope for it when he was kid growing up in the mean streets of Paterson, NJ. The kid's father who found out about the trade wanted it back, but never did. My father said that it once belonged to John Adams, 6th US President. However, my research would indicate that this is not the case. The inscribed name is merely that of the arms maker, John Adams who had a store in London (indicated by the 'crown' relief on the bottom of the barrel). The date range is merely a guess by some London arms dealers I have communicated with in the past. It is in very good condition. One end of one of the inlaid silver threads, on one grip, is coming loose, but intact. My father, a retired US Army officer and Demolitions expert fired the pistol only once to see if it worked, and worked well (done back in the early '60s)."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5502998,For Sale:  Weatherby Vanguard Scope Mount,"Chicora, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",$ 55,"Listed On: Monday, April 23, 2018",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 1 Inch Weatherby Vanguard (low) is a unique scope mount made of one-piece construction. The rigid design has no joint between the scope and the rifle. The lightweight unitized design eliminates the possibility of an ""out of alignment"" interface or ""loose connection"" between the ring and base of traditional two piece designs. Ultimately this provides more strength and durability than rival steel rings and bases but doing it with a lighter overall weight. By extruding the 7000 series alloy known for its durability then precision CNC machining the mount to its final design, it provides the strongest, lightest mount system on the market."
