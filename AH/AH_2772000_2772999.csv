10,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2772010,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 5, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

This gun is in excellent condition, the wood has a nice grain and there are no noticeable dings or scratches.  The action is smooth, but not worn, and the gun locks up nice and tight.  The stock has been professionally cut down for a reduced length of pull.  As I said this was professionally done, and the fit from the stock to the recoil pad is smooth with no raised areas, gaps, or marred finish. If you are looking for a shotgun that points and swings naturally, that would also fit a person of smaller stature, you have found it.  Couple that with the mild recoil, yet versatile  load options of the 16ga, and you have a sure winner of a shotgun.
Concerned about finding ammo? Don't be, a quick google search, or gunbot search will turn up loads of 16ga ammo for surprisingly affordable prices. I can tell you all kinds of nice things about this gun and I can even show you pictures, but you need to see this gun, in this condition, for this price to believe it.

I have a couple NOS HKS 547 Speed Loaders that I've decided to part with, I've given up hope I'll find one to purchase, at least one that I can afford. 

I paid a lot for them when I found them last year in hopes I'd find the gun but I've decided to move on now.

I'm told the going rate is 60.00+ each, I'll sell them here for 50.00 each plus shipping, just trying to get my money back, I paid 55.00 + shipping, I was told their almost impossible to get anymore so I bought them. 

I rather not list them on Ebay but I need to get as much of my money back as possible before I move on to another purchase so I'll start here.

Packages are rough (hanger hole tapes & stapled), yellowing, although sealed and unused. 

If interested feel free to let me know."

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life.

The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used."

If you are looking for a shotgun you will be hard pressed to out perform a Mossberg!

Looking for an easier way to transport your Mossberg 500? Easy - pick up the Mossberg JIC II and you will have the most travel ready 12 Gauge Shotgun available on the planet. The Mossberg JIC II is the takedown version of the venerable Mossberg 500. Never be left unarmed with this excellent defensive tool with discreet carry case.

I purchased it NEW in 1992 and it has never been fired or had a round chambered in it since it left the factory. I am a Remington 870 Armorer and I added a sidesaddle and factory Remington mag extension. The 870 has been a safe queen every since as are alot of my firearms. It comes with the original box, papers and the factory mag spring and cap should you want to convert it back to original 4 round capacity.
NOTE...This is a real Police Magnum, not an express magnum or that so-called ""tactical 870"" that is really no more than an express 870. Police Magnums are different and were built to a much higher standard than their civilian counterparts and DID NOT use MIM parts that can fail like the Express Magnum. Don't expect a hunting model to measure up to a Police Magnum's quality. These guns are built to a high standard because lives will depend on it not failing when an officer needs it. This firearm was built way before Remington was bought out by Freedom Group. 
Buyer must show a valid Concealed Carry Permit or pistol purchase permit with NCDL to verify they are legally allowed to purchase a firearm. FTF in the Leland/Brunswick County area only."

I used to have a bipod and high-power scope on this rifle and had it set up as a MBR for long-range out to 600-800 yards. I got consistent .75-1.5MOA with this rifle.

No other trades will be considered unless it's a Ruger Gunsite Scout 18"" SS and you've got some cash/ammo/silver on top.

Let me know what you have and we can talk. Best way to get me is email - REDACTED

I love the SK, but I've decided to go to a pocket pistol for my CCW and get a HK45T or HK45CT for a fun gun.

This P2000 SK is BA date code (2010 manufacture date). It has the light LEM V1 fire control group (4.5lb DAO). It does NOT have night sights - factory three-dots are on it.

I have two (9) round factory magazines as well as a single (12) round factory magazine that has the X-grip extension on it.

I also have an HK box, palm swell grips, etc that will come with this one.

Just look at the pics and you can see that this SK hasn't been broken in yet. It's sadly a safe queen that hasn't been used. There is essentially zero barrel wear, with the light marking just starting to show from racking the slide. I think I have shot this gun a grand total of 10 rounds - a single magazine. I store it ""wet"" since I'm near the coast and we have high humidity, so don't get scared off if you see some shiny spots - that's just Brownell's Rust Preventative or M1 5W30.

I also have 230 rounds of Federal LE HST JHP ammo as well as another 565 rounds of Blazer Brass, plus another 106 rounds of various loads like Winchester FMJ and HP and Blazer Alum Case FMJ that I can sell to whomever buys this gun. 901 rounds total!

Gun plus Ammo = $1100 FTF, $1150 shipped.

A truly unique design. The -L (long) model allows a 4.2"" barrel in a gun just under 6"" long. Read the full specs at the Boberg website. There are mixed reviews online but all the negative ones I've read involved using incompatible ammo. You really need to use decent-quality, compatible ammo from the list on the Boberg website.

New-in-box. Never fired, never holstered. I am the original owner.
Has factory-installed Tritium night sights and comes with the original box and a total of 4 magazines.

Cost me $1,628 with night sights and spare mags when I bought it in August last year. Selling it for $1,200.

From the Sig Sauer website:

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

I don't know if it has ever been fired, looks to me minimum rounds through it if any at all. Based on the serial number the gun was manufactured in 2010. This gun is in excellent condition with Very Little Cylinder Ring. Only serious inquiries, if you make an offer be prepared to honor it. No low ball offers will be answered. Please leave a name and phone number with you offer. I hate I have to say the last three things but the scam artists on this site are getting to be as bad as Craigslist.
