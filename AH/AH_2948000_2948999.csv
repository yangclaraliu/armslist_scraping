The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

NO NYC Sales. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit buy it 3 times, and you’re buying 9, not 3, and so on. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional magazines at the same per-mag price and with no extra shipping charges. From the arsenals of the German Federal Police, the Bundespolizei, come these well maintained factory Walther magazines to fit the P-38 Pistols and their P-1 descendants. These particular magazines were issued with GFP model P-38 and P1 Lightweights that saw service during the middle years of the Cold War, many of them involved in protecting our own American Soldiers and fellow citizens. Most are date stamped, but not all. Dates range from 1958 through 1963 on the ones that are stamped. Parent pistols were all very well preserved, and we have them listed in separate individual ads, pricing ranging from $339 to $359 each. Manufacturer is Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen of Ulm and Arnsberg, Germany. Construction is entirely steel, including the floorplates and serrated cartridge followers. Bodies are ported on both sides for cartridge count, and each magazine holds Eight rounds of 9mm Luger caliber ammunition – 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, 9mm NATO, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Finish is matte blue or military parkerized, with white steel cartridge follower. All of them bear the Walther Banner, and they are all stamped P38 9mm near the floorplate on the left side of the magazine body. Most specimens we have examined bear Federal Police issue code 1005-12-; and most have month and year of production beside that on the back strap of the magazine. Surface wear will be moderate; we rate these P38 Magazines as Good, often Very Good, and photo specimens ought to suffice for shoppers to check our grading. All of them came to us well lubricated. Replacement pricing nowadays on most any Walther Steel magazine is $50 apiece or more. Our single magazine, onesy twosy price is $29 each. We’re offering these fine Walther magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

The bore is good, the finish is actually pretty decent for being a war finish.  As a funny little extra when I removed the grips on this after first buying it, it contained a couple small matches wrapped in some fabric.  No clue if they were put there by the original soldier or someone later but its a neat little thing at no charge.   Selling due to unemployment so not especially open to trades but feel free to offer, worst I can say is no.  Definitely not looking to trade where I need to add cash.

The tippman and spyder have never been played with only shot them a few times and they work perfectly. I am asking $400 obo for everything also I can break it up.

It has a Mapgul AK pistol grip installed and a custom fitted hand guard. 

My price is VERY reasonable and the following is what is included and how much it's valued at. Not looking to sell individually, just breaking down the numbers so you can see I'm not trying to screw you over. 

Zastava AK Pistol with one 30 round magazine w/ custom fitted Tapco handguard (original hand guard has been painted black and will be included): $550
4 additional 30 round magazines (5 total mags): $80
Mapgul pistol grip. Installed but will include the box and original grip: $20
AK pistol arm brace (installed & will include box & ATF letter of legality): $140
200 rounds of Tula 7.62x39 (40 loose rounds and 8 20 round boxes): $8/box. $80 total. 

Considering the above, I am asking $870 for the entire package. I'd jump on this while you still can. These arm braces are in high demand due to the recent ATF ruling that using this as a shoulder stock does not classify it as a short barreled rifle. 

Buyer must have pistol permit and NH photo ID or pay for the transfer at a gun shop.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several
intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light
conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint
Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during
critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual
Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light
output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include
other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light
transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and
precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged
construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from
aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled
to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish
eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. It's water
resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging
hunting conditions.

REMEMBER: fast is only good if you hit what you need to! The good: Overall in very good condition, box, scraper, brush, original front and rear sights. Included are three original magazines in great shape. The magazines are marked LE only, but that doesn't apply now. It’s a rare weapon in great, serviceable condition. It has always been given the care and maintenance it deserved. They are hard to see, and amount to nothing, but wanted the buyer to know.

Up for trade is a USED Glock 23, GEN 3, with exactly 250 rounds through it.  Pistol was purchased by me from the Marksman in May of 2010. It comes with the original case, two fired rounds from the factory, three (3) 13 round magazines, and night sights (sorry, no factory paperwork).  Take a look at the pictures and you will see that there are NO scratches, dents or dings on this pistol.  It was cleaned, lubed, and stored after every range visit.  As is typical of Glocks, it has fired with every squeeze of the trigger with no FTF or FTE.  Absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, just getting away from striker-fired pistols.

I would like to trade my G23 for something that shoots .45 ACP, 5.56mm, or 30.06 (no striker-fired pistols please).  I have 150 rounds of UMC .40 cal FMJ and 27 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP to even up the trade if your trade has more value.

I am located in Lacey and would be willing to travel approximately 30 minutes in any cardinal direction, maybe a little further for the right trade.  FTF will be conducted in a public place of my choosing.  I am an honest guy that treats people fairly and I expect the same from those that I conduct business with.  If you don’t fit in this category then go bother someone else. 

CPL and DL from the state of Washington is a must.  If you are military contact me and we will work it out.  I will require a peek at both (no pics) documents and will do a transfer of ownership for both parties that will go no further than my safe.

Send me an email through Armslist and I will respond ASAP.  More pics available upon request."

It is a 1933 Tula ex-PE sniper, hex receiver. I have had the bolt turned down to the proper configuration. It also has a ""smith sights"" adjustable front sight post, as well as a jmeck low profile no gunsmith clamp on scope mount currently with a Bushnell Banner CF500 scope on it. Reproduction sling as well, and about 70rds of surplus ammo. 1933 was the first year sniper rifles were specifically produced however they did not mark them as such until 1934. So there is no steel stamp marking identifying it as a ""sniper"" rifle, however the PE mounting holes are there, albeit plugged from the rearsenal process. I can send pics of them on request as some disassembly is required to see them well. This rifle has not been counter bored either and is in overall great shape! This stock is in great shape as well!

You can purchase a reproduction PE scope and mount from accumounts for a period correct setup but that was a little more than I was willing to spend, and more work (drilling out welds) than I was up for!

Included are three original magazines in great shape. The magazines are marked LE only, but that doesn't apply now. It’s a rare weapon in great, serviceable condition. It has always been given the care and maintenance it deserved. They are hard to see, and amount to nothing, but wanted the buyer to know.

Made in Germany and designed for Military live fire training exercises. The FBI still uses it to this day as well.

It is an all plastic round (except the primer) that is the same dimensions as a traditional .308 round.  It's accurate enough out to about 200yds with an approx/average muzzle velocity of 4,400fps @ 472 ft-lbs of energy pushing a 10gr projectile. Pretty crazy huh?

YouTube video of this same exact ammo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnEdwZv9WsU 

I have personally shot this stuff through 3/4"" plywood at well over 100 yards and it just punches right threw it like nothing. That said, this stuff IS NOT A TOY. IT IS LETHAL at considerable distances.

It was sported slightly. It has an after market butt pad and rear sights. Someone also cut the ""wings"" off the front sights.

All of this for a nice gun. I do not own one piece of cheap electronics and can get up to twelve hundred more dollars for the right weapon. But I don't want to and need the rest of my money for other things, but when and if push comes to shove, I can offer $1400.00 of my money that I need for far more important things and the weapon is for a concealed weapon license to protect my father who was given two years to live a year and a half ago. One blow to his chest and he's dead. Point is, I want to keep him alive a lot longer than two years. I don't want your sympathy. I want this gun to protect my father and keep him alive two or much longer than that. So if you see something you want or must have, we can trade even up or I might add cash if your gun is worth it. Thanks.

Call, text or e-mail me. Just be quick. I need a new gun sooner than later to protect his well-being and livelihood:

Made in Germany and designed for Military live fire training exercises. The FBI still uses it to this day as well.

It is an all plastic round (except the primer) that is the same dimensions as a traditional .308 round.  It's accurate enough out to about 200yds with an approx/average muzzle velocity of 4,400fps @ 472 ft-lbs of energy pushing a 10gr projectile. Pretty crazy huh?

YouTube video of this same exact ammo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnEdwZv9WsU 

I have personally shot this stuff through 3/4"" plywood at well over 100 yards and it just punches right threw it like nothing. That said, this stuff IS NOT A TOY. IT IS LETHAL at considerable distances.

I have approx 900 rounds remaining. Most of which is still factory sealed.

All of this for a nice gun. I do not own one piece of cheap electronics and can get up to twelve hundred more dollars for the right weapon. But I don't want to and need the rest of my money for other things, but when and if push comes to shove, I can offer $1400.00 of my money that I need for far more important things and the weapon is for a concealed weapon license to protect my father who was given two years to live a year and a half ago. One blow to his chest and he's dead. Point is, I want to keep him alive a lot longer than two years. I don't want your sympathy. I want this gun to protect my father and keep him alive two or much longer than that. So if you see something you want or must have, we can trade even up or I might add cash if your gun is worth it. Thanks.

Call, text or e-mail me. Just be quick. I need a new gun sooner than later to protect his well-being and livelihood:

Consolidating my collection a bit further to fund a wedding ring, so this needs to go. 

I purchased this SIG new at the end of this past summer.  It's the Swiss non-railed frame version and features a loaded chamber indicator, external extractor, and standard sights.  The pistol is in fantastic shape and has always been well cleaned after use and fed brass non-corrosive ammunition.  Outside of the barrel shows a bit of finish wear from the action, but nothing serious.  I exclusively used it as a range piece, so there's no holster wear, etc.  Pictures show the magazine release set up for a lefty (as I'm a southpaw), but I can easily switch it back over to the standard right-hand configuration for you.

All of this for a nice gun. I do not own one piece of cheap electronics and can get up to twelve hundred more dollars for the right weapon. But I don't want to and need the rest of my money for other things, but when and if push comes to shove, I can offer $1400.00 of my money that I need for far more important things and the weapon is for a concealed weapon license to protect my father who was given two years to live a year and a half ago. One blow to his chest and he's dead. Point is, I want to keep him alive a lot longer than two years. I don't want your sympathy. I want this gun to protect my father and keep him alive two or much longer than that. So if you see something you want or must have, we can trade even up or I might add cash if your gun is worth it. Thanks.

Call, text or e-mail me. Just be quick. I need a new gun sooner than later to protect his well-being and livelihood:

Most ""pen guns"" fall into the legal category of ""any other weapon,"" and as such, must be registered. R.J. Braverman’s Stinger Pen Pistols, however, must be folded into a gun-like shape before firing, earning them a Title I designation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (Title I firearms are just ordinary guns with no additional regulations imposed upon them).
These little pistols were produced in the early 1990’s and were chambered for .22 LR Rimfire, .22 Magnum Rimfire, .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP ammunition. They were just over 5 1/2 inches in length with a 2 inch barrel when folded. This pen gun has only been shot once it is like new 22cal.

The scope power is adjustable from 3.5-10X and the objective diameter is 50mm. The condition of the rifle is mint. No scratches that I can find on the laminate wood stock either. The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The optics are beautiful and crisp. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. The rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

I will sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, caps, and rings for $650.00. For the Leupold scope, rings, caps, and mount, I am asking $425.00. For the whole package, I am asking $1000.00. You can keep the sales tax! Shipping is available for a marginal amount. Face to face transaction is possible.

Honestly im taking a loss, but I got some great discounts and traded into alot of this so it is not killing me to much to let it go at this price.  That being said I will not go any lower.  This kit is worth well over what i am asking.  I also will not part it out.  I just don't have the time to deal with parting it out, but conceivably one could buy it all part out what they dont want and get an even more ridiculous overall price.

Re-Stocked and Re-blued by the Janesville Sport shop (long out of business).  Wood by Fajen (very nice quality).  The action seems tight, and the bluing is very nice.  I don't believe it was shot much at all after refitting, or much before either, judging by the action.  If you ever wanted to shoot trap with a vintage gun, this would be a nice attractive one to do it with.  Or, if you wanted, you could give it the Cowboy Action treatment.  I understand that a cut barrel can easily be machined for choke tubes.  If it doesn't sell, that's what I intend to do - riot length, and fitted for choke tubes!  With this nice wood, this is a deal at $475 - a real Winchester, not a Chi-Com Norinco copy!
Face to face, cash only.  I don't have boxes to ship etc.
Thanks for looking!
Notice:  After doing a close look with a strong lamp, I noticed some buffed and blued-over pitting on the left side of the barrel, about 9-10"" from the muzzle back.  If you trim to 18"" it won't show; if you trim to 24"", about 3"" will show.  Not too bad, but it is there.
So, it's not perfect, but it is still a pretty nice shotgun.
I only check my desktop e-mails once a day or so - please be patient."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2948998,For Sale:  WWII Japanese Army Officer’s Katana Samurai Sword by Kanewaka,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 650,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 15, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Both handles (Tsuka) will be shipped with the sword at the end of the auction; no matter of the price. The maker is Kanewaka per Slough's book on page 72. The other kanji is the date, with the Showa era stamp above it (from 1937-1945). In good overall condition, it measures approx 38-1/2” overall with a blade length of 25-5/8” and scabbard approx 28-3/4”. The wrapped handle (Tsuka) over white ray skin with unusual Menuki on both sides. The Pommel (Kashira (頭?), on the end of the handle (Tsuka) is missing and wrap is not tied on end. I do have a second handle in the pictures that will go with this auction. So you get two handles with the sword. The blade does show age graying and nicks-Temper line is there but faint. The (rayskin) Same-kawa (samegawa) (鮫皮?); on the scabbard (Saya (鞘?) is in very good condition; you can slide off the rayskin cover and see a black lacquered scabbard that is made in two pieces. The Tsuba is plain and appears to be made of iron. I purchased this katana at a military auction a couple of years ago and have lost interest in Japanese Military items."
