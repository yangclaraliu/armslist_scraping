I've picked up a jig and a mill and moved on to aluminum...   This is an EP Lowers pink with contrasting color making it easy to complete with just a Dremel tool and a drill.   I recommend using a jig for the 2 pin holes and safety selector hole.  If you want when you pick it up, you can borrow my jig and drill press and drill those out yourself while here. The jig makes it easy to be spot on with correct placement. Get the hole locations wrong and timing it can be a PITA or possibly impossible.

The stock photo below shows detents where to drill. This was later changed to ""pimples"" that stick out instead... It's too easy IMO to get off at an angle with the ""pimples"", thus my offer to let you borrow my jig/drill press when you pick it up.

Local F-T-F only -  also cannot instruct you on how to drill, mill, etc. your lower. Do your homework first. Just allowing you to borrow my jig and drill press if you want while here."

Shot  10-20 rounds through it.

This gun features an adjustable gas system which will need to be played with to find it's sweet spot with your preferred ammo. The condition is absolutely mint. Not a single flaw, no cosmetic defects, has been locked up untouched since I bought it. 

IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT RECOIL -- there is virtually none, due to the fact that the gas can be adjusted. Don't believe it, then watch some videos on youtube.

It's top barrel flat is unsigned, but the trigger plate, behind the triggers, is stamped ""N. Wendell Lancaster, O"". This may have  been the builder. Research and discussions lately have also pointed possibly toward a gunsmith named Don Davison from Gray, TN. (the engravings on this rifle are incredibly similar in design (flower and feathers on the trigger guard) and execution to another gun in a local collection that is signed on the barrel by D. Davison) Mr. Davison was taught to engrave by a gentleman named Lester Smith. Of interest, Lester Smith worked with the great Hacker Martin. If you find and study the engravings of some of the magnificent Hacker Martin rifles, you can see the influence in this rifle! Just incredible! The carving and engraving work is beautiful. Incorporating german silver inlays with brass and iron. This is just a fantastic early contemporary rifle. Fine, early 42"" GR Douglas Barrel in 45 caliber. 57"" overall. Large german silver eagle on buttstock. All inlays engraved. Engraved trigger guard. Hidden pivot patchbox release in toe plate. My pictures don't do it justice.

I have had this little truck about 5 years now and have been very happy with it.  However my arthritis is making it difficult to use the 5spd. Manual transmission.  Therefore I am into a newer vehicle with auto trans.

This will make an excellent get around town truck and/or hunting fishing truck.  It has never failed to start and run even in the coldest winter. The body and interior are clean.  It has power steering and brakes and radio.  No A/C (sorry)

It gets good mileage and the motor, trans, rear end and brakes and lights all seem to be in good shape. Tires are about 50%

I have owned this gun for about a year and put maybe 100 rounds through it. I just bought a glock 27 as my new ccw so I don't have use for it anymore. I was at Cabelas last week and they had this exact gun, fair condition, PRE OWNED for $411 plus tax. You can call up there and ask they may still have it on the shelf. I see these guns in other states on armslist go as high as $450. Look for yourself. I need to sell quickly for vacation so first $250 takes it. It is a solid little gun for the price. I have owned this and the Ruger LCP and prefer this over the LCP. Comes with one mag. Text 270-fiveOfive-22fiveone or email with offers. No lowballers. I'm already giving it away.

The flag size is 80cm by 135cm, or 30 inches by 50 inches. According to the Flaggenbuch, printed for the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine, the flags that were designated 80cm x 135cm were for U-boats, E-boats, and Tugs. While we can’t say for certain this was on a U-boat, we can say definitively according to the German’s own reference manual that this is the size they used.
This flag has its original sewn in halyard rope in great condition. It has three minor moth holes, and one minor rip about 3 inches in size, please refer to the pictures above. There is some discoloration to the white areas of the flag, but the original red, white and black colors are still rich. This flag size is perfect to display, and would look great in any German WWII collection.

An “excellent” example of a French MAS 1873 or St. Etienne Model 1873 Chamelot-Delvigne Double Action Service Revolver produced by Manufacture d’armes de Saint- Etienne from 1873 to 1887. Utilizing 11mm caliber ammunition, these large robust double action revolvers were used widely in World War I and used by French Resistance fighters all the way till the end of WWII. On a interesting note, this is the type of firearm used by Brandon Frasier’s character in the popular movie “The Mummy”

 All external parts are matching, even the screws. The internals also match to their own serialization. The pistol is in as found condition with a light patina on the metal surface absent of any rust or pitting. The lettering and proof marks are very crisp and clear throughout the revolver. The checkered wood grips are in good condition having just two small bruises in them, which appear to be from legitimate use. This particular revolver is dated “1878” and is in overall NRA Antique Firearm Condition of “excellent” with sharp lettering, solid checkered wood grips, and a good bore.

Original Inert WWII Japanese Type 91 Fragmentation Grenade fresh out of an estate in Charlotte, NC. This Japanese Type 91 grenade was dug from the ground, then it was demiled and made inert for souvenir and collecting purposes. The Type 91 had a seven second delay, which was impractical for a hand grenade but more suited for its other intended use as a projected munition. They could be projected from a 50mm “Knee Mortar”, rifle grenade launcher, or by hand. It mostly saw service as a hand grenade and accordingly the Japanese updated the next design, the Type 97, to have a shorter fuze time. The fuze is a percussion activated delay, started by pulling the pin and then striking the cap.

It has seen some wear on the outside, probably due to being in the ground, but appears to have the majority of the parts. This Type 91 Japanese grenade still has visible Japanese writing, and is priced modestly compared to other original WWII munitions.

I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol.

compound, black phosphate outer finish and inner chrome lined.

I recently bought a new red dot green dot scope with several adjustment and put on it so i havent sighted it in yet but with irons at 75 yards is very accurate. For a brush gun, four wheeler gun, or truck gun this is really hard to beat and obviously with the 9mm recoil it is very soft shooting and easy for follow up shots. I can meet here in greeneville.

Description:

The Kobra is a truly unique pistol, and one of Ed Brown's most innovative firearms. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative and popular snakeskin metal treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering. This no-nonsense design has an elegant simplicity that has yet to be matched. The Kobra is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra!

The Kobra features the following:

5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. Exclusive snakeskin treatment on fore strap and mainspring housing. A beautiful, unique, and snag free gripping surface. Matte finished slide for low glare, with snakeskin on rear of slide only. Fixed dovetail 3- night sights with high visibility white outlines."

I have a Kahr CM9 chambered in 9mm. The Kahr is a 2013 model with zero issues and in Great shape. CM9 has had 78 perfect rounds through It. The reason I am letting it go is I now have a PM9 that has taken its spot. The CM9 is a great CCW that is about as close to a pocket 9 as they come. Very accurate and well made piece. I will attach a picture of the CM9 between a Glock 26 and a P3AT to give you an idea of the size.

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.
The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.
Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

WWII Kriegsmarine U-boat” flag in very good condition with visible Ink Kriegsmarine Eagle M Swastika, and “Reichskriegs-Flg. 0.8 x 1.35”. The flag size is 80cm by 135cm, or 30 inches by 50 inches. According to the Flaggenbuch, printed for the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine, the flags that were designated 80cm x 135cm were for U-boats, E-boats, and Tugs. While we can’t say for certain this was on a U-boat, we can say definitively according to the German’s own reference manual that this is the size they used.
This flag has its original sewn in halyard rope in great condition. It has three minor moth holes, and one minor rip about 3 inches in size, please refer to the pictures above. There is some discoloration to the white areas of the flag, but the original red, white and black colors are still rich. This flag size is perfect to display, and would look great in any German WWII collection.

Glock PF3050201 G30 45 ACP 3.78"" 10+1 w/FS Polymer Grip Blk
The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and
control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

GLOCK INC Short Frame
Glock PF3050201 G30 45 ACP 3.78"" 10+1 w/FS Polymer Grip Blk
The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and
control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.
