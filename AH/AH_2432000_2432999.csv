The P245 is a .45 auto compact and slightly shorter version of the P220. It was replaced by the P220 Compact, although nothing changed but the name. The P245 features a DA/SA trigger with a decocker and the Short Reset Trigger (SRT). It has an aluminum frame and stainless slide with a nitron finish.

This gun has some light holster wear. It was used as my carry and only very lightly fired. There have been about 500 rounds through the gun in the 9 years its been alive. I would rate it a 8/10. It comes with two 6-round magazines and the original factory night sights (Trijicon) that aren't nearly as bright as they used to be, but still have life in them. I do not have the original case. I will include a new(ish) Tactical Tailor pistol case with the right offer.

Sorry about my pics. Let me know if you'd like to see any specific photos of any of the internals. Truly, the only real wear is the holster wear you see towards the very end of the slide.

This is a single-stack .45 auto. The compact pistol is a ""cut-down"" variant of the famous SIG-Sauer P220, which is widely recognized as the most reliable pistol on the planet. Intended mostly for US market, this pistol is suitable for concealed carry and as a police backup weapon. The P245 has a traditional SIG-Sauer reliability, and, while somewhat heavy for a concealed gun, it offers a good recoil control. P245 was manufactured in Germany by the J. P. Sauer & Sohn company, which is a part of the international SIGARMS corporation.

The P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel, and has a separate breechblock held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double/single action and features the short reset trigger as well as an external hammer and a decocking lever on the left side of the frame. There's no manual safety, but P245 is provided with automatic firing pin safety. Just point and shoot.

Series 70, rounded grip, full-size frame with 4"" bushing-less barrel, match-grade everything, night sights (2011), nice trigger, ambi safety, etc. The pictures speak to the condition of this gun.

This one isn't cheap, but it is bargain-priced for what it is.

This gun shows plenty of honest, carry-type wear, mostly around the muzzle and on the right side. The right side safety has a nick in it but doesn't affect function in the slightest. If I have an extra right-side safety laying around I'll swap it out...no guarantees on that and don't count on it. It's dirty. I photo'd it while dirty just to show the unmolested condition of the gun. I'll give it a thorough cleaning prior to transfer. The bore is fine. I think it's been carried far more than it's been shot.

The sale will include the original box with all the paperwork, manual, one Kimber mag, one Wilson Combat mag (because I'm a really nice guy!) and two of the Kimber dis-assembly tools.

Transfer will be at Colorado Gun Broker in Bailey. It's easy to get to on Hwy 285 only 25 mins from the C-470/US 285 interchange and it's an easy drive...easier than driving across Denver.

Like I said...I'm letting this one go cheap. I know it's got some holster wear. So what. It's a gun that has an MSRP of $1596. They generally sell for around $1300 and up on GunBroker + shipping + transfer fees.

Seriously...I have the Ultra version and a Super Carry Custom HD version (full-size, all steel). Fantastic guns and I'd shoot them against any other brand with any ammo. I've sold thousands of Kimbers in the past and owned dozens. None have ever failed me and the Super Carry line is one of their best."

This is almost a complete Colt rifle kit minus lower receiver. This A2 upper is in EXCELLENT condition, it's seen little use, it's all original Colt as are all the included parts. As you can see by the photos there is little to no wear on the outside or inside. I believe this upper came from an R6550 AR-15 A2 Gov't Model mid-80s vintage rifle. It has the 1/7 twist, government profile barrel (it's smaller diameter under the handguards). It has all the A2 features including 800M sights, forward assist, brass deflector, etc.

It even includes an adapter so you can use a standard front take-down pin instead of the two-piece screw type that's included so it should be able to fit most any modern lower.

Aside from the lower receiver, here's what I can tell is missing off the top of my head:

    Rifle receiver extension (buffer tube)
    bolt catch with spring, roll pin and detent
    selector spring and detent
    buffer retention detent and spring
    selector lever detent and spring 

This is a fantastic upper that would make a great rifle with your lower receiver and a few minor parts.

I'd prefer a FTF in Bailey or Conifer but I'll also ship if you prefer. I'll accept cash, money order or discreet PayPal. You'll pay the 3% PP fee.  No FFL needed.

I can build this into a complete, functioning rifle, including a brand new mil-spec lower receiver and all the missing parts for an additional $125.00.  Ask me for details."

This is the full sized, 18"" barreled model, that holds 15 rounds of .22LR, 17 rounds of Longs, or 21 shorts. There isn't a mark on this rifle - the wood and metal are perfect, and it's been safe kept and cleaned after the couple of range outings I took it on.  It comes as shown, with the factory box and dessicant wax paper. The box shows some wear from storage by the original owner, but it's sound enough to wrap as a Christmas gift for some lucky kid (or stick it under the tree for yourself, and save your wife the trouble of choosing a gift for you) - Santa doll not included.

What I'm looking for is a pre-safety Marlin 336 or Glenfield 30A in .30-30. Nothing else. Cosmetic condition is not crucial, as this will be Cerakoted eventually, but it must be mechanically sound, with a very good bore and no pitting (minor spots of surface rust or freckling don't scare me, as long as they don't penetrate the metal.) Wood can have safe dings or worn spots - just no cracks, splits or major gouges.

Not interested in shipping - this is for FTF in Tampa / Pasco / Spring Hill area only."

This guns is new in the box ready for shipment.

Description:

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

I am selling all four of my firearms and their ammo;

1. Western Auto revelation model 200 lever action 30-30. This is actually a marlin 336 that was made to sell in western auto stores. It is screw for screw the exact same gun. It has great rifling and lever works smoothly and precisely (unlike the newer Marlins that are actually made by Remington. It even has the original ""JM"" stamp on the barrel. comes with 150 rounds of 30-30 and an ammo bandolier. 

2. CRICKET youth bolt action single shot 22lr ( this gun is about 30 inches long total ) I used it as a little backpacking gun. Has special ordered scope mount and an older model tasco scope that works great with it.

3. GSG MP5-22. comes with red dot and 2 mags. Awesome looking and shooting gun. This gun comes with 6,600 rounds (no, that's not a typo - 3,300 are in new unopened boxes, and 3,300 are also new but loose in a millitary ammo box that is included). PLEASE do not ask me to sell you some of the 22 ammo I am only selling everything as one price.

4. Full size Custom Build 1911 45 acp. I recieved this gun in a trade and brought it to a professional who told me that it's a good gun. It is a double stack Para Ordinance lower (holds 13+1 instead of 7+1) , it has a Thompson slide, Colt internals and last but not least a Colt MK IV series 70 barrel . This pistol comes with about 350 rounds of ammo.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

LINK IS IN THIS AD AND IF YOU GO TO GB MY AD EXPLAINS EVEN MORE WITH BETTER PICS!!!!

I have a very very Rare Randal 1911 .45 acp, 
if you don't know what this is then here is the best link I have found on the net explaining this hand gun.


http://www.m1911.org/mod_randall.htm  

it will also be how I explain why and how rare this 1911 really is. 

First off there are both sides of whether these are good 1911's or not, most the not are people who have never shot one.... 
in my opinion they shoot just like a Colt or S&W 1911 and I have been shooting for near 40yrs 

The Randal company came to fame being the first ever to offer a High-end left handed 1911 in both 45acp and 9mm 
but they only ever produced 3,431 guns in .45 and only 9968 in all their models . 
Like all guns being a new company they had some problems that were fixed but were not around long enough to make a bigger name in firearms then what they did. 

now about my Randal 
 I have it posted on GunBroker.com with a buy it now price of $4500
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=378728066
once it gets a bid I can't pull the ad but until then I can
And with the amount of watchers on the gun I'm sure it's going to sell, just a lot of money right before X-Mas lol
first I'm looking  for 1/2 cash 1/2 trade

my Randal is a Top Shelf Collectable piece, 
 first off it was the 15th gun ever made by the Randal company out of the 3,431 guns 
second it could be 1 of 5 given to the police for a trail as a off duty carry piece 
with the S# on this gun it has NO RF in front of the S# only the first 200 guns or less have this, and those command a 150% higher values then a basic Randal 
 it has the letter C behind the S# and with this and the Receipt I have shows it was given to the Chief of Police in Anchorage Alaska and I got it from his friend. 
it was on a Loan as a Trail off duty carry 1911.... which he then bought. 
there are only 5 of these out there, and only 2 of the 5 have been found, the 2 are valued at 5Xs what this ones base price is. 
I have Steven P. Fjestad at BlueBook Publications looking into if it is the second of the 2 guns, he is doing some background work on this because of how rare it truly is, 
 I was told that it's base value would be from $2,200-$5,000 depending on what shape the gun is in.... 
this gun is in 9/10 condition 97-98%+ light ware at best. 
has almost no wear at all! just from being taken out of holster. 
I have all the paperwork with the receipt showing who it went to, which is also dated showing for a fact it is the 15th gun made by Randall!!!! 
I was looking at $3500-$4500 for it ..... I have also seen some of the basic Rare Randalls not left handed LeMays but right handed 1911s round top fixed sights which is what this is, going for $3k + 
so this rare of one at that value is a steal!!!! 


the price is $3500 Cash $4500 in trade value,  
I'm doing it this way because right now you could end up with a gun worth over $10K-$15K++++ also cash is as they say King when it comes to the way of the world right now.... 
we all would take less cash if laid on the barrel head on a firearm then we would ever trade it for. but the cash price is very firm.... trade we can work with again depending on what is offered, if it is something I truly want then I'm more likely to work a better deal, but the gun is worth $4500 I'm asking $3500 to give a collector a very fair cash deal on this gun, those who deal Randal's will know this. 

There are high end 1911 collectors out there, and this being what it is will most likely be the only chance at getting this high end of a 1911 Randal with such a limited amount ever made and no more will ever be made again, so all this gun will ever do is go up in value unless the world ends and then it will make a great Zombie killer !!!!! 
 Steven will be getting back to me in the next couple weeks to give me more info on this gun after they are done with the Bluebook gun pricing guide this yr, 
 I also gave him permission to use pics of this gun in the book so who knows it could end up being shown in the best gun pricing guide also... 

I'm looking to trade or sell it would prefer trade but if someone pays the full cash asking price I will sell it. 

I'm looking for a AR15 .50 BMG conversion like the one in this link , 
 will still take this type but now have my .50BMG 

http://lgweaponry.com/ad_sheets/50bmg.htm  

since they only run $2k we can talk about trade value 

I'm looking for 
.50BMG ammo 
A REAL 1800's Henry 44/40 
AR10 .308 
Browning Bar Boss 300 win mag or 30/06 
cash/gold/silver bullion, coins, jewelry by weight value 
or????? 
so lets talk and who knows you might end up with a very rare and very valuable 1911 
how often can you say you own a gun within the first 100 ever made? least the first 15.... I owned a Colt that was 374th made but this is the lowest S# I have ever handled and owned 

I hope I have the right area in where I posted this ad, since I screwed up the first time...I have never posted on here so if I screwed up please let me know, 
I have all kinds of pics, so would love to show it off no matter what "") and I want the new owner to know what they are getting! 
any help would be great ty, 
 I have 3 clips for it 1 is a Randal other 2 after market, have a second Randal clip coming off a ad on AL so will have 2 Randal clips as long as the person truly sends it. 
it also comes with a nice aluminum carrying case, it's box, all Randal paperwork and receipt. 
my email address is REDACTED if you want pics or if you want to talk about trade or to buy. ty 

also shipping will depend on a cash deal or trade, if trade each party pays shipping of their item to FFL which means also if you insure it is up to you. 
 if cash I will pay shipping and insurance. to your FFL 
would prefer to deal local in Wa. on trades but that would depend on what is being offered of course.... 
normally I would require a CWP/CPL on any handgun I sell/trade but again that depends on what state and the requirements of that state when dealing with handguns.... 
we are in a non registration state and being so I do a photo gun transfer that was shown to me by a ATF agent so true WA license/ID will work with a carry if you have it, but you must be 21 or I will not sell the handgun. is a Wa. law. sorry. 
ok hope I now have done this right, 

ty for all who have written me and the nice guys I've talked to off here about the 1911 
been very positive for me trying out the site, even though I screwed up right off ....

The Remington 31 is prized for its smooth operation and is often sought out by Remington enthusiasts.  Of all the shotguns I have owned, (870, Mossberg 500, Winchester 1300) this is the smoothest of them all, hands down.

Remington 31's were issued to the FBI, LAPD and the US military during WWII.  

This shotgun is the lightweight version which has a receiver made from what Remington called ""AEROMET"" but is basically an aluminum alloy.  It makes it 1 pound lighter than the regular Model 31.   Originally it was a FULL choke barrel, but a ventilated Poly-Choke was installed at some point.  The Poly-choke has multiple settings.

This is a really nice shotgun and is great for a collector or someone who is looking for a good lightweight hard working shotgun.
