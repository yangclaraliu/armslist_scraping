It used to be called an LV for ""laminated varmint,"" but Savage brought out left-hand rifles and switched to using the ""L"" designation to signify as such. As you can see, it has a salt and pepper laminate stock and heavy varmint barrel. With Wolf MT, this thing was getting between 1/2 and 3/4 MOA at 50 yards for me using a cheap Bushnell 4-12x40AO scope (which as been sold, and is NOT included in the sale!). It comes with one 5-round magazine, the owner's manual, and an old leather rifle bag. It has a dent/scratch on the muzzle that does not  interfere with the crown or affect accuracy at all.

I'm hoping to see $190 for this, but am open to reasonable offers. I'd prefer to keep this a local sale, but will ship if needed. Shipping (if needed) and insurance will be extra, and is to be covered by the buyer. I'll work with the buyer to determine actual shipping charges. I ask for your patience here, as I've never shipped a firearm before and need to learn the ins and outs of it. Payment is to be made via cash (if in person), or with USPS Money Order only. No sales to California! Your FFL must accept shipment from an individual, and I will require a copy of your photo ID to verify that you're over 18.

Features/Specifications:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.  Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.  Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.  The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.  To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

 This is the Cruiser model:
 - Holds 8
 - Parkerized finish
 - Comes with the Tri-Rail accessory rail to hold everything you want to put on it!
- 20” barrel
 - Front sight bead

 Practically new… only shot a few rounds through it, cleaned it and put it up. Have the box, papers, lock, etc... 

 Added the BlackHawk Knoxx recoil reducing adjustable stock. This is a great stock as it greatly reduces the kick when shooting defensive rounds like double or triple 00 buck, etc... Has a nice thick rubber butt pad plus the recoil reducing spring technology and has 6 (I think, maybe 7) adjustable positions to match the shooter and the situation.

 Does have a mark (not a scratch) on the barrel where something rubbed against it (see picture - looks much worse than it is). I’m sure it can be removed but I haven’t tried.

 FTF in Greensboro and all laws will be followed.

 If this ad is up this shotgun is still available. I will not respond to ""still available"" emails.

The riveted plate for the charging handle is still very tight, not loose or missing as commonly found, in fact, all the rivets are still tight.

This is the black oxide (black army 1911)  repro, finish done for the colt factory by famed Turnbull restorations; it was built with the MEU(SOC) 1911 -Marine Force Recon- pistol as inspiration, but retains factory slide stop and thumb safety, which I felt was far more appropriate if it were ever to be concealed carried.

Ruger no longer makes these, not due to any sort of malfunction but they finished the P-series, so you wont see this at any registered Dealers' store. Ive personally put 8 rounds down the barrel and its extremely reliable and accurate. It has the De-cock feature, so you can chamber a round, lower the de-cock lever and the hammer will engage but it wont fire. The next shot will so be careful! Comes with 25 Federal premium Hydrashock rounds, plus about 20 Hornady HPs. 2 eight round mags, and a police style holster that carries one mag. Personally Id like a .40 Cal subcompact or 9mm subcompact, either an XD or Glock. Cash is king though, and if you talk like a gangster and come sagging your pants, I might shoot you depending on the place. I want $450 for it but make me an offer. The worst I can say is no."

Still, the most accurate out-of-the-box rifle made, the Model 700, brings its famous action and renowned consistency to three additions to the prestigious family of guns. When they first introduced the Limited Edition Model 700 CDL SF LTD it was met with great success. In fact it was so successful, customers were demanding a full line be produced. So here it is the full line of Model 700CDL SF rifles. Each rifle is made the same as last year's Limited Edition, but without the engraved floorplate and the Limited markings on the receiver made in your favorite caliber.

I will also include a Burris Fast Fire III Red dot mount and accompanying hardware kit (I received the pistol with a FF3 installed, but it has been removed and OEM sights restored).  Pictures will be posted later today.  All OEM parts are included.  Will not separate upgrades unless someone is only interested in the Stock G21 setup and completes the buy on it, first.

The Saiga autoloading rifle is based on the rugged Kalashnikov design. In the Saiga line of rifles, this timeless design utilizes a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and very few internal parts that provide the reliability that Izhmash has delivered for over 60 years. A hammer forged, chrome lined barrel and chamber provide the ultimate in long life. The driftable post front sight with protective ears is adjustable for windage and elevation. The notched side catch with bar rear leaf sight is adjustable for elevation. The rear sight has presets for 109, 218, & 328 yards. The comfortable, ergonomic operating handle makes charging the firearm effortless. The spring loaded magazine release provides for quick magazine changes. The elongated selector handle allows for a smooth transition from safe to semi-auto. Includes one detachable magazine."

Im not sure what the gunsmith used to coat it, but there is some wear on the edges of the knob where the black paint has come off. Rifle has ~150 rounds down the barrel, very accurate!

If you need just a little less than the 440 round can this is your ticket.  $75 each..price is firm.  Will travel a little bit for the sale.  Will try to get a pic up later.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

I have here a great piece to add to your collection along with enjoying it on your hunt for coyotes or other game.
Very accurate long range without the mess of bigger caliber.
I have here a nice 22.250 made by S&W model 1500 these are considered collectible and were only a certain amount of them made.
This one is in great shape. The wood has a few dings but still is like new.
It has a heavy barrel along with a Tasco 10X50 Scope and a Harris Bipod.
Also comes with a stock sleeve, it was there from day 1 so if you take it off that part of stock is brand new. 
The only thing Is that the barrel has a few spots of the bluing corroded.
Besides that the rifle is in great shape, Especially for the age.
Very smooth and accurate.

I just got it in the last month (its birthday was 9/13).  It is only slightly smaller than the P229; for me I think it is just a tad too big for CC.  It is essentially new, with less than 100 rounds through it (let's call it 99%).  I love my P226, so I figured this would be sufficiently small to carry (two sizes down).  Not quite for my body!.  MSRP: $1146  Comes with two mags, only one of which has been used.  This is SA/DA, with decocker, short reset trigger, night sights, cool Hogue factory grips.  Price is firm (I am ok with keeping it), no trades please; unless it's your sister and she is young and nubile.

If you are out of state, I have an A+ rating on GunBroker.com, with 60 references, all within the past year.  No worries on this deal.

Here is the blurb stuff from Sig:  SIG SAUER introduces the P224, the first true subcompact in its classic all-metal firearms line. Ideal for concealed or off-duty carry, the P224 offers all of the features consumers expect, with one small change.

Based on the P229®, one of the most prolific sidearms in federal law enforcement, the P224 takes the same hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame and puts them in a subcompact package with all of the familiar SIG SAUER controls and functions.

Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 10 rounds of .40S&W giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.

As part of the Extreme family of handguns, the P224 will feature the distinctive black and grey Hogue Piranha grips, SIGLITE Night Sights and the SRT (in the DA/SA version).

“Almost 80 percent of federal law enforcement agencies have chosen the P229 for its durability, reliability and safety,” said Ron Cohen, SIG SAUER President and Chief Executive Officer. “The P224 may be cut down in size, but it hasn’t lost an ounce of these performance features.”"

I found this rifle at a weird grange sale and it had an old metal scope on it at the time. I gave the guy 80 bucks for it thinking it would be a good coyote gun for the back porch. Fast-forward 3 years. I dusted this thing off and ran a cursory check on the scope online. Turns out it had a genuine Weaver 78B1 scope for the early WWII Remington 1903A4 and it was a museum piece. I sold it on ebay for 1k last week and now this little rifle is just sitting here all alone in the world. It fires great but has no sights. A scope would be ideal for it. Has period-correct sling.

Buyer must have a legal form of State of Ohio ID (prefer a drivers license), and must be legally allowed to purchase and possess a firearm (no felonies, drug arrests, Domestic Violence charges, or any other violent charges)."

It is a Gen I Noveske lower with a Magpul aluminum curved trigger guard (which I added upon repair) and all other parts are made/installed by Noveske...buffer tube/spring/buffer, take down & pivot pins (bearing Noveske emblems), magazine catch, bolt release, safety selector lever (with spring and detent) and grip.  It also has a properly torqued castle nut on the buffer tube that is professionally staked.  Finally, it has the Noveske back plate with the QD sling mount and Noveske emblem.  I didn't install a firing group or butt stock as most people want to replace these with the model they want anyways...so you can pick out what you want.  So, it's a ""semi-stripped"" Noveske lower.  Please see pictures and let me know if you have questions.  

This came off of a N4 Rogue Hunter Noveske rifle so it must stay on a rifle...AR pistol is not an option.

I am asking $350 OBO.
Buyer pays FFL & shipping fees...prefer to do face to face sale.
Thanks for looking!"

Item Description:

    Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380 with Crimson Trace laser. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.
    A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I bought brand new in May 2013 and have fired only 100 rounds through it. I have bill of sale of original purchase where I paid $350 brand new for just the rifle. The extra mag, the grip, and the bag were even more.

I really love this gun and contrary to popular thought, they aren't cheap junk. It's a solid and fun rifle - of the 100 rounds I fired through it, not a single misfire or jam. It's not gonna win any beauty contests, but as a home protection firearm it'll make any bad guy think twice."
