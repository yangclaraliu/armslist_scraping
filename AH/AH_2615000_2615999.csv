It comes with three magazines to which I've added Pierce extensions, increasing capacity from 17 to 20 rounds. I spray painted the extensions and ends of the mags to match the OD handgun.

It shows slight holster wear, but other than that is in great condition.

It has a Zev Tech Trigger Upgrade which turns the stock trigger into a 2.5 pound trigger with a very short reset. The trigger upgrade in it is $150. Makes for a far better trigger than that which comes stock on a Glock. It is adjustable. It is really quite incredible to compare the Zev Tech trigger with a stock Glock trigger.

The Glock 34 is intended to be a competition model, with a longer sight radius and barrel, but I have found it to be a superb weapon for self-defense and combat shooting. I'm sure you will too.

I have the case it came with, from Glock, etc.

I also have two Bladetech holsters, an OD Green OWB holster, and an all Black competition style holster which holds the handgun a bit away from your body. $50 each. I also have a to mag belt mag holder from Bladetech for $35.

Includes a Quality Backpack-Style Soft Case

This rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a black synthetic stock and forearm, an 18.50 inch stainless steel barrel with six grooves and a 1:16 inch right hand rifle twist. Clear matte finish. Adjustable rear sight and gold bead front sight. Ten round rotary magazine included. Weighs 4.67 pounds and is 37 inches long when assembled with each half being less than 20.25 inches when disassembled.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side."

US Sporting Goods is proud to bring the Zastava Z98 rifle to the US Market. The Mauser 98 set the standard for bolt action rifle actions a long time ago. Zastava took this military style bolt action and put it into the perfect hunting rifle. For a long time, the only way to get the Mauser action in a quality hunting rifle was to build one yourself, or have it custom built. The Z98 is all of that and more right out of the box. The Z98 features control round feed to ensure proper cartridge seating and ejection every time. Standard features include solid steel floor plate, forged & machined steel trigger guard, bolt and receiver, hammer forged steel barrel, forged and machined steel bolt handle, superior strength, smooth reliable cartridge feed for accuracy, large claw extractor, positive thumb safety and a non glare finish. The Z98 drilled & tapped for most popular scope mounts.
Z98:

Axis rifles save money without sacrificing performance. Savage didn't design a cheaper rifle; they designed a better way to make a Savage, including pillar-bedded barrels with more uniform cooling and greater consistency. These Axis rifles feature a modern design with silky-smooth bolt operation and a detachable box magazine. Drilled and tapped for scope mounts, these XP models come with a 3-9x40 matte blued scope, already mounted and bore-sighted, so it is ready to go on the hunt when you are. They also have a black synthetic stock coupled with a 22"" matte black carbon steel barrel to allow for multi-purpose shooting in multiple locales.

Scabbard is also like new and is also marked US symbol inside of flaming bomb. I am retiring and am selling my collection, I bought this in 1987 along with a M1903A3 and put them both into my climatically controlled vault where they have sat largely untouched for 27 years. I also have a Arisaka Type 38 rifle in Excellent Condition with the seldom seen receiver dust cover, and an original wooden crate of 435 rds 6.5x50 Jap ammo on stripper clips in superb condition, and a Remington made M1917 also in excellent condition, and the above mentioned Remington made M1903A3 in excellent condition for sale, pls email with any questions, I will be listing all the above here on Armslist and Gunbroker soon but feel free to email me now with any questions.

This is a great carry pistol. It has a very simple breakdown for an easy clean. I like the way it cycles, a kind of smooth chug that doesn't leave you off target for easy multiple hits.
This deal is a package deal including the gun, 2 ten rd clips, 2 sixteen rd clips and two padded cases for the gun and extra clips. these clips are about $30 each. These are factory cases and will also include the factory polymer holster and mag holder, cleaning brush, allen wrench and thumbsaver. However these factory polymer holsters suck and I never used them because I dont have a death wish. Thats why I'm including a 70 dollar quality leather holster specifically formed for this gun which also can clip on either open or concealed by switching the clip side and it is very strong and stable.
This is a great piece. I've always kept it well oiled and clean. I has less than 300 rds down the pipe. No problems, works great.

Im selling because I need the cash. I am the original registered owner. FTF in public meetup only and Ohio drivers license required to prove you're an Ohio citizen.

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety. 

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

I've carried it concealed on occasion, but mostly kept it in a drawer for home protection.  The pistol is in excellent condition, and as all of my pistols, it has always been kept meticulously cleaned and properly lubricated.  This pistol comes with two (2) factory 16rd mags, the original case, owner's manual, factory test target, and extra back straps.  The medium back strap is currently installed.  These 1st gen P99s are quite desirable and not easy to find in superb condition like this one.  I'm asking $550 cash face-to-face in the north Dallas area.  I also have several extra factory 16rd mags as well as some holsters that I'll offer first to the buyer of my pistol before I list them for sale online."

1 -- S400 L 79 gallon tank
1 -- TDC3 Pump station controller
1 -- Expansion tank
1 -- Water tempering valve
1 -- Air vent
1 -- Single line pump station
1 -- Roof flashing
2 -- Tubes of calk
Misc. fittings
Mounting hardware for solar panels (I'm not yet sure how they mount or which hardware you'll need but there is a lot of mounting hardware there. I'm pretty sure I have what you will need.)

The owner of the defunct company I am purchasing this equipment from told me they would sell this set up for $8000 not including tax or installation. Wholesale/dealer cost on all of this, NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING OR TAX is OVER $3500. I was told shipping would be another $500 - $1000 on top of that. But keep in mind, the average consumer would have to go through a dealer and there is no way to get any of this at dealer cost, without tax, without installation, and without shipping. This is truly one of those very rare situations to save a bundle of cash.

For the above system I am asking $3000.

I am not an expert in this field but from what I have learned this set up is perfect for a household or apartment building for 1 -- 8 occupants. If there are more people you could either go with more panels or let your backup water heater provide the extra hot water. Either way using this solar hot water system will definitely save you money and will probably pay for itself in just a couple years.

Please feel free to email me. I have specs on the materials, more photos and more info."

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect. The P380 boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.
The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.
The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light-weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol.

Great combat shotgun.
The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.
The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. 
The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.

915,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2615915,For Sale:  Salient Arms International Tier 1 Trigger Kit for Glock 19 Gen4,"Iowa City, Iowa, United States",$ 230,"Listed On: Sunday, January 26, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This trigger kit is for a Glock 19 Gen 4 handgun. It is exactly the same trigger that Salient puts in all of their custom packages. If you haven't heard of Salient Arms International, look up their Facebook page and/or call them. They are a top notch firearms company and they do insanely nice work! This trigger is simply awesome and the only reason I'm trying to sell it is because I need the money for college now that the bills start piling up. It's pretty much brand new! I've fired less than 50 rounds since I've had it so it is spotless! Includes Custom trigger housing, connector, trigger spring, trigger bar with flat-faced aluminum trigger, firing pin, firing pin spring, firing pin spacer sleeve, and spring cups. This is everything you need and all you have to do is throw it in your gun. Also, this trigger kit is already set up with all of the pre-travel and over-travel taken out of the trigger and it's quite spectacular and smooth in my opinion. Salient sells this trigger kit for $265 but it's actually not $265 because once you order it they make you pay an additional $40 for them to ship the gun back to you when they finish doing the work and on top of that you have to pay another $30-40 to ship the gun to them so it actually ends up being more around $335-345 when it's all said and done. If you don't believe me call them up and talk to them I promise you it will be about the same price I mentioned. Also, if you do end up trying to get a hold of them you will notice that they have no website and that it can take forever to reach them over the phone not to mention how long it takes to get your finished gun back once you send it to them. By buying this kit this way you can avoid all the pain and get the kit faster and just drop it in your gun. 

So if you want to spare yourself all that time and frustration and get the same exact trigger they will sell you, FOR LESS! Then buy this trigger it is mirror polished and virtually un-used! If you have any questions at all about the trigger and are interested send me a message and I can send you detailed pictures as well as answer any and all questions you may have. My price does not include shipping cost. Will negotiate price within reason just send me a message."

We can think of a million reasons to add this highly regarded pistol to your belt, but for time's sake we'll just highlight our favorites. Like remarkable versatility. Non-stop performance. And your choice of models including: 9mm (12+1), .40 caliber (10+1), or .45 ACP (10+1 or 6+1 in a slimmer grip, single stack magazine sub-compact .45 at under 21 ounces). The Millennium PRO"" also features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.
	Heinie Sights
Features the famous and genuine Richard Heinie ""Straight Eight"" Sight, using the rapid and accurate dot over the dot system
	New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.
