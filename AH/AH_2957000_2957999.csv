I may be interested in trades but really looking for cash.  So if it is not what I am looking for or something that I can quickly sell for $825.00 the answer is probably no thanks. I can add a small amount of cash and Brass 9mm for the right trade depending on what is offered is what I can add.

You can still find the premier, just not with the scroll engraving on the receiver and it is my understanding that they changed the gas system that makes it a semi auto. 

I am asking $700 for the gun or will consider partial trades plus cash for handguns (no glock, have plenty) or may trade straight for a 1911 .45 or 9mm. I mean hell, I am pretty open to most trades, worst I can do is say no.

This is an early gun, built in 1957, on the old 4-screw frame. It has a 6 ½ “ barrel. Overall condition is excellent however there is some finish loss on the outer bottom of the trigger guard and at the end of the bore. The grips were cut down (rounded a bit) for comfort and then finished with True Oil. Bore and mechanics are excellent. This gun was bought new by my father and given to me some 35 years ago. It has not been fired in over 25 years. This wonderful revolver comes in the original wood box. The box it came in was for a 8 3/8” barrel, but that is what it was sold in. The box is in pretty good condition (a few scratches) and one of the hinges is broken, but still the original ones. It also comes with the knurled screw driver (not shown), cleaning rod w/ brushes, and original pamphlets (ammo, holsters, warranty) that came with the gun."

All scopes have been previously installed on rifles but all are in near new condition with all seals, lens, and crosshairs in perfect condition. You'll have to search hard to even find a smudge on them. Prices are FIRM because they are already generous and I'm not in a need to sell situation. I would consider trading all for gun(s) in equal trading value of $900-1000

Make: Ruger
Model: LCP (Tiffany)
Location: Mokena, IL
Price: $400
Other Information: I have a NIB Ruger LCP .380! Comes with everything it did from Ruger. I Cerakoted this Tiffany Blue and polished the flats on it. Actually it was bouht for my wife and she said ""I would like a Kimber Solo"". So, now, I am sitting here with a Tiffany LCP which she asked for. Anyway, I would have Charged $200 or so bucks for this job. Need to move it asap as I have a large bill to pay off. That doesn't mean you should offer me some stupid price (I will say no, so save your time). It is impossible to take pictures of this pistol. Lighting makes the Tiffany blue look off (its perfect). It also makes the slide look off... the slide is perfect as well. Literally like a mirror.. All the roll marks are still perfect and color filled with Cerakote just as the cocking serrations are.

Those of you that don't know here it is.  [url]https://www.windhamweaponry.com/content_meet_our_team.asp[/url]

So down to the basics before the pictures which is what really matter.  It's a flat top which I believe they would call the SRC model with the heavy barrel which came ready for optics with a rail height gas block.  I currently have some flip up sight's on it while it sits in my safe.  I don't have an actual round count but with the price of .223 or 5.56 I didn't shoot it much.  I will say for sure that it's under 500 rounds but it's probably closer to between 200-300.  I still have the factory sling and magazine which are brand new in the ziplock that also has the manual and such with it but I don't have the cheap rifle case that came with it.

Located in Auburn, Wa. Washington drivers license and CPL required.  Bill of sale will be filled out for my records.

$800 Feel free to send your offers but no need to waste your time crazy numbers.  Depending on how I like your offer or how I'm feeling that day I might see what else I might have laying around for it to throw into the deal.  Not looking for trades.

Included are factory box and 2 factory gen 4 mags. Mags have sharpie writing on them, but that will wear off with handling/use.

Pistol is in great working order. This is my secondary 17. Round count is less than 1k.
Reason, I'm selling is the gen 4 magazine release doesn't work with me being a southpaw with the way i activate the release. Gen 3's work perfect for me.

Match barrel and very smooth trigger. Bought this February and it has a less than 50 rounds through it.  

This semi-automatic pocket pistol features a 2.5 inch Lothar Walther match barrel with polygonal rifling, bar dot sights, and a Double Action Only trigger mechanism with Kahr's Safe Cam Action striker blocking passive safety. 
The pistol comes with two factory magazines: one 6 round magazine and one extended 7 round magazine with grip sleeve. Additional magazines available for separate purchase. 
The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. 
Lastly, this P380 comes with the Crimson Trace® Laserguard installed. The Laserguard design is the most compact, instinctively activated, user-adjustable laser sighting system on the market today. 

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP (9mm Browning Short) cartridge, has a 2.53 inch barrel and an overall length of 4.9 inches, with a height of only 3.9 inches. It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. 
The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. 
The P380 features a locked breech, modified Browning type recoil lug and Kahr's ""safe cam"" action. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide. 

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The 3/4 inch wide slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. 
The P380 comes with two high quality 400 series stainless steel magazines. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings. 

The P380 proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Other Information: I bought this pistol from Will Enos just over a year ago. I do not compete and I am just not using the pistol to the extent and arena it was meant for. I have shot a total of maybe 200 rounds through it since I got it. I thought I would get into competition shooting last summer and it never happened.

With that said, This was his wife's Limited pistol that was used for about 8 matches in 2012. She said it ran beautifully and was not kidding! For the range time I have on it, its just awesome! It comes as it did from Will... and includes (5) 23rd magazines. Matt finish on the receiver has not been super durable and does show a little wear. The slide is high polished blued and for a pistol that has been used it is very good. There is more wear on the trigger guard from a DAA Racemaster holster than anyplace but, its not anything to be overly concerned about. There is also a small ding on the top front of the slide from contacting a sharp edge on a plate (I actually forgot it was there until I looked at it today. Comes in the original box with the pieces it came with. No trades.."

This is technically a mutt AR-15 however it came from the factory this way. Purchased it From PSA.
Upper is a 16in chrome lined M4 style barrel. PSA BCG. Flat top.
Lower is an ATI Omni-Hybrid gen 2.
The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.
Includes 0ne standard metal 30rd mag and a Walther red dot sight.
Again this is a great gun I just have no need for more than one AR-15.

INFORMATION (SPECS):
(USED) Leupold Mark 6 1-6x20mm M6C1 with LaRue QD Mount

The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios. Built around a rugged, ultra-bright daylight visible illumination system, the Mark 6 1-6x20mm offers a true ""both eyes open"" situational awareness at 1x, while also offering the ability to identify and engage targets out to several hundred meters at high magnification. The Mark 6 1-8 elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic.

The Mark 6 1-6 comes complete with LaRue QD mount (see the pull-down menu to the right), spare mounting screws with wrench, QD adjustment wrench, vial of blue Locktite and Instructions

There are plenty of AK variants but this is hands down one of the top 5 ever produced . Every inch of this rifle was designed with quality and reliability in mind, from the milled receiver to the chrome lined barrel. This SLR-95 is the real deal, an Arsenal of Bulgaria Import, not the current offerings on the market labeled Arsenal that are from the FIME group. It is like new, has maybe 200rds down range and is chambered in the popular 7.62x39 round. The rifle has a few expensive and practical upgrades that makes it a little more up to par with modern times and one hell of a shooter:

Ultimak M1B railed gas tube --- Primary Arms MD-07 micro dot that co-witnesses with sights --- CAA aluminum 6 position tube with watertight storage compartment and ambi sling loops --- Mako GL-shock recoil reducing 6 position telescoping stock (makes the recoil shooting this rifle feel like a 22LR) --- Hogue overmolded pistol grip --- Magpul RVG vertical foregrip securely installed on lower handguard --- Tapco G2 double hook trigger with light polish job on hammer for a crisp non gritty break

This rifle will come with (4) assorted steel mags, and a soft carrying case. It fully meets 922r compliance with (5) US parts - Handguard/pistol grip/3 Fire control group parts. This AK will outlast you and the next generation you pass it down to, you will never have to question if it will go bang, and very accurately at that, when the trigger is pulled. $1325 for all, text or call John at:  REDACTED
