This gun shoots amazingly well for being almost 100 years old - nothing less than expected from an original Colt! The serial number on the frame traces to 1918, and the slide with the rear rampant Colt is from 1914 to late 1917. The AA mark on the slide means that it went through an arsenal rebuild at Augusta Arsenal sometime after the war, as did many USGI WWI and WWII firearms. Once there, they parkerized it and swapped out any faulty or damaged parts and put it back into service. Post-war arsenals rebuilds focused more on functional parts and not keeping its original parts for collectibles, a lot of parts were mismatched. I do not know enough about the parts on it, but I do know the grips and the slide stop were replaced with later versions. The mainspring housing is still original to the gun. The gun likely received the Coltwood grips at Augusta as well. It is what would many would consider a collectible shooter. 

I fired around 30 rounds through it after I received it and it shoots great and is very accurate. The only ""damage"" to it is a little off-coloring on the left side, near the muzzle. In my opinion, it does not appear to be rust or pitting, but is likely discoloration of the metal. All in all, it is barely noticeable. Has all correct military markings and nice rifling in the barrel. Both slide and frame lock up great. Pistol includes 2 unmarked 7-round magazines and blue Colt box.

I replaced the springs in it because I did not know when the last time it received and upgrade on the mechanical/operational parts. Like I said, it shoots great and I hate to get rid of it because I love the gun and its history, but want to try something different.

The optic is a Davis Spot-Shot 15x (R.A.

I have been told the stock is a Fajen, but do not personally know this to be correct.

She is a truly massive gun with as solid aluminum adjustable buttplate and solid brass buttplate ""horn"" (and so long indeed that I had to drill a hole in my largest rifle case to accommodate said ""horn"" (case is optional with sale... $50 extra... very nice case)).

She is an absolute joy to shoot with very very mild recoil.

Three notes:

- She has an EXTREMELY light match/target trigger.

- The three position safety/bolt needs to be polished/honed to return functionality (common problem I am told and will leave this to the buyer who undoubtedly will be a Mauser lover).

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only, shipping additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

I have for sale this Kentucky rifle from the Revolutionary War era. The lock is marked ""Squire and Co."" (from my research, I have found that Squire and Co. refurbished and built rifles/muskets during and after the American revolutionary War. This rifle was likely converted from flintlock to percussion. The rifle is in very good condition for its age. The overall length of the rifle is about 52 inches. The barrel length is about 35 1/2 inches and the caliber is about .50. The patch box works flawlessly. It is hard to see if there was any rifling in the barrel. Overall the metal on the rifle is in good condition.

Breakdown of stuff for sale:

Taurus 669 6"" Blued Revolver: Awesome DA/SA revolver made by Taurus in 1992. Bull barrel. Made in Brazil. MUCH better quality than Tauruses made today. Shoots VERY tight groups with handloads. Some holster wear, but no damage otherwise. Lockup is tight and fires every time. Built like a Smith for half the price. Comes with holster.

Dillon Square Deal B reloader. First re-loader I bought, this was a great machine to learn on. Comes with a full die set for 38 and 357. Can load other calibers with another die set. Comes with all the parts and a manual as well as some load data for 357. Dillon products are top notch and made of steel, not plastic. 

With that I have about a half a pound of Accurate, 1000 small magnum pistol primers, 1000 or so bullets (most 158gr RNFP, but around 200 158gr hollow points as well) and around 200 cases (mixed 38 and 357, mostly 38)

I'd prefer to sell as a whole, but will entertain offers to split up the gun and the press. I WILL NOT sell powders, primers, and bullets separately. I'm looking for the best offer, please no lowballing. Worst I can say is no. I'll post pictures later this evening.

The ONLY trade I would be looking for is a single cylinder dual sport bike or possibly a twin dual sport/cruiser from mid 70s-late 80s. Possibly something else along those lines. Let me know what you have.

Most of the ammo in the picture is CCI as you can see, which is considered the best .22LR out there, including the CCI Stinger which is the juiced rounds that could potentially be used for defense at the users discretion.  There is a 500 bulk pack of federal, a few small packs of Remington Golden Bulllet and some Remington Thunderbolts.

The rifle is like new I don't even have 500 rounds through it, I am simply wanting to upgrade to the .223 version.  It also comes with an extra clip, that is SW factory brand, not an off brand.  The only thing that it WILL NOT come with is the optic/scope, as that will go on my next rifle.

Serious inquiries only, scammers I will not reply too.  If you contact me you are stating that you are lawfully able to purchase this weapon system.  I am willing to show you how to use it if need be.  Also, if I feel you are not fit or able to purchase this according to the law, I will not sell to you.

If you find a better deal than this, buy it now.

Thanks for looking!"

Excellent condition. This was purchased as a complete rifle. Lower is marked .204 Ruger. Has forward assist, shell deflector, and dust cover.

This is a 10+ pound varmint gun. With the .204 caliber (Google it) the recoil is laughable. You can watch the bullet impacts through a high power scope. Perfect for predator or varmint hunting. Stupid accurate rifle and the trigger is a HUGE improvement over standard military triggers.
