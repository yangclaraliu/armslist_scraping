4,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2280004,For Sale:  1984 VT700c Honda Shadow,"wenatchee, Washington, United States","$ 1,500","Listed On: Sunday, December 22, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"WTT/WTS my 1984 1984 VT700c Honda Shadow
27849 miles.
Tires are almost new, still have the strip/nubs on the front, nubs on the back.
new plugs/wires.
Couple little chips in the paint, not very noticeable, touchup pen would do the job perfectly.
bike was laid down at about 15 mph...(underestimated the new tires on a dirty road...) bike is fine, just scuffed the highway bar/engine guard a little. windscreen has scuffs on the same side, but which were already on the bike when i got it. make your own assumptions.
seat is tearing, but is still very comfortable, especially compared to my sport touring bike. 
tachometer doesnt work, but according to the internet cowboys, you just have to pull it and resolder a couple connections.
looks damn good when cleaned up.

will consider trades for a smaller ""womens"" bike, older bikes are fine, but have to be in good shape, may need cash on top, depends on the bike.
street preferred, possible trade for dirt.
no yamaha xt 225s. i hate them. they are evil, rickety death traps.

comes with new stator and regulator, i will install them if wanted, or if youd rather pay a professional or do it yourself so be it. not  very challenging. the entire bike manual is online.
front forks are air charged, so if they ever need to be rebuilt(they currently dont) it's an easy DIY job
air/liquid cooled. engine has fins like most older bikes, but a fan and radiator as well.
auto-adjusting valves, noisy for a minute, but once you start riding(or let it sit, either way) they quiet down to a purr.
runs like champ, great bike for a young rider looking to move up to something bigger, or for an adult looking for a comfy daily rider.

i think i have a new oil filter for it somewhere...
comes with saddle bags in picture.

It functions flawlessly.  I've had it for almost a year, and it's never had a failure to feed, failure to eject, or any other problem.  It's functionally perfect.  The finish does have some wear; it has been carried.  I've trusted my life to this pistol.

It will come with two sets of grips (unless you don't want the maple); I have the original rubber Para Ordnance grips.  You'll also get two magazines, a Para Ordinance case (which really isn't anything to write home about, but it beats stuffing it in a sock), and if you'd like, I'll toss in your choice of several handmade leather holsters, for either concealed carry or open carry.

This is the very hard to find M6 Scout Rifle in .22 Hornet (not LR) over .410 shotgun. The parkerized finish is very good.

This one is very desirable in that it has no trigger guard which makes a HUGE difference when folding the gun in half. Most of them have a trigger guard installed which greatly impairs folding it and how compact you can make it. 
Another unique feature compared to other M6 is the .410 barrel has a much more open choke.  This means you can safely and effectively fire slugs, unlike in a full choked version.
The safety is crossbolt, unlike the newer type where the safety is part of the barrel selector.  This means you can just keep the hammer back on whichever barrel you prefer, and not have to awkwardly fumble with the safety and make sure you get the hammer set to the right barrel when the need arises.
Also has rear swivel stud installed. Holds 4 rounds of .410 and 12 rounds of .22 Hornet in the the buttstock. Not sure what the date of manufacture is but this was made in Geneseo, IL as opposed to Czech Republic like the later ones.

Comes with original cardboard box, no manual. 
Including 2 boxes of .22 Hornet:
10+ rounds Hornady V-Max 35 gr
20 rounds S&B soft point 45 gr

Asking $680 OBO. Will not ship. No trades.
Only selling because I acquired a different version of this gun and need to pay for it.  If you offer me $200 below asking price don't be surprised when you don't get a reply.  I know what these are worth and don't care what they cost 10-20 years ago.  Please don't just email me saying ""call me”.  I communicate via email only, until I know a buyer is serious."

I have had no problem trusting my life to this firearm. She is great for concealed carry, very easy to shoot and even easier to clean. The gun and all mags are in perfect working order, I am only selling so that I can save up for the purchase of a high-end 1911.
I do not have the original factory case, but (as seen in the pics) I am including a very nice brand new nylon soft-case which can hold up to two pistols, 6 extra magazines, a cleaning kit, and more. It's a great range bag!

From Sig's website:
The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

Got it as a fun novelty gun just on the principle of how bad ass it is. Had my fun with it and moving on to future firearm endeavors. This is not a must go item, there is no rush on my part. I am pretty open-minded in trades.
 The Governor fires .45ACP, .45Long Colt and 410 shotgun shells. It comes with 4 boxes of 410 6shot shells, one box of 410 PDX1 self defense shells, a few .45LC self defense rounds, a customer form fitting leather holster, 6 moon clips, two internal lock keys, and hard case. It is a pretty bad ass gun and very sleek/sexy. 
I am looking to get multi stripped AR-15 lower receivers. You can get them online at Palmetto State Armoury for $100 or less. This firearm is well worth at least $800 not including the ammo and accessories it comes with. I am looking to get 6 AR-15 stripped lower receivers. That is only about a $600 value. You do the math. 
But outside of that I am relatively open-minded but I am on an AR-15 kick currently, so tickle my fancy but do not waste my time. I know my AR-15s/parts/accessories/ect, I have built 11 in the past few months, currently working on one for my wife right now and need these 6 lowers for future builds. 
I can be contacted at REDACTED
 From there I will forward legitiment inquirers to my cell phone."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer"

The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

This gun is in excellent mechanical condition, and always goes *bang*! It does have some carry wear on the edges of the frame & a few light knicks, but is tight, looks good & shoots very well, & eats everything.

14.7” Palmetto State Armory Upper
Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The mid profile barrel is high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated to mil-specs. Barrel is finished off with a sleek SQR 11"" free-float quad rail with built-in sockets for QD sling swivels, low-profile gas block and an permanently attached A2 flash hider to bring the barrel to 16"". 
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 Flat top AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring M4 feed ramp cuts, and T-marks, these upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA. Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.

West Fork Armory WF-15 Lower Receiver 
Marked as ""MULTI"" CALIBER so you can use them for any caliber that works with the AR-15, made of 7075-T6 aluminum.

Uncle Mikes Pro 3 Triple Retention Duty Holsters PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side TRIPLE RETENTION DUTY HOLSTERS WITH PATENTED INTERNAL LOCK The emphasis on weapon retention in duty holsters is greater today than ever before, but this vital need to protect the gun must be balanced with the ability to draw the officer's weapon efficiently. PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side. Yet, with a swift, simple motion, the officer can release the thumb break and draw the gun cleanly without the need to release any complicated system of snaps and straps. 

AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE PRO-3 Three types of independent retention 
 1.Patented internal locking device 
 2.Retention strap/thumb break 
 3.Adjustable tensioning device 
 4.Patented laminated construction - either MIRAGE® or Cordura® nylon exterior, foam core and smooth nylon lining 
 5.Positive triggerguard stop positions gun the same way every time 
 6.Holster suspended within patented thermoplastic exo-skeleton for support, strength and rigidity

For the right trade I also have the original black synthetic stock, 10rd Springfield brand mag, about 8 Checkmate industries 20rd mags, 2 Checkmate Industries 25rd mags, replacement mag springs, some magpuls and 4 original Vietnam era GI 20rd Mags (various makers). This rifle has about 200 rounds through it and has been more or a safe queen than I would have liked. It did shoot sub MOA at 100 Meters with a Leupold  Mk4 LR/T 3.5-10x40  M5-FF using both Black Hills 175gr SMK HPBT and Lake City Match 175gr BTHP XM118LR. Shot right around MOA at 100 Meters using 175gr Privi Partizan Match HPBT no problem, yet never had a chance to test the 200-600 meter waters. I have a Super Match so this Socom II was mainly intended for tight spaces and under 100M usage, but it sat in safe most of its life.  I need an AR type 308 so looking to trade for a LWRC R.E.P.R. 308, HK MR 7.62 or a POF 308 preferring an 20"" on the POF and either 20"" or 16"" on the LWRC R.E.P.R or a scar 308 but length of barrel is not a deal breaker ( I might come up with a real good excuse to purchase the 20"" upper if traded for a 16"" barrel, lol )   Email or  call / text me at 4O4-3I4-SeVen4O7 I can provide additional pics but it will only let me load one due to the size of the pic. Trade value of 3200.00 or Sale for 3000.00 cash FTF In OKC/MWC/Choctaw/Harrah area."
