Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

Here is the Specs if your interested.
http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-Desert-Eagle-1911-G-Model.asp

Purchased DEC. 2013 Only about 100rds down the pipe. 
Only been to the range twice and cleaned both times. 
Never been carried. Has no Holster wear.

This is in my opinion the best 1911 under $1000. I urge you to read some reviews and you will hear nothing but good things about this pistol. 

I added a set of Magpul grips and a Wilson Combat checkered front strap.
The original wooden grips are included, with very nice hard case and two mags.
It is a tack driver ! 

Trying to fund some spring and summer projects.
I am only trying to get back close to what I paid for it. 

$650 obo, no trades please

Take a look at the GSG-522, 22LR, rodent and other small animal smoke wagon.  This puppy is damn near brand new with only about 100 rounds through it.  Never even had chance to put lead downrange at actual critters like prairie dogs at the Vilas Zoo.
What did you say?  Does it have upgrades?  Fuck yeah it has upgrades!  The old plastic fixed stock…..gone!  It has been replaced with a fancy plastic collapsible stock.  Not that run of-the-mill plastic, but plastic made on a completely different day!  Metal rail?  Shit yeah it’s metal….mined right here on good ole Terra Firma!

Sometimes 10 rounds is not enough when you are hunting Bugs Bunny, so you are getting 3…that’s right 3…22 round mags.  Now you can take care Bugs AND Tweety Bird!

Don’t like the Magpul Vertical Foregrip?  You like it angled when you are grabbing your gun?  I’m also, this week only, giving you a Magpul Angled Foregrip.  I know this is all too much to be true.

See that tactical carrying bag in the picture?  Well fuck my life!  That’s yours too!
Ahhh, but I can hear it now.  ‘Well….22LR ammo is hard to find, and expensive’.
Do you think I would just leave you hanging?!  Hell no!  I’m throwing in nearly 1000 rounds of ammo.  I say nearly because I’ve used some already…hey don’t judge…I had some of my own Easter Bunny problems a few years ago.

I’d love to bargain….I’d love to barter…..but this package is an absolute steal at $650!
Get this package and you will be smoking squirrels and hanging their balls from your hitch by Spring!

I am working on another project and just don't get to shoot this one very often.  I may trade it for a good running 4 wheeler, key words being good running or I may be willing to trade for a lower end AR15 but also cash always talks.  I have never shot a round through the second barrel and it does have a little rust spots where the prior owner just had it in a box.

Cash in hand; ready to deal.  Please email me some photos of the pistol and what you are including in the sale.  (It's fine if you only have the pistol and one mag; I'm not really in need of a lot of accessories, but would be willing to take a look at the total package you are offering for the right price.)

Also have a basically new (<25 rounds) Ruger LC9 with Lasermax (with spare factory mag & Pachmayr grip) that I am looking to sell; if you have any interest in a possible trade with a little cash from me to boot, let me know.

Ahhh, but I can hear it now.  ‘Well….22LR ammo is hard to find, and expensive’.
Do you think I would just leave you hanging?!  Hell no!  I’m throwing in nearly 1000 rounds of ammo.  I say nearly because I’ve used some already…hey don’t judge…I had some of my own Easter Bunny problems a few years ago.

2nd Gen Ruger LCP, low round count (100 rounds). Excellent shooter, never had any problems, comes with PJ IWB kydex holster ($50 and 3 month wait) and DeSantis nemesis pocket holster, Also has Hogue grips. Have original box and everything that came with it.

If you shot the 1st gen LCP it was trash compared to the 2nd gen ones. The trigger on this one is very nice and has a clean break. I have not had a FTF or FTE with this gun.

I hand picked this early 1955 HRA 30.06 with original LMR barrel wrapped in a pristine HRA USGI walnut stock set with the correct 1/2 DAS cartouche and non serif circled P from the CMP South Store in 2011 right before the racks dried up. This grade of rifle is no longer available in the CMP stores or by mail order. It's a CMP auction item only and the lowest they close at have been $2300. You are welcome to search the CMPs past post war correct auction listings to see for yourself. Rifle comes with all the correct paper work and green Plano style CMP hard rifle case plus some extras I'm throwing in which will include 80 rounds of Lake City M2 Ball in en-blocs, with ammo can, and a Utica M1 uncut 10"" bayonet with scabbard. This gun was only test fired in 1955 and not by the CMP armorers or myself. This is the best Garand you will see on Armslist by a long shot! I'm a current memeber of the Garand Collectors Association and a CMP customer. I have fulfilled the requirements to purchase firearms and ammo from the CMP. I will give a discount and preference to local buyers who have fulfilled the same requirements. I will not play the serial number game. If you have a specific 5mil. HRA serial number you are looking for please reply with that info and I will let you know if you've won the Garand lottery.  Serious inquiries only! I will send more photos to your email upon request. This is not a hoax, bluesky, cai, dane, or greek import!!! This rifle appears to be original, unaltered, or messed with since it left HRA. In my opinion HRAs of this vintage and pedigree are much nicer than any International Harvester or Springfield. This rifle will double in value in the next 15 years!

I hand picked this early 1955 HRA 30.06 with original LMR barrel wrapped in a pristine HRA USGI walnut stock set with the correct 1/2 DAS cartouche and non serif circled P from the CMP South Store in 2011 right before the racks dried up. This grade of rifle is no longer available in the CMP stores or by mail order. It's a CMP auction item only and the lowest they close at have been $2300. You are welcome to search the CMPs past post war correct auction listings to see for yourself. Rifle comes with all the correct paper work and green Plano style CMP hard rifle case plus I'm throwing in a Utica M1 uncut 10"" bayonet with scabbard. This gun was only test fired in 1955 and not by the CMP armorers or myself. This is the best Garand you will see on Armslist by a long shot! I'm a current memeber of the Garand Collectors Association and a CMP customer. I have fulfilled the requirements to purchase firearms and ammo from the CMP. I will give a discount and preference to local buyers who have fulfilled the same requirements. I will not play the serial number game. If you have a specific 5mil. HRA serial number you are looking for please reply with that info and I will let you know if you've won the Garand lottery.  Serious inquiries only! I will send more photos to your email upon request. This is not a hoax, bluesky, cai, dane, or greek import!!! This rifle appears to be original, unaltered, or messed with since it left HRA. In my opinion HRAs of this vintage and pedigree are much nicer than any International Harvester or Springfield. This rifle will double in value in the next 15 years! If its here it's still available."

It was taken off a German Officer midway through the war and has Imperial German markings and all matching serial numbers. It has not been refurbed or reblued. It also comes with an old holster that was repurposed around that time for the gun, not an original one. It is not in perfect condition because it was carried and used throughout the war. I have personally fired, stripped, and cleaned it, and know it works well.

My grandfather gave me a bunch of WW2 guns and I am in no rush to part with it, I just have too many old guns and would like to keep some of the other ones. I would like to get a decent price for it, trades for other handguns are welcome (I need something modern for concealed carry)

This one is a rare beauty.  I personally have used this gun and it shoots amazing groups at 75 yards. I do not mean to be condescending, but there are some very important facts you need to be aware of when purchasing the Winchester Model 61, pre-war WRF Octagon Barrel. I will be referencing Ned Schwing, Slide Action Rifles Volume 2, Model 61 because simply put, it is the finest reference book ever written for the Model 61. Let me start with the Serial Number. This 4 digit serial number 4xxx puts this rifle as a FIRST YEAR 1932. The first thing you want to verify on the rifle is the number stamped on the bottom of the barrel (you must remove the slide handle and magazine tube). 32 – that is the manufacture date of the barrel (see photo). The barrel is stamped along with the caliber prior to rifling and bluing. In 1934 Winchester removed the Ejector Stop Pinhole. The Magazine Tube Collar is the Reinforcing Collar type until 1934. The Hammer Catch on early 61’s will be checkered NOT GROOVED. The trigger will be smooth, the upper Tang will have 2 Tapped Holes for a tang sight (the first thing a veteran collector checks for on a pre-war 61), the barrel will read “patent pending” and the stock will have a relatively high, sharp comb. This gun HAS THEM ALL and the condition of the bore is nearly new. I have provided all I know about the history of this gun through photographs and documentation. I have not restored or reblued this gun in any way, but I believe many years ago it was. When I purchased it, I gave it a thorough wipe down. It was completely disassembled for authentication and cleaning. At that time it was evident it was not disassembled for many, many years. Please do your own due diligence. Thank you for looking at my rifle.

Overall, the rifle is in very good condition. There are minor cosmetic flaws that you will see in the photos: 3/8"" scratch on right side of receiver near trigger guard; bluing worn from bottom of barrel; a few surface scratches on wood; and in the ""Browning BAR"" logo on the left of the receiver, there is a patch of bluing that appears darker than the rest of the receiver.

701,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2765701,For Sale:  Russian Tokarev T-33 7.62x25 pistol,"Michigan, Michigan, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, March 3, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Externally, the TT-33 is very similar to John Browning's blowback operated FN Model 1903 automatic pistol, and internally it uses Browning's short recoil dropping-barrel system from the M1911. In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning's designs - It employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911, with an external hammer. This assembly is removable from the weapon as a modular unit and includes cartridge guides that provide reliable functioning. The Soviet engineers also added several other features such as locking lugs all around the barrel (not just on top), and made several alterations to make the mechanism easier to produce and maintain, notably a captive recoil spring secured to the guide rod which does not depend on the barrel bushing to hold it under tension. Production even machined the magazine feed lips into the receiver to prevent damage and misfeeds when a distorted magazine was loaded into the magazine well.
The TT-33 is chambered for the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge, which was itself based on the similar 7.63x25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol. Able to withstand tremendous abuse, large numbers of the TT-33 were produced during World War II and well into the 1950s.
The TT-33 omitted a safety catch other than the half cock notch which rendered the slide inoperable until the hammer was drawn back to full cock or pulled back to full cock and then lowered manually, which made it unsafe to carry when loaded. It also had a tendency for the magazine catch to accidentally release the magazine while drawing or firing the weapon, if the magazine was damaged in any way."

This is a military luger that was likely brought back during ww1 or ww2.

All matching that I can see, no import marks. This is NOT a russian capture. Has a harder to find wooden bottom magazine that is not SN'd but correct for this luger so its likely the original.

Bore is very good.

The bad? This luger needs to be refinished badly, the current finish is not original. It also needs its springs replaced.
I just do not have the time or knowhow to do it, but everythings there and its all matching. $30 for news springs and $15 for an original rust blue, you will have yourself an all matching ww1 luger.

So let me do a summary
All matching, non import, very good bore, NEEDS new springs and to be refinished. The finish that is currently on it is crap.

I am asking $720 or best offer for the luger. I just need to make room in safe and dont have time for this, I will literally take any fair offer. Im asking $720 because some people like to lowball or feel they are getting some huge deal so I gotta start a little high..
