My loss is your gain though. Love to see this beautiful tack-driver go to an avid hunter who will be able to enjoy it for years to come! Rifle is a Browning X-Bolt Hunter bolt-action rifle in .308 with beautiful satin checkered walnut stock, low-luster, blued finish on the barrel and receiver reduces glare, Inflex Technology recoil pad, Gold Feather Trigger provides clean, crisp pull with no take-up and a minimal overtravel (a screw adjusts trigger from 3 to 5 lbs.). Free-floated, target-crowned barrel and a glass bedded, matte finished steel receiver that's drilled and tapped with a 4 screw per base design to ensure a secure and stable placement of scope. 3 locking lugs provide exceptional strength and a short 60° bolt lift that cycles smooth and fast. A detachable rotary 4-rd magazine feeds cartridges directly in-line with the bolt instead of feeding offset as with conventional magazines. Top-tang safety with bolt unlock button that allows you to open the bolt for loading or inspection with the tang safety in the safe position. Scope is Leupold VX-R 4-12x50mm scope with FireDot LRV Multi-Duplex Illuminated reticle. 1-button activation provides 8 intensity settings, including a low/high indicator. Battery saving Motion Sensor Technology automatically deactivates illumination after 5 minutes of inactivity, yet reactivates instantly as soon as any movement is detected so no fumbling with on/off switch or constantly changing battery because it was accidentally left on. Index Matched Lens System combines with edge-blackened lead free lenses and 30mm tube for astonishing clarity and light transmission for use in all lighting conditions. Extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures optimal diopter adjustment in the field. Second generation waterproofing resists the effects of thermal shock much more efficiently than standard nitrogen.

Current models are now offered in right and left hand versions in both long and short action cartridges!7mm Rem Mag Long action 24in barrel 9.5 twist rate 45in Oal About the 7mm Remington Magnum rifle cartridge was introduced as a commercially available round in 1962,[2] along with the new Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle. It is a member of the belted magnum family that is directly derived from the venerable .375 H&H Magnum.[3][full citation needed] The original purpose of the belted magnum concept taken from the .300 H&H and .375 H&H, was to provide precise headspace control, since the sloping shoulders, while easing cartridge extraction, were unsuitable for this purpose. Improved cartridge extraction reliability is desirable while hunting dangerous game, which would be of concern when needing a fast follow up shot. The 7mm Rem is based on the commercial Winchester .264 Win Mag, .338 Win Mag, and .458 Win Mag, which were based on the same belted .300 H&H and .375 H&H cases, trimmed to nearly the same length as the .270 Weatherby Magnum.[3] On its introduction, the 7mm Rem. Mag. substantially usurped the market share held by the .264 Winchester Magnum, which went into sharp decline in popularity and sales after 1962.[4] Maximum pressure is set bySAAMI at 61,000 PSI.[2] 52,000 CUP [5][full citation needed] Remington has recently[when?] offered Managed Recoil ammunition for achieving reduced recoil when shooting and for generating less meat damage when hunting smaller game."

The V2 is set in the *New* Montana synthetic stock made out of the finest Carbon Fiber material with Kevlar Reinforcing in the aluminum pillars, swivel stud attachments and all strength areas finished with glass beddingThe .375 H&H often is cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially in shooting large and dangerous game. With relatively light bullets in the region of 235 to 270 grains (15 to 17 g), it is a flat-shooting, fairly long-range cartridge ideal for use on light to medium game, whereas with heavy bullets of 300 grains (19 g) and greater, it has the punch necessary for large, thick-skinned dangerous game. In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals, the .375 H&H is seen as the minimum acceptable caliber in many places (in Africa, primarily) it is now the legal minimum for hunting such game. African game guides, professional hunters, and cullers of dangerous game have repeatedly voted the .375 H&H as their clear preference for an all-round caliber if they could only have one rifle. A similar preference has been expressed by Alaskan game guides for brown bear and polar bear country.

The MP5 is the ultimate close-quarters weapon. Created for use in very confined spaces, it is optimally suited both for active engagement of individual targets, and for personal defense. Up for sale from my HK collection is a MP5 built by Turner Fabrications out of Mesa, AZ. Mike Turner has an outstanding reputation for being an excellent HK smith, right up there with TPM Outfitters, Investment Grade Firearms (IGF), and Parabellum Combat Systems (Ghilliebear). Don't be fooled by the cheaper, poorly built weapons like Vector, Bobcat, Coharie, Special Weapons (SW), Atlantic Arms (AA), Pakistani Ordnance Factory (POF), or MKE. This is as close as you can get in quality and accuracy to a genuine German HK mp5 without paying $6-7k for a factory HK weapon. The welds on this pistol are cleaner than some of my factory HK roller locking weapons (HK 91, 93, etc.). This comes with a full auto bolt carrier and was fully tested by Turner Fab to run flawlessly in semi and full auto, so it would make a perfect host for your registered auto sear or trigger pack (NFA rules apply). Comes with the following upgrades: clipped and pinned SEF trigger group (extra $100); shell deflector ($125); and hammer forged 3-lug barrel ($50) to easily accept a suppressor (silencer). This has been a safe queen since I bought it and has spent its entire life in a climate controlled environment. It has a very, very low round count (less than 100 rds) and will last a lifetime. No optics have ever been mounted so there are no claw marks from rails or scope mounts on the top of the receiver like some other MP5's out there. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one 30rd curved mag. Private sale if local in North Idaho, with no FFL fees or BS to deal with, or I can accept a certified check or USPS money order and shipping will be $35 to your FFL from a private individual, or an additional $25 if my FFL must ship it. Please be sure it is legal to own in your state/area."

In total, I have spent $800.00 putting together this collection, so $550.00 for the collection after minimal use is a STEAL. Serious inquiries only please."

Used for years! Local pickup in Hoover. Willing to ship. See our website yellowhammerarms.com/gun-cleaning-supplies/ballistolLocal/Armslist price:1.5oz.....$46oz.....$7 FIREARM CLEANING OIL & LUBRICANT Keep your firearms protected! Ballistol cleans and removes all types of bore fouling. Cleaning with Ballistol will save you time, minimize the need for brushing, and also form a protective film on your firearm. Due to its slight alkalinity, Ballistol neutralizes and dissolves black powder and corrosive ammo residue. In addition, Ballistol will beautify gun stocks, and prevent them from drying out. As a lubricant, Ballistol will never gum up or harden. With Ballistol, your entire firearm will stay lubricated and protected. Ballistol is an excellent smokeless powder cleaning solvent. It will “melt” carbon deposits in the barrel and chamber. Most corrosion inhibiting lubricants can only protect against normal oxidation.

I used this gun in competitions and as my EDC. 4500-5000 rounds put through it. (Estimated life of a barrel before accuracy is an issue with 9mm is near 100,000 rounds if properly maintained). I have since returned it to stock aside from the following: extended firing pin, stainless steel guide rod, talon grips and Dawson precision fiber optic front and blacked out rear. It has the box and factory 2 mags. Also included is the Aliengear Cloak tuck 2.0 IWB holster. Located in the lakes region. Shoot me a message. $425 as is.Trades considered.I can also change out the target sights for XS Big dot sights if you intend to carry this gun. That would be a total of $455 (These sights go for $110-$120). Basically, you'd get them for 30 bucks, and I'll even install them. I can also change the gun back to a decocker if you you prefer that, and are not comfortable doing it yourself.If you do not want the holster, $400 as it or $430 with the big dots."
