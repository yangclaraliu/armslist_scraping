Arguably the most in-demand version of the Cold Steel City Stick ever.  Long-ago out of production, this special version was only offered by Cold Steel for a very limited time. The Micarta-headed City Stick splits the weight (and durability) difference between the older stainless heads and newest aluminum ones . . . . perfectly.  

The polished Micarta head is as durable as it gets, and works to compliment the shaft - making it a sleek and stealthy all-black unit. More tacti-savvy than most, and acceptable anywhere you might choose to be.

Description from LWRC:
The LWRCI™ M6A3™ features a midlength short-stroke gas piston system that is the perfect blend of tactical carbine and sniper-capable rifle. The midlength operating system’s softer recoil allows for faster return-to-target and follow-up shots.
The M6A3™ rifle features an adjustable gas system. Four positions - (O- Off, S-Suppressed, N-Normal, A-Adverse), which allow for optimum performance in any situation.
Designed with optics in mind, the M6A3™ rifle is perfectly suited to accept a red dot sight or a high-powered scope. It features an integrated flip-down front sight and patented ARM-R free-float rail system. The easily removable top platform gives quick access to the barrel and piston system and reinstalls in seconds with no tools required.
The M6A3™ rifle is the perfect all-purpose weapon for the modern warfighter or law enforcement professional.

Previous models include the Standard, Ruger's first model, made from 1949 to 1982, and the MK I Target, made from 1951 to 1982. MK II variations include the Target models, which have heavier barrels and adjustable sights, and the 22/45 models, which have a polymer frame with a grip-angle that matches the Colt 1911 rather than the steel frame's Luger P08-like layout. The MK II was removed from production in 2004, when it was replaced by the MK III. All Ruger rimfire pistols are chambered in .22 Long Rifle only.
History and variations[edit source | editbeta]



Ruger Standard pistol, with aftermarket adjustable sights, made in 1963


Ruger Mark II Stainless Slab side Competition Target Model 22LR pistol with a Volquartsen profiled slab side V-Comp compensator, reflex sight mounted on a Volquartsen Weaver-style rail, 6 7/8 in precision-crowned barrel, and checkered thumbrest target grips.
The original Ruger pistol, now called the Standard, had no model number, as it was the first, and for a time, only gun made by Sturm, Ruger. Prior to Bill Ruger's partnership with Sturm, he had successfully duplicated two Baby Nambu pistols[1] while working in his garage, from a U.S. Marine's captured Nambu, shortly after World War II. Although deciding against marketing the Baby Nambu Pistols, Ruger did incorporate the Nambu style rear cocking device and modified the Nambu's silhouette, plus he added a 4.75 in (12.1 cm) lightweight barrel with fixed sights.
The MK I added a Target model, which had a 5.5 in (14 cm) bull barrel, or a 6.875 in (17.46 cm) heavy taper barrel and adjustable sights. The MK II added a slide stop that held the slide open on the last round, and also was available in stainless steel. The MK II has been available in a number of barrel lengths; 4.75 in (12.1 cm) and 6 in (15 cm) lightweight barrels; 4 in (10 cm), 5.5 in (14 cm), 6.875 in (17.46 cm) and 10 in (25 cm) bull barrels, and 5.25 in (13.3 cm) and 6.875 in (17.46 cm) heavy tapered barrels. All guns with bull or heavy tapered barrels are Target models, and are equipped with target sights consisting of an adjustable rear sight and a taller, wider front sight, with an aggressive undercut to reduce glare.
Some special variants that command higher prices are the Government Model, a model that was used for pistol training and competition by the United States Army[citation needed], and the Red Eagle models, which were made from 1949 to the year of company co-founder Alexander Sturm's death, in 1952. The Red Eagle models had the Ruger logo in red on a silver background. Since then, the Ruger logo on the grip panels has been either black on silver or silver on black, with the exception of a special 50th Anniversary model that had a silver eagle on a red background. The top of the line Government Competition Model comes with a 6.875 in (17.46 cm) ""slab side"" barrel (a bull barrel with the sides milled flat to save weight), laminated wood thumbrest grips, a low profile scope base, and scope rings; with the addition of a pistol scope, it makes an ideal entry level bullseye pistol.

The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

The rifle has less than 100 rounds down the tube. It comes with a DOD surplus stock, the original (and somewhat crummy) fiberglass stock, two magazines, and three handgaurds: one molded black, one molded brown, and the original which is painted black. Also includes the original scope mount. Open to fair trades.

For those interested:

The Norinco M14 is as close to a Springfield M1A you can get without dropping $2K. Let me give you the good and the bad. The M14 features a high-quality forged receiver (some say better than Springfield M1A, since their receivers are cast, not forged), a chrome lined barrel, and many parts can be swapped with USGI parts. The bad is that the bolts are said to be of a softer metal, so after a thousand plus rounds, the headspace could come out of spec, which would be unsafe. There hasn't been any reports of a Norinco M14 failing because of this, but for peace of mind people have often replaced their bolt with a USGI or commercial production bolt (which may require fitting) or hardened it. There have been people who leave it alone and simply check the headspace every so often; but the choice is yours. In short, a bolt replacement is common-place, but not necessarily needed. As for how it shoots: I have only put 100 rounds through it, and it was a tack driver. The bore was cleaned between shots for proper break-in, and the parts/receiver show little wear due to the low round count. In total, despite the 'Chinese' name, it is actually a great rifle at half the cost of an M1A."

Looking for a firearm for home defense and have settled on one of these in 9mm. Live in Renton but work in Woodinville so I'd be willing to go as far north as Everett. 

I do NOT plan on carrying it so I do not have a CPL nor do I want one. I would like a very basic bill of sale that I can write up with just our names, serial #, and signature so I cant be accused of theft.

Willing to spend $750 on a Sig P226 with preference for a 9mm.

Willing to spend $600 on a CZ 75 in 9mm or $650 for stainless.

This AR-Stoner 300 AAC Blackout Barrel is an excellent choice for upgrading the AR platform with a more potent, versatile cartridge while maintaining one of the AR's key advantages: high ammunition capacity. The 300 AAC Blackout (7.62x35mm) squeezes 30 caliber firepower into the traditional AR-15 envelope, and is available in either subsonic or supersonic ammunition varieties to serve a multitude of purposes. All that is needed to harness the enhanced performance of the 300 Blackout is a simple barrel swap; the bolt, carrier, magazine and all other components remain the same as those used in a traditional 223 Rem/5.56 NATO rifle.

This 10.5"" Stainless Steel Pistol Barrel features a Lightweight external contour and 5/8""-24 threaded muzzle for easy installation of your preferred flash hider, muzzle brake and/or sound suppressor. The barrel's Pistol Length Gas Port position makes it is compatible with the majority of supersonic and subsonic ammunition in suppressed or unsuppressed rifles. Some Supersonic Ammunition may exhibit excessive gas port pressure, speeding up wear of internal operating components. Barrel extension and locator pin are both included and factory installed.

It is a true factory double action only with factory spurless hammer (no, that is not a bubba job). It is a matte stainless six shot revolver in 38 special and will also shoot 38+P. It has the frame mounted firing pin, 4"" barrel, and fixed sights. Comes with the hard to find Uncle Mike's finger groove grips. Action is typical S&W tight and smooth. No box or papers. I am told that this was a special contract gun for the Brinks Armored Car Company. This is one of the safest and most reliable guns you can have for home defense. Goes bang every time and no danger of accidental discharge in single action.

If not just know that these are the best 22 AR available as they function and break down just like an AR.  I have a MOE version of the 15-22 and love it.  When the ban was a possibility, I wanted to have another one and bought this one (a standard version) at my local gun store just to have a second one for later.  I then upgraded parts to an Ergo grip ($20), Magpul MBUS sights ($50), and MOE milspec stock ($50).  I have NOT fired one round through this rifle.  I will include one 25rd brand new mag (the one that came with it was a 10rd mag that I modified so I will just keep it).  I still have the original sights and stock.  Now that these are still available I might as well sell it to fund other interests.  Not going to give it away as I know its value (with and without upgrades).

I just started bow hunting (don't need a bow) and would entertain offers that might help me in my deer and turkey hunting.  I also am looking for a 10-12ft aluminum flat bottom john boat.  

Dont bother me with other trade offers outside of trade items mentioned above.  I will be heading to Wichita in the next week or two so could meet up.
