Docter Red Dot Sight 3th Gen 3.5 MOA Red Dot Scope Product Info 
Docter Red Dot Sight 3.5 MOA utilizes two highly polished, optical quality glass lenses (compared to one plastic lens in some competitive models) sandwiched together and solidly set in the frame of the sight. A specially formulated DOCTER multi-coating is applied between the lenses, which protects the coating from scratches and abrasions. Coating on this red dot sight from Docter assures a bright, clear sight picture, greatly reduces distracting, over-the-shoulder glare on the lenses, and eliminates parallax out to 40 yards.

Featuring a compact tubeless design the Docter Red Dot Scope 3 Gen 3.5 MOA is a low weight Docter Sight that does not sacrifice in performance. Because of the small size and weight this reflex sight can be mounted directly on short barrel guns. The outstanding features of the new Docter Optic Red Dot Scope make it the most desirable sight of its type now available. Even though Docter Red Dot Sight is smaller, lighter in weight and more compact than most red dot sights, it is extremely strong and durable, withstanding up to 500 G's of recoil. The frame of this tactical sights is made of stainless steel, brass and anodized aluminum.

The dot of the Docter Red Dot Reflex Sights covers approximately 3.5 inches at 100 yards and is best for handgun hunting and rifle applications.

Brightness of the precise red dot is automatically adjusted in Docter Optic Red Dot Sight 3.5 MOA to ambient light conditions through use of a light sensor which reduces the intensity of the dot in low light, and increases it for better visibility in bright conditions. Docter Red-Dot Scope has a built-in ""Battery Save"" mode which extends average battery life to approximately six years. Power is provided by an easy-to-replace, standard lithium Type CR 2032 3-volt battery.

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
 Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® offers the advantages of a laser sighting system"

For $175, I'll throw in a brand new, unused TOPS Knox Knife (neck knife w/kydex sheath and dog tag chain), a box of ammo, and I might have a sling around that I can throw in as well.

After the Civil War it became a custom to present ornate engraved rifles as gifts to dignitaries, retiring military leaders and visiting heads of state. You may not have anyone in your life who has achieved such a lofty position, but we all know someone special who deserves an equally special gift that reflects the lasting impact he’s made on his friends, family or coworkers. Our Big Boy Deluxe is that gift.

With graceful, elegant scrollwork inspired by the work of famed 19th Century engraver Louis Nimschke, this awe-inspiring work of gunsmithing art is reminiscent of the priceless Henry Rifle presented to President Abraham Lincoln now on display in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. In addition to the stunning engraving on the solid brass receiver, the Big Boy Deluxe is also adorned with an engraved brass barrel band and a select American walnut stock.

The traditional 20″ octagonal barrel is outfitted with classic Marbles fully adjustable Semi-Buckhorn rear sights with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight.

Production of this rifle will be limited to just 1,000 units of each caliber, so don’t miss out on the opportunity to give a gift that is a true limited-edition heirloom quality treasure that is sure to be carried and displayed with pride for generations to come."

I've never fired this 3913 since I've had it and it appears to have been fired very little before I bought it.  Original serial numbered box, no manual. 

The Smith and Wesson 3913 is well known for accuracy and reliability. It is all metal with aluminum alloy frame, stainless slide, and stainless barrel. It has an ambidextrous safety/de-cocker lever, a slide release lever, a magazine release, and a magazine disconnect which disables the trigger when the magazine is removed. It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.  

The 3913 and all 3rd Gen autos are probably the most durable and reliable pistols ever made by S&W...or any other maker for that matter.  They are known to eat any type of ammo without any FTF or FTE.

The Henry U.S. Survival rifle is ultra lightweight, weighing in at a scant 2.5 pounds. The unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8 round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

You have to see it to appreciate it. comes with a leather paddle holster, 2 mags, factory box, tac light and over 100 rnds of ammo, the small back strap is on the gun now. the medium and large did not come with the gun, im waiting on smith and Wesson to send me the other backstraps. There are only a few ways Ill get rid of it. 800 cash or ill trade for a glock 27, m&p 40c (maybe a shield) and cash boot (how much depends on how much ammo you have and condition of the gun) No 9MM I might be interested in a cheap pump action 12 gauge instead of the cash boot.

As a result the trooper is just sitting yet again and it's time for me to let the beast move on. I just cant seem to find time to use it so its time to let it go to someone who can and will appreciate this things ability. I got this a built it so that I could take the wife and kids anywhere in comfort. So the inside is nice, Has all the power options including the mirrors. Has the heavy rubber mats in it to keep the carpet as nice as you can. Has A/c but it will need charged, I haven't charged it or used it in over a year. Runs and drives great pretty much anywhere you want to go. Has approx 3000 miles on it since the axles where built.

the good

3.5 Isuzu v-6
built Tacoma 5spd tranny
Dual Toyota cases Marlin stuff in there. 2.26 stock in front, 4.7 in the rear. Rear is twin stick-ed. total of 4 gear shifters.
Axles are from a 1 ton Chevy/GM
Front axle is the heavy duty 3/4 ton Dana 44.
5.38 gears with a Detroit, Yukon gears, new carrier when built, ""heavy duty"" shafts and joints when built.
Mile Marker lifetime hubs
Rear axle is a 14b ff with 5.38 gears and a Detroit, Yukon gears with a new carrier also
Both axles, gears, parts, steering, etc etc etc were all built by Alex at Carolina Truggies and are bullet proof in my opinion. He also milled the knuckles and put on billet high steer arms with the option holes for future upgrades like Hydro assist or full hydro steer etc. to be easily mounted
Has Hummer H1 double bead-locks (re-centered by Mars Fab) with the Stazworks inserts. I have 5 of these and some extra o-rings.
(4)37 inch Iroqs with approx 80-85% tread, very little rash. Most of the wear is on the shoulders from running low air pressure.
Custom Skid built by Chris at Mars Fab, pretty and very functional (kodak tested lol)
Brand new parking brake, Toyota transfer case style
Just had the front suspension rebuilt and the alignment fixed properly by Mars Fab
Front wheels are bead balanced
Timing belt and tensioners replaced approx 2000 miles ago.
Street legal and licensed no problem passing obd inspection etc
Will include my high-lift as well
Disc brake conversion - disc brakes on all four wheels
Complete set of factory/service manuals



The bad

Has been wheeled repeatedly, has dents dings and scratches ...
Has a cold exhaust leak, goes away when warmed up. Just haven't had time to replace the donut gasket I think is leaking
Has bias Iroq's ... personally I don't think they are any good on the road, but they are the best off the road in my opinion so a trade off of qualities. Drives on the street real nice with radials. So i call it street legal just not street friendly.
No spare tire just the extra wheel (re-centered with a stazworks insert also) for the spare
Could use a new battery soon. The one in it works just fine, holds a charge etc, just starting to show the signs of aging. The new parking brake isn't fully installed yet( just need to install the rotor and cable).


The Deal ...

new lower price $̶8̶0̶0̶0̶ ̶o̶b̶o̶ .... REDUCED to $7000 obo. this is a steal now folks ... you cant buy the parts for twice this ...
All trades considered. NO JUNK OR PROJECTS!!
