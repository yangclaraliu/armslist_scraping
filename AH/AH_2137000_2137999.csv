The barrel is chromed lined and I've consistently averaged 0.75 - 1.0"" MOA.  The entire top rail can be used for mounting optics and sights.  I've only fired 50 rounds through the rifle.  It will come with 2, 20 round Magpul Mags, low profile fold down Mapgul sights, and BSA 4-16X scope with illuminated reticle, and Burris REPR mount.  The rifle also has a quick attach sling and bipod.  I've installed a Primary Weapons System FSC30 muzzle device that works as a compensator and flash suppressor.  Completely changed the way the rifle shoots, allowing faster, more accurate follow up shots.  Excellent piece of equipment!

The Smith & Wesson Model 457 is a compact semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson's metal frame series of handguns. The 457 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The 457 is a traditional double-action pistol, meaning that the first shot is fired in double-action mode and the following shots are fired in single-action mode. The 457 has a 3.75-inch barrel and 7-round magazine capacity. It is available in either black alloy or stainless steel.

The compact design of the pistol makes it ideal for concealed carry. There is no spur on the hammer, thereby reducing the risk of being caught on clothing during unholstering.

I don't have time to go out shooting anymore so I would like to try to get rid of it. 

THE FIRST ONE WITH CASH TAKES IT!

The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer frame pistol that is nearly identical to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in .40 S&W. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.

A hard black case, lock, small cleaning kit, and holster will come with it as seen in the picture.

A grip insert, lock, barrel brush for cleaning, yellow and red fiber optic front sight replacements, user manual, and original test fire brass are also included. All of this comes in the sleek and slick looking XDS hard plastic carrying case. 

If you are looking for a good conceal carry weapon this is a great buy. It can be used affectively as a primary or a backup. This gun works perfect, I am just looking to upgrade to a slightly more expensive weapon and need the extra money. It has only fired 150 rounds and still looks like new.

I will entertain offers below the asking price if they are reasonable. However, I will throw in a box of 45 ACP if you pay the asking price.

Since I am not a licensed dealer and cannot use the FBI instant background check system, the final transfer will need to go through an Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). If you would like to inspect the weapon before purchase we can arrange to do so.

If you are in or near Oklahoma City I know of an FFL that will complete the transfer for $10. This cost is on top of the sale price but can be negotiated. If you are outside of Oklahoma I will not ship to states in which this weapon is illegal. If you have a question as to whether or not you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state just go to the following address and to your state link to see (http://www.atf.gov/publications/firearms/state-laws/31st-edition/index.html). If your state is legal to ship to I will need a copy of an FFL of your choosing to ship to.

Do to the fact I am unlicensed, and this is a handgun, there is only one shipping option. This is UPS Next Day Air. FedEx and USPS will not allow an unlicensed dealer to ship a handgun interstate. UPS states here that they will only ship handguns via Next Day Air and only to a FFL, manufacturer, or law enforcement officer (http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/packaging/guidelines/firearms.html). Therefore shipping price is based on location and will originate from Oklahoma City, OK. The package is 6 pounds and will be shipped in a box approximately 16"" x 14"" x 4"". Please check the shipping price if you are out of state as this will greatly affect the price."

I considered the Magpul MIAD grip as I already had one on my 16s, but I didn't want to hassle modifying it or my new rifles grip tang. The TangoDown's new BG17 grip is claimed to fit without modification, and it does. it's slightly wider than the A2 grip or the earlier TD BattleGrip,and incorporates a grip tang at the top also. The TD grip comes with a stainless steel screw and Allen wrench for mounting on any AR15 type rifle. To mount the grip on a SCAR you will need to use the FN grip screw.

The A2 grip removes easily. 
The TD grip is a very tight fit and until tightened in place has a gap between the the grip and frame. The internal storage compartment has changed also. It now has one large cavity vs. the 2 smaller battery storage cavities of the previous version, and a black storage cover instead of green.
The new grip will accommodate an AR15 bolt as well. 
I really like the BG17 on the SCAR, it fits well and feels good in the hand. It's slightly bigger than the old version and fills the hand better. The down side is that it creates a longer reach to the magazine release, For shooters with average sized hands this shouldn't be a problem.

I'm no chemical engineer, but the polymer TangoDown uses feels much tougher and more durable than the material used by FN in the lower receiver. 
No Trades at this time.

211,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2137211,For Sale/Trade:  Kowa TSN-884 88MM High Performance Spotting Scope with Eyepiece and Tripod,"Fayetteville,  Raeford, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 2,700","Listed On: Friday, September 20, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a top of the line spotting scope for sale. This is a Kowa 88mm High Performance TSN-884 Spotting Scope with Kowa TE-10Z 20-60X Zoom Eyepiece, and Gitzo Carbon 6X Tripod for sale or trade.

The 883 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-883 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-883 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-883 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-883 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range. Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head.

This combination is valued over $3,500. Asking $2,700 or will consider a trade for a Springfield M1a with ammo.

From a review in Accurateshooter.com by Danny Reever: 
One of my tests included a Snellen Eye Chart, just like the one at your optometrist office. Instead of it hanging on a wall, I placed the Snellen Chart at 500 meters along with some previously-shot paper Ground Hog targets. Conditions were hazy and humid with moderate mirage. My Nightforce 12-42x56mm Benchrest riflescope set at 42X could read line 6 on the chart and I could distinguish only a few of the 6mm bullet holes. My Pentax PF100-ED set at 60X (to match the Kowa’s maximum power) was better. With the Pentax I could read line 7 on the chart and see more of the bullet holes. With the Kowa set at 60X, I could read line 8 on the chart and see all of the bullet holes on the white parts of the targets.. FYI, line 8 on the Snellen Chart defines 20-20 vision at 20 feet. Reading that at 500 meters (1641 feet) is pretty impressive!"

It has Sig Nite Sights, new Hogue grips with new stainless grip screws. This gun is in perfect condition operationally and almost perfect cosmetically. It has one spot where it has been scratched near the top of the frame (Beaver tail). I have attached a pic so you can get a good idea of the extent. This gun comes with the original sig plastic lockable case, instruction manual, FOUR high capacity magazines and a ""Holster Store"" IWB leather holster specifically molded for the P229. This gun is super accurate as I have personally shot 1"" groups at 15 yards and a 2.4"" group at 25 (targets included). The action is super slick and the only way to describe it is something like ""Ice on Glass"". It has been detail cleaned from frame to pin and is as reliable as it can get. I have shot close to 1000 rounds and competed in IDPA multiple times with it and there have been zero malfunctions. I am selling this becuase I have two of them (one I carry and one is my wife's) and my wife is just not comfortable with the kick of the .40S&W anymore. She wants a 226 in 9mm... The holster is new and virtually unused and three of the magazines are in pristine like new condition. I am asking $650 for this gun which is a good price considering the holster and three extra magazines are worth almost $180 alone. I am confident that you will be impressed with the action, accuracy and condition of the gun but will still meet at any range so you can test fire it and see for yourself. I do not have to sell this gun so please do not send me a lowball offer thinking I have to move it quick. I will only sell this to someone who has a valid pistol permit or an NC Concealed Handgun permit and a valid NC Drivers License. If you do not have these please do not ask... I will not sell it. If you have any questions please email me and I will try to answer your question. Thanks for looking."

251,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2137251,For Sale:  **NEW In Box Beretta 92FS Stainless Original Wood Grips MADE IN ITALY!!**,"West, Evansville, Indiana","$ 1,400","Listed On: Friday, September 20, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,no type,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'm pretty well copying what I listed on the 1994 Italian made Beretta 92FS with the plastic grips except this one has wood grips.  I do have a 3rd one of these that looks unfired, but it is one I bought from a friend and I'm keeping it as my ""shooter"" (yeah, I've put 5 rounds through it, maybe).  Anyway, the story is the same.  I'll copy it here in case when reading this listing you have not seen my other listing.

I've had this pistol forever in my safe. Back when Bill Clinton was passing anti-gun legislation I bought some new Beretta 92FS pistols, a couple of them in stainless (Inox in Italian). Going through my safe I came across this Beretta that was never used. I tried looking for another NIB Stainless Beretta 92FS made in Italy to see what they are selling for, and I haven't seen a single one in a month or so of looking. So, based on that, I'm going to assume they are reasonably rare. If you've never compared one of the Italian made Stainless 94FS pistols made back then to the US made, you won't believe the difference in build quality. They feel completely different with the Italian model making the US model feel like it was cast in a sand mold and never polished.

Included is the pistol, original warranty and manual, original 'oiled paper' in the original box along with the original 2 stainless 15 round magazines. The date of manufacture for this pistol is mid 1994. I have not racked the slide to try to clean any old oil off of this pistol.

I actually found another of these that I bought at the time that has the beautiful original hardwood grips and I honestly don't think the slide on it has even been racked except when I bought it. I'm not sure I want to sell it. I fell in love with it's beauty all over again.  This is a listing for the beautiful one with original Beretta factory wood grips.

Sale to an individual will require the individual to have a carry permit and proper ID. Any shipping MUST go through FFL dealer at buyer's expense. I'll stay on top of removing the ad if I sell it or change my mind on selling. So, basically, if you're seeing this ad, it's probably still for sale. I seriously doubt that I want to sell both of my unfired Italian made Stainless 1994 production 92FS pistols.  I will remove the listing of the one that did not sell if one sells.  I know it comes across wrong, but I really don't care if I sell either of these.  With the current political atmosphere, it seems highly likely high cap firearms will have some sort of ban placed on them.  This pistol and the other Beretta are examples of some of the highest quality high capacity 9mm pistols ever built in the world.  I'm not afraid of holding on to them if the economics are not right for them to sell right now.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in any trades at this time."

For sale is a lightly used Fender Jazz Bass (MIM) that is in excellent condition and plays very well. It has been meticulously maintained and cared for, but I just don't use it enough anymore, so I would rather it go to a better home. I am selling to fund a new purchase, so I cannot take any trades. It will come with both a black and white pickguard, so you can use whichever fits your taste better. It also will come with a soft case to hold everything in. This is a real Fender guitar--NOT one of the cheaper Squier instruments.

Comes with (3) 8 round mags. I do have ammo available to go with her and a Uncle Mikes IWB holster, and 4 Pearce Grip pinky extensions (for the mags) depending on trade agreement or cash price agreement. Here's the skinny:

Bought in Feb. of this year. I have used it as a back up pistol and my concealed carry for the summer months. Fall is now here and I'm looking at buying a replacement for it come spring anyway. 

I'm looking for a cash or trade offer for the whole package, I'm not wanting to sell it piece by piece. All or nothing is preferred. 

Pistol has had 450 rounds through it, no hiccups to date. Always fed brass .380 ACP ammo. It really likes WWB for whatever reason. 

Pistol has been thoroughly cleaned and inspected after the break in period. All items have passed a visual inspection and functions check. Gun Goes bang every time the trigger is pulled.  

The gun is a PPK clone in some ways. Slide mounted safety decocker. If the hammer is back you can safely engage the safety and drop the hammer without the weapon discharging. 
Also has mag safety. If you remove the magazine the trigger will not fire the weapon.

Very woman friendly weapon. I have taught a few friends how to shoot with it. 

List of contents, like i said I would prefer it sold/traded as a package. 

Pistol, (3) mags, IWB holster, 4 pinky extensions (new never installed), 100 rounds of WWB ammo (target), 16 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense ammo, 17 rounds of Federal Hydra-shok Law enforcement ammo. 

Okay, now for business: Cash price: $300 Trade interests: KAHR CW9,  Ruger SR9c pistol (prefer all black but not picky) OR Bersa Thunder 9 Ultra Compact (13 round mags)

I can offer cash or other items (ammo, SKS stuff, ect.) on my end. Feel free to email me cash offers or trade offers (I may change my mind depending if I like the offer)

Indiana Drivers License and LTCH is required. NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS! No info will be recorded unless you want it to be.  Price is NEGOTIABLE."

The bike needs absolutely nothing right now it is ready to be ridden home today!

I will remove the post when the bike sales so there is no need to ask if it is still available, if the post is up then the bike is still available and yes for sale.

Not sure if this was from factory, but didn't notice until use and scope was mounted.  Ammunition is scarce as Winchester ramps up production, but you have 195 rounds to get you started.  Guys have seen excellent groupings out of these, and this little rimfire cartridge is 300yd capable with accuracy.  I had to put this under 17 HMR as there is no option as yet on Armslist for WSM.

Used. Still have box and all the parts. Like new. 

Only took it to the range twice. Decided i was personally more comfortable just holding the Handguard itself. 

Real deal. Not the PTS / Airsoft stuff. 
The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Made in U.S.A.

Combining outstanding optics with pinpoint laser rangefinding and precision trajectory compensation with the exact ammunition you choose for your hunt, it eliminates most of the variables and guesswork that often cause hunters to go home empty-handed. In one fast sequence the Eliminator determines the distance to your target, factors in your trajectory and illuminates the perfect holdover. It’s that simple.

For greater versatility, the new X38 reticle is designed to work at any magnification setting. Your Eliminator II significantly extends the range and accuracy of virtually any gun and any load. It is the perfect optic for centerfire and rimfire rifles, muzzleloaders and slug guns. No other riflescope combines this level of quality, technology, accuracy, repeatability and effectiveness. It will greatly increase the distance at which you can make an ethical shot.

• 999 Yards
• Accurate at ANY Magnification
• New Ergonomic Activation Buttons
• Enhanced Extreme Range Ballistic Programming
• Sleek, New Design

Simple Operation & Programming
At the press of a button, you enter the Drop Number and Ballistic Coefficient appropriate for your ammunition. This data is available in the Cartridge List (1,500+ Specific Loads) provided by Burris or from just about any ballistics software program.

Range Compensation
To range, place the cross hair on your target and press either button on the objective bell. In less than a second, the range to your target and a lighted dot will appear indicating the correct aiming point for your specific ammunition for the distance to the target.

 



REMOTE ACTIVATION
For maximum efficiency and fingertip control, a remote activation switch is included with Eliminator II. It can be attached to the rifle’s forearm or the scope’s objective bell.



STRONG, LOW MOUNTING
All Eliminators feature a unique mounting system that allows the lowest possible mounting to the rifle.

606,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2137606,For Sale:  '86 VIP OPEN BOW 16' W/ 90 HP O/B,"BA, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 1,400","Listed On: Wednesday, October 9, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Bought this during summer of '12 and took it for a week-long trip to Table Rock where it performed great and sat in a slip the entire week. Trailer has two brand new rims, tires, bearing buddies and new LED submersible lights. Spare added for additional assurance. I added a brand new depth/fish finder, ladder, new single tube, ropes just last summer. It does come with Jr. skis and an older two-person tube that did hold air last time it was aired. It also comes with a few life jackets, fire extinguisher, paddle and safety float to make it lake ready. It has new upholstery work and the battery is still good. It is also registered in Kansas until 2015.


Now for the bad: I couldn't get it started this year so I never had it out. The distributor cap was changed with brand new and some wires replaced new and all check good, but it still won't run (it does turn over); likely the distributor is bad. I've got about $2500 into the boat, but do understand no one wants a partially running boat so I am open to offers or potential trades. I'd get it fixed, but I don't want to park outside this winter!

This firearm is in great condition. I am the second owner. Included with it are 7 pan mags, canvas case for the rifle, canvas case with machine gunner's toolkit and extra parts, a blank fire adapter, and a canvas sack to carry 3 pan mags.

The gun does need some polishing. The mag lips need polished to help feed better. (Easy to do and a common easy to fix issue with these firearms) and the gas regulator could use a little polishing as well. (Another easy to fix ""issue"". ) I have fired about 100 rounds through it personally along with about the same in blanks. 

These guns are not often up for sale. This would turn heads at the firing range and would be great for reenacting.

I am not really looking for out of state sales at the moment due to the high cost in shipping. HOWEVER. If you are out of state and you wish to purchase this and cover shipping + FFL fees (IT MUST BE SHIPPED TO AN FFL IF YOU ARE OUT OF THE STATE OF OHIO. NO EXCEPTIONS. DON'T BOTHER ASKING.) we can work something out to get the gun to your FFL and the accessories to your home. (NOTICE: You may be turned down due to magazine restrictions in your state!)

I have a barely used and in amazing condition Springfield Armory 1911 - Trophy Match with less than 50 rounds down range! This gun is like new and is one of the most accurate guns I have ever shot. The recoil is very manageable on this gun, to the point that even my wife enjoyed it.  However, we are now 9mm people and we no longer have a need for this gun.

About the Handgun:
The Springfield 1911 series of pistols are faithful adaptations of the original 45 Auto Colt-Browning design. The Trophy Match pistol includes various competition features such as a match barrel and bushing, highly-tuned competition trigger, fully adjustable target sights, wide-mouth magazine well and checkered frontstrap and mainspring housing.

I've seen this gun listed at $1545 (out the door price) at my local gun shop. Let me know if you are interested in putting in a respectable offer!
