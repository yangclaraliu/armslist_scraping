I dont even want to sell it but i just received word of a deployment on short notice and need the money to move my daughter and wife back home before i go. I have a hard case, manual, and the integral lock keys. Has a rail to mount lasers/lights etc. and uses a glock rear sight and a sig front sight; gives you options in a more affordable pistol. its a great cwp gun, got it less than a week ago and i regret letting it go, but need the money."

The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

 The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

The GLOCK 23 Gen 4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The GLOCK 23 Gen 4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

A 333 round nitrogen packed can of CCI mini mags from www.readyreserveammo.com 
Ammo In a Can is a patented process that removes the atmosphere from inside the can and replaces it with dry, inert nitrogen gas. Without moisture or oxygen in the can, the ammunition does not deteriorate, corrode, or rust. This gives the ammo an indefinite shelf life, regardless of the environment outside the can. The can is enameled to insulate the rounds from electrolysis. Just use the pop-top lid to open and the plastic overcap will give the remaining rounds reasonable containment and protection from the elements. No box to fall apart and spill ammunition everywhere.The ammunition is easily transported inside the can and fits neatly in a coat or jacket pocket, try doing that with a cardboard box. Sealed tight in the can, your ammunition will store for a lifetime or more, it can be passed down from generation to generation, easily cached if need be, and stored safely in a metal can.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Bigger and badder is the best way to describe the AR-536. Its 5x
magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards,
while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. The
Ballistic/CQ lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly
competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select
red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination
settings make it easy to match any light condition.  Ruggedly built to
withstand up recoil, abuse and weather, key features include multi-coated
lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail
mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted
to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box.

I'm selling this barrel for under than the last pre-crazy price I could find so it should go fast and is an extremely good deal.

It is in mint condition, and has had less than 150 rounds fired through it in three shooting sessions, and it has been immaculately taken care of. 

Accessories this rifle comes with: 

* American Defense Manufacturing (AD-RECON-H) quick-detachable scope mount for a 30mm optic, which allows an operator to switch between a lens and flip up iron sights within seconds, and replace the optic back at a known rail position with minimal zero shift. The value of this mount is $200.00, and it provides sufficient height to use a full sized optic over the sight assembly. 

* Two sling mounts, one for a standard sling, the other (currently installed) for a Magpul MS3 sling. 

* Harris Bipod (Came stock with rifle) 

* Two 19rd Box magazines. 

Additional notes: 

I removed the stock handrest grip, which I found to be insufficiently ergonomical, and replaced it with a MOE grip that by all accounts provides superior handling. 

The flip up iron sights on this rifle are the steel DPMS variants, as opposed to the Magpul MBUS on later models. They're built solid and are quick to get an eye on target. 

This rifle is both highly accurate and a blast to shoot, I just simply don't use it enough compared my other rifles with regulated gas systems to justify keeping it in the safe."

The originals are hard to find as most are replacement stocks. The rifle has all matching serial numbers and is in excellent shape!  It is NOT counter bored which is what you want in a Mosin Nagant for originality sake. This rifle will make a great shooter. Also, this rifle includes an original bayonet. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth.

Introduced in 1908 and discontinued in 1929. This is an amazing piece of history & one any serious shotgun collector needs in their collection. Made in November of 1923. Remington model 10-A, 26"" barrel 12 ga, take down model. all numbers matching. Only 3500 of the 10-A were made. From what i have read, the 10-A models were used in WW2 by the USMC to train aerial gunners. For being 1 month short of it's 90th birthday this ol'timer is in remarkable unrestored/original condition. There is one smaller area of pitting on top of the receiver, but nothing too bad at all. It has 1 minor issue that prevents it from being used. A broken sear spring as seen in the pic below. It's a $10 part readily available online. The sear spring from a standard model 10 will interchange. I thought I wanted a shotgun, but that has changed so i'm really not interested in restoring it, but would rather just sell or trade it out for something i'll enjoy. 

Trades: what do you have? I'm open to just about anything.

I also want to ad this is a HUGE shotgun. In the pics below with me holding it, I'm 6'1"" and 250lbs. I look like a kid holding 'daddys gun' ...lol. I picked this up a while back & have decided it's just not for me so i'm looking to trade out for something I will enjoy using. 

I'm open to anything except black powder weapons. My son and I collect vintage .22 rifles. His birthday is coming up next month and has been hinting at his interest in a single action .22 revolver I'd possibly be interested in something in that flavor. What do you have?

I'm unable to drive any longer so you would have to be willing to come to the Camdenton/Linn Creek area to pick this up."

It's new in tube, and never fired.  They retail for $170, and I'll take $135 firm.  Here are the specs from CMMG:

Our 5.56 BCGs follow the mil-spec pretty closely. Dimension and tolerance wise they are absolutely mil-spec. We have deviated a little bit with regard to material and processes. 

Our carrier keys are Mil-Spec, made from a solid piece of 4130 steel, chrome lined and phosphated. 
Our carriers again are Mil-Spec M16 carriers. Made from 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphated. 
The carriers are assembled using a more modern version of the mil-spec screw(the mil-spec screw uses a 1/8"" hex verses the newer and more common 9/64"" hex). On the note of screws ours and the Mil-Spec screws are the equivalent to Grade 8, SAE grades do not cover screws/bolts smaller than 1/4"". The screws are installed using a torque wrench to ensure they are torqued correctly. The key and screws are then staked using our custom pneumatic staker. 

Now the bolts, they are made with AISI 9310 Steel, 9310 is better suited for an application such as a M16 bolt. 9310 is a steel typically used for gears, cams and things of that nature while Carpenter 158 or P6 tool steel is a plastic injection mold steel. 9310 is easier to machine and is more dimensionally stable in the heat treat process, this equates to better made parts. 
The extractors are Mil-Spec made from a solid piece of 4140. All of our springs made to the Mil-Spec out of 17-7PH Stainless steel not the cheaper music wire some companies use. We use a one-piece 316 Stainless steel helicial ring on all of our bolts. The cam pin and firing pin are standard mil-spec parts."

Looking to sell my FN FS2000 bullpup rifle. Has 500 rounds down the pipe. It is in excellent condition mechanically and cosmetically. All the benefits of a full-length barrel in a package that's smaller than a short-barreled AR, with the benefit of a neat little pile of brass at your feet instead of the brass being tossed a few feet over your shoulder. Little recoil, perfect for optics since it puts your eye at just the right level.  Comes with original box, original magazine (which has only been inserted, but has not actually been used), full FN FS2000 cleaning kit, FN railed forend, and a small vertical foregrip. 

Asking $1900.

 I'm near Roswell, and I'm willing to drive to meet.

Send me an email at REDACTED if you want to make an offer, worst I can say is no."
