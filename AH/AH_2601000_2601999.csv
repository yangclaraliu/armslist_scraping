First, we have the full/semi-auto AK-47. It features a full metal front and bolt cover, all steel gears, a folding stock, adjustable front and rear sights, 2 high cap mags(about 500-600rds per), front grip, and battery and charger. This thing is a beast!! I have a real AK-47 and the weight and feel of this Airsoft version is dead on. It's very accurate even at a good distance. It says 495fps but we chronographed it at 405 with 20gram bbs. 
Next is the Taurus PT 24/7. It's a spring loaded pistol. It has one mag that holds 25 bbs. The gun it's self is rather light, but once you put the mag in it heavies it up and then feels realistic. It says 315fps but we didn't test this one. It's fairly accurate at close range, but it is only spring loaded and not Co2, so it doesn't have the distance. It's a great little side arm to go with the AK though. (p.s. it fits nicely in my plastic Springfield XD belt holster). Also with the pistol, I have an airsoft speed loader. holds something like 100bbs and pumps out 4-5bbs per squeeze. The speed loader also has the attachment piece to plug into the high cap rifle mags. It's a handy little tool.
Then there's the face mask. It's all one piece, goggles aren't removable. They also aren't scratched up, just a tad dirty. The mask wraps around your head to cover the ears. The inside has the nice foam padding for comfort and a good seal. 
And finally, the bag of bbs. they're 20 gram, ultra slick competition grade bbs. Never had a feed issue with these at all. there are probably 4,000 left in the bag.
Now all these things have only been used once. My buddies and I had a Zombie Apocalypse Day in the woods. It was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I am now in a position of needing the money more than the fun. Always a sad realization to have. lol. All in all, it's a great deal and it's so much fun. You will be very happy with everything. So please, call or text me if you are interested. I am looking for $250 for everything. Thanks for looking.

I have carried and shot this gun alot and have never had a single failure in any way or with any type of ammo. It shoots everything you put in it. 
A couple years ago I took it to a gunsmith in Durham and had a new trigger, ultra light hammer, slide release, beaver tail grip safety, night sights, and put on a wrap around hogue finger groove grip. All parts were wilson combat and the slide release is a bullet proof wilson combat model. 
All together this was about a $700 upgrade. It does have some wear and marks, but nothing bad and nothing that effects the safety or operation. Night sights still glow bright on my bedside table. It has three magazines one seven round original, and two eight round (one pro mag one wilson combat). Very accurate and I can hit steel plates from 40 yards all day long. I was going to have it cerakoted for $150 in Raleigh to update the look and hide my idiot marks, but I figure the person buying or trading can take care of that or just leave as is. I trust my life with this pistol and have total faith that you will too. 
I also have a Galco COP Series Black Holster that was used for about two months and a single Galco magazine holster, both leather, both very nice for sale seperately. I also have a nice amount of high end self defense hornady, gold dot, and remington precision ammo I can include for the right offer or trade, at least a couple hundred rounds.

Make your gear the color or pattern you want for far less than the cost of buying a ""wrapped"" weapon. Wrapping or hydro dipping does not have the durability or the protection that DuraCoat offers many times over. 

 Do you have something that sticks out like a sore thumb in the woods? Or something you just want to make the color or colors you prefer? Do you want your item to be one of a kind, protected forever and the color or color combination you want it? I'm your man.

I offer sandblasting, refinishing, and restoration for your hunting and shooting gear. If you have an item that has seen wear and tear, is blemished, or pitted with rust I can make it new again. Maybe it's just old and is needing to be refinished, and you want a quality, professional job done please feel free to contact me. Make sure your gear is protected forever, invisible to wary eyes and impervious to the elements DuraCoat it. 

Cleaning is done in no time with DuraCoat. Simply wipe it with a damp rag and you're done. Or leave it, that's fine too, a little dirt will help you blend in when you head back into the great outdoors. 

I can camouflage anything and specialize in application of DuraCoat which is an extremely durable and excellent two part epoxy finish. If you'd like to see all the available colors you can check it by googling Lauer Weaponry or by going to this webpage http://lauerweaponry.com/   

I can do binoculars, bipods, range finders, magazines, helmets, comm gear, stocks, barrels, scopes and bases / rings and anything else that needs to blend in to complete your camouflage breakup or just needs a new finish.

Patterns include digital, multicam, tiger stripe,  woodland, shadow grass, winter twig, brush, and on and on. In any color combination you like. You tell me what you want, and I'll make it happen. 

Price will vary with time and supplies required to make your gear and items one of a kind. I cut my own painting camouflage patterns on a CNC stencil machine in order to give you the professional look you want. I also have been seen on the farm picking through natural items to use as templates. I can add artwork, initials, quotes, etc to your gear as well. No vinyl, no ""wraps or dips,"" just diamond hard yet flexible DuraCoat. 

My work is top notch and second to none. I can and will provide references if you'd like. I have over a decade of experience in the application of finishing systems and will ensure that what you want is what you get and that it will last a lifetime and be something you love to pick up and look at, take to the field, or show your friends. 

I have been painting for 16 years and have been to many Military Technical Schools involving paint systems, preparation, methods, and application. I have been into shooting sports my whole life and I truly love seeing my work and the looks on people's faces when I return their gear to them fully customized.  

If you're interested or just have any questions feel free to e-mail me at REDACTED or call me at REDACTED. 
Thank you for your time and interest.

Made famous in the movie ""Blade Runner"" and seen in such movies as ""Bad Boys"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"",and most recently ""21 Jump Street"" the COP would be a welcomed piece to any collectors collection, Or just for anyone looking for something rare, beautiful, and different. Easy to fire and easy on the eyes this rare pistol has 4 barrels which fire 357 magnums or .38 specials. The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is about twice as wide, and substantially heavier than the typical .25 automatic pistol, though its relatively compact size and powerful cartridge made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun. The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence. Any questions please feel free to message me. Good luck to all bidders and an early congrats to whoever wins!"

The rebound spring is often lost or bent and is not useable. We have found the cause of the breaking to be ""SHEAR STRESS"". The stress is the result of the design of the bolt. The design of the bolt's can't be changed, so we zeroed in on the material used in the manufacture of the firing pins. We made firing pin's from several kinds of steel, including hardened A2 tool steel. That didn't work. We heat treated pin's to different hardness's. That didn't work! We even went so far as to have a batch of firing pins made of Titanium. Much to our engineer's surprise, that batch broke even faster than the pin's made from steel. Titanium is strong but it doesn't react well to ""Shear Stress"". This is the kind of technology, testing is what you receive when you buy our products.

We aren't just order takers, we know the Tec-22 inside and out. We are Intratec Parts and have been since 1998. Our parts are new and are manufactured in the USA to the original design specifications using 21st Century computer controlled manufacturing technology. Call REDACTED.... MAIL ORDER ONLY.

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it.

The 1907 Dreyse (full company name is RheinischeMetallwearen-& Maschinenfabrik)  7.65 (.32) semi-automatic pistol has an unusual design with a tip-up barrel which makes for easy cleaning.  This gun has matching numbers and a nice old gray sheen.  There are crown proof marks on all major parts.   It has seen its share of duty but is nice and tight and shoots well with a low recoil.  It has a 6 round replaced magazine which feeds easily for the dozen or so shots I've tested.  The integral front sight blade is slightly slanted although there are no signs of abuse.  The Vatican Swiss Guards used this handgun until the 1990s.   See pictures which can be enlarged to show detail. Please contact me if you need additional photos or details.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols.

I am offering this gun at auction at far less than gun book value because I have decided to retire overseas and will have no use for it. In my opinion, the bluing and wood on this gun are easily at 95%. There is a little bluing wear from carrying at the action shoulders and it also has a small amount of typical muzzel wear. The bore is excellent. The straight grained walnut is beautiful without checks, cracks, or even noticeable wear."

the mount 
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.

Glock 22 .40 cal Gen 3

Pristine condition
Night sights
3 hi-cap mags
Not even a scuff on any of the finish. 
Everything that came with the original box.
The gun has the TractionGrips kit added to it.  This isn't just skateboard tape that I cut to fit.

I'm the original owner.  Bought it thinking I needed a Glock.  Well, I don't so it has been a safe queen for years.  I doubt it has even seen 250 rounds as I decided a long time ago there was no reason spending money on ammo for a gun I didn't care much to shoot.

I'm listing this at less than any other G22 on this site, as well as my price being quite reasonable.  I'm not really in the business to negotiate as it can remain in the safe till someone is truly serious about buying instead of nickel and dime'ing me on the price.

Required for this purchase: ID, CWL, and sign a bill of sale.

Thanks!"

This rifle has a serial number of 35xxxx, which means it is one of the rare 1 in 9 twist, instead of the common 1 in 10.63. 

This is a straight pull bolt action rifle, which gives it a faster rate of fire than standard bolt action rifles. Barrel, receiver, and most small parts match the rifle, hell even the magazine and stock do, which is pretty rare for a 102yr old rifle. Unfortunately, the bolt does not. Rifle also has lots of car touches and other marks I haven't deciphered. 

Very strong rifling, shiny bore, very little metal wear, and no cracks in the stock. This has been a safe queen, because the quality of this one has been way higher than any other 89/11, 1911, or k31 I have owned or shot. 

Model 1889 bayonet, serial does not match, but again very little wear on it. Bayonet includes sheath and leather frog. $100 or $75 if purchased with rifle. 

135 rds of Swiss 7.55x55. These are ver clean surplus rounds and non-corrosive. $100 or $75 with purchase of rifle.

It's a full-sized striker-fired pistol in Flat Dark Earth / FDE, chambered in 45 ACP with a thumb safety. There is no magazine disconnect safety. the interchangeable back-straps really make a positive difference with a pistol of this size.  I've put approximately 300 rounds downrange with it with no feed or ejection/extraction issues. It is capable of printing nice groups in the right hands. This pistol has been sitting in my safe, largely unused, and I have another project upon which I've set my sights. The purchaser is getting quite a lot for the money.
Please feel free to email me with any relevant questions. I will answer them as best I can.

I'm willing to take about a $500 hit on this package so please stop messaging me, telling me what an idiot I am, or that I have no clue what I'm doing. It's pretty simple, if you don't want it, don't have anything nice to say, or just don't like it, aren't close to Philomath, then just do the internet and me a favor, walk away and take a break from trolling, flaming, and tire kicking.

This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two factory 25 round mags. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if maintained and treated properly after each use. Thanks for stopping by my listing."
