HK P30 V2 9mm Pistol 229800 A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation-one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. •Caliber: 9mm •Weight: 1.63 lbs. •Safety: Ambidextrous safety lever •Sights: Fixed 3 point •Magazines Included: 2 •Magazine Capacity: 15+1 •Grips: Black polymer, interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates •Slide Finish: nitro-carburized steel •Frame Finish: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer"

The site is for buying,selling, and trading, not wining. As per the one wining about separate dealer listing... There are separate dealer listings. The only ones complaining about the listings by dealers are the one that are trying to rip someone off. Keep in mind that going to a dealer you are still going to pay taxes and fees for any purchase. Of course no one is going to want what you are getting rid of when you are asking more for a used item than they are for a new one. Just ask fair prices and stop complaining or stay off the site. For everyone else, do some research. Check the value of a firearm before making a deal. If everyone stops buying from these cons, they will eventually go back to the street corners and alleys where they belong and stop bothering the people try to make a legitimate deal."

Produced to modern standards these guns are used and sanctioned for Wild Bunch SASS matches but serve well as home defense or a fun shooting choice.  The magazine holds 6 rounds of 2 3/4 shot shells in 12 gauge.  UP FRONT: These shotguns are not legal for SASS Cowboy matches as the scalloped receiver is a ""perceived advantage"" for single loading through the ejection port according one of the Wild Bunch SASS officials.  I vehemently disagree with this on this basis because I tested both extensively and see no speed advantage.  What is funny is SASS Cowboy allows 1873 Winchester/clone rifles with ""short stroke"" kits which ARE a definite advantage for rifle shooters and especially onus when this modification wasn't available in the 1800's.  Go figure.  For Wild Bunch matches many '97's have to be modified with an extended magazine tube to hold the required 6 rounds this one doesn't.  It can also be ""slam-fired"" if that's important. I don't shoot Wild Bunch matches so I am offering this fine gun to you.  Whether you shoot Wild Bunch matches or want a piece of Western history this gun is a great choice.

I know its tough to find this stuff right now so I thought I would make it available instead of hoarding it for no good reason. Here is what I have:

I just did some cleaning around the house and found a bunch of stuff that I need to sell. So check out my other listings. Did I mention that these would make excellent CHRISTmas gifts?

The carbine has been discontinued since 1999.

It was designed as a utility firearm to be used around hunting camps for foraging or defense. It was made in 9mm Parabellum and .45 ACP calibers and can use the same magazines as popular handguns in those calibers, in keeping with a convenient American tradition of having a carbine and handgun using common ammunition. The carbine operates by direct blowback. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The stock was made of walnut-finished Maine birch.

The Camp Carbine uses a detachable magazine that inserts into the magazine well in front of the trigger guard. The Camp 9 rifle magazine can be replaced by magazines from 59-series S&W pistols. The Camp 9 magazine well is sized for 12-round magazines; magazines with higher capacities extend beyond the bottom of the well. A 20-round magazine was produced, but discontinued in 1989. Numerous aftermarket magazines and drums were produced for both models.

This Camp 9 is in excellent condition with just a few handling marks on the wood and receiver. There is a number etched into the front of the Mag Well. It appears to have been fired very little.

It has a new replacement recoil buffer, leather sling and a scope mount.

I am asking $650 for the rifle and the original Marlin 12 round magazine.

The additional 3 20 round magazines and the single 30 rounder will be a total of $100 extra if you want them included. 

Asking price for the Entire package is $750.00.

Make me an offer on the whole package.

Below is the description from the H&K website http://www.hk-usa.com/civilian_products/hk45_general.asp

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:
Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
HK45 grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911’s profile
Common high-capacity metal magazines with a capacity of 10 rounds (for both HK45 and HK45 Compact models).
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system

I will sell in person to individual in Twin Cities area who has a valid State ID and current State issued permit to purchase. I will email additional photos to those parties interested. The below is from the Heckler & Koch website which describes the USP 9MM

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
