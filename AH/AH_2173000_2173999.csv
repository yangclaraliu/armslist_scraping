If you’ve never shot a BAR, especially with a BOSS, you’ve missed one of the sweetest shooting semi-autos in the world (IMO).  The BOSS is Browning’s shooting optimization system that allows you to tune the rifle in seconds based on the specific factory ammo that you’re shooting, and it works.  This thing has less recoil than any high-powered rifle I’ve ever shot.  Browning claims 30-50% recoil reduction and one-hole shot groups at 100 yds.

The gun itself is in “as new” condition and was rated by H&H in OKC as 100%.  It has only had 18 rounds fired thru it at the range and does not have a flaw of any kind on it.  It has a 3x-9x x 40 mm Burris Fullfield II lifetime warranty scope, and comes with the original case, all the original paperwork, lock and tools, nice leather sling, and 22 rounds of ammo.

The 1st Generation was the first gun Smith and Wesson EVER made. This gun was their 2nd gun to be made. This gun is in IMMACULATE shape for it to be the age that it is. It is Stainless Steel or Nickel ( Whichever they made back then ). The gun opens and closes easily. It has a Flip-Up barrel so that it can be reloaded. The latest Patent Date ( on top of the barrel ) is December, 1860. You would have to see this gun up close to appreciate it. It's not meant to be an every day shooter but a true Gun Collector would LOVE to have this piece. There were only 120,000 of these guns EVER produced. You can look up the history and read on this gun just as I have. I didn't know a thing about it until I started doing some research a few days ago. I bought this at an Estate Sale. It is worth, in the condition it is in, somewhere between $750-$1250. I am letting this one go for a mere $600 because of some unforseen vehicle problems OR IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE MY POSESSION!!! I can be reached at REDACTED. Text will get you the quickest response but if you call, and don't get an answer, leave a message and I will get back to you.

I also recently bought some 28 gauge steel shells thinking that 28 gauge was the same as .410, but the fact that they don't fit in my .410 tells me otherwise. I have the following:

4 x 28 gauge Federal Steel Game and Target 2-3/4 inch 5/8 oz 7 shot
9 x 20 gauge Remington Dove/Quail Load and Game Load 2-3/4 length 2-1/2 dr. eq. 7/8oz 8 shot (Five of these boxes are full, four are about half full)
2 x 20 gauge Remington Sport Loads, Federal Duck & Pheasant
1 x .410 Winchester Super-X Long Range 3in 6 shot 11/16oz shot

I would be interested in a trade for new 20 gauge or .410 *steel or other non-toxic* shells in a rabbit-sized shot (5, 6, 7-1/2, etc.) Cash offers are fine too!

I'm also interested in rabbit hunting places other than E.E. Wilson, so if you know of any other good places please let me know. If you've got property with lots of rabbits I'd be happy to gift you some ammo if you let me hunt your place once in a while. I'm very safe and conscientious."

It has been cleaned (Hoppes), greased (slide glilde), and oiled (Hoppes) after every use.  This was my first gun so I always took care of it.  Now that I am more of an educated buyer, I prefer 9mm and will be purchasing the same gun in 9.  I would say it has about 400-500 rounds through it.  Some of the magazines have not even been used.  I have carried the gun twice in the Crossbreed holster.  I prefer appendix carry.

*NOTE: As you may know, there is a voluntary recall on this gun.  I have personally not experienced any of the issues being reported but the buyer should send the XD-S to the manufacturer.  ALL XD-S pistols are affected.  More info here:
http://www.springfieldrecall.com/
Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur."

I will keep it before losing any more money but I am definitely willing to deal on it if you have something that may spark some interest. I really like big bore rifles, colt handguns, and all rare guns. If you have something extremely rare, or something you never see in a gunshop than I am likely your buyer. I have plenty of cash to make up the difference if yours is worth more than mine, so please do not hesitate to ask. I put on the price what I feel is a fair retail price for this rifle, I don't care what you ""can get one for"", I feel this is very reasonable for this gun and it is less than I paid. Cash is always king. Oh I also have one extra magazine I bought with the gun."

I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

Low round count by the previous owner, well under 100 is my guess based on the overall condition.

Laminated benchrest-style stock with raised flat comb
Adjustable trigger system for pull as low as 2 lbs.
The Mossberg Varmint-Predator (MVP) rifle features a patent-pending drop-push bolt-action that enables you to use your AR-15 .223/5.56 NATO magazines in a firearm optimized for varmint and predator control. The fluted 24"" button-rifled medium bull barrel has a 1:9 twist rate optimized for .223-caliber accuracy and sports a matte-blued finish. Its 11° tapered crown protects the muzzle from incidental damage. The laminated benchrest-style stock features pillar bedding to enhance accuracy and is ideal for shooting off sandbags or packs. Its ergonomic design has a raised flat comb for sighting ease, palm swell on the forend and checkering on the pistol-style grip and forearm. The Lighting Bolt Action (LBA™) trigger assembly is machined aircraft-grade aluminum and hard-coat anodized to military specifications, preventing corrosion and reducing wear. LBA’s creep-free design ensures a crisp break with each shot and trigger pull can be adjusted down to 2 lbs. using only a standard screwdriver. Ten-round magazine included."

HK USP .45V1 which comes with the following:

-UTL
-5 X 10rd factory magazines
-Safariland drop leg holster (only holds USP)
-Factory 3 dot sights (installed MTM night sights are faded)
-Factory cases for both the USP and the UTL

I am the first/only owner of this pistol and the USP has only been shot at indoor ranges.  Overall, she is a safe queen.  Considering her pedigree, she can take a lot more punishment than I could ever dish out from a range session. It has never been carried - I purchased the holster on a whim. The UTL has always been stored with the batteries removed and from the pictures you can see it is in working order. The reason that I am looking to sell/trade it is that I want something that will be easier to carry (just completed my CCW course).

As for partial trades, I am ""interested in"":

SIG 220 (especially beavertail models)
Glock 21 or 30 (Gen 4 only please)
S&W Ladysmith model revolver in .357 (for my fiancé)
Lever action rifle in .44 Mag or .45LC
Ruger 10/22 (take down model only)
Surefire X400 Ultra

I'm also open to hearing what else is out there for trade. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in trading for 1911 pattern pistols, shotguns, or any other types of rifles than those listed (sorry). I'm also not looking to part with any cash in the trade.

Of course, cash always works as well. I'd put the trade value of the package at $1200. I can also include some ammo (with an upwards price adjustment) depending on the deal.

FTF in NoVA requires 2 forms of ID and BoS. I will provide the same for a trade. I am also willing to ship to your FFL for shipping costs."

I have two RUGER OLD ARMY VAQUERO's with 5 1/2"" barrels for sale.  Both are blued and ready for serious cowboy action shooting.  These have never been fired. 

I purchased the first on in 1999; the first year they became available in the vaquero style and with the ""cut down"" barrels.   The second one was purchased a year later. I was going to use them for cowboy action.  Even had a gun rig made just for this pair.  But time and traveling for work got the better of me.  Only thing that's ever been done to them is wiping them down with gun oil on occasion.

With a matte stainless finish on the slide and frame, the gun is nicely contrasted by blued parts (hammer, trigger, operating levers). The grip panels are laminated rosewood, making for a perfect color combination with the finishes. It always amazes me how perfectly these handguns are manufactured with new CNC-machining practices, and the P220 is no exception. All the flats are flat, the sharp corners keep their edges, and there are no cutting or polishing marks to detract from the gun’s appearance. According to the information on the slide, the frame is machined in Germany while the rest of the gun made right here in the U.S.

The slide is machined from a stainless billet and has cocking serrations both fore and aft. The top of the slide is finished like the rest of the gun, and checking in the bright sunlight offered little discomfort over a blue or black gun when it came to sights. For outdoor shooting, SIGLITE night sights offer a wide notch on the rear assembly, which allows you to center the front sight with ease, even in rapid- fire situations. The sights include twin tritium dots on the rear and one on the front, offering the customary three-across sighting picture. They are very well made, somewhat “melted” into the slide and offer no rough edges to snag on clothing or leather gear. According to many, this
The typical operator controls are all there—the takedown lever, decocking lever and slide release.

I contacted Mossberg and they said the shotgun was made in 1976. It is in very good condition for it's age. In interest of full disclosure the shotgun does need a new spring in the trigger group. Because of the broken spring the shotgun will not cycle after pulling the trigger unless you use depress the action release lever. I have been waiting on my local gunsmith to fix it but he has too much going on right now. The job should be quick and cheap. If you want to purchase a whole new trigger group it can be purchased for around $40 including S&H (see link below). I purchased this shotgun at a local gun show for my brother. After I purchased it I found the exact one he was looking for and purchased it as well. Now, I have no need for this one.

I love pump action shotguns, and I especially love Mossberg 500.

This is an older Mossberg 500, New Haven 600AT. The stocks are actual walnut, not the birch they use today. The receiver has decorative etchings. The barrel was the infamous (and ugly) C-Lect Choke, that I had cut down to 18 1/2. The front sight is fiber optic. The action is very smooth. Its been completely striped, cleaned, oiled and reassembled. This would be great under the bed or in the field.

Walmart price $258 + Taxes $25 + Background $10 = $293 
and it doesn't even come with walnut stocks or 18 1/2 barrel.

My price is fair and firm at $240

For sale is a PVS-7 (D-spec) night vision goggle. Tube is an MX-10130D U/V tube, OMNI VII (7), no dark spots or blemishes. I bought the tube/intensifier assembly brand new (zero hours) and still have it's original cardboard box and plastic shipping container (this is included but not pictured). The wired housing/body of the goggle is new as of Feb 2013 (zero hours) (parts are date coded 2/13). The objective lens and ocular lenses are used and from it's original PVS-7B spec configuration. Less than 5 hours light use(est) in it's current config. In short, I had a PVS-7B, sold the tube and housing, and bought a new wired housing and new D-spec tube. Overall it's in excellent shape and runs perfectly. Clean, not dirty or beat up. Includes:

-Spot/flood lens (new)
-Manual (new)
-2 sacrificial lenses (new)
-Soft carrying case (new)
