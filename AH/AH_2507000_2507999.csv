I am very meticulous with my pistols and round counts. Through this G34 I have shot exactly 125 rounds with assorted 115gr FMJs. The standard pull on this trigger is 4.5lbs and I have done nothing to the internals. As all Glock Gen4s, it has the extended mag release the G34 comes stock with the extended slide release. 

This is a great gun, but the wife says to get another gun, I've got to get rid of one. If it wasn't for her (why did I get married again?) I wouldn't let this out of my site! 

There a few a modifications to this pistol. I have done a stippling job on it and took the gun to the Glock Factory in Smyrna, GA to get the Glock metallic night sights put on it. They are Tritium and have a 7-8 year warrantee.

1st: I have a LNIB super low round round P226R 9MM
this has only a box of 50 target loads down the pipe. Zero wear 
as it has lived in the box for most of its life. Comes with TACOPS grips, 
Houge Grips and Factory. 2 18rd Mags 
Can throw in AMMO if asking price is meet. $750

2nd: Great Condition P229R .40 S&W, this has been my go to since I got it. It has 
mounted a Streamlight TRL1s. Gun has little wear mainly on the rail from the
light. Comes with 4 Mags and a Tactical Taylor withlight carry holster. $700

3rd: Perfect condition P220 in .22lr
this is the best .22 you can get for the money! The pistol was born a .45acp
but as some point in its life the slide was replaced with a Sig X-change kit. so yes it is a .45 frame and a .22lr slide. all you need is a complete .45 slide to have an awesome 
setup. 1 Mag ad AMMO if asking price is meet. $550 is is close to what the .22lr conversion kit is alone!

Buy any of the two and I can make it worth your while. questions feel free i am a reasonable seller! Thanks for looking and lets make a deal!

This is a pretty rare version in Flat Dark Earth. Absolutely great gun to shoot. Perfect for IDPA or IPSC shooters, it can also be a decent CCW during the winter months when more clothing is warm. But hey, I have a buddy who carries the G34 year round.

I am very meticulous with my pistols and round counts. Through this G34 I have shot exactly 125 rounds with assorted 115gr FMJs. The standard pull on this trigger is 4.5lbs and I have done nothing to the internals. As all Glock Gen4s, it has the extended mag release the G34 comes stock with the extended slide release. 

This is a great gun, but the wife says to get another gun, I've got to get rid of one. If it wasn't for her (why did I get married again?) I wouldn't let this out of my site! 

There a few a modifications to this pistol. I have done a stippling job on it and took the gun to the Glock Factory in Smyrna, GA to get the Glock metallic night sights put on it. They are Tritium and have a 7-8 year warrantee. 

The Gun comes with the box and everything that came there (3 back straps, lock, owners manual, etc.), 3x 17rd magazines and the upgraded night sights ($75). 

I can text you more pictures, just let me know what you would like.

This is a pretty rare version in Flat Dark Earth. Absolutely great gun to shoot. Perfect for IDPA or IPSC shooters, it can also be a decent CCW during the winter months when more clothing is warm. But hey, I have a buddy who carries the G34 year round.

I am very meticulous with my pistols and round counts. Through this G34 I have shot exactly 125 rounds with assorted 115gr FMJs. The standard pull on this trigger is 4.5lbs and I have done nothing to the internals. As all Glock Gen4s, it has the extended mag release the G34 comes stock with the extended slide release. 

This is a great gun, but the wife says to get another gun, I've got to get rid of one. If it wasn't for her (why did I get married again?) I wouldn't let this out of my site! 

There a few a modifications to this pistol. I have done a stippling job on it and took the gun to the Glock Factory in Smyrna, GA to get the Glock metallic night sights put on it. They are Tritium and have a 7-8 year warrantee. 

The Gun comes with the box and everything that came there (3 back straps, lock, owners manual, etc.), 3x 17rd magazines and the upgraded night sights ($75). 

I can text you more pictures, just let me know what you would like.

The IOM model includes adjustable sights, a squared trigger guard, picatinny rail, magazine safety, and ambidextrous controls. The pistol will include three 20rnd magazines as well as two promag 30rnd magazines - real 30's not extended 20's, along with the original case, manual, and lock. Also included - 750rnds of SS195LF hollow points, as well as another 100rnds of SS197 V-max blue tips. The SS195's are great rounds with a velocity of over 2,000fps - on average around 300-400fps faster than the blue tipped SS197 V-max rounds. These rounds are discontinued (original white box, not blue/white), but were manufactured in Belgium rather than by Fiocchi here in the states. Great opportunity to stock up on high velocity ammo rather than paying $40-$50 a box. If you don't need the ammo or if your looking for ammo but don't need the 57, email me and we will work something out 

The Five-seven is a full-size pistol, having an overall length of 8.2 in, a height of 5.4 in, and a max width of 1.4 in. It has the same grip angle as the distinguished Browning Hi-Power and M1911 pistols. Despite the considerable length of the pistol's 5.7×28mm ammunition, the grip is not particularly unwieldy—the distance from the trigger to the back of the grip measures 2.750 in, which is identical to a U.S. Military issue M9 pistol. The Five-seven barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with a total length of 4.8 in and a rifled length of 3.7 in. The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231 mm (1:9.1 in), and it weighs 0.25 lb. It has a stated service life of 20,000 rounds and the Five-seven is noted for being very accurate. Great concealed carry option, and extrememly light-weight - 1.6lbs loaded with 20rnds!

I am in the military, so I clean my rifle to perfection! I could also include about about 300 rounds of CCI Velocitors in a trade. So far I've got over $1200 invested in the rifle.

She's got a Barska 3-9x42mm dual-illuminated scope (that's darn accurate at 100 yards!), a TruGlo TruBrite dual-illuminated 4-reticle dot sight mounted at a 45-degree angle, a vertical foregrip, Magpul ""AFG2"" Angled Fore-Grip, 4-position adjustable bipod, and 6-position adjustable stock (the one in picture is not included - it will come with original ""Tapco"" stock). Currently has some cheap rail covers on it, you can have those too! I find it makes it a bit easier and more comfortable to grip with the AFG. It's the version with the non-threaded weighted barrel, but I've had it quoted for $60 if you wanted to get it threaded. Could also sell for less if you didn't want all of the accessories - hit me up and let me know what you don't want, and we can talk price."

the REMINGTON MODEL 1911 R1 CENTENNIAL. The opportunity to own a commemorative pistol of this quality is rare and this model will only be available for a limited time. Since its adoption by the US Army on March 29, 1911, the M1911 pistol design has proven timeless. Remington's experience with the pistol design started under the UMC moniker just before the end of World War I. In 2010, more than 90 years later, E-RPC, LLC re-introduced the Remington Model 1911 R1 pistol to a new generation of handgun enthusiasts and collectors.

It is the longest Glock ever manufactured. It has a factory compensated long slide that’s just shy of 9” and a 6” barrel. A small amount of these guns were produced and they are no longer in production. 

This gun is one of a kind and out of all the handguns I have shot this one is definitely my favorite. (im more than willing to meet at a range so you can see for yourself) Recoil is very minimal, barrel rise is not an issue at all. I have done many rapid fire shoots where my shots were touching each other. The accuracy of the gun is amazing (first group I shot with it was better than any I have done with my 1911)

The only 24 I have ever seen for sale was at Gun World and it was completely stock except for a KKM barrel, they wanted $1400 for it. I have seen a few online from time to time prices ranging from $650-$800

Here is a list of everything that is done to the gun and included. I did a google search to find the lowest online prices for each item. 

6” KKM Precision Match barrel - $175
Ghost trigger connector and spring kit - $40
TRUGLO Tritium / Fiber Optic sights (TG131GT1) -$90
HEINIE Glock Clasic black sight set - $75

Extended slide stop - $15

Protec Elite 190 lumen light - $50
(5) 15 round factory Glock magazines - $150
120 rounds of FMJ  -  30 rounds of HP - $50

$805 Invested into the gun

I am incredibly attached to this gun and swore that I would never sell it but I really need money to put towards a vehicle so I guess it’s time for someone else to enjoy it. I am selling it as a package deal, I am willing to hear out most reasonable offers but I know what I have, what it is worth and If I can’t get enough money for it then I’ll just keep it.

The barrel is 23 inches long and has been crowned, the follower has been modified to close on an empty chamber. The pictures are not the best so email if you would like better ones and what you would like to see on them.  It came with a very nice old school Redfield 4X but I am not sure if that would be the best scope for this rifle.  I can add that if my asking price is met these scopes are getting 80-100 on ebay."

I started with a Remington 870 Police Magnum with original folding stock marked ""Law Enforcement Only.""  I slicked up the action so that it pumps very smoothly.  I also coated the shotgun with Cerakote, including disassembling the entire trigger group and coating all of the components.  I'm a full time gunsmith and this shotgun has been my personal home defense shotgun for years.  It is simple, very reliable and very rugged, and with the Cerakote finish it will last many years to come.  Outside of Scattergun Technologies or Nighthawk Custom it is hard to find a shotgun like this.  The only reason I'm selling it is to raise money to build a new experimental home defense shotgun.

The wood is beautiful and the stock feels great in your hand.  The action has been slicked up such that it cycles very smoothly.   I also coated the gun with black Cerakote.

   Great little deer/hog gun potential! Chinese SKS with Dragunov stock, still beautifully tight, doesn't rattle when you shake it! Shoots beautifully, incredibly accurate off the adjustable iron sights, though I'd be inclined to toss a med-range scope on her and make this a hunter.

Of course, chambered in the plentiful & cheap AK fodder, the 7.62X39 round.

This would have originally had the wood stock with a sling swivel on the left side, not the bottom. Kind of an unusual SKS, only imported by Keng's, back when they still did gun imports.

I've added them up on Brownells, and they'd cost about the same.

But your pistol looks like it's been beat the hell up around the spring and guide rod housing on the polymer's front end, and along the side near the guide rails.  $375 is more realistic of an "" asking price "" for a pistol in that condition.  Try to be fair, dude.  I don't want it, but you could get brand new Kahr for just around that same price point.  Not looking for your angry comments about your ad.  Just telling it like it is.  Hopefully you respect my opinion.  But remember that my opinion is also based on decades of experience with pistols in regards to their raw value, as well as the sentimental value, both of which are VERY different in price, usually.  Everybody thinks their pistol is worth 200$ more than what it's really worth, so I'm not busting your balls about it.    Anyway, good luck with it, though.  Hapy New Year....Armslist Family.
