Protection for those who choose not to carry a gun, those who frequent firearms restricted areas, and those gun free zones.  

Do not under estimate the effectiveness of OC Pepper.  As a police officer (now retired) and a chemical munitions instructor, I have had the pleasure to take the hit twice; not the way you want to spent your day.

Much better than the old tear gas and Mace which had to chemically burn the eye surface and airways, OC Pepper is a natural irritant that inflames the membranes with no permanent damage.  First is involuntary eye closure, extreme burnings of the eyes and airways, and about a gallon of snot running freely.  Usually, in about 45 minutes the bad guy is recovered.  Also this OC spray has invisible UV dye in it, so the bad guy can be identified even days later.

Police OC-17 Magnum unit, about 3/4 "" in diameter, 3"" in length & a 1"" key ring attached to the base.  The sprayer has a positive locking safety on top and a clearly visible expiration date on the cap.  Watch for the expiration dates on OC units, it will not work effectively when expired.  Never buy any OC unit that does not bear a legible expiration date.  Expiration on these units is 09/2017.

Smith & Wesson M&P 40 Compact
This is a great gun in like new condition. I am the only owner and I am meticulous when it comes to my firearms. This gun has an Apex Tactical fully machined sear and Apex Tactical Ultimate Striker Block installed so the trigger is very smooth. I do have the original sear and striker block. This gun also comes with 9mm barrel and two 9mm magazines. That means you can reliably shoot 9mm rounds by simply swapping out the barrel and using the 9mm magazines. Nothing else is required. Do some searches for M&P compact 40 to 9mm conversion for more info.
I am primarily looking to work out a trade for a M&P pro in 40 or 9mm or a Glock 34 or 35.
I would consider selling everything outright for $650. That is only if I am unable to work out a trade so the price is firm. 
You must have a valid permit to purchase or Cpl. Sorry, no exceptions.
Parts List:
 - Apex Tactical sear - $41.95
- Apex Tactical Ultimate Striker Block - $35.95
- M&P 9mm Compact Magazine – $41.82 x 2
- M&P 9mm Compact barrel - $65.99

The scope on it is a 3-9x40 bushnell and it has been sighted in. A shell deflector is also mounted so empty shells dont hit the scope.  i have a muzzle break for it but i have taken it off of the gun. The gun shoots flawlessly. The original cleaning kit is inside of the pistol grip. I have some brand new 30 round pmags for it still in their packaging ( not pictured).

The grip just slides off and you slide the other one on. I have upgraded the guide rod and spring to a stainless captured system from Brass Stacker ($25 off Amazon). Ill include the OEM plastic guide rod and non-captured spring also. I bought this Ruger SR22 new on 08/10/13 from a retail store.

This is by far one of the best .22 handguns ever made, its very very similar to a Walther P22 except it came with 2 mags and has better decocking/safety. Dont get mad you Walther fans, its a fact! Its had maybe 200 rds thru it, not one single issue...EVER! I'll also include approx 150 rds of mixed .22LR ammo and a leather Bianchi RH in-waistband holster ($70 from Bianchi). Hurry, this would make a great Christmas gift for the first time shooter.

Also comes with +/-400 rounds of ammunition and that handy cammo ammo-holder pictured on the stock- if wanted- it velcro's on or off. 

This isn't the cheap crap you get from Cabela's or Gander Mountain or elsewhere- Those are all round receivers made during the war years when materials were scarce and corners were cut (literally- when you look at the receivers). 
This is a pre-war Hex receiver from the Tula factory. The wood is in great condition, the blueing is in great condition, and the weapon functions perfectly. 

Not in a hurry to get rid of it- not looking to sell- only trade- and only for other fire-arms. The price is to give a value. If you want to buy, the price is pretty firm. I'm looking for trade. 

Not interested in ANYTHING made by High-Point. 
Not looking for shotguns or .22's unless its something very special. 
VERY accurate rifle, and great functional collectors item. 

Might be willing to combine with other things (see my other listings) for the right trade.  

Looking for: 
Handguns, Rifles, and Carbines. Sorry- not interested in shotguns or .22's. 
I'd be very interested in a PU Rifle- even if it's the round receiver..

Serious inquiries only- no I won't ship it anywhere or accept checks. FTF transfer only. I live around Austin, but for the right trade, I'd be willing to take a drive."

Not one made from spare parts in the US. All numbers match. The rifle features a last shot bolt hold open.  The barrel is hard chrome lined and is immaculate. It still has the bayonette lug that works for those who care. This is one of the few that made it in without it being ground off. It has been shot about 300 times. It comes with 5X 10 round original magazines!  This PSL has been Duracoated in FDE as well as the magazines. A Tapco double hook trigger has been installed and it has a very smooth and light pull. The scope is a Belarus made 8x42 POSP with an illuminated reticle graduated for the 7.62x54R past 1000M. It is battery powered and runs on common 2032 batteries. The mount is a Kalinka high mount so you can use the iron sights rapidly if needed. These PSL's are getting harder to find and the prices will only go up just like the SVD's and TIGR rifles back in the day. The stock is a Rhineland Arms Walnut and it has a longer length of pull and it is much better quality than the original. Text REDACTED or email.

Up for sale is an excellent condition .357 Magnum S&W Model 640-1 from 1995-1996, right when this model was introduced. 

This being an earlier one, built before S&W started really cutting corners in their work, it still possesses the forged steel hammer and trigger, real rifling and real roll marks. They only made them this way for approximately the first year of production, then they started cutting corners by putting MIM hammers & triggers in the guns. These are getting harder to find...great little full-power CC piece.

I haven't fired it since owning it, but it passes all functions checks, and is very smooth & clean...with only minor handling marks here and there. Doesn't appear to of been fired or carried much.

It will come with the Uncle Mike's Combat Grips that it originally shipped with from the factory and a new soft gun case. 

$550. FTF in S. Everett. No weirdos.

I have yet to find much that this Jeep won't go through or over. It was my daily driver for about six years, then, once I got married, it became my four wheeling trail and hunting vehicle. I have put about $12,000 into since I bought it:
-Rebuilt 4.2 L straight 6 bulletproof engine with about 15k on it.
-Weber two-stage performance carb which eliminates the vacuum system.
-Extra large radiator and aftermarket fan

-Has some rust, nothing structural
-Paint is getting rough, but has been a trail vehicle these last few years.

-Needs a new radio, the old one is about done, but there are new wheel well speakers that work great.

Its the shell only...no liner or chinstrap but a nice shell. Has been repainted but still worth a penny considering it is an original. Has very minor pitting on visor but is very normal on the german helmets. I think serial number is 3126 but that tells you nothing but an idea of when it was made. Factory code is ET66 (factory Eisenhuttenwerke and size 66 cm). Im looking to get $130 OBO or trade. Can send more pics upon request. Call or text REDACTED.

(about 75-ish rounds of all types of loads) It is becoming more and more fun to shoot. This includes 10 round mag that already had the alteration done on it from the manufacturer.

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun that resembles the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement of some of the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the shotgun, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun has a 5 round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.[1] Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail can be placed which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments."

The bad: 
1. I think it needs a clutch. It was acting really underpowered, driving slow even at high revs, so I just parked it until I could figure it out. 
2. It isn't currently inspected. All it needs to pass inspection is the wiper motor replaced. I have the replacement already, I just havent switched them out. 
3. There is some rust, but not anymore than you would expect on a 23 year old truck. You can see it in the pictures.
4. The Leer bedcover is missing one of the driver's side windows.



The good:
I have had the following installed (I have all receipts):
- Right side upper and lower ball joints, oxygen sensor, harmonic balancer, crank seal, serpentine belt, timing cover gasket, 2 brand new front tires (rear tires still have 75% tread).

Previous owner replaced the following (I still have the receipts):
- Spark plugs, ignition rotor, distributor cap, fuel filter, plug wires, oil pan gasket, valve cover gasket, heater hose, rear main seals.

They are made using heat treated a2 tool steel that is 38-42RC hardness so these will last a very long time. The materials alone were very expensive but since my friend is a cnc machinest i got a huge break. a2 steel is a very difficult steel to machine and each part took 1.5 hours of labor. the hole locations were made using a GI colt m16a1 receiver that was placed in a CMM (co-ordinate measuring machine) and machined to a tolerance of +- .0005 since this jig has 2 holes (take down and selector hole) it places the sear pin hole exactly where it should be and takes out the guess work and room for error that one hole jigs leave. if your receivers rear take down and selector hole is to spec as it shold be this jig puts the sear pin hole 100% where it needs to go. each jig was cross checked for correct hole locations and when pinned up to a gi m16 the holes lined up perfect. all nfa rules apply. shipping is included

It fits any standard accessory rail on any gun so you don't have to have a glock for it. I found it actually fit better on my xd9 to be honest.

If you carry then these are excellent carry guns as they are only a little bigger than a PPK or Makarov, fire a more powerful round and have a higher capacity.

This one is in very good shape with a very good finish for a CZ82.  It comes with a  box, the leather military holster it was carried in, and  124 rounds of 9x18mm ammo.  It also comes with TWO 12 round magazines.  Most of these that come into the country only come with one and these mags are getting harder to find and very expensive.

I'm wanting to trade it for a Bersa Thunder pro Ultra Compact in either 9mm or .40.  I would far prefer a .40, but I'll still consider a 9mm.  Would be nice to have some ammo along with it since I'm giving up all my Makarov ammo in trade.  

I am NOT interested in a .380 Bersa Thunder or the .45, just the .40 or 9mm.  Would also be interested in a Ruger SR9c or SR40c. May consider other similar guns in this size or caliber, but this is what I'm really looking for.  Will be fine with keeping the CZ if one doesnt come up.
