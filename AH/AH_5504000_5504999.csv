Not currently interested in splitting things up and would be more than happy to ship where legal. That said, I have the following:- Odin Works ULTRAlite 16.1"" stainless barrel with .223 Wylde chamber and mid length gas system. Round count on it is approximately 150. Very accurate barrel, especially with heavier grain weights (69 grain and up).- Odin Works low profile gas block with set screws. Came with the barrel and round count is the same, as it was installed on this barrel. - Carbine length gas tube. Unused. Bought this for a build and decided on a mid length system instead.- Two KNS anti-rotation pin sets. These are both used but are in good to very good condition. Both work perfectly, just don't have a use for them with the triggers I'm currently using.- Two A2 bird cage flash hiders. Pretty sure these are both unused but not positive on that. - Blackhawk! brand righthand offset safety selector. This was installed on a mockup then removed. - Daniel Defense 5.56/.223 complete bolt carrier group. Round count on this is approximately 60 rounds. Used this for a short time then built a 6.5 Grendel upper and replaced it. Has a KNS Perma-Pin firing pin retainer installed but I can swap that out for a standard pin if the buyer would rather have that. Only trade interest would be a partial trade for factory loaded 6.5 Grendel ammunition, especially Hornady SST or AMax plus cash.

A “almost new” USFA RodeoThis is a USFA (United States Firearms Manufacturing) Rodeo model SAA Colt .38 special revolver, with a 5 ½” barrel. This gun looks as if it has seen slight use. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo Matte Blue finish and presentation and checkered US black synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its Matte Blue finish reduces sun glare that a polished finish throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is like new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business. In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, these  reproduction single action revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail. In addition, this revolver has been ""slicked up"" by Long Hunter Shooting Supply making an already excellent pistol even better. One of two available with consecutive serial numbers."

This gun looks as if it has seen slight use. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo Matte Blue finish and presentation and checkered US black synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its Matte Blue finish reduces sun glare that a polished finish throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is like new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business. In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, these  reproduction single action revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail. In addition, this revolver has been ""slicked up"" by Long Hunter Shooting Supply making an already excellent pistol even better. Also has the low profile hammer for faster target acquisition. One of two available with consecutive serial numbers."

This gun looks as if it has seen slight use. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo Matte Blue finish and presentation and checkered US black synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its Matte Blue finish reduces sun glare that a polished finish throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is like new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business. In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, these  reproduction single action revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail. In addition, this revolver has been ""slicked up"" by Long Hunter Shooting Supply making an already excellent pistol even better. Also has the low profile hammer for faster target acquisition.

This gun looks as if it has seen slight use. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo Matte Blue finish and presentation and checkered US black synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its Matte Blue finish reduces sun glare that a polished finish throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is like new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business. In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, these  reproduction single action revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail. In addition, this revolver has been ""slicked up"" by Long Hunter Shooting Supply making an already excellent pistol even better. Also has the low profile hammer for faster target acquisition. One of two available with consecutive serial numbers."

LEMAY MODELS WERE MANUFACTURED AND THIS ONE WAS ONE OF HE LAST ONES MANUFACTURED WITH SERIAL # BF03114C BEING THE LAST.THE CURTIS E. LeMAY 4-STAR PISTOLS In 1984, Randall expanded its line with the introduction of a true compact .45 auto, which was designed by Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay. Among his many accomplishments, LeMay had been responsible for establishing the Air Force’s Marksmanship Training Unit. When LeMay created his pistol design, he intended it to be used by members of the Strategic Air Force Command. The general initially tried to have the diminutive .45 produced by Colt. But, that never occurred. As it happened, Art Hanke, who was the head of manufacturing and engineering for Randall, was a personal friend of General LeMay. It was through this liaison that Randall Firearms Company came to produce the LeMay model line of pistols. First of the LeMay pistols was the A311. It sported a 4.25-inch, 10 groove barrel. The slide had a round top and a fixed rear sight. The handle and magazine were shortened by a half-inch, limiting the magazine to six rounds. Overall weight was 35 ounces. Exclusive to the LeMay models were factory-squared trigger guards. In all, 361 of the Model A311 pistols were made in a serial number range of RF02011C through RF03114C. The first A311 was made on March 1, 1984, and production of that model ended on October 25, 1984."

Jeff Cooper outlined his personal ideal for a long gun he called the Scout—a short, lightweight bolt-action rifle with a forward-mounted long-eye-relief optic and back-up iron sights. The Model ll Scout successfully blends Colonel Cooper's do-it-all Scout rifle concept with the features, reliability, and fair price customers have come to expect from a Savage. At the heart of the platform is the trusted Savage Model 11 short action, configured for the .308 Winchester cartridge. The Scout is fitted with an 18” button-rifled carbon steel barrel featuring a threaded muzzle fitted with a 4-port muzzle brake. The gun arrives with two sighting options already installed: a 6.625"" picatinny scope rail attached to the barrel and factory iron sights that consist of a fully-adjustable Williams peep sight in the rear and a fixed blade sight in the front. The Scout's natural tan polymer AccuStock contains a permanently affixed rigid aluminum rail 3-D bedding system that provides added support for the action. Molded in diamond pattern checkering along the sides of the forend and grip improve purchase for cold or wet conditions. Three removable buttstock spacers allow the length-of-pull to be adjusted from 13"" to 14"". The simple, rugged, cheek piece can be raised and lowered as needed in relation to scope height. The Savage AccuTrigger is ultra-smooth and adjustable at home without a gunsmith. Three sling swivels provide two forward positions for attaching a two-point shoulder sling or bipod. The detachable box magazine holds 10 rounds."

70 years ago, Kalashnikov designed an incredibly reliable semi-automatic rifle, the AK-47. However, the 7.62x39mm cartridge that the AK used wasn't very accurate except at really short range, due to having shitty ballistics.

Meanwhile, over here in the West, we standardized on a rifle design (AR/M-16) that's far less reliable out in the field (it's fine if it's kept clean) but which fires ammunition that's far more accurate, the 5.56x45mm NATO round. 

Logically, the best ""survivial rifle"" would be one that offers the reliability of the AK yet fires the far more accurate (and likely far more readily available, in a SHTF scenario) NATO round. Sure enough, the Israelis figured out the same thing over fifty years ago, when they began designing the Gailil, which is an AK that shoots NATO 5.56mm ammo.

More recently, the Kalashnikov Company - known as IZHMASH - began exporting genuine Russian AK's under the brand name ""Saiga"" and several of these Saigas are shipped in western calibers, including 5.56mm.

So... about this Saiga 223: they should've called it the ""Saiga 556"" because it can safely fire 5.56mm ammo (most civilian .223 rifles cannot - however, 5.56mm ""military grade"" rifles like the AR and this Saiga 223 can fire either type).

What most people do with these Saigas, since they were imported in a ""sporterized"" setup (to get around the ban on importing foreign ""assault weapons"") is upgrade a few parts with American-made aftermarket parts, thus lowering the number of foreign parts to ten or less. When this is done, your Saiga is no longer considered a ""foreign assault weapon"" under Federal guidelines and you can now use high-capacity magazines, add a pistol grip and/or folding stock, etc, etc. By the way, these guidelines are known as ""922R"" and there's more on all this here, as well as reasons why converting is a good idea:

http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/topic/39651-why-should-you-convert-your-saiga/ 

Here in Colorado, the ban on high-capacity magazines means you may not possess rifle magazines in excess of 15 rounds' capacity unless you're grandfathered (i.e. you already owned them before the ban went into effect). One of the many awesome things about the Saiga 223 is that there are several ways of modifying it to take AR magazines! This means if you already legally possess AR-type mags, the Saiga can legally use them! If you don't have some grandfathered AR mags, the best price I've found so far for Colorado-legal 15-round magazines is here:

hhttp://www.saigastock.com/surefire-saiga-223-15-round-magazine-p-6507.html

NOTE: serious Saiga buyers will strip the gun down, media-blast all the parts and Duracote them (an ultra-durable, impact-resistant coating kind of like spray-on bedliner). Therefore, a serious buyer is not going to care about the cheap finish that the Russians give these guns, or the crappy, lightweight plastic ""furniture"" they come with (stock and forearm), since all that's going to be replaced anyhow. There's a lot of useful information on the Internet; here's the main Saiga 223 site:

http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/forum/22-saiga-223/

Here are a bunch of online stores for Saiga parts and accessories:

centerfiresystems.com
mississippiautoarms.com
www.carolinashooterssupply.com
dinzagarms.com

These guys sell a magazine adapter:

http://www.canisdesigngroup.com/m4-magazine-adapter-for-ak.html

These guys specialize in performing the conversion for you, if you don't want to do it yourself (they also make it compatible with AR mags):

http://www.definitivearms.com/main-pages/main_page.html

This particular Saiga 223 has had less than a hundred rounds through it and is in perfect condition functionally. However the cheap Russian finish looks a little crappy (I tried polishing it up a little with a green plastic scrubby and that was not a good idea) and could use a little re-bluing... or else just give it a proper conversion with Duracote.

The original factory ten-round magazine and toolkit are included.

I will only sell in-state (I don't have the time nor the interest in dealing with shipping, sorry). 

A transfer will need to be performed by a licensed dealer at buyer's expense.

The Omni Hybrid Maxx rifle is an AR with a metal-reinforced polymer lower and upper receiver. With ATI’s metal insert reinforcing the load-bearing part of the upper receiver, the new Omni Hybrid Maxx has the same durability as a forged aluminum upper—without the weight. The 7-ounce polymer upper receiver accepts all MIL-SPEC parts.For those skeptical of polymer AR-15 upper and lowers, ATI torture-tested the new Omni Hybrid Maxx series rifles, firing over 2,000 rounds in full auto without malfunctions. American Tactical president, Tony Dichario, says, “The Omni Hybrid Maxx series is a ground breaking product line that we are all excited about. This is the first-ever polymer-based upper and lower receiver combination that performs as it should and meets the same mil-spec qualifications as an AR-15 platform made from aluminum forgings. We tested the Omni Hybrid Upper in full-auto. We fired 2,000 consecutive rounds without any malfunctions or cleaning, an accomplishment most aluminum receivers couldn’t make.”American Tactical is one of the nation’s top importers and manufacturers of firearms and firearm related products. Having created a unique channel of distribution, American Tactical has quickly become a single-source distribution provider for many manufacturers across the world, as well as manufacturing their own line of fine firearms. From its signature German Sport Guns (GSG) family of products and their new Omni Hybrid Maxx Series American Tactical continues to be a leader in the firearms industry.FOR ADDITIONAL PICTURES VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT: https://www.bugoutguns.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=NS029386"

Over the years I've see a lot of plate carrier starting to come with clip-on panel and chestrig capability, not only is it verstile and useful for situation where changing different set ups in a hurry is necessary. But I was like wait a minute does it have to be plate carrier that have this capability? What about non-armour rig like chestrig? And there's where the idea come from. Coming from an airsoft background I just don't have the need to run plates and that's how the idea was born.Despite being a chestrig it is actually loaded with features, first of all there's the clip-on capability and probably the only one I know of in the industry that make use of that. Anything like Mayflower placards, Haley D3 and HSGI will work on it. There's also a small velcro panel in the back of the rig where a Crye JPC radio pouch or a Ferro Concepts Dangler can be used to carry other essential. Last but not least the strap can be reconfigurated into H or X configuration, all you have to take off or put on the horizontal strap that is in the back.
I'm 6 feet tall and of average build and the rig fits my body nicely, all the straps can be extended to at least a yard or 36"" long so it will fit people with plus sizes as well, in conclusion this is a very verstile chestrig.
Avalible in coyote, ranger green and Multicam
Pricing: $138 for solid colors and $148 for Multicam, shipping are an added cost, can do local pick up if it's within reasonable distances"
