109,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2229109,For Sale/Trade:  Like new Ruger SR9c w/extras and ammo,"Akron Area, Akron, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 16, 2013",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a nearly new Ruger SR9c compact 9mm pistol. This is the bi-tone stainless steel and black model (gorgeous I might add). I bought this pistol several months ago and although it is a pleasure to shoot, I am looking for more of a medium/full size pistol. There have been exactly 100 rounds put through this handgun. The trigger on this Ruger is awesome, smooth and crisp. It is a striker fire weapon, just like the Glock, only it has a manual safety option along with the trigger safety. This pistol is great for CCW, with the 10 round mag in, it is virtually the same size as the Glock 26 (+/- mm's). Comes with 2 magazines, a 10 round and a 17 round. The 10 round is a flush fit and is perfect for concealed carry. The 17 round comes with a magazine adapter which matches the grip of the pistol so it looks really good. The original Ruger box, along with manual, speed loader, and optional magazine butt plates is included as well. 

I am also throwing in a AIM 150 lumens tac-light that mounts nicely on the weaver mount of this pistol, and 100 rounds of 9mm ammo. The tac-light is very bright, lightweight, and easy to turn on/off.

Price for the entire package is $450 for purchase or trade for a Glock 19 or 17 or M&P 9 (no compacts). Prefer GEN 4 for the Glocks, but negotiable for the right deal. Willing to add a few bucks for the right deal as well.

Must be at least 21 yrs. old and have a valid Ohio ID to purchase, NO EXCEPTIONS!!! FTF sales only, no shipping. CCW owners (like myself) will go to the front of the line. Willing to meet in, or around, the Akron area."

Therefore, I am selling it along with all my 7.62x54r ammo and accessories. 

First, my rifle; 1943 refurbed Izhevsk M91/30 that is a smooth operating good shooting rifle. The following modifications have been performed by me. I have about 6 years gunsmithing experience doing this kind of work so all is 'professionally' done.
The rear sight base was removed and a weaver/picatinney rail($10 value) drilled and tapped onto the dovetail part of the barrel. 
Then having a new AIM Sport 2-7x42 LER 30mm scope w/rangefinder reticle installed($70 value). It has been laser bore-sighted, but I have not had a chance to get to the range to fine tune it yet. 
Barrel has been cut and re-crowned to 20.25' then the OD turned down and threaded to accept an M14-1LH Muzzle Brake from CNC Warrior called 'The Russian Original'($30 value w/washer). It looks similar to the Draganov MB. The MB has been installed with a crush washer and blue loc-tite for a secure and properly timed installation. Total barrel length is 22.5'
Original stock has been modified with the front cut back and a UTG SWAT Tactical BP78 bipod installed along with QD sling swivels and padded sling(Bipod $30, QD swivels $10, Sling $15). 
On the butt, I cut the end down then added a Limbsaver type recoil pad($20) to maintain the original overall length. I used part of the lower front part of the stock as a cheek piece and put on a 9 round butt stock ammo sleeve($5). (see the pic)

Along with the set up I have 10 Izhevsk stamped surplus stripper clips in excellent condition.($10-$15 value) 
As well as 2 MOLLE II single grenade pouches in ACU camo that work really well as belt pouches for toting ammo. Each pouch will hold 5 loaded clips for a total of 50 rounds in the 2 pouches. Great for hunting.($5-$8 value)

For the Ammo;($60-$85 value depending on where you get it)
40 rounds of PRVI Partisan PPU 150gr SP brass cased, boxer primed reloadable hunting ammo.($30-$40)
59 rounds of Yugoslavian M30 Brass cased Berdan primed corrosive surplus ammo. The next best thing to the 7N1 Sniper ammo.($30-$45 value)

I will sell some of the ammo separately. See my other listing on which and how much.

Taking the low side values, which I feel are a good fair value in today's market(tried to base values from going online pricing), That puts the rifle at $275. If you take the value on the parts I installed($190) that puts the rifle itself at $85. That does not take into consideration any of my time and labor. All in all I think it is a very fair price for what you are getting so, suffice it to say, my price is firm.

These are very highly thought of in the 3 Gun crowd. I bought two but decided to use only in 5.56 and ordered another in 300BLK so this one is a spare. Zero rounds outside of Lancer Systems factory. The barrel has a 1/7 twist and mid-length gas system. This also comes complete with the charging handle and BCG along with Lancer's superb rifle length carbon fiber handguard. There are slots on 7 of the eight sides of this handguard so that 2 or 4 inch rails can be placed in any position necessary to accommodate your needs. There is also a 2 inch rail permanently installed in the 12 o'clock position for a front sight.


The Lancer Lightweight Carbon-Fiber Handguard (LCH) is a custom profiled free float handguard system designed for 5.56mm cal AR type rifles and 7.62 AR type rifles.

Applying our experience in carbon-fiber product design and lightweight component development we’ve created a robust free float handguard that weighs less than comparable aluminum handguard systems without sacrificing rigidity or impact strength. Available in carbine, mid-length, rifle length and extra long (15”), the Lancer Lightweight Carbon-Fiber Handguard can be applied to a variety of rifle configurations and used in many different applications. 

•Free Float Design ensures that the barrel is not effected by pressure on the handguard eliminating point of impact devations.
•Low profile, octagon shaped carbon-fiber tube, is as rigid and impact resistant as lightweight aluminum free float tube designs
•Available with or without cooling slots
•Cooling slots will accept accessory rail hardware

MFG: High Speed Gear - Made in USA
Preowned - appears new
Ships via USPS Priority Mail 

Size Medium - Belt size of 32# to 34#

The High Speed Gear™ SureGrip™ Padded Military Belt is designed to provide the comfortable, no-slip stability necessary for reducing back strain and general discomfort so frequently caused by loose-fitting, drooping and weighted-down belts. Featuring a brand-new modular system, the SureGrip™ has a slim profile that is just 0.75 inches thick and only 4.5 inches tall.

The SureGrip™'s updated design features Neoprene as the belt's padding. This material gives the belt a cushiony gel-like feel for greater comfort and exceptional gripping power. It also features a removable HDPE stiffener sheet throughout the entire main portion where the three continuous rows of PALS/MOLLE are located. This feature is for those times when added stability is required. With this proprietary ability to remove the stiffener sheet, the SureGrip™ is one of the most flexible military belts of its kind, making it the ultimate support system whether at the range or in the field.

With three conveniently-positioned access ports, the SureGrip™ allows you to seamlessly attach subloads to the belt's interior, while the belt's four suspender attachments allow for easy expansion.

HK INFO
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. 

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

•Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates

This is a beautifully built Mosin Nagant 91/30.  It features a hand fitted Boyds Featherweight Thumbhole stock that is both SUPER lightweight AND durable.  The stock features vents along the fore end that allow for quick cooling of the full length, free floated barrel.  The scope is a Steel tube weaver K2.5 with crosshair reticle and mounted on a custom made scope mount.  There is a 2 month waiting list for these mounts as they are not your cheap ATI, but rather are built of high quality steel and attached to the rifle via a steel band that wraps around the receiver.  It is NOT attached using any screws drilled into the rifle or stock, and thus can be removed at any time without any harm to either.  The rifle can even be picked up and slung around by the mount and it WILL NOT lose zero!!  I have shot this rifle at over 500 yards and it will hit a small steel plate at that distance all day long! In my opinion, this is the most beautiful and accurate Mosin Nagant around!"

Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

By using a cutting-edge baffle stack combined with artificial environment technology the Wasp is able to outperform .22 suppressors that are twice its size.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

For sale is a Para Ordnance Carry 12 LDA pistol, all stainless steel and chambered in 45 ACP. Along with the pistol comes four magazines, the original box, manual, pistol specific tools, and practice caps. The original fired round and ballistics information is included.
This pistol was manufactured in 2003 and has been owned and stored for most of its life. It has received use and much care the last two years as my carry pistol and favorite range shooter.
This pistol has had less than a thousand rounds through it in its lifetime and is a pleasure to shoot. I have cared for it and have found it very comfortable and surprisingly accurate for the barrel length (3.5 Inches). The ""Light Double Action"" trigger by Para is exceptional. The pull is clean and reasonably short, the break is crisp with a defined reset. The light pull created by this trigger makes it very consistent and easily controllable. The Para Carry 12 features 3-dot night sights and frame mounted safeties.

Along with the pistol comes three holsters:
A Galco Deep Cover In-The-Waistband holster with injection molded kydex clip - (My personal favorite as it is so comfortable).
A kydex custom formed ITW holster.
A Bagmaster nylon holster with magazine pouch.

This pistol has just had a complete tune-up by Para Ordance factory, deep cleaning, bench and range testing. They updated and replaced:
New Recoil Spring Guide
Recoil Spring
New Trigger Return Spring
New Slide Stop

Outside of some minimal carry wear this is like getting a brand new pistol for over $200 less than they retailed for, plus all the extras.

I would prefer Face-to-Face, but am willing to ship if necessary. If you buy it in person I will include a box of target rounds or two for free. Just need to see a Concealed Carry Permit and Driver's License.

I am routinely in Northern Colorado (Fort Collins), Eastern Idaho, as well as Northern Wyoming. Happy to work things out as necessary.

Vz58 aren't aks. They are much smaller, lighter, softer shooting than a stamped AK but built on a stronger milled receiver and can be fed with stripper clips due to open top design. The czechs know their firearms and told the ussr pre cold war that they would not be converting to the ak47. The vz design was originally designed for a larger battle rifle round but shrunk to accomodate the ussr's desire for 7.62x39.

About this gun -- won it on a gunbroker auction a few years ago. I bought it very slightly used, turns out it was from Tom Oprey who had a huntin' show on TV, I guess -- was on a network I don't get. Anyway, said he took it on a hunt to South America, and that's probably the only time it was used. The Hawkeye didn't come out until about 2006, and I think I've had it about 4-5 years, and it's just been sitting in the box in the closet. Not new, but in very good condition. I don't have to sell, but just wondering if this wildcat would have any interest. Let me know if your interested -- Thanks!
