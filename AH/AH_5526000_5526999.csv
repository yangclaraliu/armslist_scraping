I am selling my mark iii 22/45 for $150 because it is having issues and i have given up on it! I just had the frame cerakoated in burnt bronze, had the barrel threaded and front sight moved back, then got the magazine disconnect bushing and installed it. And now besides the fact that it was always a pain in the butt to disassemble and reassemble, here are the issues im having:1. The bolt release switch doesn't release the bolt when the bolt is locked back.2. The bolt has to be tapped to close it.3. The magazines are a pain in the butt to insert and remove.4. The magazine release button doesn't lock fully when the magazine is inserted, making it hard to release the magazine, and then you still have to pull the magazine out!5. When the hammer IS locked back with saftey off and you pull the trigger, nothing happenes!I don't know if it was the cerakoting, the magazine disconnect, or just something i did wrong, but i am done! I just figured i would let someone else have it at a good price and they could spend a little more and get it running right and still be a better price then at a store. You must pick up in bremen. No exceptions! I always get offers on armslist posts from people wanting me to drive to Indianapolis and it is just not gonna happen. But, since it doesn't work right i won't make you do any paperwork on it. It is first come, first serve, so any questions don't hesitate to ask!

I’ve used NcStar scopes for years, and never had to replace one. Not even on a .50BMG. This rifle is not the light weight carbine you used in the service. It’s the heavy, stand your ground weapon the guy over your head used when you were under fire. This rifle in the hands of someone who knows what to do with it is capable of sub-moa shoots out to 1200 yards. If you’re a hunter of four legged prey, make sure you have a good stand to use this one in. The weight soaks up almost all of the recoil, so anyone can use it, even a young teenager just learning about long distance shooting. My price is firm, I really don’t want to sell this one. NO SHIPPING, NO PAYPAL, NO BULLSHIT. If you’ve been saving your tax money for something special, this is it.

Before sig brace came around. It took me a year to find one. Have 2 now. One is now SBR'd. I installed a side folding pistol tube (was not easy). Also has shockwave blade and MFT cheek saddle combo. This configuration is legal. Atf responded to the exact setup. Still classified as a pistol. Will come with standard a2 muzzle (this is my qd for suppressor). Would like to keep it local. Possible trades. Message for more pics. This is my funnest and cheapest weapon to shoot.

Approx 100 rounds fired through gun, mix of 38 and 357. Excellent condition - one little wear mark from the cylinder opening and closing on the black finish of the frame. Otherwise I can find no blemishes. This was my wife's carry gun. Bought brand new by her, she chose it because the extra weight of the 357 model (steel frame versus the aluminum frame of the 38 LCR) coupled with the factory Hogue Tamer grip made for a soft shooting gun using 38 special ammo. I was the one who had to fire some .357s through :). Either ammo is quite controllable IMHO - though obviously full-power 357s have a bit of snap ;). Comes with all original packaging, original factory Tamer grip, second Hogue boot grip, Safariland RH pocket holster, and RH Desantis belt holster, four Bianchi speed strips, one Safariland speedloader, and two HKS speedloaders. Also including all my remaining 38 ammo - 27 rounds of Hornady 158 gr XTP HPs, 10 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 135 gr +P short barrel HPs, 39 rounds of Perfecta 158gr FMJ, 20 rounds of Geco 158gr LRN, and 19 rounds of Fiocchi 148gr full wadcutters.$475 for the package.
