I have up for sale/trade a Diamondback DB9 9mm 6+1 carry pistol. this is a great little gun and is actually smaller than my PF9. I got it in the hopes that my fiancee would like the size/feel (she hated my PF9). Long story short, she did not like the feel and is still in love with an LC9, CM9, or other single stack, but wider grip 9mm. I would trade for a Taurus 709 slim, lc9, or possibly others depending on your offer. So, that being the case, we are looking to sell this one, or trade it for a gun she would like more. (or for that matter any other gun as long as it is of equal, or close to equal in value. I traded for this gun from a guy who had put 100 or so rounds down the pipe. He said the gun operated fine and had not given him any problems. This gun is black in color and will come with the factory mag, factory case, a pocket/waistband holster, and lock. This gun does not show any signs of heavy wear and operates smoothly. I would keep it myself as a backup carry if I wasnt on a mission of sorts to get her one she loves. I can shoot pictures via cell. Just shoot me a  text at REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. I am open to trades of any kind firearm related. Just shoot me the offer and we can got from there. All trades will be considered. I also am willing to add cash for the right gun as well. 



I've also got a Springfield XD9 Subcompact, a 1911 Compact 45 acp, and a Huglu shotgun for trade/sell as well. If you want to get more than one I will be more likely to cut a better deal!

thanks for looking

I've used this rifle for the past two years (~500 round through it) and as I've been getting more and more into long distance it is just not keeping up out past 800 yards. That said it is spot on out to 600 yard and I've made several 800 yard shots with it as well so it is no slouch, just not built for that distance. Base LR-308B, 2x 19 round mags and Upgrades include:

Geissele SSA trigger
Magpul PRS Stock (extra pad on end for prone shooting)
Slashes Heavy Buffer and spring
PRI Adjustable Gas block
Ergo Grip
Gas Buster charge handle with large grip
Barrel threaded 5/8-24 for suppressor and thread protector
YHM Picatinny Riser

One thing I will say is this, the rifle does not like ammo over 168gr (at least match ammo). The chamber is pretty tight so over the years it may loosen up or you could have it reamed out a bit, but I wanted to make sure you know this up front so there are no surprises. Also neither the bipod or the muzzle brake from the picture are included. I'm firm on the price so please don't bother offering less, i'll just keep it if it doesn't sell. Thanks."

There is some shrinkage along the buttplate and it is worn along the finger grooves on the left side where a cavalryman would have had it slung across his back while riding.  There is a small 1-2 inch crack in the handguard up near the front sight.  This is a decent shooting rifle at 100 yards.  Metal is good with some finish loss and patina...no rust or pitting.  Bore is not perfect...but rifling is strong.  It is equipped with a folding bayonet.  Mum is ground.  I do not know if this is a numbers matching rifle as I believe the numbers are matched by assembly number on the bottom of the receiver which is in the stock.

This year Colorado was ground zero in the fight for freedom and fell victim to some of the most extreme attacks on our Second Amendment rights in the nation.

And your state Senator, John Morse, led the charge in the Colorado Senate, blaming Colorado’s law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen for the actions of criminals. Senator Morse was instrumental in the passage of several anti-gun bills during the 2013 legislative session, including legislation to impose a “gun tax” on the transfer of every firearm in Colorado, even between family and friends.

Even though these measures are now law, the fight has just begun and you can make a difference.

So I figured I would offer up my gunsmithing services, and no I am not licensed but I don’t need a peace of paper that said I know how to work on guns I let my work speak for itself. I can thread most any barrel so long as there is no front sight because then I gets a little more tricky, I special in nagant and other older rifels but the proses is the same.  I do not use a kit or anything like that I find them to be unreliable that kind of work MUST be done on a lathe centered to the rifling on the inside of the barrel not the outside and that’s what I do. so if you want to put a muzzlebrake or a suppresser on a rifle or a pistol just let me know what you got and how you want it done and I will give you a price I am not looking to rip anyone off that's why I started doing this in the first place.   I can also do other if you wish turn down bolts for nagants and what have you. if you guys have any questions feel free to ask.
