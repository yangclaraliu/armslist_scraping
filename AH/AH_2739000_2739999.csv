The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs."

Wanted to check out the AR platform so I picked it up and made a few modifications and added a few things; I've shot it a few times and its run 100% (including with steel case ammo), but in the end I'm really just a handgun person and I don't think I'll get enough use out of it to justify keeping it.

As stated it's a DPMS Panther, has a carbine length gas system, 1:9 twist on the barrel and is chambered for both 5.56/.223.  It has a brand new, and as of yet, unfired on, set of matching OD green Magpul furniture, but it will also include the factory DPMS stock if wanted, as well as a quad rail and vertical foregrip.  Didn't like the look or feel of the quad rail personally which is why I went with the Magpul, but everyone's tastes are different.  Will come with iron sights and a brand new 4x scope, nothing special about it but its very solid and seems to be reliable.
Will also include 6 mags, 4 metal 30 round mags, 1 30 round Magpul mag and 1 20 round magpul mag.  I also have 270 rounds of ammo, 220 rounds of steel case .223 and 50 rounds of Hornady Vmax.

I've got about $1000 into the package, but I'm mainly looking to trade.  I love the Springfield XD platform so I'm primarily interested in an XDm 9mm of any size+cash, ammo, extra mags or an assortment of the three.  I already have an XD40 so not interested in another one and I'm not looking for a .45 right now.  Might consider an XD9 service+cash and/or ammo, but I havent had an XDm yet, so that's what I'm mostly interested in.  I've been looking for something pocket sized for summer carry such as a Kel Tec Pf9 or P3AT, Ruger LCP, Beretta Nano or something similar as well, so would consider an XD along with something in this class.  Not interested in other rifles or shotguns for trades.

I've been wanting to get into reloading for a long time too so would be interested in a COMPLETE reloading setup (presses, turrets, dies, measures, tumblers, etc)+cash or firearms to even out a deal.

The ONLY non firearm related trade I would consider would be for a motorcycle, looking for something along the lines of a Kawasaki Ninja 500 or 600 or an older metric cruiser 750cc's or larger.  Must be in good running shape with a title if you want to go this route, no projects.  Know it might be a long shot but just thought I'd throw it out there.

Piston-driven gas system keeps hot, dirty gases out of the chamber for longer life, more reliability, and less cleaning.  Compatible with any mil-spec AR15 lower, just pull the pins on your lower, drop it in, throw in a full mag, and it's ready to rock and roll. Upper receiver and BCG are coated in NP3 finish which needs little to no lubrication and cleans with the wipe of a rag, no solvents needed. Fully legal 14.5"" fluted barrel with a pinned flash suppressor and full monolithic tactical POF P-11SX quad rail. This is the perfect round for hunting or self-defense, offering a compact package close to the size of 5.56, but with the knockdown power close to a .308 Win. You cannot buy a more accurate, reliable, or higher quality upper than POF anywhere! Also have the matching NP3 lower which I might be talked into selling. Can email additional pics upon request. Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction. No FFL needed, can be shipped right to your door!"

Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you.

The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

(so the sights are calibrated for 5, 10, 15, 20, & 25 yds.)  This rifle is in excellent condition tho it has been cleaned & freshened up (the stock re-coated for protection of the wood) with a dull-oil finish to duplicate the original.  It was not sanded, so the stock retains it's original dings & divots from the past.  The metal parts exhibit some surface rust, and likewise has been cleaned-up and re-oiled for protection, but not re-blued, so it retains it's original finish.  The receiver bears the Czechoslovakian crest, as well as the mfr's. markings:  Mfr.--  ""Ceska Zbrojovka"", the gunmaker/designer (?)--  ""A.B. Praze"", the model: ""Vz35"", and the serial No.: ""2291"".  This is a fully functioning and accurate weapon--  In fact, I found it being used as a ""pest-control gun"" by a retired, local farmer; and, have shot it several times myself, including just yesterday (2/24/14), laying 10 shots (off-hand) in a quarter-sized group at 8 yds., with the BBs virtually, fully penetrating the 8 layers of my bullet trap.  I have seen  similar examples of this gun listed on Gunbroker for $500 and $600, and have read blogs discussing the actual sale of another similarly described example for $450, and yet another lesser one for $400...

I paid $640+tax for the gun, 

The gun has around 500 rounds through it, and I also installed a ""D"" spring, which is the hammer spring from the DAO model that drops the DA/SA trigger weights from around 12/6 to closer to 8/5.

I still have the stock spring if for some reason you choose to reinstall it, as well as an extra ""D"" spring that I will include with the gun.

When I bought the gun new, after I got it home I notcied it had a few ""dings"" around the muzzle-end, I looked it up online and this is a fairly common issue with Beretta.

It is just through the Bruniton finish and stops at the parkerizing underneath.

It's not very noticable, just mentioning it for full disclosure. I included pictures. I'm sure a touch-up pen would take care of it, I just didn't have one. Armslist only let me upload 3 pictures, if you want more of the muzzle end I'll text them to you before we set up a meeting.

Also have 350 rounds of FMJ's I will throw in for 50 if you buy the gun.

No trades, located in Russellville and don't want to drive further than Conway or Fort Smith to meet up. LOCAL SALES ONLY, WILL NOT SHIP.

""The modern SIG SAUER® pistol story began with the P220®. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

Not to mention the 6 other times noone showed up. Many people on here are simply amazing. Less than a year ago a deal was a deal and if someone couldn't make it, they let you know before you drove 120 miles. Ok, enough ranting. This is a VERY rare version of the bulldog with the bobtail hammer so you can fire it in single action but it carries like a hammerless. It is hard to price as all that I can find either have a full hammer or none.
Truly power in a compact size. This is an older model Charter Arms 44 Bulldog. I It is in near perfect shape with one small little scratch near the end of the barrel. Also has an in waistband clip on it. Great shooting gun. You would have to see to believe how concealable it is. Also has original wood grips that comes with it. Also, for $375 I will throw in 35 rounds of Hornady critical defense and I may have some plinking ammo. Will sell gun alone for $350. Just email if interested or text at 615-476-two thousand.
