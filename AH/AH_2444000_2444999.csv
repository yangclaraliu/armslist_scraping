The gun comes with the original box and paperwork, and one magazine. The gun was manufactured in 1978 (see picture). Concerning the condition, the gun is exceptional. There is a couple small handling marks on the gun, including: One very small surface scratch on the front left hand side of the grip just behind the serrations, on the very front of the right side of the slide, and a couple imperfections in the bluing on the right and left side of the slide behind the rear serrations. Those are very hard to see without looking in the correct lighting. However, for the age of this gun, it is in VERY good condition"

P/N ITP-500C incorporates lessons learned with Aiming Lights in Desert Storm, other combat operations, and extensive field evaluation, plus production experience with over 50,000 US Military standard aiming lights. The result is a dual beam multi-function laser, which combines the utility and operational effectiveness of aiming lights and illuminator/pointers in a singe device.


Separate Aiming and Illuminator Beams. Both beams are adjustable in elevation and windage.
Aim spot can be centered in illumination area.
Illumination beam is able to focus from a pinpoint spot to wide-angle flood.
Pointer ranges can exceed 10 miles.
Various diffusers available for customized light shaping.
Compact, Durable, and Lightweight.
Uses 2 AA batteries.
Waterproof to 66 feet.
Meets all military environmental requirements
Operation
The ITPIAL features a unique switching capability for both gun mounted and hand
held operation. A fully integrated low profile Mode Selector Switch is conveniently
located for ambidextrous operation and is designed for ease of use even under zero light conditions. The switch allows the operator to select one of six modes:
AN/PEQ-2
OFF
AIM – LOW
AIM – HI
ILLUMINATOR
DUAL-LOW
DUAL-HIGH

The AN/PEQ-2A model incorporates a safety block over the switch that prevents the user from switching the mode switch into High Power.

Low power is eye safe* and is useful for force on force training and to preclude blooming in close combat engagements, while high power enables engagements or training at extended range and in high light conditions. The Infrared Target Illuminator/Pointer/Aiming Laser beam can be adjusted from a 0.5-mrad beam for long range pointing to a 10° circular illumination beam. A variety of lights shaping diffusers are available for creating wider illumination angles.
The ITPIAL is the only device of its kind to have two independently adjustable beams.
The ITPIAL has two sets of Azimuth and Elevation adjusters that allow the operator independent adjustment of both laser beams.

The ITPIAL is equipped with an integral push button FIRE switch, which provides convenient operation in the hand held mode. This single button switch enables the
operator to activate the ITPIAL in either momentary or steady on modes.
When weapon mounted the ITPIAL can be activated using a variety of remote switches.

Depending on the weapon and the preference of the user, “push button” or membrane remotes of various lengths can be supplied. All switches quickly attach to the weapon and provide for convenient fingertip operation of the system, and all switches withstand demanding military environments.

Performance
The ITPIAL is a highly durable, lightweight device manufactured with advanced engineering polymers and composites for maximum utility and durability.
The ITPIAL incorporates an advanced electro-optical system comprised of two index
guided laser diodes, diffraction limited micro-lens assemblies, and unique full logic microprocessor controlled electronic drivers.

Weapon Attachment
The ITPIAL is easily attached to all US Military Standard direct fire weapons and the AT4 Rocket Launcher with standard brackets. The ITPIAL attaches to the various brackets with a single thumbscrew. The ITPIAL can be removed and reinstalled on its bracket without loss of zero.

""Astra A-100 standard Spanish 9mm Double-Action Autoloader Pistol. The Astra A-100 is the latest in a series of modern autoloader pistols from Astra. Its slab-sided appearance is similar to that of the Swiss SIG-Sauer range (described later in this chapter), and it operates on a similar recoil-driven mechanism. The hammer can be lowered on the loaded chamber for carrying. The firing pin is completely disengaged from the action, except at the moment the trigger is pulled. This means that even if the hammer accidentally falls, the pistol will not fire. This redundant system ensures that an accidental discharge is nearly impossible, making it a popular design with law enforcement.""

I believe that is what the 336 model was called in earlier production, just due to the fact that the Gun Blue Book Value lumped both of these models together.  Based on the serial number I believe it to have been built in 1991. This was one of the guns of my uncle and has been is closet last 15-20 years.  I added the weaver rails that you can still use iron sights instead of scope if you want.  The scope is a NcSTAR 3-9x40.  I have not shot this rifle but all of the actions work, and it feeds and unloads perfectly.  

Also have 100 rds of Remington Brand 30/30 ammo listed for sale that can be added to the deal for $100.

MSRP: $455.00
OAS Price: $326.78 
Sale: $279.93

Designed for law enforcement officers, the rechargeable R1 Lawman™ LED flashlight features a maximum output of 750 lumens, and head and tailcap switches that are user programmable. This dual-fuel capable light also has the ability to run on either its included rechargeable lithium-ion (li-ion) battery or two disposable or rechargeable 123A cells. The Lawman’s precision micro-textured reflector produces a smooth, wide beam with extensive reach and generous peripheral illumination, perfect for a broad range of police and security applications including temporarily blinding opponents. 

The Lawman’s tactical tailcap switch activates the 750-lumen output—press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. If programmed by the user to do so, pressing the tailcap switch three times rapidly will activate the high-intensity strobe mode. A separate click-type head switch lets you access three light levels: high (750 lumens), medium (150 lumens), and low (15 lumens)—or it can be programmed to activate high output only.

It has a short stroke push rod piston operating system making it more reliable and cleaner than the standard AR platforms. 

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its 16"" chrome-lined, phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail forend and barrel, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available. The SIG516 Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol grip. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the Sig Sauer innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the Sig Sauer proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO's Over the Beach test. It has a free-floating M1913 quad rail, and the the top rail is optic-ready with Sig Sauer flip-up iron sights.

I would recommend watching the Sig 516 Torture Test video on Youtube.

This is a great gun for home defense.  It holds 8 2 3/4 inch shells in the magazine tube and one in the chamber for a total of 9 shells!!  That's pretty amazing!  If your looking for a home defense shotgun that has similar qualities of a benelli but for half the price, this is it!  This gun is highly reliable and will not dissappoint.  It has been kept in a safe with a dehumidifier for the last year since it was purchased on an impulse buy. The only reason I am selling is because I own several home defense shotguns and need the cash.

-maybe, a glock 17 gen 4 only with night sights. I'm only intersted in the gen 4 g23 or g17 in glock format, no 34s, 19s (already have 2), etc...

The Witness Full Size Steel pistol incorporates several unique design
features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. The
ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points
more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile
pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore,
further enhancing accuracy, and the Wonder finish features a polished steel
slide.

It is model #19471 that fits Wood Stock Shotguns: Fits Models 870, 1100, and 11-87 (2004 or newer), including Super Magnum models that came with the R3 or SuperCell Pad as original factory equipment. Will not be a ""perfect fit"" for models that did not have the R3 or SuperCell Pad as original factory equipment. Designed for 12 Gauge only. 

Here is some commentary from the Amazon website:
The result of 10 years of rigorous R&D by the top recoil-suppression experts in the industry, the Remington SuperCell Recoil Pad is the world's most efficient inhibitor of kickback energy. So potent, in fact, it single-handedly helped our Model 870 generate up to 54% less recoil than our leading competitors' autoloading shotguns with factory pads. 

Using a complex matrix of millions of SuperCells, the advanced polymer construction harnesses and releases energy over a much longer time period. Rearward force of your gun is reduced from a kick to a gentle push and muzzle travel is diminished, resulting in the softest shooting experience possible. All from a pad that's extremely lightweight, durable and enhanced with a smooth surface for rapid gun mounting. 

Will ship 1st class postage at cost if needed.  Email your phone number and I will call you as I do not respond to 1st time emails due to creative question asking spam.

The 37A is considered probably the best single shot shotgun ever made. Teh 28 G is very hard to find and I have seen them on Gun Broker for over $600. The .410 would be the next most valuable with guns in Good condition going for $300 or more. They decrease in value as the guage gets larger.

This rifle has never been fired and includes factory box. 

This is the very desirable, nearly impossible to find new, very limited edition Remington Model 700 200 year anniversary of Eliphalet Remington in 30-06 with a 22"" barrel made in 1993 and carefully vault stored ever since. To celebrate the 200th Anniversary, Remington pulled out all the stops and fitted a collectors grade stock on this rifle in truly spectacular, ultra highly figured fiddleback maple finished in unstained natural maple high gloss finish with a Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, generous skip line cut checkering both on the pistol grip and for end, black caps on the for end, pistol grip and on the butt stock which wears the Remington logo. 

The pictures simply can't show the true beauty of the wood. The stock has a 3D, holographic effect to the exquisite fiddleback grain as you look at it from different angles. The rifle includes a Leupold Vari X II 3-9x40 scope. Being a Model 700 BDL it has the factory Remington open sights installed with the front having a removable hood and the rear being adjustable for windage and elevation. The magazine has a hinged floor plate that has a gold filled etching paying homage the 200th anniversary of the company's founder and the metal work has a rich, deep blue gloss finish which looks superb with the gorgeous maple stock. Also, note that this rifle does NOT have the silly locking bolt shroud as some later 700's do. As you would expect on a NIB rifle there is no wear on the bolt face."

Product Information
Shop more Lee products The Lee Auto Prime XR Hand Priming Tool is the updated version of a time tested classic. The XR has been designed to work with every brand of primer and features the patent pending ""elevator pin"" which safely separates a single primer from the tray reducing the likelihood of tray detonation. The XR uses the same body and shellholders as the original but the rest of the components have been improved or replaced. Some of the upgrades include an unbreakable comfort curve lever and large square trays that accept all brands of primer boxes with slide on covers for large or small primers.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

It is marked as a factory test fire (from the Kahr website: Q. What does the ""U"" on the trigger guard of my pistol mean? A. If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

With a 25-year track record of reliability, durability and performance in the field, the simple and ecomomical pistols of Ruger's P series are handguns you can trust in adverse conditions. The Ruger P345 .45 Auto Pistol surrounds its stainless steel barrel with a rugged blued chrome-molybdenum steel slide. Ruger desigers keep the P345's weight down with a lightweight, black, custom-compounded polymer grip frame with a built-in picatinny rail for laser sights and other accessories. And, like other P-series guns, this pistol strips down easily into five major subassemblies for cleaning and maintenance, without any special tools. High visibility, drift adjustable, 3-Dot sights provide quick and easy target acquisition. Easy to reach, ambidextrous manual safety. Contoured and checkered grip panels, front strap, and backstrap for sure grip.

Browning and his brother commenced making the rifles by hand in their second-floor workshop in Ogden, Utah, with limited success.
In 1883, Thomas G. Bennett, Vice-President and General Manager of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, traveled to Ogden and negotiated the purchase of the single-shot design, as well as the prototype of what would become the Model 1886 lever-action – the beginning of the fruitful 20-year Winchester-Browning collaboration. Winchester's engineers made some improvements to Browning's design, including angling the block at six degrees to create a positive breech seal, and released the rifle as the Model 1885. Two popular models were made, the so-called Low Wall which showed an exposed hammer, firing less powerful cartridges, and the so-called High Wall for stronger cartridges whose steel frame covered most of the firing hammer when viewed from the side; but both were officially marketed by Winchester as the Single Shot Rifle.
It was produced principally to satisfy the demands of the growing sport of long-range ""Match Shooting"", which opened at Creedmoor, New York, on June 21, 1872. Target/Match shooting was extremely popular in the US from about 1871 until about 1917, enjoying a status similar to golf today, and the Winchester company, which had built its reputation on repeating firearms, had in 1885 challenged the single shot giants of Sharps, Remington, Stevens, Maynard, Ballard[disambiguation needed] et al., not only entering the competition, but excelling at it, with Major Ned H. Roberts (inventor of the .257 Roberts cartridge) describing the Model 1885 Single Shot as ""the most reliable, strongest, and altogether best single shot rifle ever produced.""[1]

I have an AK47 ""project"" that I'd like to sell. I'm not well versed in gunsmith work and do not have the tools, nor know what I need to know to repair it. A friend built it years ago, I've only put about 40 rounds through it in all this time.  No rust. The issue is that it jams on extraction. It is accurate, but jams every round. A similar unit built with same parts had the extractor filed and it functioned 100% after this. I don't have the equipment to do this, or knowledge and can't seem to find a gunsmith in my vicinity who can.  It has a Tapco trigger, the stock is from my Saiga 762. Comes with 30 round mags, 3 of them. Asking $300.  With a little work this could be worth a lot more.  Reach me at REDACTED

Note on manufacturer - I'm not completely sure it is a Zastava."

Lightly used, very well taken care of, upper receiver. Can't beat the price for a 6.8 SPC.

This package is literally complete and ready to shoot. I know what the current ""NEW"" price is online. I keep up with prices just like everyone else. This is a practically brand new upper, that comes with a bit more swag than Bushmaster is throwing in, for a generously lower price.

Price is set/firm. I won't respond to ""negotiations"" or ""offers"". They will simply be ignored, and sent to junk mail so that I won't be bothered twice."
