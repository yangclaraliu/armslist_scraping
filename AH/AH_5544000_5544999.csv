KRISS Vector CRB Gen. 2: Carbine / Semi. / 16"" barrel / M4 stock / 13 rds / .45ACP / FDE

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16Ã�Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

That does not mean I'll be further lowballed, I'm already lowballing myself enough and I won't drive all over the state to lose even more money, this is the bottom dollar you come get it price, no excuses no exceptions, period. With all that said heres the break down with the prices I have in it. I've only had the chance to put 30 rounds down range and it preformed flawlessly and hit exactly where it was pointed every time.  Anderson assembled upper with 10.5 inch chrome lined 223 wylde barrel with key mod handguard and bird cage. $500 Anderson hand matched lower, no play in the receivers, milspec LPK, anderson buffer and tube, really nice trigger feel, no grit, breaks nice and short reset. $250 Magpul BAD lever $30 Fab defense mag well funnel/grip $25 Ergo grip with storage compartment $15 KNS anti walk/rotation gen 2 dog bone hammer and trigger pin set $30 Shockwave blade pistol stabalizer $55 Steel flip sites(not cheap pot metal sites) $$50 Add it all up and I'm just shy of a grand into this and it's well worth every penny of that. I have more than one custom AR pistol though so I'm willing to part with this one to fund another purchase and I know I won't get all my money back but $800 is more than fair and as low as I'm willing to go. I'd much rather hang on to it and lose out on the other deal rather than take any more of a loss than I'm already offering. I've been jerked around and low balled enough, don't expect me to play nice if you try it again. Just fair warning."

These pistols were based on the Browning M1903 and were the standard military sidearm of Sweden during WW1 and also WW2, originally manufactured to fire the Browning 9x20MM Long. They were later easily modified by the US importer to shoot the more common .380ACP, known in Europe as the 9MM Kurtz/ Corto/ or Short. This particular pistol is in excellent condition, manufactured about 1930 with inspector Gustaf Bjorkenstam's initials under the royal crown and serial numbers identify it as being assigned to the 6th Infantry Regiment. The barrel is shiny, appears to be practically unfired and comes with the original military holster, three magazines, lanyard and cleaning rod. Recoil spring and magazine springs are still very strong and the pistol will fire the .380 without fail."

Crosman is a custom job, it comes with the following:-Steel breech kit: extra accuracy and you can mount...- A fixed 2X power scope-A silencer. Putting this on you sacrifice a bit of power, but it's only as lound as a flyswatter hitting a counter.Both come with some ammo and a nearly full case of cartridges. I'd like to sell both together. The PPK is great training for trigger fingers- very realistic heft. Hell, both are great to introduce someone to pistol shooting or to just customize into something cool. Will ship to any legal state for additional charge.Thanks for reading."

It is my understanding that this model was indeed used at the very end of WWII, but they were very present through out the Korean War. Verification of correct part types and markings was done using the following references: 1) M1 Carbine by R.C. Larson (the best single resource by far!); 2) The M1 Carbine III, by J.C. Harrison; and 3) U.S. M1 Carbines, Wartime Production, by Craig Reisch. There are also the ubiquitous War Baby tones by Ruth (volumes I, II & III), but they are mostly history, excessively detailed and hard to use as a collector's tool. This carbine is a shooter, with M2 stock, and M3 hand guard, all parts are correct types for build month and year and date of acceptance by the military. All parts are correct for the manufacturer. The rifle comes with a 30rd mag. Barrel is the original with good ME and TE measurements, the bore is shiney and free from any pitting and frost. Original stock, hardware and finish. This rifle has been fully carefully maintained and comes ready to shoot. The Stock has the original type finish. All parts have their original finish, but wear from use during war time, as well as peace, is evident on all painted parts. CONDITION: Used/ Fully restored/ well maintained good condition. Crisp mechanics, correct military finish. Both surplus military rounds and modern Hornady ammunition have been fired through the rifle with full reliability and accuracy. This rifle is an old war horse and should be respected as such. If you know anything about this gun, you know how rare this combo is"
