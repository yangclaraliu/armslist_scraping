 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The rifle comes with (6) steel magazines, so if you have trouble finding magazines, this is a great way to get started. Included are (2) 40-round steel magazines and (4) 30-round steel magazines.

My original listing was for cash only, but I've had numerous requests to do a trade. I am looking for at least $250 to $300 cash out of this rifle. If you have a gun valued up to $400 you'd like to trade and put the rest in cash to make up the difference, I may be willing to consider it.

At this time, the trades I'm most interested in are a S&W M&P 15-22 .22lr in good condition + cash from you or a Kel-Tec PMR 30 .22 magnum + cash from you. I may consider a Ruger MKIII .22lr depending on the model (barrel length,etc) and the condition. Depending on what it is, I may consider other .22 pistols in LR or Magnum. I may also be interested in a Kel-Tec SUB2K Carbine in 9mm (Glock mags).

What I'm not looking for are hunting rifles, shotguns or ammo.

I just bought a Gunsite scout with the 18.5 inch stainless barrel. Great gun, but i am curious what kind of scope i should get for what i want out of the gun. i know the gun has a short barrel but i want to use it to hunt Deer and Coyotes. Should i go with traditional scope mount in regular spot? or should i use a scout scope in the forward mount. My concern is the zoom wont be great enough with a scout scope.? and as i am looking for scopes it is hard to look online ( because i have amazon gift cards) because i don't know what size the rings are that came with the rifle. What are you using on yours and for what purpose?   any help or suggestions would be great. thanks a lot armslisters."

The barrel is a 1:9 twist WASP 5.56 NATO barrel. From CMMG's Website:
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

This upper has fired every round put through it. Has standard wear with use.

Waffen Werks is a company that builds AK74 from matching Bulgarian parts kits. It has a U.S. made chrome-lined barrel and contains a tapco G2 trigger group. 

Included in this offer is 2 Plum Izhmash 30-round magazines. These are the true Russian magazines and have steel reinforced feed lips. 

Included in this offer is a Magpul MS3 sling that is coyote brown. 

Included in this offer is 180 rounds of 5.45x39mm 7N6 ammunition from 1981 produced in Russia at the 539 factory. 

Included in this offer is a Flambeau Safe Shot Single Gun Case.

I received the rifle new, fired 90 rounds through three magazines to ensure firearm + magazines work reliable. I have given one of the mags as a birthday gift to a buddy hence why only two available for this sale.  

Firearm was cleaned less than an hour after firing the 90 rounds of the surplus corrosive ammunition. 

As you can see from the pictures, the stock and handguard are wooden and require some refinishing to get them back to 100%, or you can throw new hand guards onto the rifle. 

I am interested in only serious offers, the price is firm for the amount of gear and accessories that will come with the rifle. 

If you are just interested in the rifle my bottom $ to justify selling it instead of just keeping it is $800.

I am willing to drive 1-2 hours to accommodate sale. 

Please refer to the pictures and if you have any additional questions shoot me an IM, thanks."

Made by Spanish firearms manufacturer Astra, the Constable is noted for being almost identical in appearance and function to the Walther PP-series pistols. The Constable has played an important role in a number of films as a stand-in for the PPK, most notably used by the main characters in the Martin Scorsese classics Taxi Driver and Good-fellas. The accurate, fun to shoot Constable uses a blow back design with a first-shot double-action trigger system. Astra adds a thumb-operated slide stop lever to the basic Walther design for added convenience. This pistol features fixed 3-dot sights, two-piece plastic grips, and a 7-round magazine. Its grips, metal, and bore are all in very good condition."

Eight miles east of Medicine Bow National Forest.  Two hours from north suburbs of Denver.
Perfect for those who just want to be left alone.  At this time there is only one occupied residence within 3 miles.

Ideally, my neighbors would be like minded folks who are thinking for when the SHTF and in the meantime, appreciate a weekend get-away to shoot lots of guns and be close to hunting, fishing, skiing and snowmobiling which are 30 minutes or less away.

There is a long distance gun range up to 600 yards (longer if you want it) developed on site, with more to come! Price starting at $1500/acre ($52,750 total)... and can be very negotiable to the right buyer (neighbor). I can finance w/ 20% down, 7% interest, 10 year term.  Monthly payment of $500 covers P/I and taxes which are $250/year.

I'm preferring to sell to folks outside of Albany County, Wyoming so that all owners have a 'destination visit' to their property. Hopefully, when you or I visit our property, there will not be things happening like a local company picnic at the gun range, or some kids being sent out to the property for the afternoon to ride dirt bikes all over the countryside, company picnics, excessive traffic on the gun range, etc. etc. such as might be the case with a local landowner living 15 miles away in Laramie.  I want to sell this property to somebody who will make it a destination as opposed to being an extended back yard.  I own the adjoining land, so I care about it.

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

As you can see from the pictures, it is truly brand new. I bought this a couple weeks ago. I havent fired a single round through it. I havent even put any ammo into the magazines. As you know this is the premier 1911 to have. I wish I could keep it but another firearm I've been looking for just became available to me. Therefore the wife says I can't have both. This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $40. I will only ship after payment has cleared.

927,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2045927,For Sale:  Walther P-38 nickeled (!),"Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States",$ 450,"Listed On: Friday, September 6, 2013",Handguns,Walther                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Pictures tell most of the story but not all. This is  a 1942 Walther P-38 made by Spreewerke with the ""cyq"" code markings. Serial numbers all match.  It is a superb shooter, and has had the feedramp polish so it will feed hardball and hollowpoint 9mm reliably. I regularly shoot empty shotgun shells  at 25 yards with it. After WWII, many of these GI bringbacks were nickeled since at the time they were not expensive and to 1940s and '50s eyes they were ""prettier"" in nickel. One thing about nickel is that it is tough, so the condition of the gun is really nice. All markings are there, including the Waffenampt (eagle/swastika) acceptance marks. When I got it, the seller told me it fed just fine. Well, let's just say he was optimistic. So I polished the feed ramp, cleaned and lubed it, and it now runs 100%. Bore is great, and it is accurate.  I am only selling it because I would like to buy a weird Swiss rifle. (If you have a really nice K31, let's talk, lol.)

I have it in a nice little case I put together to keep it from getting scratched,  since it is in great refinished condition. It comes with  one nickeled magazine,  one brand new P1/P38 magazine, and a superb reproduction 1942 P38 holster. These are all pictured. It also comes with the original brown WWII grips, but I thought this shiny nickeled gun was crying for some ivory grips, so I had a set of faux ivories made for it and aged appropriately. All in all, it came out pretty nice I think.

There are NO importer's markings on it, thank goodness. 

At any rate, if you want to be anonymous at the shooting range, this gun is not for you. But, if you would like something that has a bit of history, is reliable, accurate; and fun to look at and shoot, this may be something you will enjoy. Basically,  if you like '59 Cadillacs, this is your gun. Not just fun though. This is also a serious 9mm German fighting pistol.

If you want to have a look at it in person, contact me through Armslist with your email and phone number and we can meet up. I think you will like my gun when you see it. I know you will like it when you shoot it. Plus best of all, it is a practical piece of history, yet still cheaper than most of the plastic guns out there. Funny, it looks a lot like the $5,000 one on Gunbroker, lol. Check that one out.

It is the Express Magnum which is a little more difficult to find, not exactly sure they even still sell them.  Works perfectly. Is a good self defense gun since it is short and the ammo is cheap.  Has wood furniture. It has obviously been used, no big scratches or dents or anything of that nature.  Only normal wear and tear you would expect on a lightly used shotgun, but it is an 870 and they are built like tanks.

Mainly looking to do a straight up trade, not interested in selling it since it sits next to my bed for home defense and I would need something to replace it.  Really just trying to see what I can get for it to see if any options are worth it.  Please feel free to send me any and all offers, the worst I can say is no thank you, or if you have any questions.  I'd be willing to put up to 100 dollars in the trade but that's it and it would have to be for something I really liked.  You can also have all the ammo I have for it, which is probably only around 50-75 rds plus 5 slugs."
