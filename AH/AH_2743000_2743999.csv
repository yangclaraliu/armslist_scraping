Please ask as many questions as you deem nesasary  I thank you for your interest

Please have an ID for proof of age as I will NOT sell to a minor, also I please ask that you are lawfully allowed to own a firearm in Wisconsin."

An interim pistol is a pre-pilot test production gun that was hand built with new 3rd generation modifications there were less than 150 released for commercial sells
this is what became the 4506 but is still marked 645 also you will notice the red decocker dot is on the slide itself and when they were officially marked 4506 the red dot was moved to the frame this is a 1988 gun and was what Don Johnson carried as Crockett in the 5th & final season of Miami Vice not the 4506 despite peoples confusion the 4506 was not made yet comes with 2 factory all metal magazines not the cheap plastic ones these are far superior!
Also comes with a very rare Galco Jackass/Miami Right Hand shoulder holster with harness and cuff case  this is for both the smith and wesson 645 and the 4506 with the squared trigger guard 
nice leather still has plenty of life no dry rott still whatsoever soft and pliable shows normal scuffs and light wear from carry very common
snap and harness restraints in perfect working order
Galco does not make these anymore for these specific guns The Harness strap screws are still made and are very easy to get
Holster is marked Galco #192 LG FR AUTO 
I still carry my 645 and 4506 in these amazing holsters and believe they are far superior to what Galco is Making now
Please feel free to contact me & I can also provide more pictures
Again these are extremely rare and even more so with the holster
and 2 factory magazines
Asking $1400 I will consider all Serious Cash Offers 
need some funding for other things so now is the time to buy this listing will be taken down soon as I reach my goal
I would be interested in a Detonics Mark VI Combat Master Professional Model
Must be shipped to FFl or deal in person

The ONLY negative is there is a small plastic piece that fell off after a few shots. You can see it in the pictures. It doesn't effect performance at all, just a cosmetic flaw. I don't know why it fell off but Taurus said they will send one out for free. It comes with original box and everything that was in it , and 2 mags. I will also include snap caps and a box of Hornady steel match and half a box of Winchester self defense hollow points. 

Next is a PSE Rally Compound bow. It's set at 70 lbs and 27 inch draw. Can be adjust to whatever you like. I have literally shot it 2 times so it's brand spanking new. Comes with badass drop away rest, 3 prong sight, nice stabilizer, case, nicer arrows, and wrist sling.

This appears to be new magnifier that the customer didn't use.  The customer didn't have the original packaging, so it is magnifier only.  Come down and inspect in person!  We'll help you get it mounted if you want to bring your rifle down.

The Sightmark 5x tactical magnifier allows shooters to quickly acquire the target, and then move the magnifier out of the way without having to detach the unit. Inspired by military and law enforcement applications, the magnifier is designed for use in conjunction with holographic, collimated reflex, and other compatible weapons sights, giving the shooter the benefit of a reflex sight and scope in combination.
The magnifier increases the magnification of the accompanying sight, boosting sighting range and improving target recognition--especially at medium range distances. The Sightmark 5x tactical magnifier can assist in quick target acquisition up to 350 yards and accurate target shooting at 150 yards. The magnifier also features extended eye relief for comfort, a wide field of view, and high-quality multicoated optics for improved visibility and clarity.

The Sightmark 5x is compatible with most Picatinny and Weaver mounts, and is designed to work with EOTech, Aimpoint, Trijicon, and other brands. In addition, the magnifier's lightweight, waterproof, fogproof, and shatterproof frame provides durability in all elements.

If you know about scrubs they were early British made rifles used by the Brits in India than later sold to the Indian Forces. After the war and the British lost power in India, the India Army scrubbed the British Markings from the receiver and barrels and put a screw in the stock to match the no.1 MKIII they were producing. 

This rifle has the screw, but it serves no purpose unlike the Indian rifles. All matching numbers besides the magazine. The serial number is pretty low for a mass produced war rifle. Metal is in good shape, besides minor pitting on the left side of receiver. This rifle still has one Brit marking on the barrel. The bore has strong rifling. This rifle is a great shooter. The stock was refinished, and it is more glossy than satin. Has the Indian marks on the stock.

First off the tactical AK.
This AK is Romanian. Has a foldable stock, upgraded pistol grip, quad rail hand guard set (metal not the cheap plastic tapco crap), top scope rail mount, and a foregrip/bipod combo, the scope is a ncstar 3x9x42 with blue retical and and bullet drop compensator the scope also has a side laser, in addition there is another laser on the hand guard with a pressure switch on foregrip. It is completely cerakoted in black and zombie green.

The basic AK is just like you'd dig out of Vietnam. It is a Norinco has basic wood furniture, original pistol grip and cleaning kit that goes inside the stock. Has bayonet (not pictured) Has original adjustable sights that range from 100-1000m this gun is all original and in great condition

For everything else:
Let's start with the Mags:
(1) 75 round drum
(7) Metal 30 round Mags (don't think all are pictured)
(3) Polymer 30 round mags
(1) Polymer 20 round mag cerakoted green
(1) Metal 5 round mag
So 12 mags and 1 drum
I have 1800+\- rounds to go with it
Also have a bipod that will attach to a pictanny rail, an extra wood stock and some mag connectors. I might be forgetting some stuff but that should be enough. Would like to sell or trade as a lot but who knows I might split it up.

I have 2 guns for trade. Up first is my MasterPiece Arms 10SST in the mighty 45.ACP.
This guns a lot of fun to shoot and hell, it just looks badass. Especially in 45.
Has a few scratches but nothing major. Mine is the side cocking version which functions way better than the top cocking models.Nice rail on top to put some optics or a light onto. Functions great now that she's been properly oiled and has had a few hundred rounds down the pipe. Comes with one 30 rd mag. 
Second gun is a new Phoenix Arms HP25A pocket pistol. Holds 9+1. Small, light, reliable. Comes with ammo and holster. 

I'm looking to trade both of these guns for one pistol."

Its not entire level, and needs to be hit on a bench grinder and touched up with cold blue. Still patterns fine with Rem 00 buckshot. Also no bead, so its either point shooting or the barrel will need to be D&T for a bead.

Otherwise, it runs great and is overall in VG condition with some scratches on the receiver, wear on magazine tube, and some dings in the wood. Typical pump shotgun wear. Mechanically EX condition. Would make an excellent HD shotgun as is.

I'm looking to sell a U.S. Model of 1917 Winchester Serial No. 447293. I would describe the rifle as service grade, fully functioning, shoots more accurately that I was expecting (more accurately that I do), minor pitting in the barrel, all parts present except that the stock was ""sporterized"" in that the front (muzzle end) ~10 inches of wood was cut off, sanded down and refinished. I know that for the collector it will take a hit for whomever chopped the stock and for having some mismatched parts. I have test fired this gun and it definitely works and definitely hits what you're aiming at.

I am asking $350, preferably FTF in Northern Virginia.
I would accept trades of a Glock 19 (maybe a Glock 23, 3.8 XDM or M&P compact of any caliber) and would be more than willing to add cash to complete the trade.

For the hunter, I've attached pictures, for the potential collector, here is the run down of the markings from the muzzle to the butt:

The front sight has had the ears cut off but is marked ""W""

Just behind the front sight, there is a ""W,"" then a flaming bomb, then ""9-18""

Front sling attachment is marked ""W""

The side of the barrel, just before the chamber is marked ""RU322""

Top of barrel (at the chamber) is marked with a flaming bomb, three eagle's heads (both faded) under one there appears to be ""P-3?"" under another ""?-?0"" and under the third ""P-3?""

There may be a ""20 on the barrel but one of the eagle heads overlaps making it difficult to see.

There is a flaming bomb and two eagle heads on the receiver, under one of them is ""p.30"" and under the other is what looks like ""J-6""

The rear sight is marked ""W""

The bolt, firing pin and cocking piece are all marked with ""E"" and the cocking piece also has a flaming bomb and what looks like a ""U"".

The stock is marked ""6E"" in one spot, ""S"" in another, and has a couple of eagle heads with what looks like ""600"" under one.

The buttplate is marked ""W""

Those were the markings I found in a surface survey, if I need to break the rifle down further I can."

Upper is 14.5 inches with a Yankee Hill flash hider that I had pinned and welded for overall 16 inch length.  It has the standard A2 sight package with the fixed carry handle.  It is equipped with Magpul MOE handguard and forward handle finished in High Desert which is similar to ATACS AU pattern.  Stock and grip are OD Green.  Stock/buffer are Milspec and there is an ambidextrous single point sling mount in place of the buffer plate.   Also included are OD handguards and a drop in 2 piece quad rail with several sections of UTG OD rail covers.  Can swap everything out to black furniture if u want.  Includes one new and 4 used milspec 30 round mags.  Will also include and Otis military M4 cleaning kit new in the pack in desert/coyote tan.  This is not a Stag factory upper...I bought it several years ago on Gunbroker.  It has a chrome chamber and M4 feed ramps.  Has never been fired.  Email for a couple more pics...the pin/weld job finish is not perfect...gunsmith probably used a cold blue.  It is on the bottom of the suppressor and does not show much....I am sure u could touch it up with duracoat or something.  Not interested in trades at all...will consider reasonable offers.

With over 2 years of development and research using direct feedback from law enforcement,
military and civilian users we have created the absolute best 4 power magnifier available.
One of the main comments we heard was the fact there was not a quality 4 power magnifier
available with all the competitor brands only offering 3 power. Second was the ability to focus
the magnifier vs a fixed focus like the styles available on the market now. This along with the
new fixed and lock windage and elevation setting are combined to create this all new approach.

4x Magnifier Features:

    The Only High Quality True 4 Power Magnifier Available On The Market.
    6061 Hard Anodized Housing With Matt Black Finish.
    Swiss Optic Coated Lenses And Nitrogen Charging For Clear Picture Field.

    Mechanical Windage And Elevation Adjustment With Fixed And Locking Set Screws. Adjustment Is 100% Permanent Once Set And Locked.
    2 Setting Heights To Be Used With All Red Dot Or Holographic Optics Using The Supplied Spacer.
