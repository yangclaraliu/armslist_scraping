I had this valued ($2000.00-$2200.00) and info received from the New Collector's Board. They say this pistol was imported into the U.S. in 1923 and the way Germany got around the Versaile Treaty was by switching the way they used the serial numbers. Please see photo's and make your own judgment. This pistol is in very good condition. It currently has an after market 9mm barrel installed for pleasure shooting with 2 metal 9mm clips. It also comes with the original (matching serial numbered) 32 caliber barrel along with a period 32 caliber clip with wooden grip on end.

Willing to ship to FFL dealer or local sale with background check and transfer.This gun is extremely reliable and an absolutely fantastic shooting gun. If you didn't already know, Benelli makes some of the best shotguns out there, and as far as semi-autos go, this is one of the best for your money. Wish I could keep it, but I need the money for another toy. Only TRADE that I would be interested in would be for a nice xc full-suspension mountain bike."

I had this valued ($2000.00-$2200.00) and info received from the New Collector's Board. They say this pistol was imported into the U.S. in 1923 and the way Germany got around the Versaile Treaty was by switching the way they used the serial numbers. Please see photo's and make your own judgment. This pistol is in very good condition. It currently has an after market 9mm barrel installed for pleasure shooting with 2 metal 9mm clips. It also comes with the original (matching serial numbered) 32 caliber barrel along with a period 32 caliber clip with wooden grip on end.

This gun is in superb (museum quality) condition. The gun is silver plated and fully engraved by Gustave Young who was Colt's premier engraver from the 1850s through the 1870s. He is often referred to as the Picasso of engravers. His ""signature"" mark is the dog/wolf head (Pictures available). The gun's grips are ivory and it has all matching serial numbers. This gun was obviously a custom order gun made as a presentation piece. The back of the back strap was left blank where a persons name would have been engraved (Pictures available). I have been told the Confederacy ordered a small number of these Navy models at the beginning of the civil war to be used as presentation pieces. Because the serial number fits in that same time period it has been suggested that this could very well be one of those pieces? While we know very little about the history of this gun we do know it is extremely rare to find a silver plated Gustave Young engraved presentation gun for sale in this kind of condition.

Stock is made of wood with what I believe to be aluminum bedding/block. It was painted at some point as were the legs. Has adjustable check rest I believe is some form of plastic or kydex. Comes installed with what I believe is Badger bottom metal and uses standard AICS mags. Legs do swivel with option to tighten or loosen the swivel action. Stock is used and shows marks here and there but is totally sound. Free floating barrel holds my .90 barrel fine. Great stock and I like it alot but it's heavier than I would like.
