Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt.

After his son, Masayuki (3rd generation) has joined, he has started making his own knives (handmade custom knives). At the local knife shows, his unique Tactical knives have quickly received great reputations for it’s unique blade style and extreme durability and sharpness. His first blade steel preference is the OU-31 but he also uses D2, ATS-34 and VG-10. The blade durability, edge sharpness and longer edge retention of his knives are not only for the steel character, but also for his special Hamaguri-Ba (Japanese Convex edge famous for Katana) grinding. After polished the blade, he will use a special art etching process on the blade for non-glare finish, corrosion resistance and blade surface protectionEach knife comes with hand fitted Kydex sheath with Tek-Lok carrying device. You will be amazed with the outstanding blade grinding and cutting performance of Kiku Knives, when you actually use it. We would like you to experience and prove it, However, his custom knife production is very limited right now, as he still devotes most of his work for the blade grinding for several knife makers."

It's very fun to shoot, and I'm a little reluctant to get rid of it, but I have two and I don't shoot this one as often. It's just taking up room in the safe, so it's time to let it go. This way, someone else can enjoy the hell out of it. The pistol is in great condition, and fires with no problem whatsoever. I'm looking for $300, but I'm very open to trades as well."

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.  Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.  The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.  If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.
