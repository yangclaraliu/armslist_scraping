Ruger Police Service Six in .357 magnum , 4 "" BBL. , blue finish. It has a shiny bore with well defined rifling. There are no signs of erosion to the forcing cone or bottom of the top strap. The chambers are also shiny . The action is smooth in both single and double action with no binding, it locks up well when cocked with minimal cylinder movement in any direction and has perfect timing on all six chambers. There is no rust or pitting. It does have holster and honest use wear to the finish but shows no evidence of abuse inside or out. It wears Pachmayer Presentation grips which are in good condition. The round count is unknown. This is a very clean revolver inside and out that passed my own 30 step used revolver check list and functioned perfectly in all manners when test fired with four cylinders full of mid range ammo exhibiting good combat accuracy in double action.

It loads a 12 gauge ""shell"" that acts as a magazine for airsoft pellets. When pumped and fired it will blast out 3 pellets in a narrow cone. Despite being a ""shotgun"" this stylish airsoft armament is extremely accurate. The three pellets flying straight at high speed are guaranteed to hit your target and let you know they hit it.

My M3 is beautiful and I've never taken it out to dirty fields. It has stayed very well protected in its storage box. It has not been fired more than the occasional shot against a pellet trap. If you are interested in this unique airsoft you will not find a better piece.

Not only will it smoke your friends on the airsoft field, but it has proper Benelli M3 dimensions and can be used as a practice piece in place of an actual pump action shotgun.

There are plenty of youtube reviews. Go watch them and see for yourself.

I believe I have some extra ""shells"" and pellets that I can throw in. For a bit extra I can also through in a very nice black tactical shotgun vest made specifically for holding shotgun shells and slugs. Style.

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The stock is sound with no major blemishes, no dents or dings or anything. The oroginal charging handle was made of zinc I believe and they had a tendency to break so I replaced it woth an aftermaket steel handle. This little beauty shoots fantastic and is more accurate than a sporter should be. This one is Japanese made. Pretty neat that you can flip a switch and turn it from semi auto to single shot.

Description from Condor:
The Condor Summit Soft Shell Jacket is designed with a three layer integrated shell fabric technology with reinforcement on the forearms. The breathable shell wicks moisture from the body, prevents water penetration, while maintaining body heat. Underarm vent zipper to control temp, and multiple pockets are provided for utility and storage. Also available in a lighter version, the Summit ZERO, for warmer climates.
This durable, waterproof, lightweight, breathable fabric contains billions of microscopic pores smaller than a raindrop, but hundred times larger than a molecule of water. The triple layer combination wicks moisture, stops water from passing through, and circulates body heat.

Smith and Wesson discontinued the K frame revolvers because back in the 1980's they found that the small K frame revolver had trouble staying together when firing heavy 357 magnum loads extensively. The K frame revolver became a memory and something that could only be found on the used market - until now. With advances in metallurgy and Smith and Wesson's new ball-detent locking system the K frame has returned and is stronger than ever. The Smith and Wesson K frame is smaller and lighter than the popular L or N frame revolvers, and more suitable for carry or duty use and back in the day was very popular for target practice without needing a heavy revolver. The ball-detent locking system ensures that there will be no excess wear and tear on the revolver and no timing issues or abnormal warping/parts breakage. The model 66 is without a doubt a classic. Police officers carried it, gun owner's loved it, and untold thousands of people learned how to shoot with a model 66 Smith and Wesson. Now that the Model 66 legacy is alive again, you can add a classic to your collection that has a modern touch.

 EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

(The magazines had been modified to accept only 10 Rounds) The extremely compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide. The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe. The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13. Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users. Features: • Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life • Fluted chamber aids in extraction • All steel construction • Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator • Fixed barrel ensures accuracy • Trigger guard heatshield • Ambidextrous magazine release • Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function • Blued finish - HK P7M13 9mm pistol - Date Code : IG - HK factory Box with matching serial number - 2 HK factory 13 round 9mm magazines - Box, 2 Mags, and Pistol only!

The features of the new Kimber SIS have been selected with the job requirements of SIS and the training program of LAPD in mind. First, it is an ultra-reliable Kimber 1911 pistol. In .45 ACP, of course. Standard bushing and recoil-spring design–no full-length guide rods or bull barrels for the LAPD. The barrel is a Kimber match barrel, properly fitted to slide and frame. The trigger pull is clean and crisp, set in the five-pound region, and the solid trigger (aluminum, no extra holes) lacks an adjustable trigger stop.

The frame is checkered 30 lines to the inch, and the frame has the corners rounded. The sight is a specially modified Kimber fixed sight, with the front face squared off. The LAPD Academy teaches officers who need to do a one-handed slide cycle to do it by pressing the sight against their holster, duty belt or other convenient object. While members of the SIS do not work alone, and often use long arms, they specifically requested a rear sight that could be one-hand cycled.

Kimber, in laying out the pistol, figured a way to incorporate the “SIS” of the unit into the cocking serrations, If you look closely, you’ll see that the grooves are a stylized “SIS”.

On top of everything is the KimPro finish in dark gray over the stainless slide and frame. Why a baked-on finish on a high-end semi-custom gun? Well, Los Angeles is hot in the summer months. Sitting in plainclothes in their cars, it is a sure thing that officers will be sweating onto their sidearms, and no one wants a rusty blaster, now do they? It just doesn’t look right. And it might not work when you need it.

Molded and carved, New England Fowler form,  semi-Roman-Nose, Tiger-Maple fullstock with simple raised carving around the lock mortise and a finely fluted wrist. 

 The forestock and buttstock/wrist with patches of distinct “Tiger Maple” grain striping and the barrel-tang,  sideplate mortise and lock mortises with old filled repairs. Recycled, finely cast, European, brass furniture/mounts— of tradition mid-century 18th century form.  The buttplate with a scroll-engraved, long tang, (3) American-made sheet-brass barrel-form ramrod pipes; and the openwork embossed sideplate  with replaced sidebolts and some old damages/losses. 

The trigger-guard, en suite with a “rifle-type” bow and a finely embossed forward finial.

I have run 2 boxes (100 rounds) of 230 grain FMJ through it.  Not a single hiccup and the first 2 rounds made a figure 8 in the center of the bullseye (so gun is a heck of a lot more accurate than I am).  Gun purchased in July of 2013 and is in great shape.  Comes with everything it originally came with.  Only selling it to free up cash for another project and this gun really deserves to belong to someone who will shoot the heck out of it.  No lowball offers.  If I can't sell it for a fair price, I'll sell something else to fund my new project and keep this one.
Keep in mind this is the single stack Para, not the double stack which is known to need multiple trips back to Para to get them dialed in to function.  Also, this is the Elite series, not the less expensive ""expert"" model so please do not email me back saying you can but a new Expert model for much less than this.  That's true and if you want that level of features, buy a new expert.
Below is the info from the Para site.  
Out of the box and in your hands, never has the icon performed better. Starting with only the finest precision-engineered parts, each pistol is hand-assembled and fine-tuned for perfection by the most demanding, dedicated craftsmen in the industry. The result is a true classic without compromise, featuring the customgrade quality and timeless looks of a high-end 1911, plus a host of innovations first developed, and still done best, by PARA.
