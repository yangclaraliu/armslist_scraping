This barrel will have a stainless Wilson Combat bushing. From my understanding this means this barrel was made by S&W for a military contract as replacement barrels. 

Barrel 2) Marked Colt .45 auto just above the left lug, a P on the left lug, and a G in front of the lug with a small F above it. This barrel is parkerized and has a parkerized bushing w/ no markings. 

Barrel 3) Marked Colt .45 auto on the top of the barrel. The only other marking on this barrel is a small box w/ a C in it on the left lug. This barrel is also parkerized w/ parkerized bushing.

Semi-auto piston driven shotgun. Extremely durable, used by the Marine Corps. 18.5"" barrel. Tactical pistol grip stock. 4+1. Just moved and can't find the box it came in so just the new shotgun and the different chokes it came with. Extremely hard to find! For those who aren’t familiar with the M4, this is the same gun the U.S. Marine Corps are using. The M4 strays away from traditional and sometimes complex (not to mention dirty) gas-operated actions and utilizes its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operating system (ARGO). The ARGO system instead uses dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons to operate the action and was designed to handle everything from low power rounds to hard-hitting buckshot.

Its been sitting in my closet unused for years, so I see no need to keep it around.

It is in ROUGH shape, just to get that out there.  The stock in particular is in pretty rough shape with a large sliver of wood missing out of it directly under the receiver on the left side.  Still in good working order and firable, you just do so at your own discretion.  Has a dark bore but strong rifling and has the folding bayonet.  
Again, its still in working order its just ugly.  Would be a good canidate to be transplanted into a replacement or new synthetic stock and converted to a scout rifle.

Open to trades for other firearms (ONLY firearms considered for trades), and I'm not particular at all, handguns rifles or shotguns, just no .22's, I have enough already.

Colt Gold Cup® Series
The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard.

Armscor Precision International  Fire Storm 38 Special Revolver , hammerless double action revolver.... This is like new...  It has had less than a box of ammo through it.  Bought a few months back for my wife and she doesn't like the weight of it..  I tried explaining to her that the weight helps with the recoil when shooting it... She wants something with colors and lighter to carry.. Women.. LOL.

It shoots great.. easy to handle with standard loads.  Great conceal carry gun, no hammer to catch on a jacket or bag or where ever you wish to carry it.

It comes with everything you see in the pics.. gun lock, case, and paperwork.

 I have had two guitar experts inspect this, and sent photos of it to EBMM customer service. It is authentic, and has no serial number which means this is a prototype made in 1985. It's a one-of-a-kind with some real history, being 28 years old and being in great condition.

****UPDATE****
4 Collectors at the gun show this weekend has told me that there is nothing wrong with the finish on the rifle.  All 4 has told me not to re-blue in order to keep it in it's original condition for collection purposes.  The rifle is a post 64, made in 1981 and is in great shape for being that old.  Action is excellent, very smooth for that year of production and the wood finish other then minor marks is in excellent condition beautiful grain.  3 of the 4 gave me the same price range to sell it for and the last was higher, however I'm not changing that asking price, and going to leave the price low

Sig Sauer Model P239 9mm Luger DAK/DAO INCLUDES: (2)  8 round magazines, original Blue Sig case/box, and all paperwork. CONDITION: excellent as seen in pictures. USAGE: firearm is from 2004 when quality is/was undisputed- and fired but a few times over the years! NOTE: the gun is a ""single stack"" design of magazine, and is NOT a polymer frame, it's all metallic construction. No decocker, no safety DAO. Frame was made in Germany. This is an excellent CCW pistol. If it’s good enough for the Navy Seals and Delta that should tell you something about SIG quality.

Not in pictures but stock pistol grips have been replaced by black Hogue rubber wrap around grips.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HKs enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HKs enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures

P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.
