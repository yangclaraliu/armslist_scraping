I am opening this up to cash purchase as there is an item on here I want, and the guy doesn't want trades.....that being said... this is last bump and this listing will be up until Friday 4/11 then I am locking it back up in the safe....  Must have proof of good guy and legal to own.... If you don't have a CPL or WAC card, I will require a B.O.S for my records only. ***

Converted Saiga 12g - This gun was torn down and built/ fabricated from the ground up by a local gunsmith, all parts were sand blasted and coated with Moly-Resin (a Teflon impregnated baked on coating), top of the line parts for conversion, modified for left hand charge, Ace Skeleton stock, Chaos Rail, HK Sights,  barrel shortened with Tromix brake welded in place to make it just at legal length and a steel plate welded to back of receiver to take the punishment of rapid fire, bolt and slide were polished and gas ports modded, adjustable gas plug added. Silver weld was used to fill in all the markings (not serial) so there is none of the laser etched upc symbol that was so ugly on these. Total build was well over $2500 couple years ago when Saigas were on the cheap. Comes with 2 20rnd drums and a 12rnd drum. I've only put maybe 3 drums through the gun, have video so you can see it run. Just sits in the safe collecting dust..... Not in a hurry or in need of getting rid of it, just putting it up to see if anything cool jumps out. For me to build this again would be well over $3000

Trade Value or trade + cash is $2500 to $3000... Like I said, to build it again now would be over $3000 and a lot of time finding all the parts.

***Response to the emails I have been getting.......

1) I consider asking me what the ""lowest I'll take"" as rude and the same as low-balling..... I did my homework...You do yours and make me a REASONABLE offer based on it..... 

2) If you are serious and wish to see the craftsmanship to prove the value, just ask and I can meet up with you, but please be realistic on a meeting place.... I am not driving all the way to Olympia or Everett just to let you look at my gun. I work and go to school, so I have very limited windows to meet up so please be patient.

3) Don't just state that you can get one for $1000... yes you can get an unmodified Saiga 12 for $1000..... add the cost of parts, labor etc... for a conversion.... then compare a standard conversion to the over 40hrs worth of labor that went into this shotgun.... To help with math we'll average it..... 40hrs * $50/hr (average gunsmith fee) = $2000 +parts, Mags and the original cost of gun....add it all up and it's well over my asking price ***"

THE VERSATILE SUPPRESSOR

Whether it is industry leading sound reduction on a 45ACP handgun or durability on submachine guns and subsonic rifles, the Octane 45 performs. The innovative high strength stainless steel CTA baffles allow it to be disassembled with ease and make it the most versatile and durable suppressor on the market. The Octane 45's interchangeable pistons mean caliber versatility as well. It can be used on 9mm, .40, or .45 cailber host firearms simply by swapping pistons.

The Octane 45 HD has a unique design for easy disassembly and user serviceability. The CTA baffle stack makes it the easiest .45 silencer on the market to clean. The unique click together design keeps debris from reaching the tube of the suppressor, which allows it to be disassembled with ease. CTA baffles are very important when shooting full auto on a submachine gun or shooting lead bullets.

This model was the grandfather to the Model 1911, both designed by John Browning. The slide has a Patent date of April 20, 1897 & the magazine July 9, 1884. The Model 1900 seen many changes along the way, the main one being the rear sight. Early guns had a rear sight that pivoted down, acting as a transfer bar type safety. This sight was not liked by the buyers & around serial number 2200 Colt started altering the sights to a fixed rear sight. They started with guns that had not been shipped & offered a free upgrade to any customer that wanted to send theirs back. By serial number 3300 most guns shipped were altered during production, or manufactured with the new sight. This is important because the guns before serial # 3300 were refinished or at least had the sides refinished due to the alterations. This one is serial number 3363 & the Colt Factory Letter does not show this one having gone back to Colt. Only 4274 were ever made in this one is in the batch that were produced with the new style rear sight. It also has a round hammer, spur hammers were used to about serial # 2400. It is chambered in .38 ACP, has a 6” barrel & hard rubber grips"

It's overall action and design was the basis for later Mauser style rifles, such as it's replacement, the K98. The Gew 98 uses a controlled feed action and cock-on-closing style design to deliver the best possible reliability. It's 8mm round delivers similar stopping power to the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, and it's new 3-position safety made handling the rifle easier. One of the most distinctive features of this gun is it's unique rear sight. Late models abandoned this style design for a less bulky and easier to manufacture alternative.

I purchased this Ruger used (off Arms List) about a year ago for my wife to conceal carry, but she got a Glock 42 instead.  :)  This Ruger shoots amazing, very straight, and is fun to take to the range.  Not sure exactly how many rounds have been through it...  We didn't put 400 rds through it, but we bought it used.  We took great care of it - cleaned it every time we took it out and it's in great shape."

This gun was manufactured in 1910. This gun shoots the powerful 8mm! For the age of this gum, it is in very good condition. For over 100 years old, even the stock is in good condition.  There are dings and dents on it, but for how old this is, its expected! The metal is worn a little but there is NO rust on the gun. I take very, very good care of all my rifles. I always make sure the gun is spotless and oiled up before the next time at the range. The bore is nearly perfect! Whoever owned this gun before me really took care of it. I couldnt get a good picture of it, which i apologize for. The action is as smooth as can be as well! Nothing beats a mauser action! The gun is non matching which is usually expected with these. If you have ANY questions id be glad to help! My name is kevin. You can text or email me at 414-4O5-9587! This is a very nice, affordable gun! It would look great in your collection! Im looking for $200 or Best REASONABLE offer!"

It is no small thing for a company with Fabrique Nationale’s reputation for quality manufacture to license another entity to manufacture one of their products, but in the case of Precision Small Parts (PSP), now known as Precision Small Arms (PSA), quality of manufacture is not an issue. This gun simply exudes quality.  Even the low-end Traditional model is beautifully finished both inside and out.  You hold it in your hand and it “feels” right.  You work the action and you know immediately it is a well made weapon.
  Since I’m praising the gun so highly, I don’t think the PSA company will take it amiss if I quote from their brochure: “Le Bébé is a single action, semi-automatic, self-loading, blow-back mechanism manufactured of all steel alloy components. It is striker fired and utilizes a smooth faced, single stage draw bar trigger with pull weight of 5.25 lbs.  It can hold six rounds in its magazine and one chambered. Le Bébé’s barrel is 2.13 inches long, has 6 lands and grooves and is right-hand twisted with a radius of 3.54 inches.  Le Bébé is 4.11 inches long, stands 2.88 inches tall and is .88 inches thick.”  In addition, the PSA website states:  “When utilized with modern high-velocity ammunition, this pistol can achieve the effectiveness of a .380.  It should not be underestimated with regard to lethality.”*

The above stated pistol is stone mint. It is unfired and free of any rust, scuffs, dings etc.
The action is very very smooth and the finish has a very high luster, just tits. 
I am just testing the waters to see what is out there.

Both ARs are identical except the coloring and are made with high quality milspec parts and have matching/sequential serial numbers.  Both are brand new, never fired.

Pictured optics are included and are very nice.  Aimpoint T-1 Micro on Larue 660 QD mount with Magpul MBUS, lower 1/3 co-witness.  The optics are very high quality replicas.  They perform well, hold zero, and give great accuracy & target acquisition, but these rifles do not have $700 of optics on each of them. 

You do not need to email me asking, ""ARE THESE STILL AVAILABLE?"".  If you're reading this, they are.

Price may be very slightly negotiable.  If I need to knock a couple bucks off so you feel like you bargained or got a deal that's OK.  But you don't need to email me asking, ""WILL YOU TAKE $1500 FOR BOTH?""  I won't.  I have a lot of money in these builds and simply don't have wiggle room at this price.

These are offered as a pair.  If you want only one of them, price is $875 firm.  I'd be splitting up a matched set of serial numbers and then left to sell the other individually.  You don't need to email me asking, ""WILL YOU SELL ME JUST ONE OF THEM?""  I will, for $875. 

I'm only interested in a few specific things for trade/partial trade (listed below).  You don't need to email me asking, ""WILL YOU TRADE FOR MY TAURUS/GLOCK/PARA//HUNTING RIFLE/SHOTGUN/ETC?"".

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™provides the power of a 9mm or a .45 ACP in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

Herbert Schmidt of Ostheim an der Rhon Germany. Schmidt has marketed firearms under a long list of trade names in Europe and the USA including Deputy Marshal, EIG, E8, PIC, Geroco, Madison, Bison, Omega, RG, AMCO, Spesco, Valor, Liberty, LA's Deputy, Liberty Scout, Deputy Magnum, Deputy Adjuster, NATO, Western, Burgo Mod 21, Gecado Model 21 , Indian Scout, VOL, Eusta, Cheyenne Scout, Texas Scout, and Buffalo Scout. The basic Schmidt pattern was a six-shot double action solid frame revolver, with a swing-out cylinder and a short barrel. Schmidt's other principal pattern was a western-style .22 Small Frame Single Action revolver with a rod ejector beneath the barrel. All Schmidt revolvers have the maker's name stamped into the lower edge of the butt grip frame, visible when the grips are removed. As with Em-Ge, Schmidt revolvers were also widely sold in the USA before the passing of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde  and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

I am selling a indian trade style reproduction I am guessing. I got this rifle on trade a year ago and its been hanging on my wall ever since. It is a flintlock rifle with a 34 inch barrel with 47.5 inch overall length. It is .45 caliber. The flint sparks great, but the trigger assembly wont stay cocked most of the time. You have to push the trigger forward to keep the hammer cocked. Sometimes it will work.Most of the time it will not.Could be an easy fix or not, not sure.There are no names or markings on the barrel I can find. Inside of the barrel is clean .Previous owner says he used this for a deer rifle. Not sure about that. This is being sold as a project or wall hanger rifle only. We can haggle on the price back and forth.I need to 100 for this. Im firm on that. Honestly Im not getting the hours at work like I was and I could really use the cash more than this thing looking cool on my wall. I figure that is what this rifle is worth in parts."
