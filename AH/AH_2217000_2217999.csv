Several companies started producing the necessary training rifles for this purpose. Unfortunately most training rifles did not bear markings that identified their origin.
These training rifles had no standard design and were often made from older models of military rifles or parts from these rifles. Therefore you will find many variations of the same model. There are known models that used 1888 Mauser, type 99, type 30, and type 38 rifle parts. These training rifles continued to be produced until the late 1930's. Some of these rifles could not be fired while others would fire wooden bullet blank ammunition. Many of the blank firing rifles were made with smooth bore barrels. Rarely would any of these rifles fire the standard service round. Nearly all of these training rifles could carry bayonets. This rifle is a battlefield pick up and lacks any import marks."

It has a 24"" barrel and a very nice trigger pull, the walnut is beautiful and it has the Weatherby trademark Rosewood stock cap.  I am approaching retirement and am selling some of the guns I never use, this is one of them. Rifle and scope both come with original boxes and owner's manual, including the Weatherby factory test fire target. I have over $1300 in this rig, will take $800 cash. Price is firm, not interested in any kind of trade or lesser offer. Buyer must be MD resident or active duty military stationed in MD and not prohibited from owning firearms. Will meet buyer half way between us geographically for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public setting during daylight hours. I could only find one other Weatherby Stainless Walnut Sporter online, that one is at GunsAmerica and its going for $850 plus shipping plus the FFL's fee for just the rifle, no scope and rings. As this model was only offered for one production year (according to what I read online), so there may be some collectible interest for you Weatherby guys out there. Thanks for looking, pls feel free to ask questions and check my New in the Box unfired Ruger 96/22 Magnum and Rock Island Armory M20D .22 semi auto rifle here on Armslist."

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance. The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.  There is not a scratch or any sign of wear on it.  I don't believe it's even been fired, but if it has it's VERY little as the magazine isn't even scratched.  It has Trijicon night sights and a 14 rd magazine.

Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily."

ZiP™ delivers a long sought after vision of “X-box” gamers and advanced weapon enthusiasts not possible until now. A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.

ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel – opposite of all modern striker guns – making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.

.30-06 Remington m1903 A3.   I bought this at an auction and honestly don't know why.  I have 2 .30-06 rifles  and just don't need another one.  I suppose I bought it because it was a novelty...

Anyway, If you're interested, I'd sell it for exactly what I gave:  $250.   If you have a trade, let me know what you have in mind.   

Things I'm looking for (I'll trade up or down, equal value or cash difference either way).  

1.  A GOOD .22 rifle.   IF you happen to have an old Ted Williams single shot .22 from the early .70s and IF it's the right model (similar to an Ithaca 66 saddle gun), then you're my hero.  Let's talk.  Otherwise, let's talk about a good .22 rifle.  No Savages or Marlins unless it's a .22 mag..I MIGHT consider it then.
2.  .410 pump or semi-auto
3.  .20 gauge pump or semi-auto
4.  Any of the following pistols:  Glock 36, Glock 30, Glock 23, Glock 26, Glock 21, (No Glocks below Gen 3), Springfield XDs (.45 only), Ruger Mark II .22, Hi Point .45 carbine (no Hi Point pistols!)
5.  Snub-nosed (2.5"" or 2"") .357 revolver (no EAA but would entertain Taurus, Rossi and obviously Rugers or Smiths)
6.  IF you have a good condition H&R Topper Model 54 12 Gauge, I'd like to talk :)  This was the first shotgun model I ever owned and would love to have another one just for sentimental reasons.
7.   Might consider other things but the first 6 items have priority :)

I hope I don't sound brash but I've had too many 'time wasters' so far.   If you're truly interested, let's talk.  Here are a few things I won't do:  I won't take less than $250.  I'm not going to throw in ammo, or hold it for an unspecified time while you try to find the money.   I have no plans to drive 200 miles to deliver this or to meet halfway UNLESS you have a trade and we've agreed.   

Certainly, I'll answer ever question possible but understand this is a M1903 Military service rifle which was sporterized by someone in the past (not me).   It's old, but it's in great working and safe condition (in other words, it's not a shot out piece of junk!).  This would make a great first rifle for someone just getting into deer hunting or perhaps for a youngster who is moving to a big boy's rifle.    If you're expecting a Weatherby quality rifle for $250, after I get a good laugh, I'll cease communicating with you and you're welcome to go elsewhere.   If you can find a better deal, please go get that deal.  After all, you wouldn't be interested in this one if you can get it cheaper elsewhere, right?

Thanks for looking."

The gun is in good condition with a few minor dings that you will probably find on any used gun. It comes with everything shown in the pictures (2 clips, NcStar 4x20 scope, carrying case, sling and gun). I believe that the gun has a custom grip, muzzle break, handguard, and possibly some other things. Feel free to call me if you have any questions REDACTED (you have to dial 505). I will be happy to try and answer any questions over the phone if you just tell me what to look for.

The magnifier looks fine, I just find that I don't feel like buying a mount to something I don't really use. I can see how it adds more versatility to the Eotech sight in Military/Law enforcement scenarios, however since I am in neither of those professions I will opt for switching between red dot and fixed scope with the use of quick detatch mounts.

Product Information

Shop more Redding products  The Redding G-Rx Base Sizing Die meets the need of the reloader needing to reload brass shot through some of the most popular autoloaders today. These autoloaders, when fired, produce a bulge at the bottom of the brass, which normal sizing dies can not reach and remove, rendering the brass unusable. Simply push the brass through the sizing die and the bulge in the web of the brass is removed. This step fully sizes the brass back within the accepted SAAMI specification for brass diameter. After the brass has been pushed through the die it may be resized in a standard sizing die allowing once unusable brass to be reloaded normally. 

Technical Information

Notes •The G-Rx die set comes packaged with a pusher rod which fits into the ram like a shell holder and the unique push through sizing die with lock ring.

•To use simply place the brass on top of the pusher rod. Then raise the ram to push the brass entirely through the die. The resized brass is then held in a rebated portion of the die for easy removal. 
•An optional bottle (Product #471-996) and bottle adaptor (Product #789-703) are available. When these two accessories are combined they make collecting the sized brass very convenient speeding up the sizing process

•Reloaders using nickel plated cases may encounter die scratching problems as small particles of the hard nickel plating may be present from trimming/deburring and can find their way inside the dies 
•To avoid problems with die scratching, keep dies clean and free of debris"

I have polished the bolt with the intention of having it blued, move the trigger group moved forward, get a forearm with a rail system, flashlight, vertical grip and so on, but as you all know there are so many things to do and I did not get around to it. I have not kept a shell count log on the weapon, but it has sent less than 700 rounds down range. I have kept the weapon with good maintenance. It has been cleaned after each trip to the range, and oiled before each trip to the safe."

WILL SELL SEPARATE OR TOGETHER OR TRADE BOTH FOR EOTEC
$150 for the Sceptor
$125 for the Acog
This is for an ACOG style scope (this is NOT a branded Trijicon scope). It measures 6 inches long and is solidly built with aircraft grade aluminum and multi-coated optics. The scope features 4x32 magnification with a crosshairs reticle. The crosshairs have a bullet drop compensator out to 600 meters. Best of all, the reticle is fiber optic and the center glows Red when light hits the tube on top of the scope. The stronger the light, the brighter the crosshairs against the target. This is true fiber optic, no batteries required. The reticle lights up with direct light only, when there is no light a fixed mechanical/adjustable bullet drop reticle is visible. Windage and elevation are adjusted using the screws under the two waterproof caps. Four clicks will move the bullet one-inch on a 100 meter target. If you are unfamiliar with ACOG type scopes, please be aware that they have a short eye relief coupled with a finely marked reticle so the scopes will need to be mounted nearer to the eye. Comes complete with a Picatinny mount, which quickly attaches to your rail using two thumb screws. It is shock resistant and waterproof, although extended submersion is not advised. 

.223 / 5.56mm approved for hunting or target practice. The test scopes were zeroed within 9 rounds at 25 meters on a 25 meter zero target. An additional 50 rounds were shot and held acceptable zeroes. (See Pictures) The scopes will come new in package in factory boxes with a lens cloth.  Thanks for looking!!!! Again this is ""not"" a Trijicon scope.

I just installed a $50 GG&G rail adapter so all tac-lights and lasers can be installed.


Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

I already tried Numrich, Havelin, and several auction sites.  This is on old gun of no real value, but it has a little sentimental value, and I would like to pass it on a littler better than I received it.  I made my first wingshots with it.  Its actually a Westernfield 04M-215A.  I think its actually a Mossberg 85C, but I think the D magazine, and maybe the B magazine would also fit it.  

Numrich sells an adapter for a 185 magazine, but that doesn't feed.  I bought it and tried it.  The shell does not kick up high enough to start into the chamber.  I may try to modifiy the 185 magazine since it doesn't feed anyway, but I would really prefer to find an original magazine with the retention latch on the magazine.  I think it will look a lot like the attached pictures.  

I am not looking for a freebie or a steal either.  Just want to put this gun in shooting order as a proper mag fed bolt gun.  

Any assistance would be appreciated.  Thank you very much."

748,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2217748,"For Sale:  Rare, Collectible, & Hard to Find Ammo - Part 2","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, October 13, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey everyone. I've just about finished selling my life long collection of military small arms from around the world so now I've opened up my ammo & accessories safe and I'll be selling it's contents as I have time.  

All of this ammo has been stored in my air conditioned home inside a dehumidified safe.   

A few things to keep in mind: First most of this ammo was originally designed for either military or LE use, and a lot of it is either steel jacketed, steel core or both. So any ammo I describe as magnetic means that it will potentially penetrate targets much deeper than standard commercial ammo. Therefore please be extra cautious with your backstop if you decide to shoot any of it. I feel quite sure that it all will fire so be careful. Second any of the tracer ammo can and will start fires. So again please use with all due caution. Here is the ammo in this lot:  

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser. Brass case, non corrosive & magnetic. Very clean military surplus ammo. $35 for both boxes. 

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser with wooden bullet. This ammo is intended as a blank round but requires a special adapter to shred the bullet at the muzzle. Without this adapter the wooden bullet is dangerous and could be fatal at close range so use caution when firing. $15 for both boxes. 

(5) 10 round boxes of German 8x56R for use in Steyr Straight Pull rifles & carbines. This ammo is brass case, corrosive and magnetic. It's unbelievably clean for being made in 1938. This ammo is truly collectible and the box plus every round is stamped with the German War Eagle. Each box has 10 rounds loaded on 2 stripper clips. These clips & empty boxes sell on Ebay for as much or more than I'm asking for the real live ammo. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. 

(1) 50 round box of Kynoch 7mm Mauser loaded on 5 round chargers. Ammo is brass case, corrosive & very magnetic. This box is unopened so I did not want to disturb it. However I have a partial box of the same ammo and it's unbelievably clean... looks like it was just made, but it was actually produced in January 1938, and it's noted right on the box. Vintage Kynoch is among the most collectible ammo available. Asking $100 for the box. 

(1) 100 round bulk box of 7mm Mauser made by FN Belgium in 1936. Ammo was made for Venezuela, and it's brass case, corrosive and very magnetic. This ammo is also in unbelievable condition for it's age. Cases are bright and there are no signs or corrosion or deterioration at all. Very collectible and perfect to display with your South American Mauser(s).  $75 for the box. 

I do have additional quantities of some, but not all of the ammo listed above. So just ask if you are looking for more. 

Thanks for looking."

Excellent condition, bright shiny bore. Intact rifling. I've only put around 50 rounds through it myself. Previous owner before me put about the same through it. 

All matching numbers.

This VZ-52 is a 1955, chambered in the VERY unique 7.62x45mm round.
The bore is EXCELLENT, a lot of these rifles have ""sewer pipe"" barrels from the corrosive ammo.. how ever this barrel is bright,with strong lands and grooves, no pitting or frosting.
Functions and fires wonderfully (A lot of the FTF issues with these rifles are from the ammo, NOT the rifle.. Hard primers and time )
there have been a few times I have had to eject, then reload a round to get the primers to pop.
This rifle is Numbers matching minus the Stock..
Over all excellent rifle, I have a few more of these rifles and they are a joy to shoot
and a Unique part of history.

Commander size slide with Officer size frame (grip).  Excellent for accuracy and comfortable easy to conceal carry.  Google this pistol and read reviews stating a very good handgun for competition shooting also.
Has a small very light scuff in the stainless just in front of the ejection port.  Will need a set of short grip screws for the Ultra thin grips currently on the pistol.  Or I could put on a set of standard size Hogue's if you prefer.  You get one or the other.
This is an outstanding pistol for carry and accuracy.  Very effective overall design that puts the very accurate Commander size barrel/slide down the leg for concealability yet   has the easy to conceal Officer's size grip for virtually no printing thru clothing.

I can make these any size and can also make them in 3 pieces so you can put them in the trunk if you don't own a truck. And for you pistol guys I can make the plate a picture frame that you can tape targets to.
