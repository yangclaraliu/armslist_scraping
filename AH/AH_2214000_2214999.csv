7,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2214007,For Sale:  380 Auto Standard Pressure Ammo 90 gr. JHP (1025 fps/M.E. 210 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Saturday, October 12, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=218

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel.  We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols.

1. BDA-3.75 inch barrel----1061 fps
2. Walther PPK-3.5 inch barrel-----1049 fps

After reading a lot of reports on the PT1911 since last year, I believe that the only REAL difference between the PT1911 & the other brands is the price!! The only thing that the other brands can do that the PT1911 (so far)is unable to do, is to take more money out of your pocket! For the PT1911, the accuracy is there.

I put this rifle together with the intentions of hunting coyotes at night. The PVS-14 mounts perfectly with the Redfield optic and it is amazing how well the two work together. The nightvision optic can be removed by hand and the rifle can be fired with the same zero during daylight. I will also throw in a Vortex Sparc miniature red dot that I purchased to put on the rifle. I wasn't able to get the red dot and the PVS-14 to co witness so that is why I went with the scope. The Redfield has two sets of turrets, one for 55 grn 5.56mm and one for 168 grn .308, that allow the shooter to make on the fly range adjustments by hand for the ballistics of either load. I have tested the turrets on this AR shooting various 55 grn bullets and the adjustments are pretty much spot on. I have all the paperwork and original packaging for all these items.

 I would entertain the thought of splitting these items up. If I were to split the pricing would be as follows:

 -AR-15 with Burris P.E.P.R mount/Redfield scope or Vortex Sparc $1400
 -PVS-14 with accesories ( Rail mount, Head harness w/ mount, sacrificial lens cover, Carrying case) $2500
 -Vortex Sparc Microdot $175

 I have a few boxes of Remington 55 grn Accutips that I will throw in as well. If a buyer is serious about buying this firearm I can arrange to get on a range during the evening when you can shoot the rifle using the nightvision. I guarantee you will be impressed."

Spikes are some of the best ARs built and there is a long wait to get one if you order it. They use all milspec top quality components and are renowned for their accuracy and reliability.

Features in addition to the standard Spikes Tactical M4 rifle include Magpul MOE handguards, a Magpul vertical fore grip, and a Magpul Bad Lever for those quick mag changes. The MOE handguards are extremely comfortable to hold, and allow direct mounting of accessories like the vertical grip, flashlight mount, bipod, or rail sections in a variety of positions as desired without the unnecessary weight, bulk, and expense of a full quad rail. It is set up for a scope (I no longer have the scope) and it also has a railed gas block added for use with a bipod, but I will include the original A2 front sight post with it as well in case you want it. Has had under 50 rounds run through it just to function test and sight in the scope that was on it. Comes with 1 Magpul 30 round PMAG.

Look around on here, this is still the best deal on a quality Mosin and ammo/accessories.

For sale is a great condition 1939 matching numbers Izhevsk 91/30 Mosin Nagant.  It comes with everything you see (except the case): two dual ammo pouches, ten stripper clips, bayonet, cleaning instruments and multi-tool, sling, ammo butt cuff, Hoppes 9 and Ballistol in oil bottle, and one 20 round box of Winchester White Box 7.62x54R.  Case not included.

With the loaded stripper clips, ammo cuff, and box, there are 79 rounds of brass cased, reloadable, non-corrosive Winchester 7.62x54R.  I will also include the spent brass, which is all Winchester White Box (I've only shot WWB out of it and cleaned it after every trip to the range; it's probably in cleaner condition now than when I got it).

It's a great rifle and a very clean example of the Mosin Nagant platform.  I've enjoyed it but I just have no use for it anymore as I'm moving towards a .308 bolt action rifle for my hunting needs.

Will sell without the WWB ammo shown for $200.  Will not separate beyond that.  Can combine the gun and accessories with WWB ammo and the 880 round unopened crate of milsurp ammo for $500.  Meet in Brentwood."

Classic Feel, Modern Design. No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

The magazines hold 8 rounds each plus the round in the chamber which makes it a 9 shot.

It has the factory original wood grain Cougar hand grips which are very rare and worth some money by themselves. All three magazines are also factory originals which are also nearly impossible to find. I have the factory carry case, factory leather holster and magazine carry pouch, and gun lock as well. I'm throwing in a brand new tactical swat leg holster that can be adjusted to fit ANY semi auto pistol out there. It fits this pistol like a glove even with a laser/light combo attached. 

The laser/light combo I have on this is the brand new Streamlight TLR-4 model with built in red laser sight and flashlight. It fits this pistol perfectly.
