Its a Smith & Wesson Performance Center model, the 586-7.  Its a limited edition L Frame .357 magnum, 7-shot revolver with a ported barrel and a full barrel lug.

Timing is great, lockup is great, and the gun is in fabulous shape.  I'd rate it at 98% or so.

This is a dream to shoot, even with heavy .357 mag loads! Its as accurate as my 6"" N Frame 44, but has half the barrel length so its a gun you can tote around with you. The trigger's been tuned up by S&W, so I'd say the pull's somewhere around 5 pounds in double action mode.  Single action is probably around 3 pounds.

Definitely worth a look if you consider yourself to be a revolver aficionado, as these are very difficult to find.  I haven't been able to find specifics on just how many were made, but from what I've been researching, it was a pretty small number.

Trades-wise, I don't have anything specific I'm looking for at the moment.  Feel free to send me an offer, but know that I'm not interested in rifles, Springfields, or Glocks."

- It can shoot both 5.56 and .223 ammo (unlike most .223 bolt actions that can only shoot .223 ammo). I have several AR's and have a lot of 5.56 ammo accumulated and t's nice to know I can shoot the 5.56 with this rifle as well.
- It has a fully adjustable trigger, as in the owner can adjust it in about 5 minutes without needing any fancy tools or an expensive gunsmith. 
- The barrel is 1:9 twist, meaning is can properly stabilize up to 69 grain ammo. Many .223 bolt action rifles are 1:12 twist meaning they cannot effectively shoot anything higher than 55 grain ammunition. This is important for distance shooting and accuracy.
- This rifle is designed to use standard AR15 magazines. Yup, you read that correctly. any size or form of standard AR15 magazine fits fine (ex. 5/10/20/30 rounders, polymer type like Magpul or metal type like issued by the military...all work in this rifle). No more trying to hunt down specific hard to find magazines, only to pay through the nose.
- Military spec bolt (meaning it is both durable, lightweight, and effective)
- Fluted barrel for reduced weight and heat dissipation. 
- Integral Weaver-style 2-piece bases for such things as optics

I am willing to take a bit of a loss, within reason, after all it is still brand new unfired. Price is $550. I also have a nice unused rifle butt-stock pouch and cheek pad that holds extra ammo and other stuff as well. I will include this as well (paid $45 for it). Not really looking for any trades at this time.

Like a hip holster for it. Ive got over half a box of paint, two pair of pants, and a jacket. Also, I have all the original parts in case you want to part this out and still be able to play.

Have a taurus tracker 357 mag 4 inch barrel new hogue grip and 117 rnds of winchester hp. Will trade for an ak 47. That is 7.62×39 sorry folks but the people clamimg there ak 74 are ak 47 need to know your ak is in 5.45×39 or whatever it is. That would be an ak 74 big differance in bullets and price. However back to guns i wont take any lower than 525 which is a steal considering these gougers are asking upwards to 575-600  with that pathetic grip still on it and no ammo. Mine litteraly seen 31 rounds through it also comes with holister. But please dont messege me with your mossberg 500 and hi point. I understand im not selling a smith and wesson or colt but anyone that knows anything about these trackers know that there badass revolvers and very reliable. They dont have the fixed rear sights they are adjustable the front may to not sure i just see a pin on the side and never messed with it to much. Like i said i would love an ak47 . Not a big fan of unconverted siagas however i will hear you out on it. Wasr10 m70 even century arms i will be interested in of course arsenals would be best but like i said i aint got no colt here. Romanian is a good option. And the only 22lr i would ever consider would be the reall hk mp5 not no knock off gsg 522 that mentally challenge people are trying to sell for 500. Let me know what you have if the deal is sweet enough i can add cash , not much though or i can work out something with a mag tactical lower . And of course nice lever actions like a winchester 30-30 or 45-70 gov wpuld work also."

She ended up carrying the LCP due to weight, but the TCP is a better shooter, in my opinion, than the LCP, as the trigger break is much cleaner. My wife fired a clip (7 rounds) through the TCP, and then I fired 7 more rounds, comparing it to the LCP, so a total of 14 rounds have been fired through it. I was going to use it as a smaller Carry Conceal, but just couldn't give up my Kahr PM9, so I'm selling it. I am the original owner, and it comes with it's original box, 2 magazines, and 2 keys for the Taurus lock. I will be happy to send pictures if I don't get them uploaded."

I was so excited to find it (vertical oriented holsters can be hard to find) that I didn't notice until after I left the store that it was for someone who's left handed.  What are the chances?

It""s military surplus and is used but appears to be lightly so with no major wear or areas of concern.  It's desert pattern digital camo, has leather belt straps, and THREE mag pouches which fit a full sized Beretta 92 mag just fine.  Was designed for the Beretta M9/92, but should work with just about any full or mid sized semi auto, maybe even a 4in mid or large framed revolver.

Mostly interested in trading it for something I can use.  Would trade for a 100 rounds of  9mm or .40 ammo, a beretta 92 magazine or Springfield XD40 magazine( 9 or 12 round).  I'm still looking for a good conceal carry holster for a Beretta 92, but needs to be right handed obviously, and I don't like to carry IWB, so prefferrably OWB

Comes with sling. Has a very nice aftermarket grip. These rifles are very popular right now this is a sweet rifle very accurate for an AK consistent two inch groups. I've shot a 40 rounds into a 3.5 inch group There Built on a milled receiver out of all American parts and built to Polish specs which were widely regarded as some of the best.The rifle is spray painted in a winter-style camo with cheap spray paint that will come off with some solvent, hot water and some rubbing. Do not ask me a laundry list of questions about the paint. I have knocked about $80 off the cost of the rifle because it will take some time to get it off I am a new dad and just do not have the time. I have put about 1000 rounds through this rifle without a hiccup. I've shot a 40 rounds into a 3.5 inch groupThere is a small piece missing from the cheaper polymer quadrail that came on the rifle. nothing to effect function by any means so don't think  I am going to take half off for something most people would replace with a new rail anyway. I paid $837 for this rifle NIB OTD. Now they are about $700 OTD. So I am asking what I view to be a very fair price of just the rifle with plastic stock for $550. Now I have some goodies to go with as well if you are interested. All prices are very fair and firm. Don't bother lowballing as I don't have to sell this but would like the money for an AR project.

I have 10 tapco mags that can be included for $40
180 rnds Herters ammo for $50
1 box of Winchester brass cased ammo ($20 brand new); $10
1 box of Yugo surplus brass cased; $5

I have a nice solid birch buttstock (wooden buttstock in picture) that I paid $70 total for to buy and have installed on the rifle. It can go for $40. It is an awesome stock and well worth every penny.

I have an Tapco AK74-style muzzle brake that can go for $10. 

Sight Mark Ultra shot reflex sight with quick detach ($100 brand new, used for only 2 hours) ; $60.

I will sell everything all together for $750 so that you will get a rifle with a lot of goodies for the same price as a new one out the door at your gun shop. Prices are very fair and firm.

Like new .40 caliber Glock 22. Only fired 31 rounds through it. Factory test fire date is 3/2013 I've had it for 2 months. New $515 plus $47.63 tax and $10 background. Total $572.63. Selling because I've decided keeping one caliber of ammo stocked would be easier. 

Have roughly 300 rounds (mostly JHP's) of ammo that I will sell with it for .40 cents a round which is less than cheap FMJ's at Walmart.

Features new full-ambi lower.

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

If you’re a shooter with any time in the sport - of course you have. And almost all of us have heard them mentioned throughout our shooting lives. And just about always, they're associated with the Federal Cartridge Company name.

Well, how about a deal on some original >> PRE-FEDERAL CARTRIDGE COMPANY << HYDRA-SHOK stuff!

I have two, partial boxes of it for sale. One in .357 magnum, and one in .38 Special (the original/original).

Here’s what I have…….

23 rounds of .357 Magnum. 
End flap marked, HYDRA-SHOK “125gr. SEMI-JKT COPPERHEAD”.  All cases stamped “HYDRA-SHOK 357 MAG"".  They have nickel-plated cases and contain the semi-jacketed HYDRA-SHOK (center-post) Hollow-point bullet.

34 rounds of .38 Special. 
End flap marked, HYDRA-SHOK “146GR. SCORPION”.  All cases stamped “HYDRA-SHOK 38 SPL.  They have nickel-plated cases and contain the original HS lead (center-post) bullet.  There are also 12 empty cases included.

Both are in original, shelf-worn, 50ct-size red boxes and marked “HYDRA-SHOK CORP., WATKINS GLEN, NEW YORK 14891” along with Hydra-Shok proprietary information on the box backside. 

The name ""FEDERAL"" doesn't appear - anywhere.

I have no firm idea of what this stuff is worth, but one just has to look at comparative places like the auction sites showing lesser stuff going to and from collectors for $5 - $7 a round, says something.  Again, this is pre-Federal cartridge company stuff, with a very enviable history (if you’re a cartridge). These are the ""Founding Fathers"" of the the whole Hydra-Shok line.

Entrepreneurs ... at even $10 a pop (your shipping charges not included) you’re looking at $570. Plus you have the boxes . . . and don't we ALL know about boxes! 


$200 for everything / Pick-up in my area

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.
