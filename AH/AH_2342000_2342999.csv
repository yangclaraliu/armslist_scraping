I am looking to sell for $430 (the cost of a brand new Ruger LCR) or even trade for a Ruger LCR or a Smith & Wesson 442.
This gun is in great condition, still shoots great! No damage to the rifling or the firing pin, has the lanyard ring still intact (which a lot of models from this year do not) and comes with 29 rounds of Winchester Super X ammo in 38 Smith & Wesson. A lot of these models were converted to 38 Special when they were brought back to the United States after the war, but this one remains in its original caliber of 38 Smith & Wesson.
This gun appraised at $500-$600, so what I'm asking isn't much, I am just trying to help my grandmother.

Taurus produced their Thunderbolt version which was bought mainly by SASS shooters. Being handicapped I thought it would be a good rifle for me in CAS competition because of the barely 2 inch throw to pump a round. But with my injured left arm the angle for me to effectively pump a round with speed for CAS stages is prohibitive. It would cause a normal person no problem. In addition, being NIB the action on this beauty is TIGHT and though time or an action job will loosen it I don't want to wait. These rifles are extremely accurate and hold 14+1 of .45 Long Col. Has Lifetime Warranty through Taurus. I will entertain trades ( I have a weakness for EAA's and 10mm guns) but worth must $600.00 of course Cash is King! Original box included.

The Beretta Model 93R is a selective-fire machine pistol, designed and manufactured by Italian Beretta in the 1970s for police and military use. The ""R"" stands for Raffica, which is Italian for ""volley"", ""flurry"" or ""burst"". The Beretta Model 93R is mechanically similar to the Beretta 92 with a selector switch that allows the operator to alternate between the two firing modes; single shot or three round burst (approximately 1,100 round per minute firing rate). The 93R also came with a folding fore grip under the barrel and an available folding shoulder stock.

The chances of finding an actual transferrable Beretta 93R (let alone being able to afford it) are VERY slim, but you can use the magazines in your Beretta 92 at least.  I HATE the jokers creating all the paranoid panic purchases lately, but these are literally the only ones I have EVER seen in person, get them now or it may be literally never.

I have truly enjoyed owning this weapon and will be an advocate of FNH for life. I am the second owner and have taken great care of this gun. It's been to the range about three times (~500 rds) since I bought it and cleaned after each run. NEVER an FTF.

I'm traveling from Milwaukee up to Green Bay on Sunday for a meeting, then back home.  If you live along the route I can arrange to stop on the way back, if you live in Green Bay I can meet you somewhere after noon.

I have an unconverted Saiga 20 gauge shotgun up for sale. It's a shotgun based on the AK-47 rifle platform. I've put about 100-150 rounds through it with no problems. In fact I'd be keeping it but I moved up to a 12 ga model

The shotgun comes with the manual, 3 factory 5-round magazines (only one shown in the picture below), one 23-round drum, and one more magazine that doesn't quite snap into place. It fits the gun so it may just need a hair dremeled off the top or something, but I got it for free and I never messed with it after finding out it didn't fit properly. I'm also throwing in an almost-full box of shells that's missing a few from the last time I went out with it.  A great gun at a great price.

For those of you who love to do the math and then tell someone how little they're gun's worth, here's what I paid:
Saiga 20 gauge - $799 plus tax and fees
23-round drum - $379 plus shipping
2 more Izmash factory mags - $90 plus shipping
Metal mag that doesn't fit - free
Box of ammo - $16 plus tax

So you're getting a slightly used shotgun with almost $500 in extras for less than a new one would cost you for just the rifle after taxes, and there's no paperwork involved here! Please keep that in mind when making me an offer.  I'm asking $850 OBO."

These were widely distributed through central Europe and the Balkans and were used by the Austro-Hungarian Army. Most common type was the ""Montenegrin-Gasser"". After 1903, the company became Rast & Gasser until about 1912, when they went out of business. The ""Montenegrin Gasser"" revolvers were large-frame, large caliber, with 6-shot cylinders, usually in 11 mm. The first Model was the M1870. Subsequent ""Montenegrins"" featured minor changes in the original design and later models featured hinged-frame construction with Galand cylinder locks and self-extracting mechanisms like the one shown. It is a double-action revolver of some size, weighing in at 2 lbs., 13 oz.! They were produced by Gasser and a number of other fine Austrian and Belgian makers. King Nicholas of Montenegro is said to have owned a financial interest in the manufacture of the ""Montenegrin-Gasser"" style revolvers and that he made ownership of these revolvers mandatory for his male subjects. Today, they are very rare. I have seen only 3 in movies: MGM's 1952 ""Prisoner of Zenda"" (and mine looks identical to THAT particular revolver, including the fact that it has a weak trigger return spring). And Warren Beatty used a Montenegrin-Gasser revolver in the film ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"". One also appeared in the recent film ""The Illusionist"". Around 1910, the owner of Alfa Arms sold a sizeable shipment of these guns to Pancho Villa and his Mexican revolutionaries. the barrels were changed on these particular guns, so they would fire .44-40 ammunition. He made a fortune in profits as Villa was able to afford them. In fact, this gun is very much associated with the Mexican Revolution and is instantly recognizable by its unique look. This particular (auction) gun is one of those that went to the Mexican Revolution. It was really THERE! Mechanically, it is still almost perfect, except that 2 chambers don't quite index and the trigger return spring is weak. The real bone grips are still in fine shape. No chips, still sturdy and strong. Finish has a nice honest patina. How can you tell it is a survivor of the Mexican Revolution? Because the barrel is stamped ""For 44 Winchester Cartridge"" (which is a .44-40 caliber). On the top of the frame, it reads only ""Belgium"". This gun is literally ""wearing its history"" and this is as fine a specimen as you're likely to find. Very RARE today!. Buyer pays $20. shipping & ins. in Lower 48. Payment must be received within 7 days from close of auction. This gun is an ANTIQUE and is FFL exempt, so is legal to ship direct to buyer. certified check or money order only.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World
Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for
competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened
recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced
performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front
sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load
combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass
which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be
used.

These are hard to find super hot AKA ""hyper-velocity"" 22LR rounds. Can't speak from personal experience but I've heard that the Stingers being a little bit longer than average 22LR rounds can have some feeding and seating problems in the 10/22. 

I work 5pm to 5am this Friday Saturday and Sunday (Nov 22, 23, 24) then am off work Nov 25-Dec 1. Can meet on days off. 12 hour shifts make it tough to do much else on work days. 

Plain wood stock ruger 10/22 with a small Tasco 3-7 x 20 scope that's sighted in to 50yds. Fired 50 rounds of CCI standard velocity (flawlessly) through it to sight the scope then cleaned and stored. Was gonna be my raccoon gun but can't get a dog at this time so the rifle kinda is useless to me so might as well sell to fund the PTR91 I'm getting my dad for Christmas. Comes with one ruger 10rd BX-1 factory mag and one ruger BX-25 factory mag. Still have original box. Have 550 rds of 22lr ammunition that goes with. NOT splitting this up. Package deal. No use for gun without ammo/magazines and vice versa. 
Ammo that goes with is as stated:
100rds of CCI stingers copper plated HP, 1640 FPS 32gr
300rds (25 of which are loaded into the BX-25) of CCI mini mag HP 36gr
100rds of CCI mini mags round nose 40gr
100rds of Winchester T22 lead round nose 40gr
50rds of CCI standard velocity lead round nose  40gr

Asking $280, not (again NOT) accepting lowball ""$180"" offers. With Christmas coming up this would be a nice little full package present. And with the ammo it's like getting that special someone that new toy WITH batteries, but batteries are easy to find. Quality 22LR ammunition is kinda hard to stumble across with all the people buying it up just to sell and line their pockets which of course is a major contributor to the current false 22LR ammo shortage. There's plenty out there, just getting bought mostly by people who don't even own a 22 firearm."

The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted
to different needs. The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked
breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise.
Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease
of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect
the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced
polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a
custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

Stock:  Nutmeg Laminated wood - in ""Barracuda"" target style.  Right-hand thumbhole.

This is a very high-quality Ruger 10/22 Magnum clone.  Stainless steel with an integral rock-solid P-rail, 19"" graphite lightweight barrel.  Extremely lightweight rifle.  Known for their accuracy and durability, these Magnum Research rifles are a 10/22 lover's braggin' rifle.  Extremely low round count (less than 40 rounds through it).  Comes with original box, packaging, and all original paaperwork and trigger lock.  This comes with one Ruger 9-round magazine (rifle holds 9+1), and has an oversized charging handle

These were/ are over $900 new before tax.  
You can see right here that this exact rifle still has an MSRP of $935: http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-22WMR-Barracuda-Nutmeg-Rifle.asp
The rubber-stocked blued ones still go for over $700 used.  

This one is in pristine condition, stainless steel, with the beautiful stock, and is yours for $745 (old price was $775) - Plus, I will even throw in for free, THREE 50-round boxes of .22 magnum ammo (150 rounds), which is THE hardest ammo to find right now - great deal, IMO!

I also have a scope to sell separately from the rifle, which is removed from the rifle but is still sighted into the rifle - it is a Swift Premier 3-9x50mm with high-quality Weaver steel rings.  The scope can be purchased separately or in addition to the rifle.  It is $60 for both scope and rings, which is a very good price, since the rings are $25 new.
