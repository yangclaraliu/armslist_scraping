Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This L120’s alloy frame renders the gross weight 28 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well made  Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Importer is Tri Star of North KC, MO. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Barrel is 4 1/2 inch 6 groove, with pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are classic CZ style three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 6 1/2 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face combat trigger. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer with the T Tri Star logo. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar CZ7517B, not catalogued but produced for Tri-Star exclusively in a bright blue finish. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece."

This is an awesome brand new in package EFK compensatory for .45's. It will work with any threaded barrel with a .578 x 28 RH thread. I run these on my other guns and man do they reduce recoil and look badass. These are superior to other comps because they are the same profile as the slide so they don't add much bulk. These basically eliminate muzzle rise so all you have to deal with is the rearward push of the weapon system. I honestly with I had another .45 to throw it on...

Putting these beautiful and rare pieces up with the main intention of finding a couple of Colt revolvers to add to my slowly growing collection. I am especially interested in limited production pieces. Also looking for 2.5"" snakes or any size in stainless or Coltguard. Looking for pieces with 98% or better finish, boxes and paperwork always preferable. 

Make: HK 
Model: HK45c limited edition (1 of 298) in FDE. NEW IN BOX - pic is not of actual pistol but another identical nib that I sold a few months ago. Yours will look just like her ;-)
Caliber: .45ACP
Price: $1950 cash or trade for Colt snake or bear revolvers 

Make: Guncrafter Industries - SOLD SOLD SOLD!!!!!
Model: Model No.2 
Caliber: 50GI & .45ACP
Price: $3650 cash with ammo or $4000 trade value (with ammo) for Colt snake or bear revolvers

Guncrafter Industries Model No. 2 in a very rare (I've never seen another) bobtail frame - GI is arguably one of the best semi-custom 1911 makers out there. this pistol is usually only offered in a 50 GI round. However, this particular 1911 comes with a .45acp full conversion kit (BOTH Barrels, bushings, etc were HAND FIT TO THIS GUN by manufacturer) - 2 calibers in one pistol. This gun is in as new condition. It has seen less than 300 rounds and is a BEAST. I sent one of the steel plates flying off of its chain at the range while shooting 50GI.  I rarely shoot this thing and think she deserves better!! Price is FIRM at well over $1000 below retail plus no tax or shipping. 

Pistol retail - $3540.99 - $3880 without extras!
Extras include:
Factory Caliber Conversion Kit - $395
Labor for fitting Caliber Conversion kit - $115
Novak Adjustable Tritium rear sight - $95
Bobtail Frame - $185
Melonite finish - $275
Alumagrips w/GI logo - $59.95
Extra .45 Magazine - $49.95
Extra 50GI Magazine - $49.95
Total: +/- $4800 depending on retail
I will throw in $400 worth (160 rds) of factory 50GI JHP ammo at my asking price!!!

Make: Wilson Combat
Model: CQB
Caliber: .45ACP
Price: $2700 trade value for Colt snake or bear revolvers
Very low round count, could pass for NIB. excellent finish and the forever, no questions asked, paid shipping both ways Wilson Combat warranty. This is a newer build with grey bag.

Make: Springfield Armory 
Model: 10-8 Operator!!!
Caliber: .45acp 
Price: $2950 - trades for collectible colt wheel guns 
Other info: some handling marks - this gun has been shot as every 10-8 should be. Hilton Yam did a VERY limited run of these annually from 2007-2012. They are no longer being produced. Made in the SACS this 1911 is made to run hard and is an absolute tack driver. 

Make: Guncrafter Industries 
Model: American 
Caliber: .45acp

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Priced New: $2,199.00

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

I just bought it earlier this week and it is unfired so far.  Was planning on carrying it but it's just too long for my preferred method of carry (OWB, IWB doesnt work well for me).

I'd like to trade it for a mid sized 9mm such as a glock 19 or similar, or a commander length 1911 in .45.  I like the 1911 platform but I think I'd prefer to have it in .45, might consider a full size, but again, I'm wanting something a bit shorter.  I've also wanted a Beretta 92 or a CZ75 for a long time and would be interested in either one as well.

Butt stock is in good condition, foregrip has an imperfection where the previous owner decided not to complete drilling hole. The weapon overall is very rough. Explanation follows:

The barrel has none of the bluing left. It is pitted interior and exterior. I personally would not fire rounds without replacing the barrel. The barrel also has been fabricated from 28""-18.5"". The fabrication looks to be a job well done. 

The receiver appears to have damage due to ignorance of dis-assembly. The action is smooth and crisp. Breach release works as it should and quite well. Firing pin, firing pin spring, and hammer are in very good working condition as stated above. The trigger guard is original and undamaged. The shotgun appears to be roughly dated to 1958.

I do not have ownership, this belongs to a family member. I will part out or sell as complete working weapon. The price below is for a reference point ONLY. I will negotiate for final price. I will not ship. This will be local pick up only in Oklahoma City, OK

I was buying a .45 and saw it on the wall and just fell in love. It is really an awesome gone but after having it for awhile, I realized that I have no use for it whatsoever. It has been sitting in my gun cabinet only brought out to show my friends it's awesomeness. It has never been fired or even chambered a bullet. It's time for it to go to someone that will use it. Here is what it is, I am not a gun expert so this is what I know about it. It is a RUGER mini 14 with a TROY IDUSTRIES chassis. It has a flip down battle sights as well as a LUCID HD7 red dot sight. It also has a telescopic stock and a hand grip. It looks amazing. I paid close to $1500 for it but will settle for $1000. You can message me with any questions and I will do my best to answer them.
