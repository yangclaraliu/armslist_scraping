The whole weapon is KG GunKoted for durability. I built this gun to do work with - carry on property, truck gun, etc.

***The gun is shown with a bunch of accessories that I have put on it and stored in my safe. If you want to negotiate for them, we can do that. But I am more showing how it gets kitted out. I don't think anyone should take on accessories that they wouldn't use. The weapon is currently fitted with a Law Tactical Gen 2 Folding adapter as well. Add $200 if you want that included. ***"

Stock is in good condition with slight handling marks. The base of stock has small piece missing at heel as was common with these rifles if you set them down hard they had a steel butt plate and narrow wood at heel and it would split a piece off about 3/8""
It was repaired/sanded. Also My Grandfather stamped his Name in the stock on action side.. Not too deep and could be taken out with some sanding.

and also engraved in stock and fore grip are all matching same number.. All Original 
My great uncle killed a grizzly out west on a hunting trip with this gun. Hit it in the spine and dropped it..

Bigger and badder is the best way to describe the AR-536. Its 5x
magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards,
while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. The
Ballistic/CQ lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly
competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select
red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination
settings make it easy to match any light condition.  Ruggedly built to
withstand up recoil, abuse and weather, key features include multi-coated
lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail
mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted
to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.
Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame."

Raven Concealment is the ""Lambrogini"" of top quality Kydex concealment holsters. Below are the specs and link to Raven's website. I bought this holster a month ago from their website. However, I have no use for it now, because I have discovered the wonderful world of ""Appendix"" conceal carry, and that's all I'm doing now. 

I also have the matching single magazine carrier for a single stack Glock 36 magazine.

Both the holster and mag carrier have standard size belt loops.  

You can have both for $85 (Retail is $120 for both)
Holster only $60 (Retail $80)
Mag only $25 (Retail $35)

The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians.The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.

We construct the body of the holster from thin, high-strength Kydex-T. We chose to use a pancake-style design in order to minimize bulk and distribute the weight of the firearm over a wider area on the belt. The “outside” portion of the holster body fully enshrouds the weapon from ejection port to muzzle. The “inside” or “body-side” portion of the holster incorporates a full-length body shield. This enhances comfort and aids in re-holstering, while simultaneously protecting the controls of the pistol.

The Phantom ships ready-for-use as an OWB belt-mounted holster with 1.5"" belt loops. All Phantoms are designed around the Eclipse Modular Mounting System, and are therefore compatible with all Eclipse Modular Accessories. Through the use of Eclipse Modular Accessories, the Phantom can be converted to one of over 20 different styles of OWB or IWB carry.

The Phantom Modular Holster has been proven under fire through heavy daily use around the globe for over five years. Since its introduction, tens of thousands of Phantoms have been used for everything from day-to-day concealed carry by civilians to offensive operations by Tier-1 military units. No other holster even approaches the versatility and functionality of the Phantom. Nor does any copycat product have the proven track record of the RCS Phantom.

 Willing to pay a fair price for a good used gun, but be realistic.  I can get a brand new Glock online for $499 @ budsgunshop.com w/ free shipping, and my ffl only charges $15 for a transfer plus ten for the backround. So thats  $525 out the door, just for a reference point.

Military Sidearm.  This is a completely original M1911-A1 manufactured by Colt (The original designer and builder of the 1911).  This particular pistol was built and shipped between July 18th and 31st of 1941.  This pistols S/N of 736XXX is right at the point of production where they went from being blued to being parkerized.  It comes with what I believe to be its original service holster, belt, magazine pouch magazine.  There are 4 magazines included and I also have 3 boxes of USGI surplus ammo.  The story I have is this M1911-A1 was originally issued to a Private Raymond L Carson  of the 326th Engineering Corp. (his was SN36376557).  Private Carson entered the service from Michigan and was KIA in Germany on September, 18 1944.  He is buried in the American Cemetery and Memorial in Limburg, Netherlands.  This pistol is in very good condition showing very little wear and/or scratching.  Has all original parts it was issued with that include the correct ""Hollow-Back"" grips, the small ""G"" stamped barrel correct Colt manufactured trigger, hammer, slide release, thumb safety, grip safety and main spring housing.  There are 2 original early W.W.I.I. Colt Manufactured 7-round magazines (marked ""Colt 45 Auto."" on the base).  The original Boyt 42 Holster has it's lanyard braided (most likely done by Pvt. Carson), the belt has Private Carson's information written in it and is in near perfect condition, the magazine pouch is the original Boyle 42 that has 2 slightly later issue pinned base magazines in it. (1 shows some rust pitting but operates perfectly).  I have also found a reproduction of the original shipping box and wax protective paper inside.  I have 3 boxes of USGI Issued .45 ammo that are in unopened boxes dated 5-44 and 7-44.  I am selling everything as a package.  The Colt M1911-A1 with (4) Correct W.W.I.I. Magazines pinned-base (2 are marked Colt 45), Holster, Mag Pouch, Belt, 3 boxes of W.W.I.I. issued ammo and reproduction shipping box.  This is a REAL COLT that I am asking $3850.00 for the entire package and I will not separate any of it.  I will consider trades (Whole or partial) of collector Colt 1911's or Revolvers and may consider a S&W.  Send me your contact information with a phone number and I'll get back to you.  If you send a message and it does not include your contact information I'll assume you're a scammer and I will not reply.  I live in Albuquerque, NM and I am willing to ship and insure at the expense of the buyer.  If your FFL will not accept a shipment from an individual with 2 forms of ID I will ask that you pay the $25 FFL on my end."

It is a Supermatic Citation Model 102 made from 1958 to 1960.  These are some of the finest target pistols ever made and far superior to anything you can buy today for the same money.  This pistol comes with 1 10-round magazine, original 8"" barrel with optional muzzle brake and 1 barrel weight.  This pistol is in very good condition cosmetically and perfect condition mechanically.  It is clean and operates flawlessly on just about any ammo you want to run through it.  It shoots 22lr only and is not set up to shoot 22 short.  I have 2 of these pistols and have decided to sell one to get into a larger caliber target pistol.  This is not a cheap stamped steel pistol it is made from forged steel and you can feel it when you hold it.  The trigger pull is set a 1.5lbs and it is the first model that holds the slide open on the last round.  The original grips are in very good condition and the magazine feeds this pistol flawlessly.  I am asking $800 for this pistol as pictured or best reasonable cash offer.  If you wish to make a low offer please keep in mind the pistol will not include the muzzle brake or barrel weight.  These are very valuable and I will sell them on Gun Broker if you're not willing to pay for them.  The only trades I will consider are quality target pistols in like or better condition.  I am looking for a Colt National Match Mid-Range in .38 Wadcutter only, S&W Model 52 or a Colt National Match Gold Cup (Chambered in .38 Special Wadcutter, .38 Super or .45acp).

It is a Supermatic Citation Model 102 made from 1958 to 1960.  These are some of the finest target pistols ever made and far superior to anything you can buy today for the same money.  This pistol comes with 1 10-round magazine, original 8"" barrel with optional muzzle brake and 1 barrel weight.  This pistol is in very good condition cosmetically and perfect condition mechanically.  It is clean and operates flawlessly on just about any ammo you want to run through it.  It shoots 22lr only and is not set up to shoot 22 short.  I have 2 of these pistols and have decided to sell one to get into a larger caliber target pistol.  This is not a cheap stamped steel pistol it is made from forged steel and you can feel it when you hold it.  The trigger pull is set a 1.5lbs and it is the first model that holds the slide open on the last round.  The original grips are in very good condition and the magazine feeds this pistol flawlessly.  I am asking $800 for this pistol as pictured or best reasonable cash offer.  If you wish to make a low offer please keep in mind the pistol will not include the muzzle brake or barrel weight.  These are very valuable and I will sell them on Gun Broker if you're not willing to pay for them.  The only trades I will consider are quality target pistols in like or better condition.  I am looking for a Colt National Match Mid-Range in .38 Wadcutter only, S&W Model 52 or a Colt National Match Gold Cup (Chambered in .38 Special Wadcutter, .38 Super or .45acp).

This particular pistol was built and shipped between July 18th and 31st of 1941.  This pistols S/N of 736XXX is right at the point of production where they went from being blued to being parkerized.  It comes with what I believe to be its original service holster, belt, magazine pouch magazine.  There are 4 magazines included and I also have 3 boxes of USGI surplus ammo.  The story I have is this M1911-A1 was originally issued to a Private Raymond L Carson  of the 326th Engineering Corp. (his was SN36376557).  Private Carson entered the service from Michigan and was KIA in Germany on September, 18 1944.  He is buried in the American Cemetery and Memorial in Limburg, Netherlands.

There are 2 original early W.W.I.I. Colt Manufactured 7-round magazines (marked ""Colt 45 Auto."" on the base).  The original Boyt 42 Holster has it's lanyard braided (most likely done by Pvt. Carson), the belt has Private Carson's information written in it and is in near perfect condition, the magazine pouch is the original Boyle 42 that has 2 slightly later issue pinned base magazines in it. (1 shows some rust pitting but operates perfectly).  I have also found a reproduction of the original shipping box and wax protective paper inside.  I have 3 boxes of USGI Issued .45 ammo that are in unopened boxes dated 5-44 and 7-44.  I am selling everything as a package.  The Colt M1911-A1 with (4) Correct W.W.I.I. Magazines pinned-base (2 are marked Colt 45), Holster, Mag Pouch, Belt, 3 boxes of W.W.I.I. issued ammo and reproduction shipping box.  This is a REAL COLT that I am asking $3250.00 for the entire package and I will not separate any of it.

Comes an extra full size owner's manual, original paperwork, 2 - 15 round magazines and the original hard case. Like I said this is the desirable made in Italy version from Beretta...  The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.  These are great pistols with great reliability!  I am asking $600 for this pistol.  I may consider a Ruger, S&W or Colt Revolver in trade.  I have too many 9mm pistols and so I am getting rid of this one as I shoot it least.  It might have has 100 rounds through it and have been kept clean and spotless.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*529I"

The upper receiver has an interchangeable barrel system in which you can buy the 300 Blackout barrel kit to install easily without the need for a gunsmith.Literally 6 allen screws and the barrel pops right out! All calibers come in multiple length barrels also. Faxon has multiple caliber barrels coming out this year!
The 300 is already available. 308, 22LR, 5.45, and 7.62 are on the way.
It also has a non-reciprocating charging handle and you have the option to switch it to either side.
forward left like an MP5…..
A special feature with this upper is that it can be fired without a buffer tube, thus you can fire this with a folding stock or without one as a pistol; its quite versatile.

Below is a break down of everything in the build. I have the boxes, paperwork, and receipts for every item. The Faxon upper and Vortex optic also have a lifetime, no questions asked, warranty! Talk about peace of mind!

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles
•	All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver. 
•	Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47. 
•	The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads. 
•	The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle. 
•	The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling. 
•	The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip."
