What I have is a match grade Springfield Armory FAL rifle (SAR-4800) IT IS RARE TO SEE ONE OF THESE, but FAL parts are still pretty easy to come by.  This bad little beast has been in my family since it was new.  Not in a hurry to sell, just working on a different project.  Here is a list of add ons and specs:

Full length Springfield Match grade barrel (original equipment)
Upgraded rail forend with Blackhawk rail covers.
Have original forend in box, and a brand new one that is included but not installed .
Original owners manual and paperwork
Springfield Armory muzzle break (original equipment)
 6-9x 50 scope on 3/4 inch rise mounts, beefy set up
Harris Bipod w/ quick release.
7 Magazines (20 RNDS)



It has been meticulously maintained since day 1, all components are still in good working order.  It is shooting sub MOA at 100 meters.  I had this thing out a few weeks ago shooting clay pidgeons at 400 meters (stationary, i wish i was that good)
I have never experienced a jam or misfeed.  It is a joy to shoot, and I will miss it, but I have too many .308 rifles currently to justify keeping it.  It is a safe queen, and I would estimate the round count to be around 500-600.  Always brass, usaully match grade.  You will be happy with this rifle, and it is not something you see every day.  email me here or text REDACTED for more information, pictures or a history lesson on this rifle.  Price is 1500OBO, reasonable offers will be considered , and I am open to partial trades.  Hit me up, worst I can say is no!!!  Priced to sell"

I very much like the small platform of the Glock subcompacts, but would like a little bit more power from the 10mm over the 40 S&W; specifically for wilderness defense (i.e. bears and stuff). If any one out there feels their 10mm is a bit too much power for their application, this trade is for you.

Just don't really need it and someone else can enjoy it if it's what you're looking for. The A-bolt with the 60% short draw is awesome! The trigger is one of my favorites by far.

A very sophisticated bolt action. 
With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.

Barrel
The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger
A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.

Magazine
Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.

Magazine Capacity
For all A-Bolts 300 WSM: Three in magazine, one in chamber."

This rimfire rifle sports an AR-style look and is modeled after the legendary original Colt M4. A ""Tactical Rimfire"" rifle, the M4 Ops is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine. Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories. Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle.

The 92 FS semiautomatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blow-back system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

92 FS - A LEGEND IN FIREARMS.
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.
BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL.
• The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage.
• During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction.
• The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.
• Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single mal function or, at most, with only one malfunction.
• The average durability of Beretta M9 slides is over 35,000 rounds, the point at which U.S. Army testing ceases.
• The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds"

 I bought it and put it on my AR. I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash. So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

Soft armor is crye as well. 

Also includes Cryes removable water bladder/molle back panel. That's coyote as well. You can essentially make a light dismount pack with it out of pouches instead of an assault pack.

I have a 6.5MM ARISAKA TYPE 38  


I believe it was made in Tokyo in KOISHIKAWA or KOKURA ARMY ARSENALpre 1935(or 42 hard to tell) bluing is quite nice!! mum ground off but has all other markings(s,arsenal stamp,serial #, and etc ) and back of bolt missing(bolt no internals. with  the internals for it would be complete and worth tons more i just dont want to put in the time ) and firing pin(you can find parts ive found them in the past ). bore looks fair rifling is their.now what makes this rifle so badass other than its a ww2 bring back(almost no jap rifles were imported) has no import mark. 1st) it has HWINA  carved in the stock assuming the soldiers name. 2nd) looks like a good amount of dried blood on the bolt side under bolt.once again assuming Hwina's blood.I HAVE HAND BOOK ON TYPE 38S TO INCLUDE WITH INFO.WW2 bring back

The second rifle is a type 38 trainer rifle

the rifle with refinished stock is a type 38 training rifle(im 99% sure) has no bolt,nor mum. whats crazy to me is where the serial number goes is a 61#(will email picture) and its stamped on bayo lug again. this could of very well been number 61 off the line but im not sure. bore is smooth(FOR BLANKS) looks just like the type 38 but about 1cm smaller on everything.THIS IS A PAIR TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION.

628,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2237628,For Sale/Trade:  2003 Saab 9-3 6 Spees Manual ARC,"Springboro, Dayton, Ohio","$ 1,750","Listed On: Saturday, October 19, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a high mileage Saab for sale 367,000 plus miles(I just drove to Cleveland and back). This car still runs great. Exterior color is silver and the interior is gray leather. I bought the car with around 45,000 miles and have owned it ever since. I will start with the bad first. The check engine light is on due to the secondary air injector pump and check valve not working. This is a non issue as this only is emissions equipment that engages on cold starts to add air to the exhaust fumes creating slightly less pollution. This has not worked for the past 100,000 miles and has not effected performance at all. The other problem is the fuel gauge does not work, which has not been an issue if I fill up soon after 400 miles driven on a full tank. Cosmetically the car has some nicks in the paint and a couple small dings. The front fascia is pretty scratched up. The interior is smoke free and is in excellent shape except for the drivers seat has cracked a bit but not torn. Enough with the bad.
Now with the good. The car has many options including heated seats, aux audio input, traction control, moonroof, duel climate control. I have done most of the maintenance over the years and know this car inside and out. I have always used premium fuel and done regular oil changes with Mobil 1 synthetic. For any perspective buyer I can go over in great detail everything that has been done over the years. The tires are Michelin Primacy MXV4 with plenty of tread left. I see no reason why this car can not go another 100,000 miles. I would like to do it myself but I have too many cars right now. If anyone is interested or has questions don't hesitate to ask. I can send some pictures to those who are serious. I really love this car it gets great fuel economy 29-30 mpg average, pulls hard with the turbo and rare 6 speed manual, no rust (car has been in North Carolina) low maintenance if properly cared for, and is comfortable enough for long trips."

Gun is located in Waco. Will accept cash FTF. Will ship on buyer within TX. Would like to sell today. Come get it for $1200, today only.

I have decided to sell one of my target guns. I have shot 1/2"" groups at 100 and 5/8"" groups at 200 with 53 grain Hornady VMax's.

The barreled action is a special release Remington 700 VTR in .223. Normal VTR's have a 22"" triangular barrel with a factory muzzle break; my rifle has a 26"" triangular barrel with no break. I have all the paperwork and (I think) the original box.

The trigger has been professionally tuned and breaks at a crisp 2 pounds.

The barreled action is bolted into an Accuracy International AICS 1.5 chassis system. I have painted the stock and it looks great (see pictures below). This thing is solid. Period.

The rifle comes with three Accuracy International ten-round mags.

The bipod, mount, rings, and scope are not included unless otherwise negotiated.

The gun, trigger work, AICS and AI mags - $1200 today only.

I also have an excellent CompTac Minotaur IWB; hands down the most comfortable and concealable I've found.  I also will throw in a Pachmayr grip

So here's the deal; I love this gun.  It's great stopping power in a small, easy to control package.  I have maybe 200-250 rounds through it, and it's been cleaned and hasn't a mark on it.  The problem is, I have a bad back and sit/drive a lot for work.  The tightness of my gun belt is causing pain, and I need to get rid of it.  I want to move to ankle carry, and the Shield is just a tad too big for that.  

I am leaning towards a revolver; SW airweight or possibly a Ruger, but will also consider semi-auto as well.  It has to be small and light; if you have an ankle holster great, if not it's no big deal.  I have quite a bit of .40 in both plinking and defense that we can work into the right trade.

Great little gun unfortunately I am moving to California soon and Springfield won't make a 10 round magazine for it. It comes with the XD gear (speed loader, dual magazine holder, holster and an excellent case), an extra mag (3 19 rounders total),a cqc serpa holster and a comptac mtac shell.

It also has a Springer Precision trigger kit installed by a professional gunsmith that makes the trigger pretty awesome. Link to kit at end of post.

Mostly looking to trade for something but will take cash offers to. I'm open to almost any gun in trade with the only caveat being that the firearm be California ok so if it is a handgun they have to make 10 rounders for it. No ars, aks etc...
I really like HKs and Sigs will of coarse add cash on my part if your stuff is worth more.
Send me an offer with what you have. Emails are free. Worst I can say is not interested.

All rules and laws will be followed. Must have foid and abide by waiting periods.
I don't care if you are offering a mint condition factory original Sig p210 and you'll add 10000 dollars no foid no deal.
