It's not the X-Mark trigger........it's the older style Remington trigger..........(that's a good thing!).  It has a Weaver 20 moa rail.  It has been fired 19 times.  I wasn't planning to shoot it but I couldn't resist.  After all, it's an ultra mag.   I shot the gun according to instructions from the best gunsmith around.  He scoped the bore before it was fired and again after 10 rounds......then again after 9 more rounds.  Amazing accuracy and even more amazing trajectory.  Wanna kill a deer at 500 yards?  This will do it pretty easily with good optics.  I'm willing to sell outright or trade."

This is your perfect all-purpose hunting / camping / survival gun.

So basically I bought a rem 700 and it shot amazing for a out of box rifle (1/2 moa) so I decided to leave the action, barrel, and bolt alone because every gunsmith said just leave it so I did! bought the aics so then it is 100% free float put the trigger and everything else on and after I was done with it. The best I shot was a 5 shot grouping of .297 MOA!!!!!! Most high powered 308 builds don't shot this well. I need cash so I can buy a bike! So NO TRADES!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

notes:
Megastar has internal slide rails, instead of more usual external rails. This pistol features non-ajustable sights. Magazine capacity is quite impressive, especially when speaking about the period of the early 1990s, and is 12 rounds of .45ACP 
Overall, Megastar represents one of the strongest designs in auto-pistols, heavy but powerful and built to last forewer. Heavy weight also helps to control the recoil of the powerful cartridges used.

The Scabbard is missing its prongs for the belt. Try to find a better price for an Authentic Mark I in this condition. Belonged to an avid WWI/WWII collector. One of the first Knives of US Special Operations the Rangers and the Marine Raiders the fathers of Marine Recon. 

The Mark I trench knife was an American trench knife designed by officers of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) for use in World War I. It had a 6.75 in (17.1 cm) double edged dagger blade useful for both thrusting and slashing strokes, unlike previous U.S. trench knives such as the M1917 and M1918. The handle is made of cast bronze and uses a conical steel nut to hold the blade in place. The Mark I's blade was blued with a black oxide finish, the bronze handle was chemically blackened, with cast spikes on the bow of each knuckle. The spikes were intended to prevent an opponent from grabbing the knife hand, as well as to provide a more concentrated striking surface when employed in hand-to-hand combat

Of those Mark I knives released for service, most were issued in 1942 and 1943 to soldiers serving in elite Army Ranger and airborne formations, though some Mark I knives were used by Marine units in 1942 and 1943, in particular marines serving with the four Marine Raider battalions.

It is estimated that there are only 1600-1700 WW marked Caracal pistols in the US in total. 

I am the second owner of this pistol, and have only personally put about 30 rounds through it. The original owner treated it very well and shows no wear - he put very few rounds through it as well (not quite sure of total), as it simply sat in his safe for the majority of the time he owned it. I own the full size Caracal and simply need the money for another project. This is a sweet shooting gun - take advantage of this unique opportunity to own a great pistol.

Mainly need the cash right now, but will entertain compelling trades. 

Comes with original case, lock, and 2 magazines. 

NC CCW or purchase permit with NC DL required. Bill of sale will be provided. 

Will ship to your FFL for $30 (my cost). Credit cards accepted with 4% fee.

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

will sell lot of ammo/mags  for $220 or trade for magazines for my 45's listed, or the .40 listed.. or a gun

Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 

KelTec p11, in good shape, belt clip installed, one 10 round mec gar magazine.  This is an excellent, accurate and reliable subcompact 9mm, and I love it outside of the fact that it is configured for a right handed shooter.  I am left handed and need something with either ambidextrous controls or reversible mag release

savage mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun comes with factory 11 round mag, and a mec-gar extended 15 round magazine.

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modelled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central American special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus model 809 - This 9mm has been well kept, and is modelled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central American special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 17+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.  This version is bi-tone."

will sell lot of ammo for $220 or trade for magazines for my 45's listed, or the .40 listed.. or a gun

Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 

Maverick bullpup shotgun.  18 inch barrel, only 28"" overall length!  5+1 capacity and the perfect size to deploy in small areas while still maintaining a full size barrel.  It is well used but still in perfect working order.  the bullpup frame will accommodate any mossberg 500 style reciever

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

The Millennium PRO"" features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. This gun is in good condition with one small finish wear spot.  one mag."

The 1-4x CMR (Close Medium Range) scope is the scope you need. This relatively short 30mm tube scope does not add a lot of weight to any rifle, and thanks to the large diameter of the scope tube, it lets in a lot of light for a bright target image. Also, due to the high quality fully multi-coated lenses, that image is also clear and sharp. An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter's eye to the center of the scope. To insure that the target is fully visible, this reticle has only a horizontal crosshair, with a partial vertical lower crosshair. The upper half of this reticle leaves the scope clean and uncluttered. Plus, the lower crosshair features short bar aiming points calibrated for standard .223 and .308 service ammo, which are very precise out to 600 meters.

This is not your everyday plastic Foregrip / Bi-Pod that you can purchase for $20. This Foregrip is made of Polymer with the legs being made of Aluminum 6061-T6 Hard Coated Anodize for Superior Durability and are independently adjustable so if you're not on an even surface, you can adjust the legs and be 100% level. These Foregrips sell for $149, Google and check for yourself. The light is a Nebo Protec that is already attached to Foregrip with a pressure switch ( See picture 6 ). All you have to do is squeeze Foregrip handle lightly and it turns on the light or laser. There is a blue button on top of the light that you change the function of the light to a different mode. After changing the mode, the pressure switch will still activate the same way, you now just have a different mode. If you don't want to use the pressure switch, I have the end cap for the light ( to use as a regular flashlight ) and I also have the piece that fits back into the slot on the Foregrip where the pressure mount is. More information and specifications are further down in this listing. I bought these last week to put on my Mossberg 715T, tactical 22 but the gun was stolen while we were gone for the weekend. I have about $280 in both of these items. These T-POD Foregrips / Bi-Pods are made for many guns for the Israelian Army. These two items can be mounted to any rifle that has Picatiny or Weaver Rails. Ideal for Assault Rifles or Target Rifles

Not a flaw original box paper work. This rifle was unfired until today. I believe it was made in mid 80s. I know this cause I received it from a family member who bought it brand new.  I fired 20 rounds total the last 12 all fell 1/2 bullseye  after zeroing scope in. The only reason I am getting rid of is I shoot left eye dominant. If u don't understand what I mean don't ask.

SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is operated using delayed blowback principle, which is rather unusual for shotguns. It employs roller-delayed action with two-part bolt and two rollers in its head, which enter recesses in the barrel extension. This action is very similar to that found in many older weapons by Heckler & Koch (such as G3 or MP5) based on WW2-era German Stg.45(M) design.Model 1216 shotgun is built using bullpup layout, with polymer housing / stock and steel upper receiver, connected by cross-pins. Ejection ports are located on either side of the receiver, with one which is not in use being closed by removable ejection port cover. Normally Model 1216 shotgun is set up to eject to the right, although user can disassemble the gun and set it for left-side ejection, if required. One of most unusual features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is its feed system. It employs detachable rotary magazine with four channels, each containing its own spring and follower. Each channel can hold up to four rounds in the same manner as any common tubular shotgun magazine. When magazine is inserted into the gun, it is located below the barrel. To feed the weapon, magazine should be rotated until one of its compartments is in topmost (12’o clock) position and aligned with feed port in the gun. Once it is done, cartridge retainer in the topmost compartment is disengaged, and first cartridge is pushed rearwards from magazine and onto the lifter platform in the gun. Once all four cartridges from topmost magazine are expended, bolt hold-open device engages the bolt in its rearward (open) position, indicating that magazine compartment is empty. After that, user shall push the indexing lever(s) at the front of the magazine, and manually rotate it 90 degrees to either side, until next full compartment is aligned with the feed port. Once it is done, fresh round is automatically fed from magazine and bolt hold-open device is released, chambering the round and making gun ready for the next shot. Once all four compartments are empty (or firing is done), rotary magazine cam be removed from the gun by pushing magazine release button, located in front of the magazine, below the muzzle. Empty or partially loaded magazines can be topped up only when removed from the gun.Other features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun include conveniently located manual safety, which can be set on left or on right side of the gun, and set of integral Picatinny type rails, which can be used to install variety of sighting devices (Red Dot or iron sights), as well as laser aiming modules and/or tactical flashlights."

It has a Well p90 stock that has been gutted and the shell alone used, bedded to accept the the 597 receiver and barrel which is completely stock. Cutouts have been made in the stock for the charging handle and ejection of spent cases as well as for the magazine release and cutout on the bottom for a magazine well to accept either the included factory 10 round magazine or either of the 30 round remington magazines that are included 1 clear and 1 black. There is two safeties the one on the trigger as well as a access door on the butt of the stock that you can open that allows you to engage the 597's safety. It was made using a 20"" barrel to make the firearms overall length meet the federal guidelines 26"" minimum OVERALL rimfire rifle length there by also surpassing the guideline for 16"" minimum rimfire barrel length. I have built several .22 conversions this was my first one I did based on seeing many other internet forums where people did this with the 10/22 I just happen to prefer my 597s and model 60's a little more so thought I would give it a go. It shoots great runs as should be expected with minimal jams ftf fte than a 597 would in a regular stock out of roughly 3-400 rounds that have been fired in this rifle maybe 3 or 4 failures and I attribute that to the 30 rd mags as they tend to hiccup in all my 597's every once in awhile. There is no optic included so you would need to supply your own reflex sight red dot scope what ever you prefer. This was a brand new rifle that was bought to put into this stock I also have a original stock that can go with it if you would like. The clear 30rd mag has been used the black one is new. This is a very fun unique well functioning firearm that is a very close replica to the real FN p90 dimensions weight firing characteristics all similar yet fires the much less expensive .22lr. Will entertain cash offers not sure what to ask have several hours of assembly as well as cost of rifle mags stock etc... would really like to do some trading so make some fair offers. Thanks for looking!!!"

Survival Slings are gun slings made out of real 550 paracord and can be custom made. Many different options to choose from. The survival sling has some essential tools to surviving in the wilderness. Plain paracord slings are also available.

3 Different End options depending on gun:
----- Quick detach swivels
----- Hk style hooks
----- Snap enclosure ends

I designed these slings to incorporate:

-80+' of real 550 paracord
-over 25' 8lb. mono fishing line (inside off weave #2)
-3 fishing hooks 
-1 sewing needle sewn inside patch on webbing
-5' sewing thread
-7"" stainless survival knife 
-flint/magnesium bar
-compass (that works)

These slings include what I consider to be essentials in a wilderness survival application. A fire building method, shelter building tools, a means to catch and/or hunt food, a sturdy knife, navigation tool, sewing kit, and even if the slings paracord is dismantled entirely, a sling can be made using the 1"" webbing and sewing kit included.

Slings are typically adjustable from 33""-43"" (custom lengths are custom priced.)

COLORS: Black; O.D. green; desert tan; charcoal gray; coyote brown; woodland camo; red & black camo; pink camo.

Prices range from $40 for just plain paracord sling. $60 for survival sling w/ knife. More pics upon request. Shipping available.
