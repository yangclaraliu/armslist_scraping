This is a Model 949 9 shot revolver in 22LR (will shoot 22 shorts, longs as well). The gun is in excellent shape for its age....the only noteable issues are a small crack in the back of the grip (pictured), but it has enough space left to be sanded and nicely refinished. There is some patina which is to be expected for a gun of this age. Also for revolver fans, you'll like this - this gun has a Single Action style cylinder, but can be pulled off using a double action trigger pull (super cool!!). The gun shoots super well too, and is really accurate as well.

This gun is in excellent condition, having seen minimal use over the past 3 months I have owned it.  In my honest opinion, these M10's might be the best AK's on the market right now (except arsenals).  With the scope the gun is a 2 MOA shooter from mag resting.  Much better than almost every other AK I have shot.  The quick detach scope mount is rock solid, I have removed it multiple times to use iron sights and when replaced was pretty much dead nuts on zero.  The scope is a very nice compact scope that fits well if you want to shoot out to distances past 100 yards.  The Tapco mag it came with is fantastic, no issues whatsoever.  The quad rail is a very nice touch, and the trigger is perfect for tactical style applications.  Gun has about 300 rounds through it, that is all.  

This is a very cool, and customizable AK, one which is very unique to the market.  I own a few ""Commy Tommy's"" and now have my eyes set on getting an AR platform rifle.  Need to make room, so unfortunately this one has to go.

You will also receive 3 boxes of ammo.

I am asking $750 or best offer

Will trade for AR platform rifles, cetmes, other tactical platform rifles + cash to add if necessary, please message me if you have something I may be interested in.

I'm selling my bike because I really don't ride it anymore and the bike just sits in my garage. Since May it's been ridden about 10 miles. I bought it brand new and have barely ridden it over the years. Right now it's got 995 miles on it. The bike runs flawlessly and is a lot of fun to ride. It handles as if it was on rails and since most people don't know what a supermoto is it always gets attention. 

It's got an FMF exhaust and a jet kit. I've modified the tail end to remove the mud flap and clean it up a bit. I've always kept the chain lubed and changed the oil and filter often.

The rear plastics are painted white as there was a scuff on the right rear. It's plastidip coating so it can be removed completely by just peeling it off. The bike is great for anyone and is very easy to ride. Very economical too, it costs me about $80 to insure and it gets around 70 MPG. 

No test rides until I have cash in hand. A guy recently dumped a friends harley and took off. I'm trying to avoid something like that. 

Kawasaki and Honda discontinued their supermotos so they are starting to become very hard to find. 

$3400 title in hand, firm on price. If it doesn't sell, I'll just keep it and ride it for the rest of the summer and fall.

I am looking to sell a like new Parker Pioneer XP ready to hunt Compound Bow with 
accessories and arrows. Bow and all accessories were only used for a couple of days. You cannot tell it from new. This would be a great entry level bow for anyone looking to get into archery. It is a fast and quite bow. Don't spend 4-5x as much when you problaby won't notice the difference. 

It is currently set at a 29"" draw length, and unlike some more expensive bows, you don't need to buy new cams to go to a longer draw length. This bow is adjustable between 29-31 inches.
The draw weight is currently set to approximately 62.5 lbs which is also very easy to adjust with an allen wrench. It is adjustable from 60-70 lbs.

Will include receipt. Bow not yet registered. I believe this will allow you to register it and get the lifetime warranty.  It includes a Cobra 3 pin Fiber Optic Sight, Hostage arrow rest, 3 Carbon Express Crush arrows with target points, D loop, and stabilizer.

Parker is a VA company and one of the largest bow manufacturers in the world. The lifetime warranty is backed up by some of the best service in the industry. Parker bows are regulary rated as high as the big name bows when they are allowed to compete. They just don't spend millions of dollars on advertising. 
This is Parker's flagship model in the XP line. Their goal with this model was to create a quiet and shock free package. The bows is light weighing in at 3.85 lbs. It has a walnut grip.

This stock free floats the barrel and mounts the receiver to aluminum bedding pillars for much better accuracy and has adjustable length of pull and comb height. Other than the stock and the 1913 scope mount rail the gun is stock. The scope is not included but I will include it if you want, its wearing a Leupold Mark 4 LR/T M1 fixed 10x scope. If you want the scope with the gun we can negotiate a price on that separately but keep in mind that this is a super high quality military grade scope. If you just want a crappy walmart special el cheapo scope there are plenty here on armslist. I will also include no extra charge, the factory stock which is the grey Hogue overmold stock. Bore is in great condition and it shoots great. I put this gun together to shoot extreme long range and realized that wasn't my thing before putting many rounds through it. The picture below was a group I got last time I had it out (100 yards, cheap factory ball ammo!) Don't underestimate the importance of a quality stock in a precision rifle, a tight action and good barrel are nothing if they aren't securely mounted. Sorry for the not too great pics, I'm using a camera phone and the lighting is bad. If you are interested and want more pictures just message me and I can send you more. This is a sub MOA rifle with cheap ball ammo and a .25 MOA rifle with quality loads."

The Magpul PMAG 40 Gen M3 AR-15 Magazine reflects five years of research and development to advance the already proven PMAG design. Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures.

Internally, a new low friction, 4-wayanti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine's body. These ""smoother"" side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions. The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way. 

The PMAG 40 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

This rifle is chambered in  5.56 and .223 although only marked .223, you can call Ruger and ask for yourself. I installed a Vintage, all steel heat shield to replace the clunky looking metal and plastic factory one. I installed a Mo-Reaper Hooded and ported front sight/ supressor. It comes with a Like new Buttler Creek Stainless folding stock. 2 factory scope rings. A flat top rail. I have 5 Factory Ruger magazines, all new some still in packaging. one each 5 rnd 10 rnd 20 rnd and two 30 rnd. Also comes with four Steel 40 rnd, four steel 30 rnd, and one stainless steel 30 rnd. Thats 14 total magazines. All after market magazines are High quality Made in the USA. Not cheap Chinese knock off with feed problems or polymer crap. I bought the rifle brand new at Big 5 on sale for $875 with tax, I still have the receipt. It comes with the box and all paperwork. I paid $120 for the folding stock, $130 for the Mo Reaper, 30 for the heat shield. $25 for the rail. Thats where my Savy buying ended. As for the magazines, I was lucky enough to buy them during the scare and spent over $700. I know I got killed but I thought they were going after high capacity mags. So real money I am out over $1850. However that is not your problem. I am firm at $1000 cash only, ABSOLUTELY NO TRADES. Even used you couldn't buy all of this for under a $1k.

Their answer was the 7n1 round. This ammunition is match grade and produced in extremely limited quantities for military use only. It is the most accurate ammunition available for your PSL/Dragunov rifle. Not only was the round designed for hair-splitting accuracy, but it was also developed with a steel core and a hollow spot in the nose of the bullet with a lead knocker behind it. This means that upon impact into a person, that knocker moves forward into the hollow spot, destabilizing the bullet and causing it to tumble into the target creating massive injury. Very deadly stuff. It comes packaged in bundles of 20 marked with the Russian word for 'sniper'. The packaging is removed before going into combat so that if captured you cannot be identified as a sniper, who is the most hated person on a battlefield. Scarce even in the Russian army (according to the account of a sniper in the Afghan war), this ammunition is not exported by Russia, and is not normally sold to civilians. This stuff is a must have for someone collecting the Dragunov or PSL rifles, as it was created just for them, or shoot it to get the most accuracy out of your Dragunov. Price is per 20 round bundle."

These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are extremely accurate and reliable. The Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a monster round. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds.
