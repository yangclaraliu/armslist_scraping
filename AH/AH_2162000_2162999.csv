This is a brand new in box LWRC Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle, or REPR, LR-308 architecture semi-automatic rifle chambered for .308 Winchester. This REPR features a distinctive and practical Olive Drab Green cerakote finish on the receivers and handguard. The unique LWRC REPR is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm rounds on target in a variety of roles. The REPR rifle utilizes LWRC's patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blow-back to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R rails are easily removable and re-installed with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.please make sure you contact me at : bag_scar@outlook.com   for quicker response"

Synopsis 
For the first time since the original King James Version rolled off the presses, see and experience an exact, page-by-page, digitally re-mastered replica of the original 1611 printing in an economically priced edition. This replication contains the lavishly illustrated genealogy of key biblical figures---from Adam and Eve to Jesus. Enjoy the beauty of decorative initials, the original classic font, and the complete preface entitled 'From the Translators to the Readers' found in the original. There are only two differences between this special 400th anniversary edition and the original 1611 KJV---it does not contain the deuterocanonical books and has been reduced from its massive 12' x 16' pulpit-sized folio to this manageable keepsake. Now you can embrace the elegance, majestic style, and rich cadence of the first printing of the 1611 King James Version Bible.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

This version takes series 92 magazines. It is also a bit of an ""in betweener"" model (made in 2010) -- it is the later version that has the pic rail on top between the sights, but not the most recent version that has the checkered foregrip and pieces that protect the safety.

I am the second owner of this Storm, and it is in great condition -- a rough estimate is that it has 500 rounds total through it. It is an excellent shooter, very accurate (almost boringly accurate out to 100 yds), eats any ammo I've put through it including Tula steel and Blazer aluminum, and has not seen heavy use. It is not a ""problem child"" that malfunctions, has problems, is damaged, or has any other issues. The only cosmetic issue is a small ding on forward edge of right side ejection port (see photo below), which is a fairly typical bit of wear for the Storm Carbine. It had some very light work done to the trigger/hammer/sear by a gunsmith that significantly improved the stock factory trigger pull (which is awful). I actually really love this carbine and hate to get rid of it -- its been a very comfortable, accurate, and reliable range toy -- but I just had the opportunity to pick up an MP5 clone, so this one has to go.

Comes with 2 x 15-round factory magazines (standard 92FS magazines) and 1 x 17-round aftermarket mag (also 92 FS compatible).

Accessories included (not installed on the carbine in the photos):
- AIM Sports red dot sight
- Forend tri-rail
- UTG Ergo foregrip

New in box Kel Tec KSG 12 gauge shotgun. Weight is 6.9lbs. Overall length is 26.1"". 18.5"" barrel. Pump bullpup style shotgun.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3""
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

 The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

The gun shots great, got it through a trade and ran 10 rounds through it just to see if it was something I could get into. But as much as it is a very nice gun, I'm just not a long range shooter or a hunter. So once again I'm looking to trade here. What I'm hoping to get in trade is a higher end sub compact chambered in 9mm or .380 for the wife. Although if someone has a trade that perks my interest I can always just let the wife pick out something at the gun store."

The Smith & Wesson 686+ has the more versatile round butt grip frame that can accommodate a wide selection of aftermarket grips to suit any hand size. With its intermediate size and weight, it is comfortable to grip by its finger grooved grip. Its overall configuration allows for a good position of the trigger finger around the narrow smooth trigger. The narrow, smooth trigger allowed the finger to roll over its surface,
preventing the tendency to pull the sights off target during the long double action stroke.

I fired about 20 rounds from it today just to zero the BUIS. This would make an excellent truck or trunk gun. Works and functions excellent, zeroed within 9 rounds at 100 meters. Has a Magpul pistol grip and comes one Magpul Gen 2 magazine, still unused, the factory hard case and the paper. It has an ambidextrious safety and the fun switch has a position for three round burst that unfortunately is just for show and does not work.

I am more interested in trading it than selling it but I valued it at $700.00 for a cash sale.

I would trade it for 9mm pistols of a Glock 20 and some additions to make it fair to both of us. A bolt action rifle in .223/5.56 like a Mossberg MVP would be an even trade or a Remington SPS.

A Smith ""K"" or ""L"" frame and maybe some cash to make it even, I would like an FNH  FNS-9, some Sigs (only in 9mm)

Don't hesitate to make an offer I am always courteous and civil.

This is a good fully functional M4gery but it is not a Tier One weapon. Great first AR or one that you are going to put some hard use to like in the trunk of your car.

There is a mandatory 24 hour wait for the rifle, if trading a pistol that increases to 72 hours and I am going out of town on the 3rd for 2-3 weeks so if you want to do this, jump on it."

   From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S.

What sets it apart from the 92FS is: 

Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.
Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.
“Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9.

Depending upon your offer, the Ruger will also come with a Bushnell Tactical First Strike Reflex Red Dot (#730005)  (different from others in that it has a sensor instead of an 'on-off' switch: remove the protective cover and its ready to go; put the cover back on to 'put it to sleep') (retails new for about $125 on-line).  The weapon hasn't had a lot of use (I play with my 10/22 more!) and, in consideration, would be considered 'lightly used.'  If you are unfamiliar with either the Ruger 22/45 Lite or the optic, I urge you to research both.  You'll find them both to be quality items with great reputations.

The Ruger comes with all its original accessories to include box, carry case, paperwork, manual, two 10 round magazines, etc.  The front sight has been replaced with a 'Hi-Viz' sight (still have the original sight).  The tactical rail, allowing the placement of optics, is already attached to the pistol.

If you think you have a 9mm or .40 cal CCW, or one of the below weapons, to trade, please call Bill at (501) five-nine-zero 9-4-2-6.  I urge you to research this fine weapon and do a cost comparison to what you want to trade.  If you think yours is worth a little more, I can throw in some cash and/or .22LR ammo.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, I have never had any failure to fire or failure to eject. Overall this is a very well made gun I just don't need it anymore (bought a kriss vector!) and I only have until monday to sell it to a MD resident. I paid $2200 for this gun; it came with 300 rounds of ammo, no magazines, a cmmg 22lr conversion bolt, and the hard case. I am keeping the 22lr conversion bolt.

You will get

RRA Elite Operator 2
RRA Dominator 2 eotech mount
2 x 20 round mags with speed loaders
80 rounds of .223
Hard Case
Magpaul bolt catch lever

I am selling to a MD resident only and I am asking $1800 obo. The paperwork will be done at a state police barrack and I will release the gun on the 8th day (as long as you pass my google background search). 

I will also sell the complete lower receiver for $550 obo
I would also be interested in trades (firearm related only).

If you contact me this weekend I can arrange for you to shoot it before you buy it.... It doesn't make sense not to test drive a car before you buy it!

This will be listed until monday, after that I am pulling it and keeping it.

I have since built an addiction to firearms and money has been drying up so I am looking to get rid of it for one of those two things.  
A quality handgun or a mid range AR15 would interest me.  Also bulk .40 ammo. And otherwise cash -
As for the virago the plan was to make it a bobber bike and it is well on the way there, the guys I bought it from didn't have a whole lot of general knowledge to put it lightly so I had a decent amount of work to do; all of that is complete now other than a throttle twist, & starter solenoid.  I can help you source these parts if you need help but ebay has been my friend thus far.  
These engines running are worth $500 alone so my asking price is very fair, the tranny and clutch are strong, brakes work well, idles well its just a pain to get started until you get the starter solenoid as its a somewhat heavy bike and you have to push start it as it sits, I ran this bike a few times before starting the disassembly and reassembly of the areas needing work.  Brand new rear tire, ignition, cables, and battery, were installed; also cleaned and rejetted the carb.
I bought this bike initially because of how great it runs, mechanically this thing is set.  It has $600 in brand new parts and more than that in initial purchase.  
  You will need to get a builders title, or a bonded title as the guy I purchased this from never sent the title to me and shortly after purchase disconnected his phone line (awesome right?) but that is pretty easy to attain once you get the few things it needs to be turn key start. Or to the mechanically inclined man you can buy another clean title virago frame for less than $250 and swap all of this over with ease. I have some great looking and brand new levers with a new brake master cylinder off of a sports bike to better fit with the flat bars.  This would also make a great parts bike for someone already with a project but I'd love to see someone finish the job and run it for what it is.  

Cash price is slightly negotiable.  Look up what these bikes sell for, you hardly ever see them for under $2000!!
Feel free to give me a call if its before 9:00; Adam REDACTED or text anytime!

Sorry about this pictures quality I took it at night and had to use my flash, get a hold of me and ask for another otherwise I will get it changed out for a better one asap."

Anyway, cabelas has a ruger 10/22 plain jane for $239.99. They have BX-25 mags for $21.99 each (call owatonna cabelas to verify if you want). Really the only thing they don't have in stock 24/7 is ammo but they do have it off and on and when they do, 100 rounds of CCI mini mags is $8.49 NOT $20 like online people think they cost. Anyway, if you have a decent deal on a nice little package most importantly is the gun and ammo, don't care much about mags. I'll be looking to buy on Friday October 4th (payday) so I'll have cash. Also too, I had someone flip out on me once and refuse to deal out of ignorance so I tell people now, I have permit to carry and almost always open carry so be prepared to meet a perfectly calm sane rational firearm owner who WILL have a Glock 35 on his hip. Thanks. Oh mandatory is you give me full details, what comes with in the deal and the PRICE. I'm not playing the guessing game cause you hope I'm dumb enough to way over pay. If you're interested enough to sell something, you should know what you're trying to get out of your it. Hopefully I'm not scaring anyone off thinking I'm crazy. Just really tired of these shitiots (shitiots = shit-idiots) online trying like hell to rip off everyone and their grandma. Your $300 10/22 is not worth $600 now, well I guess a few are but they're usually not so stock anymore, you know what I mean. Thanks.
