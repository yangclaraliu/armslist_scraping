The 7mm-08 rifle cartridge is one of the most efficient hunting cartridges for medium and large game found everywhere in north america.  Having LESS recoil than the .308 AND the 30-06, yet flatter trajectory than both, it screams in at around 2800 FPS with an impact of around 2500 ft-lbs.  Not to mention, since the parent case is .308, it is much easier and cheaper to reload than the 7mm magnum"

Was planning on using it as a DMR to pack with my bugout bag, but it's really quite a heavy rifle, especially when carrying ammo with it. Shoots great, and the HK slap is always fun.

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one. CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I really dont want to sell it but my wife is making me sell off a few guns to pay for a plumbing issue we have. Call or text me anytime.

Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur.

What should you do?
STOP USING YOUR 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP PISTOL AND CAREFULLY UNLOAD IT! 

To begin the upgrade process and for fastest response, click on the Get Started link at the top of the page. On that page enter your serial number and click Next.  If your pistol is subject to this recall, you will need to provide your name, address, phone number, and email address.  The serial number is located on the frame beneath the dust cover (accessory rail).  If you prefer, you may initiate the upgrade process by calling REDACTED.  If you no longer own the 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol, please advise Springfield of the current owner.

XD-S Serial Number

What pistols are involved?
This Safety Recall applies only to:
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm pistols - serial numbers between XS900000 and XS938700 
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols - serial numbers between XS500000 and XS686300.

This Safety Recall does not apply to any XD® or XD(M)® pistols.

What will Springfield do?
Springfield will send you a return authorization and mailing label, allowing you to return your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol to Springfield at no cost to you.  Springfield will upgrade your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol with the new components, and return it to you.  Springfield will provide tracking numbers so you can monitor the receipt and return of your upgrades.

Questions?
Visit www.springfield-armory.com for further information about this safety recall. You can reach the Springfield Armory Call Center at REDACTED.  Springfield apologizes for this inconvenience, but your safety is our paramount concern.

We greatly appreciate your loyalty to Springfield products."

These guns were made of some of the highest quality walnuts and were made at the same factory as the Winchester 101's with the better parts before they made the Winchesters for them.

There are very few of the model 512's available for sale across the internet ranging from $700 to $850 with recent sales.

These guns were made of some of the highest quality walnuts and were made at the same factory as the Winchester 101's with the better parts before they made the Winchesters for them. I have not had a chance to shoot this one yet but I have another O/U from Nikko and it is hands down the best O/U I have ever had the opportunity to shoot. 

There are very few of the model 512's available for sale across the internet ranging from $700 to 1900. This one is completly original with no parts being changed out as far as but plate and what not, from the looks it has been shot very little although there are signs of use. Easily a 90% if not 95% gun. Make me a reasonable offer after doing some research. I am willing to travel to make a good deal. 

Prefer cash only, trades only accepted if they are of higher value as I will have to turn around and resell.

Will consider offers/potential trades for rifles/shotguns. 

""Excellent trigger and great accuracy!
The trigger is very light and almost crisp. The little mushiness is hardly noticeable, since almost everyone shoots the gun as fast as possible. If you take your time, a 600 can be very accurate. Crosman really knew how to rifle a barrel, and they put the very best into this pistol. It's as accurate as a Crosman Mark I.

In demand!
A used 600 will bring $225 in shooting condition and $275 in excellent condition in the box. They shoot so well that they are in demand. When the UK relaxed their laws against CO2 guns years ago, the Brits went crazy importing the 600. For a while, you couldn't buy one for less than $350 in any condition. Those days are over, but don't expect to get a cheap one unless you get lucky."""

They were used to store electronics, so some of the pluck and pull foam has already been removed.  This hasn’t bothered me since the main section that has been removed is the perfect width for boxes of pistol ammo.  These cases make great range cases, as you can carry everything in one case.  I have no trouble bringing my three pistols, targets, and plenty of ammo to the range.  They’re lockable, watertight, and nearly indestructible.  You could fill it with ammo or valuables and bury it in your yard if you wanted.  Aside from the missing foam, these cases are in brand-new condition.  They were only used for storage, so there aren’t any scratches or anything on the outside.  I might be open to trades, especially for reloading supplies for .223 or .45acp.  Call or text anytime.

I put this rifle together with the intentions of hunting coyotes at night.  The PVS-14 mounts perfectly with the Redfield optic and it is amazing how well the two work together.  The nightvision optic can be removed by hand and the rifle can be fired with the same zero during daylight. I will also throw in a Vortex Sparc miniature red dot that I purchased to put on the rifle.  I wasn't able to get the red dot and the PVS-14 to co witness so that is why I went with the scope. The Redfield has two sets of turrets, one for 55 grn 5.56mm and one for 168 grn .308, that allow the shooter to make on the fly range adjustments by hand for the ballistics of either load.  I have tested the turrets on this AR shooting various 55 grn bullets and the adjustments are pretty much spot on.  I have all the paperwork and original packaging for all these items.

I would entertain the thought of splitting these items up.  If I were to split the pricing would be as follows:

-AR-15 with Burris P.E.P.R mount/Redfield scope or Vortex Sparc $1400
-PVS-14 with accesories ( Rail mount, Head harness w/ mount,  sacrificial lens cover, Carrying case) $2500
-Vortex Sparc Microdot $175

I have a few boxes of Remington 55 grn Accutips that I will throw in as well.  If a buyer is serious about buying this firearm I can arrange to get on a range during the evening when you can shoot the rifle using the nightvision.  I guarantee you will be impressed."

This boat was originally purchased by my dad in 1987 but he only used it two or three times on hunting trips. The boat is very clean and has no leaks. I inflated it a few weeks ago now and it is still just as solid as the day I pumped it up. All of the one way air valves (see picture) are also functioning perfectly so you wont have to scramble to cap it as air rushes out. The boat packs up small enough to get in a car trunk (case pictured) and weighs just 87lbs (according to the original specs). With the wood floor it is also much faster and more stable than many inflatables. The original patch kit is included and unused (I would recommend new glue however). The only damage on the boat are the slight scuffs from where a motor was mounted.

Everything you see is included in the sale price is $800 obo, I don't have the pump for inflating it in the field. I am keeping it inflated for any one to come look at. If you want to arrange something or have any questions please email."

It's a 1978 Series 70, I'm told.  I bought this from an estate.  It had been stored too long in a leather holster and the satin nickel finish was a little greyish and strange looking.  So, I sent it back to the Colt shop, then five months and $400 bucks later I have a nickel plated 1911 that's just too pretty to shoot.  (I have the paperwork.)  They spiffed it up and made sure it was safe, then put a new magazine in it too.  The only problem is a light idiot mark on the grip that is visible in the picture, other than that, it's perfect.

My guns are more tools than collectors items, so maybe a collector could get more use out of this than I do.  I'll take cash, or trade for silver.  Face to face, in or near Eugene.  Be prepared to show I.D. and sign a bill of sale.  Respond to the ad if you are interested.  I'd be happy to send more pictures to interested people."

everything is new & the box except for the loose shotgun shells (85 in the ziplock).

I took everything you see in the pics to Butches on Aurora. I had the pleasure of listening and learning from the owners daughter. She was really sweet and helped me price out everything at a discounted price.  Its in the box but is still older ammunition. 
We made to sure to check everything & she verified it all looked fine ready for use!

I added everything up I think it was $720 or some where around there but I am a fairly motivated seller so I thought I would lower to the price to $600 bucks. 

Instead of listing out what I have here over text i will take pictures of the original lists we wrote up. Sorry my hand writings not the best but you should be able to see it on the boxes to..

This is a great and reliable gun. My wife fires the .38 while I tame the .357...and trust me, the bark is not nearly as bad as the bite with the almighty .357!

The ammo alone runs about $120 at Green Top and Cabela's. Ammo will not be sold seperately.

-- 20 rounds of .357 Federal 158gr Hydra-Shok JHP Personal Defense
-- 61 rounds of .38 Remington 125gr FNEB range ammo

I also have the 67 once fired casings. If you are a reloader, I will sell these to you for an additional $10 (if not, I already have a buyer for the brass. 

RESPONSE TO INQUIRY:
The only windicator that CTD has in stock is the .38 only model, not the .357. It is $270 with free shipping. If you figure a minimum $25 for FFL transfer and $15 for federal and state background check, you are looking at $310 for the revolver alone. Throw in the $120 of ammo, and we're at $430 for the .38 model with ammo. The .357 runs about $50-70 more in most gun shops around here. You may find it for about $30-50 or so dollars cheaper online (gunbroker, etc.), but they all have shipping and FFL fees. I would say $425 is about fair unless you've got some trades in mind.

This beauty will make a fine addition to anyone's collection. Has an un-touched factory satin stainless steel finish with tight lockup and smooth action. Has been fired very little, if any. Comes with S&W box although not for this gun or a 686.
The Magnaport porting process is proven to reduce recoil by directing the spent gases upward to compensate for muzzle flip which means faster follow-up shots and better control of the handgun.

This is the one you've been waiting for, a highly collectible, beautiful piece you can use for CCW or just to shoot!

Placing a bid on this piece certifies that you can legally purchase and own this weapon in your city/county/state/locality. Sorry no sales to California. If you are a resident of Missouri it may be possible for local pick up. Thanks for looking and good luck!

At the heart of the Super Vinci is the In-Line Inertia Driven® system, designed to reliably chamber light 2 3/4-inch loads up through the most powerful 3 1/2-inch Magnums. The Super Vinci features Practical Speed Performance™ (PSP)—a matter of how fast you can shoulder the gun... acquire the target... shoot... and recover from recoil to prepare for the next shot.Precise instruments developed by Benelli measures and creates graphs that illustrate the total recoil of the Super Vinci against its competitors. Other guns have a peak recoil that’s as much as 15 percent greater than the Super Vinci’s. But more significantly, the total felt-recoil of the competitors’ guns is as much as 22 percent more. Combine the In-Line Inertia Driven® action with superior balance, light weight, reduced recoil and minimal muzzle climb and the shooter experiences the real timeline of performance speed where the Super Vinci has no equal.
