Factory Description:

Designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Some sling plates may not be compatible. Includes SSAR-15 SBS , interface block, hex key and instructions.

It is built on a Waffen Werks receiver with a Tapco G2 trigger assembly. These rifles are imported as parts kits with chopped receivers and rebuilt to comply with 922r at Waffen Werks in Knoxville TN. They were originally selective fire, so they were once the real deal. All parts on this rifle match 100%. I am asking $800 OBO with the goody package. If you want just the rifle, I am asking 650.

This rifle can't be shipped to states with ""assault weapons"" bans. Obviously. If you live in the state of Maryland and you are reading this, sorry, I can't sell this to you unless you reside in another state that doesn't have such laws. Buyer pays all shipping fees.

What I am including with the rifle:

Bulldog rifle case
4 Burned Orange tapco mags
2 Bulgarian Mil-Surp mags (circle 10 and 21)
UTG MNT973 AK Side Mount with Double Rails (brand new)
Mil Surp butt stock cleaning kit
40 rounds of Golden Tiger 59gr non-corrosive ammo
40 rounds of Wolf 69gr non corrosive ammo
Already installed Valmet Galil recoil buffer

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

I've about lost it with this site because ya'll can't seem to figure out what your weapons are worth. Probably most readers of this will be preached to like a choir, a bunch of the remainder will be insulted, and a few light bulbs will turn on. This is for the light bulb crew:

1) Your NIB gun isn't new if you took it home. If you aren't an FFL, then that gun is used. So - 90% of your original purchase price will sell it. Unless it is a rare, hard-to-find, or coveted item, you won't get your purchase price out of it because we will go down to our LGS and get it NIB ourselves.

2) Purchase price isn't the MSRP. We have all seen that the MSRP is $1100, but we paid $975 for whatever it is. So be aware that anyone can type the model you listed in Google and have a real price in 10 seconds.

3) Your Sightmark red dot and Simmons Wal-Mart scope do NOT add anything to the price. Just because you want to get rid of the garbage you bought or the fact that you spent a grand on an AR and then less than 10% on your glass - doesn't mean anyone else wants to be part of that. Either ""throw it in free"" or just keep it for your next bad decision. Give it your kid for his/her air rifle. But don't act like you are making a sweet package.

4) If I can buy it at my store for $20 or $800 or any other number, don't price yourself at the same or higher. I can't tell you how many ads for 33 Round Glock 9mm magazines I've responded to because they wanted $50-$60. The price is $34.95 for these in any store that is reputable. If you don't know a reputable store, write me. I'll send you their way. Your .22LR brick of 500 isn't worth $100. Your Beta drum isn't worth $400. Welcome to ""The Democrats didn't pass the AWB and you should have put your money into stocks 2013."" Buy up all the stuff you want - save it for a rainy day - but at least look outside to see if it is raining before you post your RIDICULOUS ads.

That being said, for the 10% of you that I would actually buy or sell a weapon to - thanks for posting. Carry daily, carry safely, and carry on.

220,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2504220,For Sale:  Smith and Wesson WW2 Victory Model .38spl C&R Eligible!,"Leesburg, Sterling, Chantilly, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 425,"Listed On: Thursday, January 16, 2014",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"This is a beautiful Victory model Smith and Wesson, in the original wartime parkerized ""battleship grey"" finish. The manufacture on it appears to be 1944, though I can't verify that it was an issue gun. The Victory models are essential Model 10's before there was a model 10 - they are a K frame revolver, with a 6-shot cylinder, and a 4"" pencil barrel, with half-lug. Like most Smith's, this is a double action revolver. This is .38 special ONLY - remember not to try .357 or .38+P in it!

This one has a case hardened trigger and hammer, and the hammer is factory rounded for holster draw. The sights are integral to the frame and barrel. Barrel is pinned, though not recessed. Finish has honest use, but is still VG - no dings or scratches. Barrel and cylinder are VG as well - clean, with no pitting, and well defined lands/grooves. The original plan walnut grips were replaced before I got it with a set of really incredible target K-frame grips - these will go on any of your other square or round butt Smiths, or will blissfully live on this gun. Note in particular the S&W medallion on the palm swell. 

This gun also has a really nice fitted Leather holster that goes with it, which will also accomodate any other 4"" K-frame Smith. 

My only grief with the gun is that a previous owner (probably the same one that replaced the grips) lowered the front sight. The gun shoots high at 25 yards, and is dead on at 50. If you reload, I'd be happy to give you a reduced load that I built to let this one shoot at 25 yards accurately.

Always happy to respond with trades! Happy to ship to a C&R, or FFL, if you desire.

Please note - I will require a Virginia 21+ License and a Voter ID/CCW permit."

Grilling and Jim Beam are synonymous with sharing good times with family and friends. The same folks who enjoy Jim Beam are the same folks who use their grills to entertain at a weekend barbeque or just cook a special meal for their family. The new Jim Beam 4-Burner Stainless Grill gives you all the power and versatility you need for backyard grilling, and to share with family and friends.
Big enough to cook for 4-6 people with 696 square inches of grill space (493 square inches primary, and 203 square inches secondary), and a total of 61,000 BTU.
4 individually controlled main burners, aligned front-to-back, give you the versatility you need to grill over direct heat, or set up with indirect heat.
Burners are stainless steel tube-style, and each provide 12,000 BTU to give you the power you need for high-heat grilling.
Includes a 13,000 BTU side burner for added versatility.
Cooking grates are cast-iron; designed to give beautiful grill marks.
Hood is a double-layer design to hold in heat, with stainless steel on the outside, and aluminum plating on the inside.  All of the burners are stainless steel as well, providing longer life.
Electronic ignition for easy start-up, and a handy temperature gauge, centered in the hood to give you “oven temperature” as opposed to grill temperature; enabling better control over longer cooking applications."

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

Grilling and Jim Beam are synonymous with sharing good times with family and friends. The same folks who enjoy Jim Beam are the same folks who use their grills to entertain at a weekend barbeque or just cook a special meal for their family. The new Jim Beam 4-Burner Stainless Grill gives you all the power and versatility you need for backyard grilling, and to share with family and friends.
Big enough to cook for 4-6 people with 696 square inches of grill space (493 square inches primary, and 203 square inches secondary), and a total of 61,000 BTU.
4 individually controlled main burners, aligned front-to-back, give you the versatility you need to grill over direct heat, or set up with indirect heat.
Burners are stainless steel tube-style, and each provide 12,000 BTU to give you the power you need for high-heat grilling.
Includes a 13,000 BTU side burner for added versatility.
Cooking grates are cast-iron; designed to give beautiful grill marks.
Hood is a double-layer design to hold in heat, with stainless steel on the outside, and aluminum plating on the inside. All of the burners are stainless steel as well, providing longer life.
Electronic ignition for easy start-up, and a handy temperature gauge, centered in the hood to give you “oven temperature” as opposed to grill temperature; enabling better control over longer cooking applications."

This revolver is in overall excellent condition (see photos, but really need to see in person to appreciate), not carried, barely shot, rarely handled, well-oiled and generally well taken care of. Finish is not perfect, but close, especially for a snub from 1968. Trigger pull is smooth, as expected, timing is good, lock up is tight. Comes with original box and manual, both carefully kept in surprisingly good condition. 

Serial is 633XXX. In photos where it appears (box sticker, manual front page), the serial number has been smudged digitally, but obviously not altered in real life.

Asking $460 cash FTF in Birmingham, AL. Don't miss this opportunity to pick up a very nice piece with original box! Would be great for showing off, both at home and at the range.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Thanks for looking!

Nothing particular in mind. It's time for a change up. 

I am seeing the 75b selling in the $400-$450 neighborhood and the Kadet Kit selling for $300-$400. (Magazines are also at a premium - ~$45-50 each for the Kadet). Total value of trade or cash offer would be in this general neighborhood. If I have overvalued this, I am happy to learn the appropriate value. Not interested in ripping anyone off, just looking to get a fair trade. 

The CZ 75B has 2 sets of grips - rubber grips and the factory plastic grips (both CZ brand).
Comes with two MEC-GAR 17 round mags, one 15 round mag and one 10 round mag. The factory case, manual and lock are included.

The Kadet has the .22 slide stop, four 10 round mags and a mag loader. The factory case, manual and cleaning rod are included. 

9mm and .22 have functioned flawlessly. Even with cheap lead nosed .22 ammo. 

Very easy to convert between 9mm and .22 - just remove the 9mm mag, slide stop and slide, put on the .22 slide, slide stop and .22 mag and you are ready to go. Same as normal takedown procedure. 

Both are trouble free and fun to shoot. The CZ has a comfortable grip.

I have MN permit to carry & MN driver's license. 

Would be interested in a firearm of equal value in 9mm, .38 special, .357 Mag, .45, or 10mm. Might be interested in Rifles or Shotguns as well. 

Prefer to trade but would also consider cash offers. Prefer to trade/ sell together but will consider all offers. 

EDIT: I am also in the market for a reliable and cheap daily driver capable of taking me 30 miles to and from work each day. Looking to get in the ballpark of 25-30mpg in a car."

The award-winning Springfield XD is engineered to work with your body to help you reach your full potential as a shooter. Pick up an XD for the first time, raise it to eye level, point at a target and you'll likely be looking right down the sights. The XD Point & Shoot Ergonomics make it feel more like an extension of your body than an object in your hand. Fully hammer-forged barrels with precision rifling enhance accuracy. All critical internal parts are forged and precisely machined from billet for durability. Steel slides are mated to super-tough, all-weather polymer frames. Tough, corrosion-resistant finishes keep them looking great. Stainless steel magazines drop free when the release is activated. Easy, no-tool disassembly makes routine maintenance a snap. Standard features on all models include a striker status indicator, grip safety, loaded-chamber indicator, Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, ambidextrous magazine release and accessory rail. Every XD pistol in this line comes with a package that includes two magazines, a magazine loader, a magazine pouch, a holster and a hard-plastic carry case.

The Micro Slick coating is able to lubricate, resist wear, and also act as an anti-seize agent while preventing galvanic corrosion or bonding of the metals.  Micro Slick is virtually unaffected by temperatures ranging between 800 and 1200 degrees Fahrenheit  When two adjoining surfaces are coated with Micro Slick it prevents surface-to-surface contact, which reduces friction and wear between the two surfaces. An example of this would be to coat a bolt carrier group on an AR 15 and the inside of the upper receiver. This combination would reduce the amount of friction between the parts and help the firearm to function more smoothly.

Micro Slick out-performs its competitors, such as Nickel Boron (NiB-X), Fail Zero, NP3, Titanium Nitride, etc. Because of this, Micro Slick is not only used on firearms, it is used on high performance vehicles as well, including vehicles in NASCAR.

Micro Slick is generally applied, but not limited, to internal, moving parts such as engine parts, bolts, bolt carrier groups, trigger groups, rails, etc. This product comes in a dark grey or black color only.

It is my last .45acp pistol so with it, I will include 6 x 50 round boxes of factory 230gr ball ammo: two boxes of Remington and four boxes of American Eagle. It has had only 50 rounds through it but you cannot tell that it has been fired outside of the factory. It comes with everything that was originally shipped with the pistol by Remington. It is a newer pistol as it does not have the ERPC marking that was evident on the earlier versions. I would consider a trade for a quality .38/.357 snub nose revolver.

You will be required to have a valid FOID, sign a bill of sale, and abide by the state mandated 72 hour waiting period. Also, since you will not be taking possession until after January 1st, you must provide your FOID information when you agree to purchase this pistol as a new law goes into effect that requires private party sellers to obtain approval from the ISP before delivering a firearm to another private party. If you can't or won't agree to the foregoing, I will not sell this pistol to you."

 Factory Description:

 Designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Some sling plates may not be compatible.

I have a barely used Ruger .25-06 M77 Hawkeye (right handed) bolt action rifle with scope for sale.  This rifle has only been fired 15 times and I will even throw in the remaning Black Hills ammunition from the box!  The scope is professionally mounted and the rifle is zeroed at 100 yards (for the BDC to work).   It is a great rifle but I need the money for another project.  

This is an incredible deal.  Considering the rifle MSRP is $899, scope is $410, rings at least $40, sling and sling swivels around $40.....that comes out to about $1,389.00! Almost $500 worth of savings and not counting the cost and time of having the scope mounted and zeroing the scope.

Beautiful Monte Carlo Walnut stock, ultra smooth bolt action, 22""micro-grooved barrel, ""PRO-FIRE"" user adjustable trigger and factory 7 round blued magazine.
I purchased it brand new 6 months ago to complement one I already owned identical to this one. Not a scratch or blemish to be found either. The girls are back to college and work and this one is rarely fired so I'm selling it. I am keep the other one for shooting steel targets on the silhouette range when it warms up again.

Also included is an Allen soft case, Simmons 8 point scope (3X9X40mm) with lens covers, weaver scope rings, security lock and a ""Marlin"" 10 round nickel plated magazine. All original boxing, packaging and owners literature is also included.

I will also throw in a 550 round box of Federal 22 LR. Everything needed for target and plinking fun. And this rifle is FUN to shoot!

The 22"" barrel and ""pro-fire"" trigger make this a very accurate rifle with run of the mill bulk ammo. I have experimented with several kinds of 22LR ranging from subsonic to hyper velocity and different brands as well. The only ammo it does not love is Winchester white box. They won't feed reliably. It really likes the newer Remington Golden bullets as well as some other less expensive cartridges.

$285 firm and includes everything shown. Local pick up only. Purchaser must be at least 18 years of age, a Wisconsin resident and able to legally purchase firearms in WI.

The boat is solid and sound and rides nice, planes out real quick. We bought the boat at the start of the summer with the plan to keep it for quite awhile but that is when we were living in north Alabama and went had 3 nice lakes to go out in. Now that we are moving back to the Coast I am more of an Island person not a river/lake person, So I hope to sell or trade this boat for something bigger center console preferred.
This boat runs great and rides nice. We have it up to roughly 40-45 mph with 4 people in the boat.

The good to this boat are:
The 3.0 145hp motor was rebuilt prior to me buying the boat
The seats have been recovered or replaced
New whale tail
New Anode
and new water fuel separator.
Bilge pump works
am/fm cd player
New bimini top
Trailer has new tires
Trailer also has new wiring for lights.
also comes with Anchors, tube, ski ropes, Tie off ropes, life vest anything that makes the boat water ready.

The bad the very front seat need to be recovered
the trailer jack need to be replaced.

I have over $5000 in the boat, Which I know I will never get what I have in it back but I wont give it away either. 

Cash is of course best since I want to buy another boat but I will take trades as well.

Trades I would consider would be mostly a center console boat, Running or not something 21' or bigger.
Jeeps, 4 wheelers, other boats (center console) rifles, pistols, cars or trucks and campers. Pretty much anything that allows me to spend quality time with my family.

This is a hard to locate, absolutely incredible rifle that is not even on Remington's website. I got it on Buds a while back and it was their only .300wm in stock. They're only produce when the have the time and spare barrels. 5r barrel made from the same steel and tooling as the M24, just on a commercial 700 receiver. A beautiful green/black web HS Precision stock with palmswells and dual front studs. Never fired, comes in original box with everything it came with. I only cleaned the bore carefully with Hoppes copper remover and lightly coated in a thin film of oil. Had an optics, rings,and base installed but they are removed and not included. It is sitting in a climate controlled safe, ready to begin the barrel break in process.

I may add other trade considerations later...
If you want to pay cash, I'll accept $999 for the rifle with no Karsten cheek rest, add $60 for the cheek rest.


The very thin, barely noticeable residue of pink on top of the receiver is the compound I used when mounting the Seekins Precision 1913 base. It is not rust or damage. Everything is in great condition and I just chose not to scrub it off since it will be covered by another base mount /compound anyhow. I just wanted to give the buyer a full disclosure."
