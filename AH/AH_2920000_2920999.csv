This is a truly unique and collectable piece. Made in the '90s, this is a fully legal, ATF approved ""Pen Gun"". This gun was allowed by the ATF because it has to be converted to a ""Gun Shape"" in order to fire it.

This is a one shot gun that even has a safety to prevent it from firing prematurely. Machined entirely from stainless steel bar-stock, this is a remarkably solid, well made and durable gun.

It come complete with two barrels. One for .25 ACP and one for .17 HMR. The barrel includes the chamber for the round.

These were only made from about 1992 to about 1997. They were revived from about 2002 to 2004. Since then there have not been any new guns made. 

This is an incredibly well made and fun gun to shoot.

We are asking $395 for the Stinger complete with both barrels and the soft case you see in the pics.

It was designed by John Browning and features an exposed hammer design. It was produced from 1897 until the late 1950's with over 1,000,000 made. This is a takedown model in original configuration. The shotgun functions as intended (it shoots, the action cycles, etc.). Here is what I know about this 107 year old gun:

The receiver is a ""C"" revision, built in November 1906. The stock is original (with the round knob), but was modified at some point to increase length of pull. This is good for a taller/larger shooter. The stock is free from cracks or water damage, and has an attached rubber butt pad (slightly collapsed from being stored). The action is smooth and all parts function as intended. The chamber is designed for 2 3/4"" shells (NOT 3"" magnums).

The Barrel and Magazine tube were built in July 1906. The barrel is the original unmodified 30"" version with a brass bead up front. The bore is clean, and the forcing cone is still intact. The pump slide is of the 3-screw variety, and is free from cracks or major signs of wear.

The finish is worn, leaving a rustic browned patina on the exposed metal. THERE IS NO PITTING on the surface of this gun. The 97's I've seen in local stores recently are all pitted and etched, and they are asking $500+. The stock LOP modification could be easily covered by a leather wrap (common in the old west). This shotgun is SASS/CAS approved. This would make an excellent CAS/SASS shotgun with a few modifications.

Price has been updated since listing based on condition compared to local inventory and condition. The long barrel makes picture taking somewhat difficult."

Manufacturers details:
Overview:

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

Key Features:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable 
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 
Sling swivel studs built-in

The versatile, best-in-class Cantilevered Modular Shelving maximizes storage space with long guns, handguns, and modern sporting rifles while making accessories easier to find.The Mark III fits in with today's modern, tactical look and takes shorter rifles and shotguns into special consideration with the short barrel loops on the DPX Storage System.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVER MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilever design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.QUICK ACCESS RACKFlexible polymer wings secure the barrel and allow firearms to easily be pushed into or pulled from the rack.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuable.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device, It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.BLACK LABEL MARK III TACTICAL MP 23 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 58""x30""x23""Interior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 54""x29""x16""Cubic Feet: 23Weight: 520 LBSBolts [Total/Active]: 8/5Gun Capacity: 25 Total (9/18+7)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 12-Gauge SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1"" Formed Door w/ Partial Inner PlateLocking System: Force Deflector Locking SystemLocking Bolt Size: 1"" Diameter Chromed Locking BoltsLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 3 SidesLock: SecuRam ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Steel Pin Lock ProtectionFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door: 1""Insulation Thickness- Body: 1""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 1-1/2""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1400F/60 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESExterior Finish: Tactical Matte Black FinishInterior Covering: Beige Carpet InteriorHandle: Black Chrome Tactical HandleCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degree HingesStorage Solution: Full DPX Storage SystemInterior Shelving: Cantilever Modular ShelvingRaised Floor: Elevated floor protects gun socksTactical Firearms Storage: Two Carbine Barrel Loops"

Put your best offer forward, and I'll at least reply with a reasonable counter.
If you have need for a home- defense shotgun, I recommend looking for one.
This build is designed for less practical applications.
First of all, it's going to be heavier than a regular shotgun, it's modified for austere environments, and lastly, this isn't your typical mantelpiece gun.
I have seriously wondered how I could part with it, or if anyone else 
wants it anyway.

Rifle has been to the range once and functions flawlessly, it is a very fun gun to shoot. Pictures show the rifle with the wire stock but I added the riser bar to make it a skelotonized stock allowing for a good cheekweld.

You will not find a better deal on a quality AK 74 anywhere. This is a top quality AK built by Interarms in Houston, not some shoddy century job that costs as much for half the quality.

I will ONLY sell FTF in the Austin area. CHL holders are preferred and if you don’t have a CHL you must be willing to sign a bill of sale with your contact information stating that you can legally own the gun. I will NOT ship.

The versatile, best-in-class Cantilevered Modular Shelving maximizes storage space with long guns, handguns, and modern sporting rifles while making accessories easier to find.The Mark III fits in with today's modern, tactical look and takes shorter rifles and shotguns into special consideration with the short barrel loops on the DPX Storage System.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVER MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilever design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.QUICK ACCESS RACKFlexible polymer wings secure the barrel and allow firearms to easily be pushed into or pulled from the rack.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access.

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included. The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

The AAC 7.62-SDN-6 is a compact fast-attach sound and flash suppressor for 7.62x51mm and 300 AAC BLACKOUT (7.62x35mm) weapons. It is 1.25” shorter than the 762-SD and features a fully welded all-Inconel® baffle stack and front end cap to maximize durability on select fire 7.62mm SBRs. The 762-SDN-6 also functions as a superb multi-caliber suppressor for multiple hosts, providing excellent performance on 7.62 NATO, 300 AAC, 6.8 SPC, 6.5, and 5.56mm NATO.

From Taurus:
The PT845 is one of  ‘the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds 
an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. 
""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" 
capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series 
senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by 
resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do 
anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better 
chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will 
automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, 
simply manually recharge and keep going.’"

Black Label Mark IV safes feature the unmatched storage potential of Axis Adjustable Shelving to accommodate a wide range of long guns and carbines, plus the secrity measures you want for peace of mind.A fortress for tactical firearms: Elegant is an understatement, the Black Label Mark IV is designed to accommodate modern sporting rifles as well as traditional long guns. These full-featured, no-nonsense safes provide maximum protection from fire and theft while adding a sleek tactical appearance to your room.WHY STEP UP TO THE TACTICAL MARK IV?Stepping up to the Mark IV gives the added versatility of Axis Adjustable Shelving for more interior organization potential and standard LED Interior Lighting. The Exterior Gear Loft provides provides a place to keep gear in a convenient location. The heavy-duty Duo-Formed Door adds additional security while the new Electrical Outlet makes it easy to add accessories such as dehumidifiers and charge electronics.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than 2 1/2 times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fill in the safe and use the minimum amount of space, individual shelves can be adjusted to accomodate modern sporting rifles, carbines, and shotguns.EXTERIOR GEAR LOFTTactical and hunting gear can be stored within easy reach on the top of the safe in the semi-enclosed Gear Loft.CARBINE BARREL LOOPSLower mounted barrel loops secure shorter rifles and shotguns to the DPX door panel.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access.

The metal as you can see is almost all a nice even patina with no rust or pitting and the furniture is crack free and solid. The bore has decent rifling with some pitting in the grooves but not enough to really affect the accuracy. The problem with the gun is the left side ejector is missing. The right side is present and functions as it should extracting but the left side is the ejector so you have to tip the emty shell out then it's ready to go again. The parts are available several places but not currently instock. Prices seem to range from $15 to $25."

Black Label Mark IV safes feature the unmatched storage potential of Axis Adjustable Shelving to accommodate a wide range of long guns and carbines, plus the secrity measures you want for peace of mind.A fortress for tactical firearms: Elegant is an understatement, the Black Label Mark IV is designed to accommodate modern sporting rifles as well as traditional long guns. These full-featured, no-nonsense safes provide maximum protection from fire and theft while adding a sleek tactical appearance to your room.WHY STEP UP TO THE TACTICAL MARK IV?Stepping up to the Mark IV gives the added versatility of Axis Adjustable Shelving for more interior organization potential and standard LED Interior Lighting. The Exterior Gear Loft provides provides a place to keep gear in a convenient location. The heavy-duty Duo-Formed Door adds additional security while the new Electrical Outlet makes it easy to add accessories such as dehumidifiers and charge electronics.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than 2 1/2 times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fill in the safe and use the minimum amount of space, individual shelves can be adjusted to accomodate modern sporting rifles, carbines, and shotguns.EXTERIOR GEAR LOFTTactical and hunting gear can be stored within easy reach on the top of the safe in the semi-enclosed Gear Loft.CARBINE BARREL LOOPSLower mounted barrel loops secure shorter rifles and shotguns to the DPX door panel.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access.

The main issue with this rifle is the stock has a piece missing on the lower side behind the trigger guard. But stock and forearm are very tight.It loads fires and ejects perfectly as it should.

Classic safes offer essential fire and security features, plus new Cantilever Modular Shelving that will give you almost unlimited organization potential for your guns and valuables. Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The versatile DPX Storage System includes a Quick Access Barrel Rack for extra storage. The beautiful exterior finish, subtle graphics and chrome trim pieces add class to any room in your home.

MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTS

MAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. 

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM

The Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

DUO-FORMED DOOR

The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.

HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTION

The heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.

NEW CANTILEVERED SHELVING

Quickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM

Includes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.

Classic safes offer essential fire and security features, plus new Cantilever Modular Shelving that will give you almost unlimited organization potential for your guns and valuables. Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The versatile DPX Storage System includes a Quick Access Barrel Rack for extra storage. The beautiful exterior finish, subtle graphics and chrome trim pieces add class to any room in your home.

MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTS

MAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. 

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM

The Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

DUO-FORMED DOOR

The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.

HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTION

The heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.

NEW CANTILEVERED SHELVING

Quickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM

Includes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.

This gun was purchased brand new in late 2013 and has been to the range exactly once; then cleaned and stored in a humidity controlled safe ever since.  This particular example has a factory blued slide and carbon fiber hydro-dipped lower which looks really cool (kind of hard to see in the pics) and is something I haven't seen done a lot on these guns.   It includes everything it came with new including the original test fired case, lock and paperwork as well as the storage bag, original magazine and the original box.  I am also throwing in 2 extra mags with pinky extensions making a total of 3.  I am just clearing out the stuff I don't ever shoot and consolidating calibers so this one has to go as I am phasing out .380s.  In any case my loss is your gain.

This rifle was painted flat black (barrel and action only, not the bolt or stocks) I have removed all the paint except for one small area under the scope base. That's still there because one base screw is almost stripped and I gave up trying to remove it. That said the gun is in great shape and has very few rounds through it.

EGW 0 MOA Base
Warne maxima perm attach 1"" low rings
Non Harris bipod ( I think cabelas brand)
Allen sling
Original stock
Hogue pillar bedded stock BRAND NEW ( heavy barrel contour, I was wanting to rebarrel eventually)

For those who may not know, AR pistols are 100% legal to own, as long as it is used as a pistol. If you add a 6 position shoulder stock, it becomes a short barreled rifle! If you add a vertical foregrip, it becomes a short barreled rifle! If you put this pistol upper receiver/barrel assembly on an AR lower from a rifle, it is a short barreled rifle!
 The good news...this was built as an AR pistol from a virgin lower, and is 100% compliant with all ATF rules & regulations. Ready to fire and have fun.

Pry-Stop MAX Locking Bolts and a reinforced door frame provide superior pry resistance. Pry-Stop End Bolts at the top and bottom of the door side secure the critical door corners from pry attack. Exquisitely painted, pinstriped and accented with chrome hardware, a Deluxe is the ideal safe to protect your valuables. Feature-packed Deluxe safes offer class-leading security and fire protection at an excellent value.Stepping up to the Pro Series Deluxe Series gives you a full selection of finishes, colors, and options to select from. Inside the safe, the new Electrical Outlet, premium Axis Adjustable Shelving, and LED Interior Lights are all standard. A higher fire rating (75 min. vs. 60 min.) and locking bolts on all four sides of the door improve protection from disaster.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.ELECTRICAL OUTLETA 110V outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.LED INTERIOR LIGHT PACKAGELED Lighting adds even more value to the Deluxe Series. This integrated LED Lighting package makes locating objects on shelves or identifying the right firearm convenient and easy. Wired to a door-activated motion sensor and illuminate when the door is opened. Factory installation adds a seamless look with no exposing wiring.Browning Pro Series Deluxe 26 DimensionsExterior Dimensions [HxWxD] : 60""x30""x25""Cubic Feet: 25Weight: 740 lbsLocking Bolts: 10Gun Capacity: 29 total (11/22+7)Security Features Body Thickness: 11-Gauge steelDoor Type/ thickness: Force DeflectorLocking Bolt Size: 4""x1"", MAXLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 4 sidesPry-Stop Bolts: 2 Pry- Stop MAX End BoltsInner Plate Specification: FULL 10-Gauge PlateLock: S&G Mechanical or ElectronicLock Protection Features: 1/4"" Hardplate, Hardened Pins, RelockerReinforced Door Frame: 4 sided, Full ReinforcementFire Protection FeaturesInsulation Thickness-Door: 2(3/8)""Insulation Thickness-Body: 1(7/8)""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 2(1/2)""Fire Seal: Triple-Fin PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/100 MinutesConvenience Features180 degree hinges, LED lighting, Electrical outlet, Raised floorStorage Solution: Axis Shelving, DPX with Scope SaverDPX HAndgun Puches/Hooks: 2 Pouches, 5 HooksAxis Accessories Included: 5-Gun Pistol Rack"

Mix top-notch security, fire protection, and appearance with excellent value and you have the Deluxe. Deluxe safes use uncompromising construction with a one-piece, continuously welded steel body adds increased protection and a high level of finish quality that rivals safes costing much more. Pry-Stop MAX Locking Bolts and a reinforced door frame provide superior pry resistance. Pry-Stop End Bolts at the top and bottom of the door side secure the critical door corners from pry attack. Exquisitely painted, pinstriped and accented with chrome hardware, a Deluxe is the ideal safe to protect your valuables. Feature-packed Deluxe safes offer class-leading security and fire protection at an excellent value.

Stepping up to the Pro Series Deluxe Series gives you a full selection of finishes, colors, and options to select from. Inside the safe, the new Electrical Outlet, premium Axis Adjustable Shelving, and LED Interior Lights are all standard. A higher fire rating (75 min. vs. 60 min.) and locking bolts on all four sides of the door improve protection from disaster.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM

The Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

DUO-FORMED DOOR

The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.

HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTION

The heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING

Multiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM

Includes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.

DPX SCOPE SAVER

With the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.

NEW ELECTRICAL OUTLET

A new outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.

NEW LED INTERIOR LIGHT PACKAGE

New LED Lighting adds even more value to the Deluxe Series. This integrated LED Lighting package makes locating objects on shelves or identifying the right firearm convenient and easy. Wired to a door-activated motion sensor and illuminate when the door is opened. Factory installation adds a seamless look with no exposing wiring.

Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.ELECTRICAL OUTLETA 110V outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.LED INTERIOR LIGHT PACKAGELED Lighting adds even more value to the Deluxe Series. This integrated LED Lighting package makes locating objects on shelves or identifying the right firearm convenient and easy. Wired to a door-activated motion sensor and illuminate when the door is opened. Factory installation adds a seamless look with no exposing wiring.SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 11-Gauge SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1(11/16)"" Duo-FormedLocking System: Force DeflectorLocking Bolt Size: 4""x1"", MAXLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 4 sidesPry-Stop Bolts: 2 Pry-Stop MAX End BoltsInner Plate Specification: Full 10-Gauge PlateLock: S&G Mechanical or ElectronicLock Protection Features: 1/4"" Hardplate, Hardened Pins, RelockerReinforced Door Frame: 4-Sided, Full ReinforcementFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door: 2 (3/8)""Insulation Thickness-Body: 1(7/8)""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 2 (1/2)""Fire Seal: Triple-Fin PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/100 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESHinge Caps: Black Chrome, Chrome or GoldInterior Covering: Beige CarpetHandle: 5-Spoke, Black Chrome, Chrome or GoldCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 degree hinges, LED lighting, Electrical Outlet, Raised floorStorage Solution: Axis Shelving, DPX with Scope SaverDPX Handgun Pouches/Hooks: 2 Pouches, 5 HooksAxis Accessories Included: 5- Gun Pistol Rack"
