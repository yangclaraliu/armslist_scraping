This pistol is of recent manufacture (date code of BA) and the accompanying factory threaded barrel was one of the last made before HK began serializing their HK45C threaded barrels (at least that is my understanding) – it has a date code of AI.  The pistol has had approx./ est. 300 rnds through the threaded barrel and approx./ est. 200 rnds through the standard barrel.  There are very slight wear marks visible on the edges of the original sight posts despite it not being a carry weapon (this is pretty typical of these pistols).  The two original mags which will come with the pistol also show very light typical wear.  The pistol comes with all original accessories except for the factory gun lock (so, you get the manual; sticker; test casing/ envelope; extra o-rings, spare backstrap, and key in original platic bag, and second 8 round magazine – all in the original black gun case). The threaded barrel also comes with the original green o-ring plus thread protector. The pistol in the pictures is the actual pistol the successful buyer will receive.

I am available to meet serious buyers during weekday evening hours and Sat/ Sun daytime or evening hours and am furthermore willing to drive a meaningful distance in and around the Puget Sound to meet serious buyers in a public place.

Are you looking for a gun that can shoot the wings off a fly at 800 yards? Yeah?!?! Well this is not it, but if your looking for a badass thunder stick that can knock down an elk at a reasonable range then your in the right place. This well crafted weapon packs a kick that would make Chuck Norris cringe and the angels cry. Sure its not the Bone Collector with all its bells and whistles but last time I checked I was a man, a man who needed nothing more then a gun that could send a projectile 2,300 fps towards an unsuspecting critter that I nicknamed supper. ""But it doesn't come in camo"" you say in a whining disappointed voice. Well if you need camo covering every square inch of gun to keep from getting spotted then this gun is not for you. Matter of fact here are some other signs this gun may NOT be for you.
 1. You brake for squirrels
 2. Put the twist tie back on the bread when your done
 3. Have ever heard a One Direction song and exclaimed ""not bad""
 4. You skipped out on poker night to watch Glee
 5. You eat hot wings with a fork.
 IF none of those apply to you then your a decent American and I don't mind handing this septar of a rifle over to you. Gun shoots like a dream and at the mere age of 1 harvested her first 6x6 elk. I'm no good with math but a friend tells me that 1 for 1 is 100% or something like that. 
ALL JOKING ASIDE THOUGH. . . . Gun is in near perfect condition it comes with the Limb saver butt pad, Hi Viz sights, the ram rod with the changeable tip for cleaning, and it is the weather shield version of this rifle.

I use a Glock and a Kahr now, both without an actual safety. Has original box, instructions, cleaning brush (never used) and 2mags are included. $550 including a box of 50 9mm FMJ.

Of course I would like to trade 1:1 but I am willing to be flexible and give up more 9mm in return for less .45.  So, make me an offer and maybe we can make a deal.

 Very accurate rifle. I'm not guaranteeing accuracy but so far its been sub MOA for me out to 400 yards. 1-9"" twist rate, it prefers 90-100 grain projectiles. Best accuracy achieved with Hornady 95 grain superformance Match.

806,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2851806,For Sale:  Tumble lubed hard cast bullets,"Wellington, Fort Collins, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 27, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Tumble lubed hard cast bullets - I currently have .40cal 180gr Truncated Cone, sized to .401.  

These projectiles are made of a lead/tin/antimony alloy, quenched in water as they are cast to make them harder.  They are then sized, lubed with liquid alox and coated with a fine dusting of mica powder to prevent gumming up your dies and giving an extra layer of lube.  I cast these as a hobby, and will have other calibers available as I find the time and have cooperative weather.  I can also do 9mm 124gr round nose, 148gr .38 wadcutters, and .45 230gr round nose, and I may start doing 158gr flat point projectiles in 38/357 at some point in the near future.

Recently, my hobby has taken a very interesting turn into powder coating of the projectiles.  Powder coating instead of tumble lubing offers several advantages.  Since the powder coat covers the whole bullet (minus the base), there is no chance for the lead of the bullet to contact your barrel.  The only fouling I have seen is from the powder residue.  Another upside is the total lack of any sticky coating, so no more waxy stuff on your fingers, in your dies, in your magazines or your firearm.  Those of you who have used plated bullets will find these to be very similar in how they load and what velocities to expect. 

And of course, they look pretty cool - see attached photos.  I currently have capability to do black and red, with intentions of buying more colors and experimenting with creating my own by mixing colors together.

1 - Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun (Gen 4) with factory box and 3 .40 magazines - (540.00 at Buds)
1 - 9mm Lone Wolf Threaded conversion barrel (140.00 at Lone Wolf w/thread protector)
1 - 9mm recoil spring (30.00 at Glockmeister)
1 - 22 LR Tactical Solutions Threaded conversion kit (350.00 at Midway)
2 - 9mm Glock Factory Magazines (25.00 ea at Midway)
1 - 33 Round Glock Factory Magazine (35.00 at Midway)

So, at the cheapest internet shops available today (even though several were out of stock) this would still cost $1,200.00, so I am going to sell it all for $1,000.  That's a steal even by 2014 standards...."

I took it shooting for the first time on Friday and only shot 100rds(2 boxes) of Federal 9mm ammo through it. Beautiful, quality firearm. This P30 is the V1 which has the 4.5lbs DOA trigger. Very smooth, light trigger. Best version of the P30 in my opinion and I've used the other trigger set ups. Brand new custom made Theis IWB horsehide holster included. Very comfortable holster. Similar to a Crossbreed but with slightly more sturdy kydex. Holster fits this gun like a glove and was only worn once. This gun is so nice that it's a little too nice for me. I beat my guns up a little but this one was too pretty to be rough with and I just don't need a gun that I'm going to be afraid of using. Only thing I did was round out the left slide release to allow for a better grip and eliminate the one common problem with this gun which is the slide not locking back on the last round due to the oversized paddle hitting the strong side thumb. It is a cheap easy piece to replace if the buyer doesn't like it but if you use a high thumbs grip(and you should with this gun) you will find it a very convenient modification.

keep in mind i have been doing this a long time and i know what is worth it and what isnt and i will text fire the weapon as soon as a purchase it-
my weapon system is as followed 

H&R Security 12 gauge brand new never fired i customzed the barrel and added breaching ports and grip spikes its compensated so your recoil is going to be lighter for fast action shooting- 
like i said the weapon is brand new and has never been fired how ever the barrel was put on my buddies H&R for testing-
barrel is still 18 inches (meets ATF req.) the barrel comes 18 inches but like i said we did some work to it-
its a great beginner weapon for you or your team to run drills with- 
i paid $200.00 but i am not expecting to get that price out of it...however being that the gun has never been fired and is in great shape and has the modified barrel i am going to ask 170.00 for it and 190.00 trade value...

so with all of that being said and done with i am looking for a id range weapon something like a 9mm or 40 s&w or possible a small revolver...
also i am most deff interested in a tokarev or anything from out of this country except glocks (not a glock fan) 

also please note i am looking for a package type deal basically something with ammo and a weapon that way i dont have to go around every where looking for ammo 
i am open to the following 

kel tec 
cz
taurus 
tokarev 
walther 
hi-point (no c9 or 380) 
and as i said before basically anything that works and you dont want 
no 32 22 25 mm weapons please 

so if you have a old weapon in a handgun platform that you would possibly like to trade or sale between 2-4 hundred bucks let me know asap

It shoots beautifully and smoothly. I have a bunch of spare, aftermarket and even original parts that come with it. I’ve also got 500 rounds of non-corrosive Russian hollow point ammo to go with it as well. 
I have a list of parts and what has been done for work on the rifle along with a whole bunch of pics that I can email to anyone interested. I just didn’t want to post a huge long ad that nobody would want to read, so please contact me for more info either through the messaging system here or at: REDACTED.
I’m asking $800 OBO for the entire package. I live in Berlin, NH. I would prefer to sell face to face to a non-felonious fellow NH resident with the proper identification.  And I am willing to drive to meet a prospective buyer somewhere as long as they are a serious buyer, not a game player. Thanks for reading my ad and have a great day!"
