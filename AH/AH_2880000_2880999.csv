MORE INFO BELOW
The 5.56 PDW Tactical Elite 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

The upper itself is melonite coated to reduce wear and resist corrosion from the surplus ammo. I have fired 180 rounds through this upper without any stoppages or malfunctions. It recoils similarly to a 5.56 AR 15 and has similar ballistics.  I originally paid $675 for the upper and $200 for each spam can of ammo. I am asking $500 for the upper and $150 per spam can.

These are the most popular round used in law enforcement do to the fact it can go through windshields, dry wall, steel and heavy clothing and still expanding to .75 inches. These are no longer available to the civilian market. I personally called Federal Ammunition and asked why I could not find these in local gun shops. They said the demand by law enforcement to buy these bullets were so high they could not make enough bullets for both law enforcement and civilians. They did also mention these are 100% LEGAL for CIVILIANS. Luckily I am in law enforcement and I am able to buy these but I only could buy a 1000 round case even though I only needed a couple hundred rounds. So I am selling these so cheap just to break even on the 1000 round case (I'm not getting rich off these). I will ship these if you live too far away but shipping costs will be at your expense. THESE ARE THE CHEAPEST ON ARMSLIST.

This has been checked out by my gunsmith and he said it is in very good condition with no cracks or chips on the wood or metal and all of the serial numbers match.  The barrels were cut to 24 inches. The length of pull is 14 inches and the overall length is 40 inches. The barrels are eleven and a quarter centimeters wide making them both cylinder bore. The bores are bright and shiny and the stock and forearm wood is in excellent condition.  This is a very nice double barrel and makes for a good bird gun.  I am open to trades of equal value.

This holster is FLAWLESS and never actually worn. I ordered it and forgot about it because the wait times for these custom made holsters was like 7 or 8 months at that time. I have since bought a Springfield XDS .45 ACP.

Presently the company has expanded and the wait times are 1/2 of what they used to be but you could still wait up to 4 months for this exact holster. They sell all the time on EBAY for $160 - $320 because some people don't want to wait that long for a phenomenally crafted holster. I would like to get $180. Nobody seems to want to pay that so I'm opening it up to trade.

I would be willing to trade for ammo. I'd love to get a whole ton of .22 LR ammo. Maybe even 5.56 or .223 calibers. I'll do partial trades of cash or ammo. 

I'd love to get a hold of a Ruger or S&W .44 mag or .357 mag. (Specifically full size frames) so for the right trade I might give you cash as well.

I'm a little impulsive and may trade for other things, just make me an offer.

Including Ammo & Caps, but the longer it takes to sell, the fewer rounds will be left.
I started with 1000 rounds, and estimate you will get at least the 500 rounds shown, which is a good supply.  I'll throw in a bit of my awesome homemade black powder, so you can shoot right away.  You can buy 1 LB of Pyrodex at Walmart for $19, good for 2800 rounds (or 1750 magnum rounds), or get 777 if you want a higher muzzle velocity. The original instructions from freedom arms allowed for 1 grain of Bullseye pistol powder, but North American removed this high energy option from the instructions when they took over.  http://www.freedomarms.com/MiniRev.pdf

You will price compare, as you can buy these new.  I am giving you a chance to buy $400+ worth for $300 firm.  This is the magnum version (aka Super C&B), with many extras.  You may be able to buy just the pistol for $300 if you shop around.

You get:
1) Complete magnum pistol, stainless steel, used for hundreds of rounds.
2) Leather Holster, never used
3) Leather ammo sack, never used
4) Extra stainless cylinder; you can shoot 5, then quick change another 5, never used
5) Extra cylinder pin, never used - but they can wear out
6) Original case lock with keys
7) Pistol Case, padded
8) 500 Rounds of Ammo shown, 250x2, ++ whatever I have not shot yet...
9) Extra Nipples, 5, never used, easily replaceable wear part.
10) Extra Walnut grips, new, never used
11) 2 yellow powder scoops, standard and magnum load
12) Bullet seat crimp tool
13) Allen wrench for nipples and Hatpin perfect for clearing nipples
14) At least 500 CCI #11 primer caps+
15) Original instructions
16) NAA No hassle lifetime warranty, Just register, http://northamericanarms.com/warranty

I am NOT a motivated seller, this pistol is a blast. When is sells, I am using the $300 to buy another NAA pistol.  I originally purchased because I cannot find 22 LR ammo for my pistol.  Ammo for this C&B is readily available from NAA, inexpensively, but it may be quite a while before you burn through the ammo included.  There are some great alternate options to the NAA 30 grain bullets.  You can shoot 22 caliber pellets, high velocity, but lower energy overall.  For short range, you can get a sack of #4 buckshot, 21 grain balls, great snug fit.  You can use 6mm airsoft BBs! Indoors, using no powder, just the #11 primer, these are perfect parlor rounds, about 200-300 fps, just like an airsoft pistol, with a bang."

A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability.

I'm asking $1,100 cash for it. The cash price is fairly firm. I'm not interested in pistols or shotguns. I'm only interested in 308 rifles on trade. 

I'm looking for a Savage model 12 in 308 or a Remington 700 in 308. Extras and add-ons are worthless to me, unless your rifle is setting in a high end stock. We will look at the cost difference between my gun and your gun new and go from there when deciding the cash difference.

Quote from PSA:
Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

Bolt Carrier Group: M16 Full Auto Profile Bolt Carrier Group with Carpenter 158 Steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Full-auto profile bolt carrier is manganese phosphate treated outside, and chrome lined inside.

Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function."

For sale, brand new Aimpoint Micro T-1 CLONE with Larue LT660 QD mount CLONE.

Picked this up on a too-good-to-be-true deal thinking it was the real thing. BUT, it is still a hell of a nice optic. I've handled some of those Chinese airsoft copies and this is HEAD and SHOULDERS above those, really curious to know the story behind it... Eastern European made perhaps?. While I'm not sure I would stake my life on it mounting it on a duty rifle, on a range only gun or a fun gun it'll be great.

Displays both Red AND Green dots, five levels of brightness for each. Compatible with all Aimpoint Micro covers, lens caps, kill flashes, and mounts.

Comes with clone LaRue LT660 QD riser mount which will provide lower 1/3 cowitness with AR sights. Actually this mount is an improvement over the LaRue as it has a see-through design, perfect for if you are running lower profile HK style iron sights as back up. Otherwise it is the same materials (CNC machined aluminum base, steel locking QD throw lever).

Mounted once to make sure it all checked out, no rounds through it otherwise. Comes with cleaning cloth and QD mount adjustment wrench.

I have a first generation universal M1 carbine. It is in good condition with great rifling and shiny bore.

The only thing ""wrong"" with the gun is that the front sights had a small glob of soldering added to it to see it better through the peep sight, but the gun will come with a replacement NOS front sight piece as well. And it is missing the buttplate. The guy before me was a bigger guy so he added a spacer and pad to the butt of the rifle. I am only 5'10 so I took it off and put it back to ""normal"" and just haven't gotten a replacement buttplate. Gun shoots great."

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

****The UMP lower is select fire. This does NOT mean the gun will function in full auto. It will not. This gun is SEMI AUTO ONLY, and will function as such. Any modifications to make the gun full auto are ILLEGAL. If that is why you want this gun, then do not contact me. All NFA laws apply. Parts from the stock USC lower must be swapped into the UMP lower, before use, as per BATFE regulations. This lower is for looks only, and will shoot semi auto on both settings.

The only trade considerations I will take are for an FN Five SeveN, a Trijicon TA11-D ACOG with the RMR red dot up top for a .308 as well as an Eotech EXPS3-0, EXPS3-2 and an Eotech G33 magnifier.
