All the salesman told me was that it would be louder. Plus the PC Shield comes with an upgraded trigger and fiber optic front and rear sights. I went home with it, did some research and came to the conclusion that a ported barrel was not what I wanted. It is brand new, never been fired other than the factory test shots. I have field stripped, cleaned and lubed it once with ballistol and hoppes 9 gun oil. Other than that, it comes exactly how it would come if you bought it from your LGS with a 7 round mag and 8 round extended mag. Shoot me an offer. Buyer pays FFL. 420 obo."
