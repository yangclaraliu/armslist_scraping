So I contacted Glenn at Colt Competition and he informed me that the CRE-16GT was a distributor exclusive, limited run of 300 rifles. He also informed me the barrel on this rifle is the same one they put on there $1900 CRP-16 Model.This is a very nice rifle sure to be worth a lot more than your run of the mill AR, 300 is a very low run.  I may take partial trade with this gun, but I am looking mainly for cash.Vortex sight shown in pics is not included $1950 or OBO . FTF meet only, cash, no felons and I need to see an Ohio ID. I can be reached best by text or phone REDACTED.Thanks"

Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, like the 6.8, the 300AAC Blackout is lightweight, modular, utilizes a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt-stock. Never before seen with the AR platform, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout fires 7.62 x 35 rounds while remaining compatible with the standard M4 Bolt Carrier Group and existing magazines. Details Other features include the Cold Hammer Forged, 1:8 twist, 16” S2W Profile barrel and shotgun-inspired hand grip, and is available in Black and REALTREE AP®. Whether chasing after a wild boar or anticipating a 10 point mule deer, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout supplies ample knock-down power while reducing recoil. The Ambush Firearms 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout firearms indicates that un-suppressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend. Although, through our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation. MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION Precision crafted from the highest quality material available today with meticulous attention to detail, The Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout will prove to be the benchmark in the industry.

These magazines are not dated, but some of their 229 mates from the same Agency had 9 02 dates on their polymer plates. Each Magazine holds 12 rounds of .357 Sig or .40 S&W caliber ammunition. These are made for Sig P 226 pistols chambered in .357 Sig or .40 S&W that accept a double staggered magazine, and the Kel-Tec Sub 2000 rifles made for Sig Magazines if Kel-Tec ever made any like that. They will also fit the 229 in .40 or .357 Sig caliber, but they will protrude from that model’s shorter grip frame. They will not fit a 220, will not fit a 239, Will not fit a Smith & Wesson 4006; will not fit the valve handle of a 19th century Italian Bidet. They are made for .357 Sig or .40 S&W caliber Sig Sauer / Sig Arms P226 [and 229] pistols only. Surface detractions are minimal to moderate, only faint amounts of insertion and ejection whitening. We rate them as Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, 85 to 90 percent vicinity by our estimate. They are excellent mechanically; spring strength is excellent. Replacement pricing on Factory 226 .40 Magazines is upwards of $70 apiece in many areas, and they’re not easy to find. Our Single Mag, onesy twosy price is $39 per. We’re offering these magazines in lots of 3 at $29.00 per, not sold separately. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, D.C., Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 11 round or higher magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement.

Restrictions apply for some areas in the US, please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. For a person, law enforcement or civilian alike, to entrust his or her life to an extra magazine puts a strong responsibility on us. For as long as we have been in business, the best magazines are factory magazines for semi-auto firearms. We only trust One name in aftermarket magazines: Mec-Gar. They free-fall like they're supposed to; they lock the breech open on the last shot like they're supposed to; we've never had One stick a spring or follower. They are, in short, vastly less likely to mis-perform than any other aftermarket magazines. Mec Gar manufactures the factory magazines for many brands, including Browning, Beretta, Rock Island, and Kel-Tec. That is the reason, for example, that the cheap little Kel-Tecs are so reliable. Here are representatives of the Mec Gar 17 round anti-friction Teflon blued steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols made in Czechoslovakia. They will also fit, we are quite sure, the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. Mec Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. Our single mag price is $39 per. We’re offering these fine magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $29 each. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to civilians in jurisdictions where 17 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, includes Aurora IL, Colorado, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, California, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and South Bend IN.

HVY 45 AUTO RIM STANDARD PRESSURE

You've been asking for a couple heavy 45 AUTO RIM standard pressure loads, so by popular demand, here they are. Both of these loads utilize high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the ballistic equivalent of +P 45 ACP loads, yet they operate at standard 45 ACP pressures. These loads are safe to use in ANY 45 ACP revolver that is in normal operating condition, including ANY model 1917 Colt or S&W revolver.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch MT Gun gives velocities almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch barrels. This is not a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel.

Item # 31A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 869 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 795 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 880 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 875 FPS

 Item # 31A was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot through stick frame and dry wall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 27 inches of penetration through live flesh and bone."

One owner gun. I bought this gun brand new last summer of 2013. Test fired, and shot less than 40 rounds through it without any problems. This is a very nice gun. Pictures does not do this gun justice (it's my fault I'm not a good photographer). I like it a lot, but I need a smaller handgun for my wife and money more than this gun. Originally came from the factory with a hardcase, 2-7rd stainless finished mags, black rubber grips, cable security lock, warranty papers, and owner's manual. In addition, I'm throwing in a like new Kimber Pro magazine and a brand new Colt rosewood grips (pictured). You must be at least 18 years old, or older to buy this gun and a Kentucky resident, and have a valid KY Driver's License (KY CCDWL is okay). Thanks for your time, and thanks for looking.

The limited info I have is:

Stamp near muzzle is 'SA'
Stock has what looks like Mother of Pearl inlay.  Also looks like there is some damage to the stock where the bolt handle locks in.
Original Patina - Very worn blue finish but not out of the ordinary for a 115 ish year old rifle.
I don't know much about the scope but looks like something from the 50's.   The receiver has been drilled and tapped.
Looks like the rifle had a sling at one time as there is a sling mount on the butt of the stock and a barrel band on the front.

A fair offer or trade will be seriously considered so that my father can purchase my brother's gift.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

Here is a description on the CZ VZOR 50 from world.guns.ru:
The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame."

MADE IN USA
With a 2-1/2"" barrel and a weight of about a pound, the P380 is perfect for use as a concealed carry firearm. The stainless steel barrel and slide on the P380 weighs just a bit more than the aluminum alloy or polymer frames of the competition, but it helps ensure that the P380 will be durable and fire reliably after years of use. The wrap-around polymer grip is comfortable and extremely compact. This pistol features fixed low-profile sights and includes two 6-round magazines and the original factory hard case.

Stock is the only variant: someone cut off the curved rear, about 1/2” of the length is gone, and put on a rubber buttpad that disintegrated over time. Everything was torn down, cleaned, polished, re-blued if necessary and reassembled. Stock was rubbed down to base and then tung oiled and sealed. A one of a kind (I made it) , 0.2"" thick solid brass electroetched/engraved buttplate added with hand-made, authentic Irish Saddlers (Dublin) leather slip on buttpad to finish dressing it out. Comes with Remington sock and new padded zippered bag. Fully functional and like new again. I'd put this up against any semiauto shottie of the period.

A solid steel reputation for durability and dependability. Few firearms ever earn the level of respect the Browning BPS boasts. The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working in spite of what Mother Nature does to stop it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise because the BPS has what most other pump shotguns don’t — features like rigid dual machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation, and legendary Browning balance and handling. That’s why the BPS continues to be the pump shotgun serious shotgunners like you can always rely on.

Ambidextrous. That is how many shooters describe the BPS. And it is true. But the advantages are more than just being a great shotgun for the left- OR right-handed shooter. The bottom ejection design and full, two-sided steel receiver combine for a level of durability and strength that is not common among pump action shotguns today. The design is totally balanced, with matching dual steel slide action bars -- one on each side -- that balance forces for very smooth pumping. Top tang safety is functional convenience to the max. The receiver forms a ""roof"" over the action-- there is no opening on either side for an ejection port, so a drenching rain won't drip into the action. When you shoot bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight,  to distract your aim. Those that shoot a BPS are a unique bunch . . . a bit more serious about their hunting guns than most? Yes!

Bottom Ejection and Loading Bottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.

Reliable Pump-Action The proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots. A convenient serrated slide release is located at the rear of the trigger guard.

Safety The thumb-operated, top-tang safety on the BPS can be easily operated by right- and left-handed shooters alike, even with gloved fingers.

I used it once to make sure it worked alright by firing 50 rounds through it. Other than the sights being off just a touch, it shoots like a dream. It is just a bit bigger than I originally thought and I would prefer smaller, like a Walther or another Ruger.

With the handgun comes 3 mags (1 came with the gun + 2 extra) and a carrying case.

It's single action, but not like a revolver that needs the hammer cocked back for every shot. It is more like a Kel Tec where once you chamber a round, it is good to go. There is also a safety on the left with the mag release and slide release/stop latch.

Please see pics and ask questions. I am firm on this price because if you were to buy online for $335-350 + taxes + FFL transfer + the 2 extra mags and the case, you would see that my price is a fair one at $435.

You MUST have a FOID card for the transfer as I request a transfer approval number from the ISP - this is done online with your FOID number and DOB and takes seconds. I will also fill out 2 copies of a firearm transfer form for each of us.

I can send more pics upon request - I can only post 3 here."

Century Arms Centurion 39 AK-47 Semi-Auto Rifle, 7.62x39mm, 16.5″ Barrel, Two 30 Round Mags, 4 Rail Handguard, Adj. Sights – Century Arms RI1622N

The Centurion 39 is assembled using all new U.S. manufactured parts. It is different from other rifles on the market in that the receiver is machined from an 11 pound block of 4140 ordnance quality steel. The barrel is equipped with a proprietary V shaped Chevron Compensator, designed exclusively by Century. This unparalleled compensator design directs gases upward, which reduces recoil and makes the rifle more controllable. Instead of adjusting for windage from the front sight like other similar rifles, the rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. Other features include a high visibility front sight post and a buttstock that is 1 inch longer than military style stocks, for better comfort and handling. The upper and lower handguard have four Picatinny rails which can be used to accessorize the Centurion 39 with red dot sights, scopes, lights, lasers and a fore grip. Barrel: 16.5″ with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 37.25″, Weight: 8.2 lbs. Comes with two U.S. made 30 rd. mags.

The gun hasn't been fired since being packed away during refurbishing. It is in great condition and is truly a piece of history! It does not have any import stamps.

I also have 140 rounds of ammo for it, about half are hollow points. I don't have an extra case, so you may want to bring one with you. 

I would possibly consider a partial trade on a .22 semi-auto or .17 bolt action or a 12 gauge pump.

I bought the rifle, scope and a custom case from Jensen’s Custom Ammunition in Tucson, Arizona in 1980. It has less than 10 rounds fired through it - I still have the half empty box of ammunition. It has never been stored outside of the case and handled very little. The date stamp is LA26, which is February of 1980. 

The scope is a Weaver T20 w/ Micro Trac and is set on Weaver rings. It was installed by Jensen’s and this is from back when they were made in El Paso. These were top of the line target scopes back then. The only non-stock part of the rifle is a nice Pachmayr butt pad that was installed at the same time as the scope. The pull with the 1” pad is 14”. I may still have the original sling and it will be included if I find it, but I can’t promise it. 

PLEASE NOTE – The case you see in the pictures is NOT included in this sale.

I will ship anywhere in the lower 48 to a legal FFL holder that will accept sales by individuals, the shipping will be through FedEx Ground or Home Delivery and includes full insurance and tracking. 

I would rate the condition as close to new as you could find. I see sellers listing percentages, so let’s say 99%. The stock is really well figured and looks even better in person than the pictures. 

I am also willing to remove the scope and sell just the rifle for $1850.
