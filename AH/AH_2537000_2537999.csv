It comes in the original factory case with three 17 round factory magazines, adjustable backstraps (3 different options), manual, fired shell casing and lock.  The factory installed night sights are good and bright.  I think the date of manufacture is mid 2012.

I shot one of these pistols that a friend of mine had and I just had to go buy one.  In my opinion, it shoots better than my Sig 226, Glock 17 and S&W M&P 9mm.  I have 2 of these and the only difference is the other has a manual external safety, so I opted to keep that one and sell this one that doesn't have an external manual safety.  As I mentioned in another listing, I simply have too many firearms and I'm selling off what are basically duplicates and ones I know I won't use.

Normal wear for a hunting gun, few light scratches if you look closely. Plastic trigger guard has small cracks (see picture) like all the 795/60's that had the guard overtightened. Purely cosmetic shoots nicely with any ammo, see test target below and YouTube video shooting empty .22 cases at 25 yards.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

 The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

 A target version  was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

So I've decided to sell one of my Rhodesian Builds. This one is a very nice battlefield reproduction of a Rhodesian R1 FAL.

***Here's a link to pictures from the Rhodesian Bush War. Lots of photos of FAL's painted very similar to this one Rhodesia: The Ultimate Photographic Resource! - The FAL Files***

I built it using an old R1 Kit I got a long time ago. Came with a G1 Lower instead of a South African.

Here's what it has:
-Century L1A1 Receiver (old DCI Type 1 converted). Has a unibrow feed ramp that made it so I had to slightly reshape the very lip of the chamber face. No modifications to the chamber! Cycles really good now.
-South African 21"" BBL. Good Bore for a Rhodesian Bush War vet.
-South African Non-Bipod Cut HG's.
-G1 Lower and Stock (Stock is cracked but very usable.)

L1A1 Upgrades:
-Sand Cut Bolt and Carrier
-Folding Charging Handle
-L1A1 BHO

Interesting Field Repair:
-Wire used to keep Grenade Sight from flipping up. (Kit came this way. Wire replaced with new one)

Comes with 1 Mag.

Rifle Feeds and Cycles like a FAL should. Never had a chance to sight it in, but it seemed to be pretty close to right on.

$1100 plus shipping. Last price drop. Can't build one like this for less.

 The SCOUT is CVA's first ever center-fire only rifle, but what a rifle it is. Sleek, lightweight and an incredible value for the dollar, the Scout sets a standard for affordable single-shot hunting rifles. All Scout barrels are fluted and available in either Blued Steel or 416 Stainless Steel. Stocks are 100% ambidextrous, making them versatile not only for all shooters, but for all off-side opportunities in the field. The Standard SCOUT include .243, 7mm-08, .270, .30-06, .44 magnum, .35 Whelen, and 12 gauge Rifled Slug, that all come with the standard stock and 22 in barrel. Plus, they come with DuraSight Dead-On one-piece scope mount, rather than open sights- since most shooters will be inclined to scope this little jewel of a rifle.

This is the nicest 03-A3 you will find and I will tell you why.

I found this Remington in a box that it had been sealed in since 1955.

When I opened the box 4 years ago, the rifle was covered in Cosmoline soaked bandages.  After thoroughly cleaning the rifle, it was apparent that this wasn't your average A3.  The condition is beautiful, from the warm glow of the stock to the almost flawless finish on the action & barrel.  The proof marks and serial number are deep and clear.

The proof marks tell the history:  The parts were made in April of 1943, the rifle was built in August of 1943 by Remington, final inspection was done by Lt. Col. Frank Atwood.  The rifle was at some point shipped to the Rock Island Arsenal where it was inspected and stored by Frank Krack.  Current condition would be ""Unissued after rebuild"".

More pictures available upon request.

I test fired the rifle at 600 yards (yes, 600!) and it grouped around 12"". 

A beautiful example of a 70 year old rifle, it probably belongs in a museum.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

To eliminate ""it depends on the child"" responses, I will include some info on her behavior...Currently, if I leave a twice-unloaded ""dummy gun""(safe, safe, safe; two person integrity) on my living room floor, in her toybox, on my table, etc...her response upon discovering it is to flee the scene, report the incident to myself or my wife, and ask us to put it away.  If we ask her to bring it to us, she says ""I can't""...""I don't touch guns"". We respond with praise and reward her for this behavior. We have been exercising this behavior since she could talk(1 year). She will never be permitted to use the firearm without close adult supervision. It will be easily identifiable as ""her gun"", and the rules for ""mommy and daddy's guns"" will not change, and will continue to be emphasized.  

I'd like some input from my fellow shooters/enthusiasts, whether positive or negative, give me some feedback. All replies will be read and respected. Thanks."

All matching numbers gun. I removed the stock and meticulously hand sanded every blemish out of the beautiful Baltic Birch. Then I applied 15 coats of Tung Oil Gloss Finish. (one coat per day for 15 days) Between each coat, I buffed the entire stock with 0000 steel wool to get a beautiful resulting high gloss and durable finish. This is the kind of Finish put on very high dollar rifles. You will not find a more beautiful SKS, anywhere. The firing pin was replaced with a Murray's stainless steel firing pin and spring set. The gas valve was replaced with a Murray's stainless steel gas valve. The original parts that were replaced come with the rifle upon sale. I sent the trigger assembly to Bill Springfield , (http://www.triggerwork.net/sksrifles.html) and he did a great trigger job, reducing the length of pull and removing all grittiness in the trigger. Also he reduced the trigger pull from over 8lbs. to just a hair over 4lbs. Needless to say, this SKS shoots like a dream. By far the smoothest, most accurate SKS I have shot in 40 years of shooting. Included  are : a Tapco 20 rd. magazine,  one dust cover scope mount with a no-name 4x scope, and another dust cover scope mount with a BSA Red Dot scope. Personally, I prefer the stock sights, but to each their own.  You wont find a prettier, smoother shooting , or more accurate SKS. The bore shows very little wear and the accuracy proves it. Comes with original web sling and original magazine. This is the model with grenade launcher , grenade sights and phosphorescent night sights, original blade bayonet, and correct cleaning kit (in the buttstock) and cleaning rod.  I know I am asking  a premium price, but when you see this rifle in person, it is a gem.  Will consider trading this and a S&W M&P 15-22 ( my other listing) for a good AR-15 w/ fwd. assist, not a ""sport""."

Yes indeed! Larger handguns carry excessive costs for ammunition and produces huge amounts of felt recoil. Whereas this powerful Super Redhawk 44MAG will put down and keep down what it hits. And, just as important, the amount of felt recoil and the cost of ammo is reasonable. Itâs smooth with its light single action trigger pull or its slick double-action trigger pull. While being used âwith the rapid fire techniqueâ, its accuracy has proven unbelievable when shooting at aluminum pie plates located 100 yards away. The targets were hit without scope assistance 4 times and in some cases 5 times from each gun load of six .44 caliber magnum rounds. These hits were made over seven different range visits. I liked it so much that I got carried away and bought two of these guns. This clean beauty comes with a medium-hardened rubber grip along with custom wooden grip side panels. There have been less than 200 rounds put through the pipe and looks to be almost new. A fun experience!

Call Eric at REDACTED for details.

Easily the most advanced rimfire rifle ever built, the Model 597â¢ represents the first technological breakthrough in the category in 35 years. Our new rifle has all the standard features that have made the originals an American favorite, but with some notable upgrades. Because our Model 597â¢ action is the ultimate in feeding reliability and out-of-the-box accuracy, it was only natural we develop the Model 597â¢ TVPâ¢ (Target-Varmint Plinker) to take full advantage of the superior design.

Truly the ultimate 22 target-rifle platform, this tack-driver features a 20"" stainless heavy barrel and a rugged laminated thumbhole stock thatâs contoured to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters with equal comfort. The impeccable balance of our new stock design will shine the first time you try an offhand shot. Trust us, one squeeze of the trigger and youâll be a believer. Its receiver is equipped with a factory-mounted scope rail so you can add optics and be ready to shoot in a flash."

This gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

These early Ishapores are difficult to find at all, much less in this condition and with all matching numbers.  All original, matching serial numbers (receiver, barrel, bolt, rear sight, nosecap).  Buttstock is correctly marked and dated for the gun with sharp original markings.  Very good condition and is a pre-1968 import.  Just has British export markings on it and ""England"" on the receiver.  Retains much arsenal metal finish.  Stock set is solid with some assorted dings.  Has one hairline crack about 2"" long on the right side of the forestock.  It isn't structural and I have shot it with no problems - I never bothered to fix it, but it would be an easy glue job.  See the pic.  I took the picture with the lighting angled to intentionally make the crack show, so it looks worse in the pic than in hand.  

Very good bore with very strong rifling, good shine, and just a bit of scattered light pitting in a few places.  The gun is a good shooter.  When I bought it, it was missing the magazine and I have shot it single shot, but it isn't all that hard to find a magazine on-line or at a gun show.  I just never got around to it.  I am selling it as I bought it and pricing it to sell, even accounting for the missing magazine.  

The only trades I might be interested in would be USGI M14 parts or possibly 300 rounds of quality surplus 7.62 NATO ammo (Portugese, South African, etc.)
