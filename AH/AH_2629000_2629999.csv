Citori's are regarded as among the best Over/Under shotguns you can get. This one has 30"" barrels, and fixed full/full chokes.

This is a great little handgun by North American Arms.  It comes with 2 cylinders--1 for .22LR, and 1 for .22MAG.  They are quick and easy to change.  This gun is great because the grip folds around the under side of the gun to secure the trigger when it's in your pocket but when you flip the grip out, it makes it easy to shoot.  You can also take off the grip with an allen wrench to just have the gun by its self.  
I've put about 50 rounds through this gun and I decided to sell it to get another Glock instead.  But this gun is an AWESOME concealed carry handgun."

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. This rifle runs flawlessly!! I love it but just bought a Larue OBR and I've got to sell something.

50 Rounds Federal Lake City M855 5.56x45mm NATO Green Tip Steel Penetrator Ammunition (XM855), in box, is new production, NATO stamped brass ammo that features a 62 grain FMJ bullet.
XM855 5.56mm Federal Lake City ammo is reloadable, features brass cases, boxer primers, and sealed primer and projectile. This ammunition is non-corrosive.
Muzzle Velocity 3025 FPS (Feet Per Second); Muzzle Energy 1260 ft.lbs.
This is made by the famous Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. The 5.56x45mm M855 62 Grain SS109 Green Tipped Steel Penetrator Lead Core Mil-Spec ammunition have a steel penetrating core in the tips, designed for combat use, to increase hard target penetration at longer ranges. M855 will punch a 1/4"" steel plate. 

Works fantastically in AR15, semi-autos, and bolt action. (To be used in rifles marked 5.56x45mm only.) 

This is the ""EXACT"" same ammo our military uses. NOT CHEAP WALMART BRAND. M855 is military and ""X"" in XM855 designates overrun or extra. You can tell the difference when you fire it! When I use it at the range people think my 5.56 M4 is a 50 Beowolf. I sell a cheaper brand of 62 gr. for $9.50 less per 50 RDS. when I have it available."

50 Rounds Federal Lake City M855 5.56x45mm NATO Green Tip Steel Penetrator Ammunition (XM855), in box, is new production, NATO stamped brass ammo that features a 62 grain FMJ bullet.
XM855 5.56mm Federal Lake City ammo is reloadable, features brass cases, boxer primers, and sealed primer and projectile. This ammunition is non-corrosive.
Muzzle Velocity 3025 FPS (Feet Per Second); Muzzle Energy 1260 ft.lbs.
This is made by the famous Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. The 5.56x45mm M855 62 Grain SS109 Green Tipped Steel Penetrator Lead Core Mil-Spec ammunition have a steel penetrating core in the tips, designed for combat use, to increase hard target penetration at longer ranges. M855 will punch a 1/4"" steel plate. 

Works fantastically in AR15, semi-autos, and bolt action. (To be used in rifles marked 5.56x45mm only.) 

This is the ""EXACT"" same ammo our military uses. NOT CHEAP WALMART BRAND. M855 is military and ""X"" in XM855 designates overrun or extra. You can tell the difference when you fire it! When I use it at the range people think my 5.56 M4 is a 50 Beowolf. I sell a cheaper brand of 62 gr. for $9.50 less per 50 RDS. when I have it available."

It's chambered in 22lr. It comes with 250 rounds of ammo. This is a really nice little cowboy action pistol (single action). I've had a lot of fun shooting it (just looking for something different). These are excellent guns to teach kids how to shoot while instilling ideas on gun safety. Comes with a custom hand tooled gunbelt. The belt is specially made for .22 revolvers & holds 36 rounds of ammo on belt. It’s genuine hand-made leather & not some cheap knock off. I'm only interested in trading.

The history of this gun is far too intricate to be recounted here. Mine is from 1931 though I have had it from the early '90's. I see many appear on GB over the years, but only occasionally one in this condition. The great majority of the blueing is intact and a conservative figure would be 95%. The outside of the trigger guard and magazine guide frame are both showing base metal through the blueing. The bore is bright, clean and fired very little. A couple of marginal dents in the stock, only one, at the rollmark that seems to have broken grain. Butt plate is in great condition and the sling swivels are also. The rear sight is a Lyman 48 which was the standard for the period. Mounting blocks, also standard are found exactly where they should be. All in all an outstanding example of the early model 52 in original condition. Has one magazine that was in it when I got it. It too appears to be a period original. Please see pictures for details. I have not fired this rifle as much as I wanted to. The new owner can if he or she desires. I have been happy enough to get it out for oiling now and again."

534,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2629534,For Sale:  Remington R-15™ VTR™ Predator Carbine CS .223,"Fountain Inn, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 1,199","Listed On: Thursday, January 30, 2014",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"PRICE CHANGE - ""Remington AR-15 style Model R-15 VTR Predator"". Purchased for Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

But the real treat is that the Mystic can also withstand several other centerfire rifle and handgun calibers as well. The 300 / 221 Fireball and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but also in supersonic speeds. Also, the 38 Special/ 357 Magnum family work as well. Being take-down, this suppressor will be a favorite for using cast lead bullets. We all know that lead buildup in the 9mm suppressor is a reality.

Due to the take-apart nature of the Mystic, 22LR carbines are no longer off limits to your 9mm suppressor!

Winchester has determined the above lots of 22 Long Rifle rimfire ammunition may contain double powder charges. Ammunition with double powder charges may subject the shooter or bystanders to a risk of serious personal injury and/or death, or cause firearm damage, rendering the firearm inoperable.

DO NOT USE WINCHESTER® M*22™ 22 Long Rifle RIMFIRE AMMUNITION WITH LOT NUMBERS GD42L or GD52L. The ammunition Lot Number is imprinted (stamped without ink) on the left tuck flap of the 500-round carton as indicated here. The 1000-round intermediate carton does not have a Lot Number.

To determine if your ammunition is subject to this notice, review the Symbol Number and Lot Number. If it is Symbol Number S22LRT with a Lot Number containing GD42L or GD52L immediately discontinue use and contact Winchester toll-free at REDACTED or visithttp://www.winchester.com/Product-Service/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx for free UPS pick-up of the recalled ammunition.

This notice applies only to Symbol Number S22LRT with Lot Numbers GD42L and GD52L. Other Symbol Numbers or Lot Numbers are not subject to this recall.

If you have any questions concerning this 22 Long Rifle rimfire ammunition recall please call toll-free REDACTED, write to Winchester (600 Powder Mill Road, East Alton, IL 62024 Attn: S22LRT Recall), or contact Winchester Customer Support online.

We apologize for this inconvenience.

Inconvenience? INCONVENIENCE??? Does Winchester really appreciate how hard it’s been to find any .22 long rifle ammo in the last year? This recall notice doesn’t even promise to promptly replace the defective ammo; I’m sure they’ll win plenty of customer loyalty with that.

There have been rumors that ammo QC has been slipping over the last year. This is the first concrete example I’m aware of, showing the risks that manufacturers are running by pushing their production lines 24/7 and training up entire shifts of inexperienced employees.

This risk to shooters is aggravated in this instance, because M22 ammo was specifically designed to be used in AR-style semiautomatic .22s. A bolt-action or break-open .22 probably wouldn’t give a rat’s ass how much powder Winchester stuffed into a .22 long rifle case: it would rupture the case and maybe spit some hot gasses out of the breach but otherwise survive without damage. But a straight-blowback semiautomatic .22 could experience catastrophic internal damage as the still-burning cartridge blasted the bolt rearwards and continued to cook itself off while being ejected from the gun.

This miserable story is a reminder that even the lowly .22 rimfire still demands eye and ear protection. A ruptured .22 long rifle is damned unlikely to kill you, but escaping combustion gasses and case fragments can ruin your vision if you’re not protected.
