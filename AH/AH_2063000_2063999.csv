Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr Super is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount can be attached to this rail system.
21.75 inch barrel.Integrated muzzlebrake. Push button safety. 
Comes with original box and manuals,two 10 round polymer mags and two(expensive and hard to find) 20 round metal mags,and bipod.

I recently upgraded to a Glock 27, and am looking to move on from my Hi-Point.    The Hi-Point is a reliable American made hand gun that accurately throws lead down range.  I have had minimal malfunctions with this gun, and am only trying to sell it because I just spent over $500 on my new gun!  I'd like to get some of that cash back.  The Hi-Point is $150 new, and I have added the holster ($35 from Hi-Pointfirearms.net), 2 additional magazines ($18 each there), the Hogue handle grip ($10), and a hard shell case with foam padding ($30 online).  I am asking $150 total for the package, but would consider slightly less.  Sorry the holster is not in the photos, but it is the holster that is sold by Hi-Point and it has a magazine pouch on it.  Here is the link (http://www.hi-pointfirearms.net/proddetail.php?prod=P40SW004)

I know that when I was looking for my entry level gun, I looked all over Armslist for a Hi-Point to get myself into shooting.  I couldn't find one, and had to buy online.

If you're local, I can meet you and exchange for cash only.  If you need it to be shipped, it will need to be shipped to an FFL, and will also cost an extra $45 (UPS Overnight Air is required to send a handgun).  I will accept PayPal, but I will wait for the funds to be released before sending (to weed out any scammers).

Any questions, please email me.

- Competition hammer
- 15# hammer spring
- Single action only trigger

These modifications make it so that the gun runs much like a 1911 would, except more reliable, in 9mm, with access to double stack magazines and with those great CZ ergonomics. The trigger has a little take up before you hit a crisp, predictable 3-4 pound break. The trigger reset is minimal. 

The gun will come with ONE 19 round factory magazine, and will also include a Sig Tac belt holster. It will also include some of the stock parts. Stock hammer, stock trigger, firing pin block and sear cage parts. 

Price is 700.00 OBO, willing to go down on price if going to a good home. I bounce back and forth between Tucson and Tempe. Mostly in Tucson but if you're in the Phoenix area and really are interested we'll set up a time.

This rifle is in the 140,000 serial range and some GI parts were still being used. Obviously the 18"" barrel is not a GI part as the were no production M14 rifles with 18"" barrels. This rifle is in excellent shape mechanically and the function is flawless.. The stock had a few rubs, marks and dings, so I sprayed it with a very light coat of automotive black finish. It turned out looking new, but you can still see the marks, they're just all black now. I did no refinishing on the metal. It was cleaned and wiped with an oily rag. That's all. Bush rifles are no longer produced and not seen for sale very often. Comes with one 20 rd. mag. Ships to FFL.feel free to ank any Question.Please no Trading"

The ST is ""Smooth Top"", and was a limited run that took 2-piece Remington 700 style bases, rather than the integral Ruger base.  It gives a lot more flexibility with mounting and is fairly unique for a Ruger.  Has iron signts as well, which are becoming hard to find on new guns.

Gun is in great shape, not flawless though.  Has been carried quite a bit in the field (I'm owner #2), but shot very little.  Wood has expected scratches for a 40 year old hunting rifle.  Bluing is great, with two small areas of wear.  Bore is excellent.  Accuracy is fantastic with the right load, horrible with the wrong load.  It eats heavier bullets with ease.  

I would prefer to trade for an ""easier on the shoulder"" rifle, but could also sell.  It does a number on Elk, Boar, and Targets, but it is just too much gun for me.  Would make an excellent coyote gun, if you weren't saving pelts and wanted to shoot 600 yards.  Open to any trade offers, always prefer older guns and the occasional fixer-upper.

Cash offers can be made as well, fire away and no, I don't expect to give it away or to get my money back on a gun I have had for some time.  I'm reasonable, really.

Have a good bit of reloading equip and components as well, if interested.

Im assuming its and antique because the man I got it from said he had it in his family for longer than he can remember. (he was in his 70's) Everything form the pistols to the Levis tag on the rear of the jeans are carved very well. I am currently moving and a lot of items are heading to storage.

I have a Mauser 1909. It has been sporterized, but is unlike a great many sporters here in the US. the job was done by Chet Paulson out of Tacoma in the late 50s to early 60s. It resides in a handmade stock by Paulson himself, and sports vintage Redfield sights. It is in the original 7.65x53 Argentine, unlike it`s thousands of similar sporters, which were converted to .30-06. In my limited experience, I`ve found that it is a lot cheaper than .30-06 too. The weapon has been used, and it shows. It has no Rust, just some patina on the Bolt face. Mr. Paulson is now deceased, and that only makes this Mauser worth more. Most of his work is in private collections, too. I had it priced at about $700-$750 by a friend who is very knowledgeable on this subject. It only needs a good bolt cleaning, although everything functions exactly as it should."

Okay, so I want $999 for the pistol as pictured. I'm taking a huge loss here but I'm moving on to another build. SO, what that means is I need the cash BUT I will PARTIAL TRADE for an AK. I need at least $400 cash on this deal so yes, I'm not expecting someone to offer up an Arsenal in partial trade. However, it needs to be a good shooter and standard AK format. So NO PAPS or AMD65s and anything else that has some universal fitment issues. Not looking for a Saiga unless it has already been PROFESSIONALLY ""smithed"" converted. I'm not trading for some junk, canted sight, wobbly mag, stripped barrel threaded, spray can painted, dinged up feed ramp looking gun. You get my drift!

I live in Puyallup and work in Renton. Those are my meet locations. On your mark...get set...PM!

So that's it. $999 in cash or a GOOD AK in partial trade with $400 in cash."

The .223 SJC Titan was designed and developed with USPSA Grand Master Eric Lund to provide a competitive advantage in 3-gun competition. It is legal for Limited, Tactical and Open Division rifles. 

This compensator will reduce your muzzle rise, giving you better control of your rifle. Gas vectoring technology maximizes recoil reduction and minimizes torque and shot to shot recovery time. The design traps expanding gasses in the baffles and increases dwell time for maximum efficiency possible, allowing faster follow up shots and transitions between targets."

Just got spoiled with the a/c unit in my new car and never drove the skylark since. It needs new tires and a battery and it should turn over on a drop of a hat like it always did. I gave it a higher end tune up when I purchased it and it was running PERFECTLY for 3 years. Would probably need new tune up and fluids ect. EVERYTHING IN THIS VEHICLE IS ORIGINAL. to the motor, interior, paint, and logos on every door and rim saying skylark and logo.. Everything is shiny chrome. The interior is nicer than my 2010 charger. Paint is perfect. some pics make the roof look sun damaged but it is just dust. paint is very nice when washed and buffed out. Also professionally installed all kenwood audio system. Kept all original radio and speakers in and the kenwood in the glove box and the speakers in there own boxes I put on top of the back seat by the rear windshield. I have over $8000 in this beauty.

I am looking for a RUSSIAN NAGANT MODEL 1895 / m1895 REVOLVER (7.62X38R) that is priced reasonable.  These used to be $99.  The supply dried up but it didn't make the firearm any better.  Demand just won't  push supply anywhere near $225+.    

I'd prefer one with all the extras but will consider ones without.  I have a concealed carry permit so I am good to go buying or selling these WWII guns. I'd prefer meet face to face in Tampa Bay but I do also have a C&R FFL so I can accept direct firearms shipments.

Let me know the details (i.e. date. condition, markings, etc) of the revolver you are offering for sale.  I am willing to pay $165 for one in nice shape (and maybe more for something exceptional).  I may also entertain trades depending on what you are looking for.

Roughly 200 hollow point match ammo, some PPU stuff, some Freedom Munitions stuff and a single German DAG round (the blue plastic rounds). I'll also throw in a can of tung oil. This is the real 100% stuff, not the mix.
Reasons why I'm selling. Reached a point in my life where I need cash more than guns. Because of this I can't afford to feed a big 308 flinging rifle.
I bounce back and forth between Tucson and Tempe. I'm mostly in Tucson but if you're interested and in the Phoenix area we can work something out.
Again I'm looking for $1500 or throw me an offer. What's the worst that can happen? I say no?
Thanks for looking and e-mail me if you're interested."
