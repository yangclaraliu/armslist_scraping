16,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2079016,For Sale:  Pentax Lightseeker Variable  8.5 - 32 x 50 Riflescope,"North, San Antonio, Texas",$ 495,"Listed On: Thursday, September 5, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a used Pentax Lightseeker rifle scope 8.5 x 32 x 50 in matte black, with target turret style adjustments, 1/8 moa windage and elevation adjustments, parallax adjustment from 50 yards to infinity,  a one inch body tube, and a fine duplex reticle.  This is old school first generation Lightseeker, they are onto Generation II now. But I dont think Pentax makes this scope in 32 power anymore, I think they only go to 24 power these days, and a new Pentax Lightseeker II that is only magnified to 6 - 24 x 50 sells for 648.50 online.  If someone wants something as high as 32 power in the higher quality lines, I think the only choices these days are Nightforce Scopes and Leupold fixed power benchrest scopes, the Leupold for over 1,000 bucks, and the most ""inexpensive"" Nightforces are over 1200.  There are two other brands these days selling up to 32 power, I think Sightron is one, and maybe Bushnell is the other, but even both of those are 900 bucks, and the glass is not as good as Pentax.  Remember, Pentax originates from a photography heritage, so their glass is very high quality.  The scope is 17 1/2 inches long, not sure of weight, sorry.  There are some superficial surface scratches and mounting marks, and this scope looks-wise is admittedly not as totally pristine and perfect looking as the rest of mine (see my other ads), but I can assure you this is just from light  contact and rubbing from coming in and out of its case.  This scope sat on a pampered 22-250 Varmint /Target rifle ( a light recoiling  round) which I simply used as a benchgun, so the rifle was never in the field in any hunting application, and so was never abused in that sense.  So just some surface blemishes  from a sloppy in and out of its case once or twice, but the mechanics are perfectly fine, and the glass is fantastic. If you're looking for a high quality, high magnification used scope, from someone who uses only top end items and takes good care of his stuff, and don't have over 1,000 -1200 bucks or more to splurge on a Nightforce or Leupold that go up to 32 power, then this is a great buy for you."

49,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2079049,For Sale:  Pentax Lightseeker Variable 8.5 - 32 x 50 Riflescope,"North, San Antonio, Texas",$ 495,"Listed On: Thursday, September 5, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a used Pentax Lightseeker rifle scope 8.5 x 32 x 50 in matte black, with target turret style adjustments, 1/8 moa windage and elevation adjustments, parallax adjustment from 50 yards to infinity, a one inch body tube, and a fine duplex reticle. This is old school first generation Lightseeker, they are onto Generation II now. But I dont think Pentax makes this scope in 32 power anymore, I think they only go to 24 power these days, and a new Pentax Lightseeker II that is only magnified to 6 - 24 x 50 sells for 648.50 online. If someone wants something as high as 32 power in the higher quality lines, I think the only choices these days are Nightforce Scopes and Leupold fixed power benchrest scopes, the Leupold for over 1,000 bucks, and the most ""inexpensive"" Nightforces are over 1200. There are two other brands these days selling up to 32 power, I think Sightron is one, and maybe Bushnell is the other, but even both of those are 900 bucks, and the glass is not as good as Pentax. Remember, Pentax originates from a photography heritage, so their glass is very high quality. The scope is 17 1/2 inches long, not sure of weight, sorry. There are some superficial surface scratches and mounting marks, and this scope looks-wise is admittedly not as totally pristine and perfect looking as the rest of mine (see my other ads), but I can assure you this is just from light contact and rubbing from coming in and out of its case. This scope sat on a pampered 22-250 Varmint /Target rifle ( a light recoiling round) which I simply used as a benchgun, so the rifle was never in the field in any hunting application, and so was never abused in that sense. So just some surface blemishes from a sloppy in and out of its case once or twice, but the mechanics are perfectly fine, and the glass is fantastic. If you're looking for a high quality, high magnification used scope, from someone who uses only top end items and takes good care of his stuff, and don't have over 1,000 -1200 bucks or more to splurge on a Nightforce or Leupold that go up to 32 power, then this is a great buy for you."

This is a Springfield Garand made in 1943. It is the Danish variety and has the highly sought after VAR barrel. The barrel is made in 1957 and is one of the only non original components of the rifle. It's throat gauge is less than one and the rifling is excellent, which means it's rarely been used. The stock has virtually no dings and matches the receiver. This is definitely a collectible model, although it shoots beautifully if you are so inclined (as I hope you are). The pictures do not do this rifle justice. I would prefer to sell this outright but I might consider a lesser value trade if an appropriate amount of boot is offered.

NEWEST MOST ADVANCED SHELL CATCHING SYSTEM.....PERIOD!!!!!!

Light Years Ahead Of The Competition!

The ""National II"" was developed for the shooter, especially the competitor at the National Pistol Matches. It meets the NRA requirement and will defy high wind, with optional High Wind Kit, but will not act as a screen, thereby not giving an extra advantage against the wind.

The National II is a far superior system to the original in that the tubes are thinner with threaded ends, the basket is larger which is also foldable for storing, and the casings drop unobstructed via the adjustable length shute to the can. The basket height is adjustable with extra tube lengths and is so much easier to put together with less parts. The Most Advanced Universal Brass Catcher in an Ammo can of the 21st Century, Period!!

Completely self contained and easy to use with adjustable height. Extra tubes are used to increase the height of the net location and are available from our online store. Unscrew the tubes, fold the net and the frame, place them in the dedicated storage compartment in the can, and you're ready to move on.

That's over $1000 in Awesomeness, not including tax and shipping. This gun was a blast to trick out and it's even better to shoot. Make me an offer- I don't hold grudges. This pistol kicks the lc9's ass and makes the Kahr look like a nerdy virgin. This firearm is $475 cheaper in it's current configuration than it's only competitor the Glock 26. With tax and shipping your saving over $625 off new. And it is like new.  This thing is perfection. Your gonna end up with all these accesories anyway. Save money.

      p.s.  EVERY replacement part Brownells sells for the Nano is in a box with this gun. Extra striker, springs, ejector, everything. And RECEIPTS for everything listed!

I have installed a Karsten adjustable cheek rest on it and had the barrel threaded 5/8-24 for my favorite can and brake. Also included is a Harris 6-9 notched leg swivel bipod. I installed a Primary Weapon Systems (imho the best brake on the market) brake on it and really cut what wasn't a whole lot of recoil by a much greater amount. The barrel was meticuously broken in and has a whole 86 rounds through it. I has the Accutrigger on it as well. On these rifles Savage puts the match trigger in them, not the hunting rifle trigger. I will tell you guys this thing drives tacks! Varget with 168 Sierra MK's is king in this rifle! If you are looking for a phenominal tac rifle at a great price, this is it. These have been noted to shoot side by side with most of the very high dollar production rifles as well as some of the customs being built. I shot next to some guys from a local SWAT team one day and they couldn't believe what it was doing for having so few rounds down the tube!

Unused as I decided to go a short barrel route and this is intended for a carbine length rifle. Includes Piston, Rod, attachments, and bolt carrier. Worth well over $400, only asking $200 or best offer. Factory information listed below:

The Bushmaster Gas Piston Retrofit Conversion Kit is a Patent-Pending Gas Piston System for MIL-Spec M4 type carbines (Note: MIL-Spec
carbines have a barrel diameter not exceeding .875” immediately behind the front sight block). It replaces the original gas impingement system tube and bolt
carrier with a robust short-stroke piston and operating rod that is designed to enhance the controllability and reliability of your rifle under adverse conditions. The
Gas Piston Retrofit Conversion Kit is designed for easy installation requiring only a few minutes of time. However, if you are not thoroughly familiar with the
disassembly and function of this type of rifle, you should have this kit installed in your rifle by a trained armorer or competent gunsmith who is well versed in the
AR-15/M16 family of weapons. Such a trained armorer can perform the test-fire procedure to ensure that this kit has been properly installed and is completely
functional.

All of today's standard 45 colt loads are very anemic. Often featuring a 250 gr. Bullet at around 700 fps.

We knew that we could develop a couple standard pressure 45 colt loads that would feature a 255gr. Gas checked soft cast bullet at around 1,000 fps or a 200gr. Jacketed Hollow Point at around 1,100fps. We wanted loads that were substantially more powerful than today's weenie loads, but that could be fired in ANY 45 colt firearm.

Both of these 45 colt loads are designed to be a heavy loading, yet be within standard (SAAMI) pressure. As such, both of these 45 colt loads are safe and recommended to be used IN ANY post-war 45 colt that is in normal working condition. ANY post-war means ANY post-war, so please take my word for it without phoning or emailing me ""just to make sure"". I love hearing from and appreciate customers, I really do, but there is no sense using up your or my time answering questions that have already been answered.

These loads are indeed heavy 45 colt loadings. You can fire them in any post-war firearm that is in normal working condition chambered for 45 colt without reservation. These loads will turn your Colt SAA or clone into a powerful carry gun. The cast load (item 3E) is gas checked and will not substantially lead your barrel.

I have a few boxes of ammo that I would like to sell or trade. 
- 3 550 round bulk packs of 22 Long rifle. (22 lr).
- 6 50 round boxes of federal 9mm FMJ 115 grain ammo. 
- 1 50 round box of Remington 9mm fmj 124 grain. 
- 1 50 round box of PMC FMJ 9mm. 
- 2 50 round boxes Brass FMJ Monarch 115 9mm ammunition
- I have a good number of various 50 round boxes of 22lr. 

This is all fresh ammo (within the last few months) and I have many rounds and partial boxes as well. 
OK, that being said, here is what I am looking for:
-I would trade some or all for most any gun, or I will sell for best cash offer. I am not looking to sell for an extremely hyped up price like some of these yahoo's selling for 50 bucks for one of these bulk boxes, but at same time I'm not willing to sell for less than the retail on them. I know these are hard to find, and I know what they cost and what the market has them at

If you have any questins or offers please message me at REDACTED and we can try to make a deal. I can shot pictures if you want, although pictures of ammo seems rather unnecessary. haha

WILL TRADE FOR:

22 revolver, 22 semi auto, 22 rifle, 9mm, 380, 45, shotgun, rifle, you name it. I am open to all reasonable offers. I am interested in really anything that goes bang really. Preferably no blackpowders unless it is just an amazing deal in my favor. I do have a high preference for a 22 lr revolver or possibly military guns. But like i said, I am open to anything really."
