- It is a 195 series (dated around 1996) all stainless steel and in good condition.
- Includes the following:
--- ATI synthetic 6-position folding stock with rubber padded cheek rest.
--- 40 round metal magazine.
--- Muzzle break / flash hider.
***As seen in pic, original front sight pin has been lost years ago and there is a slightly longer temporary pin in its place. The muzzle break is also slightly loose and could use some simple tampering to tighten up.

Overall a great, reliable Ruger rifle. I am only selling because after spending four years in the Marine Infantry I miss my M16 and want to get an AR with A4 top next.

Looking for $700.00, but I am open to bartering with +/- cash, etc... 
(In the event of a tie, a case of beer will settle it.)

Fresh build that's never been fired. Willing to take buyer out to certify functionality post sale.

I used to fire weapons I intended on selling at least once to reiterate flawless functionality, but I never had a single issue and I've seen many people concerned with it not being ""brand new"" at that point.

The ammo alone would cost over $200+tax. I have worked up a load that shoots 1/2"" groups at 100 yrds. Very nice scope. I can hit a 6"" target 10 out of 10 times out to 600+ yrds.

Action is insanely smooth, far and away better than my $1700 Remmington 700 rig. Comes with Plano hard case. Ammo comes in .50 cal cans.

This is the m1887 Swedish Nagant. It is chambered in 7.5mm Swedish or 7.5mm Swiss Ordinance (available online). This will also shoot .32 S&W long unjacketed lead bullets without issue which can be had at Cabelas for $16 a box. I will include a box of .32 wad cutters.

This particular revolver was made in 1898 or 1899 depending on the source of the info. It has a second serial number that shows it was re-issued to the Swedish home guard during WWII. Strawed and blued parts are an great shape with no rust. Shiny bore with no pitting. Overall 80-85% condition. Perfect mechanical function. Handmade with some of the best quality steel ever made in Sweden. Double and single action, six shot. Locks up tight and trigger breaks cleanly.

All #'s matching except the cylinder which came off a revolver made a month before this one.

Would make a neat little trail gun or a good piece to add to a Nagant collection.

Make a cash or trade offer. Must meet me here in Arlington. A revolver in this condition would conservatively sell in the $400-500 range on Gunbroker. The Tulalip Cabelas has one for $399 in worse shape. I am open to some negotiation. Must be 18 or older to own.

Looking for a browning auto-5, AR parts (stripped uppers and lowers), and general interesting firearms related stuff. I like old bolt guns and weird stuff."

UPPER ASSEMBLY DESCRIPTION
This Adams Arms Tactical EVO PDW Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 pistol or registered SBR lower receiver. The Tactical EVO upper receiver line represents an outstanding value, and is the result of blending characteristics from the Adams Arms EVO Ultra Lite configuration with their Tactical Elite series to create a new, high performance platform at a more economical price. It features a melonite finished, 7.5"" medium contour barrel with a 1 in 7"" twist, making it capable of stabilizing medium- to heavy-weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. Despite its short pistol length gas system, the piston chamber inside the PDW's gas block is the same size and has the same volume as Adams Arms' other gas system lengths. This means that unlike most AR-15 based systems that become notoriously unreliable once the barrel is reduced to less than 10"" in length, the super short Adams Arms 7.5"" PDW upper has the proper gas dwell time and bolt carrier velocity to allow it to function reliably and consistently in all conditions. It comes equipped with a free floating, 7"" Samson Evolution Modular Rail Handguard that extends to surround the picatinny rail piston gas block on its bottom and both sides for a clean look and additional rail space if required. Additional features include M4 feed ramps, an A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle assembly, one 4"" modular rail section and one QD sling swivel socket adapter. 

BARREL DESCRIPTION
The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

PISTON DESCRIPTION
All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance. 

LIFETIME WARRANTY
All Adams systems come with a lifetime warranty provided you have not modified any of our parts or used them for anything other than their intended usage.

PROMAG SKS 30 round magazine unopened in factory packaging. 

LEAPERS SKS scope mount never used. Mount fits any SKS and is designed for use with any scope or red dot with a 1 inch tube. 

Pre Ban 20 round blued steel magazine. This mag is high quality all steel construction with a very nice blued finish. It fits any SKS and it allows you to double capacity to 20 rounds while maintaining the original factory appearance. It also protrudes far less than the more modern high capacity mags. I've seen these sell for $90 on eBay, but you don't see them often. 

80 rounds 7.62 x39 ammo loaded on (8) SKS steel stripper clips and packed into a reusable OD green nylon bandoleer complete with cardboard sleeves. Ammo is made by S&B with lacquered steel case, non-corrosive with 122 grain FMJ bullets.  

5 additional SKS steel stripper clips. 

Flip down bipod that attaches to your bayonet lug on all common SKS variations. Just use the special mounting screw/stud that's included and you can install this bipod while retaining full use of your bayonet (blade or spike style). This is a really nifty SKS accessory.

Price is $150 for everything and it's being sold as one lot only. Pick it up in the Brandon area.

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
 This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
 A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
 This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

 The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."

For sale/trade is 900 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. I am asking far less than retail for cash offers.

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.
I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

 The Vortek™ has many of our most popular features molded into one gun. Our ergonomic alloy frame gives hunters a lighter gun and also helps prevent rust. The one-piece, Drop-Out trigger assembly can be removed with a single screw which makes cleaning and maintenance a breeze. The Speed Load System allows for easier bullet starting and more consistent groups thanks to the ability to seat your bullet in the same place each time. 360 Degree Barrel Porting helps reduce muzzle jump and recoil. The stainless steel barrel is also packed with features. Sitting atop the barrel are Williams™ fiber optic metals sights which can withstand the wear and tear of the outdoors. The barrel can handle up to 150 grains of pelletized or loose powder. Another great feature of the Vortek™ is the Accelerator Breech Plug™ which allows you to unscrew you breech plug by hand in just three complete turns! Rounding out the Vortek™ is an all-around good feel thanks to over molded stocks and forends. This gives you a sure grip even in the worst conditions. Seeing and reading about the Vortek™ is one thing but feeling is believing. The Vortek™ was designed by hunters, for hunters and once you get your hands on it, you too will ""feel"" the difference."

This is a rare all factory free-floated 10/22. Most likely you have never seen one of these in person, and neither will any of your buddies have either. This is the ultimate tactical style 22, it blows away the S&W MP15-22, and all others. If you are not familiar with these check out the link below. MSRP on it is $650 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have.

Gun is in great shape, very low round count, still in it's break in period. Comes with factory box and all accessories that came with it in including the barrel bushing wrench and gun lock

I deal pretty much exclusively with 1911s and have had them all from RIAs to Colts and I can honestly and confidantly say these Remingtons are the best bang for the buck on the market right now. They have all the same quality as Colt with the only exception being that Colts have a better finish and a horse on the side. This Remington actually has a smoother/lighter trigger than either my Colt or my Springfield which had full Wilson Combat internals. The trigger is fantastic and the slide is super smooth. The factory mags on these Remingtons are the best I've seen sent with any factory 1911. They're very smooth and have the follower that turns down into the frame of the mag so they don't get hung up during loading or chew up your brass. I will add a pic of what I mean so you can see for yourself

Ok here's the deal. I'm not actively looking to get rid of this gun. I love it and have no problem keeping it. I have a very specific idea in mind of what I would take for this gun and will list that below. Other than that I will sell it outright if anyone is interested but my price is firm. Again not actively looking to get rid of it but will let it go for the right deal"

It is not new in the box, but has only had 150 or so rounds put through it, mostly low brass target load. It is very well maintained and operates very smoothly as would be expected of an 870. It incliuded a threaded door breaching, improved cylinder choke tube, Magpul MOE foreend and Magpul MOE buttstock with adjustments for cheek weld and length of pull. This is a great shotgun for home defense and handles better than any other 870 that I have ever used. It has an 18 1/2"" barrel and 6+1 capacity. It is a very nice shotgun and I hate to part ways with it, but I need the money at this time. I would like to get $500 for it, but I am willing to talk reasonably about the price. Sorry, that I have only one picture on this page. I will gladly send more to anyone interested.

The 3904 is a a 3rd generation S&W semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9mm that is a very good mix of the very popular compact 3913 / 3914 and the the full size 5906 / 5904 series.  The 3904 offers the full size grip and 4"" barrel of the 5900 series but the slim single stack design of the 3900 series.  These make great carry weapons with their slim design and light weight of an aluminum alloy frame.  3904's are some of the rarer 3rd generation smith's as they were only made from 1988 - 1990.  

This 3904 is in good condition with holster wear from carry.  It is traditional Da/Sa with slide mounted safety / decocker.  Gun is VERY reliable and is not ammo picky.  It does have adjustable rear sights and is extremely accurate.  Due to the longer grip and sight radius and can shoot this more accurately than my 3913 but it is substantially lighter than my 6904 or 5906.  Gun comes with 2 S&W magazines, 1 8 round and 1 9 round.  Also, if you have a 3913, 908, ext.., the 3904 mags can be used in those and they protrude out the end some.  I really like these guns just looking to free up some cash for another purchase.  Asking $350 but will consider reasonable offers.  Not really looking for trades but might be interested in S&W or Ruger revolvers in 32 H&R Mag or 327 Fed Mag, especially a single six in 32 H&R.
