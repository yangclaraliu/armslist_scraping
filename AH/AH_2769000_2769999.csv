As you can tell, I have right around $1,900 in this rifle, pre-panic.  Everything on this rifle is high end, except the scope setup which is what most would consider mid-range.  There is no tapco or NCstar crap on it.  It has had approximately 1,500 rounds through it and during that time not a single malfunction of any kind.  There are only two minor issues with it; both of which are common.  Issue 1:  It is impossible to fully seat a full 30rd mag into this rifle.  You have to load 26 or 27 rounds into a 30rd mag to get them to latch in.  issue 2:  Apparently, Rock River makes their buffer tubes a bit smaller in diameter than everybody else.  This means that the ACS stock does not latch down as solidly as it could on a regular milspec tube.  It does not effect function whatsoever.  I remedied most of this issue with some aluminum ductwork tape in a few strategic spots on the buffer tube.  It could easily be removed if you like.  You can't see it until you pull the stock out passed the second or third closest in position.  Anyways, I would sell the rifle as it sits (minus the laser sight on the rail system; which is not for sale) for $1,300.  Text me at 317-529-72nine nine I am open to partial trade offers.  I don't want your compound bow, muzzle loader, or high point.  Not interested in project cars, campers, or fishin' boats.  I like high end tactical guns, plain and simple.  If what you have to offer to trade doesn't fall into that category then please do not contact me."

History of M70 automatic rifle

During the 1970th The opportunity arose and the other flag is tasked to initiate the production of AP and AP M70 M70A for the army. Model AP M70A was the folding butt. Home production of local varieties Kalashnikov began somewhere around the 1959th The first models appeared under the given name M64 for testing. Model had a familial south handle, closing the gas chamber for firing grenades and a few more things different than the original model of Kalashnikov assault as a handle that is different from the original. How are performance rifles were only satisfactory, the Yugoslav People’s Army is not accepted as a standard rifle infantry weapon.

Before the larger models of rifles made, reducing costs proizvododnji resulted in the removal of some parts of the frame and relocating the followers. In addition, the usual set pipe through the reciver is being replaced by cheaper extrusion tube reciver. Rifles produced with this new method are called AP M70B (with static butt) and AP M70AB2 (with foldingbutt).

As with the M70 series assault rifles, these models are not produced in large quantities before they are reduced production costs, which led again to a new model. This time the reciver reduced to a thickness of 0.9 mm, speed reducer cracking has been added to the trigger, and set the brake. Yugoslav Kalashnikovs with these characteristics are called AP M70B1 (with static butt) and AP M70AB1 (with folding butt).

These models are also coming to mass production, before the last alteration M70 rifle design resulted with models AP M70B2 (with static butt) and M70AB2 (with flip Kondakova). The latter two modes had reciver thickness 1.5mm thinner and reinforcing the front of the gun in an effort to strengthen the frequent firing grenades. These two models are widely produced in the M70 series, and have become the most widely used models in the JNA and on all sides during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Parts imported to America, show marks that are contradictory to the final model. On those parts of the printed label M70B1.

All models of the M70 family of AP share the possibility of firing grenades, extended grip with 3 cooling slots, iron tombstones with phosphorus or tritium to improve shooting night. Rifle are fire codes for the types of R – burst, S – single fire.

Design and features AP M70

M70 can be easily distinguished from other Kalashnikov assault rifles for 3 slots for cooling to handle, light colored wood grip, sight for firing grenades and black rubber coating on factory M70 rifles.

Reciver from AP M70 is 1.5mm thin, and compared with standard receivers Kalashnikov, it is more rigid. Besides the tube is not chrome-lined, making it more precise than the standard machine guns.

 Winchester 534REDACTED Carbine Lever-Action .357 Mag Rifle, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. For 2011, this exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

This rifle is in good cosmetic condition and has an excellent bore (around 100 rounds through it), but it needs a little bit of work.

Its main problem is it has a bad gas tube which bleeds off gas, causing it to short stroke. 7/10 times it cycles properly, but it failed to hold the bolt open on the last round on every occasion. It has cycled properly with another gas tube, so i can confidently say it does work, just not with its current gas tube.

Other issues are its front sight is slightly canted and the trigger is a bit heavy.

He is incorrect.  Only handguns must be transferred through an FFL in PA.  Long guns can be transferred via bill of sale.  Yes, an AR, AK, or a shotgun is considered a long gun (provided it has a minimum 16"" barrel).

BTW, this guy is just a fear-mongering troll.  I contacted him and was given the good word of The Lord on gun transfers, or his version of it.  Personally, if the government doesn't need to be involved, don't let them be.  I've always found the shooting community does a good job of policing themselves.  As for civil liability, I'll take my chances, but I doubt it would be an issue.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple Brand New, factory fresh CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical 9mm Pistols, Model 91153. The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical models also come standard with 3 dot tritium night sights. If you haven’t yet experienced the joy of shooting a CZ handgun, you need to. They are crafted masterfully, and with a solid steel frame these are built to last a lifetime and then some.


I only have TWO in stock, and they are priced to sell quickly for only $649.00 each (cash price).



CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical 9mm Semi-Auto Pistol with Decocker, Tritium Night Sights, Two 18-round Mags – CZ 91153

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform.

The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ 75 SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

This Glock features a unique, limited edition Olive Drab Green frame. The GLOCK 19 is ideal for a versatile role because of its reduced dimensions when compared to the standard sized option. Chambered in 9x19, the G19 has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case

This Glock features a unique, limited edition Olive Drab Green frame. The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size, , including the popular new beavertail backstrap. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case

(Yes shoots all 3 types of bullets) Rifle looks like a Winchester M-49. It's a single shot .22. You load one round at a time in the breech after pulling down the lever, close the lever, pull back the hammer and then shoot. Pull down the lever again and the shell ejects. Load your second .22 round and repeat.  Rifle is 35 "" overall length. This is an older 1960's model based on the serial number. Wood stock is in great shape Someone did a fine job using some nice grain wood and refinishing it. It has Original Ithaca butt plate. The only problem with this weapon is some of the metal near the breech appears to be painted black. In no way affects the use of the weapon. I've seen some M49's sold on gunbroker.com for nearly $180. I'm asking $125 or trade for U.S. silver coins or .22 pistol.  Because of the Colorado Democrats, you are now required to submit to a background check for private sales. I know a place in Littleton that charges $25 for the transfer paperwork. (A place called rapid fire bunker) One good thing is you don't have to pay any sales tax!!!!! So that will save you around 8% of the sales price. If you want more pictures or other info, text me at REDACTED or email me.
Things to remember:
This rifle is over 50 years old, and in nice shape, however it is NOT in perfect shape. If you want a new perfect .22 go and buy a new one for $180 including sales tax.
This rifle has an overall length of 35 inches. (Don't come and see it and tell me that it's shorter in length than you thought it would be). 
Just trying to save us both some time before meeting!
Thanks for looking!"

This rifle is brand new, still in the original factory plastic, only removed for pictures. It is unfired and absolutely unused in anyway. I purchased this rifle new from Gander Mountain not very long ago for an upcoming hunting trip. Well, the trip fell through and I really have no need for this rifle. That said, I don't NEED to sell it either so please don't waste my time or yours with low ball type offers. 

Some fun facts about this rifle, most of which is why I end up deciding on this model:

- It can shoot both 5.56 and .223 ammo (unlike most .223 bolt actions that can only shoot .223 ammo). I have several AR's and have a lot of 5.56 ammo accumulated and t's nice to know I can shoot the 5.56 with this rifle as well.
- It has a fully adjustable trigger, as in the owner can adjust it in about 5 minutes without needing any fancy tools or an expensive gunsmith. 
- The barrel is 1:9 twist, meaning is can properly stabilize up to 69 grain ammo. Many .223 bolt action rifles are 1:12 twist meaning they cannot effectively shoot anything higher than 55 grain ammunition. This is important for distance shooting and accuracy.
- This rifle is designed to use standard AR15 magazines. Yup, you read that correctly. any size or form of standard AR15 magazine fits fine (ex. 5/10/20/30 rounders, polymer type like Magpul or metal type like issued by the military...all work in this rifle). No more trying to hunt down specific hard to find magazines, only to pay through the nose.
- Military spec bolt (meaning it is both durable, lightweight, and effective)
- Fluted barrel for reduced weight and heat dissipation. 
- Integral Weaver-style 2-piece bases for such things as optics

Here is a link to the exact rifle I purchased from the place I bought it from:
http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Mossberg-MVP-Varmint-Centerfire-Rifle&i=721783&r=view&from=grid

I paid approx $685 for rifle with tax. I am willing to take a bit of a loss, within reason, after all it is still brand new unfired. I think $600 is an extremely fair price. I also have a nice unused rifle butt-stock pouch that holds extra ammo and other stuff as well. I will include this as well for $20 (paid $45 for it). Not looking for any trades at this time.

To purchase - must be at least 18 years of age with a valid government issued ID. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the Akron area. CHL/CCW holders preferred."

The History...

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied."

830,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2769830,For Sale:  Mossberg MVP 5.56/.223 bolt action rifle,"Akron area, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 4, 2014",Rifles,Mossberg                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a Mossberg MVP 5.56/.223 bolt action rifle for sale. This rifle is brand new, still in the original factory plastic, only removed for pictures. It is unfired and absolutely unused in anyway. I purchased this rifle new from Gander Mountain not very long ago for an upcoming hunting trip. Well, the trip fell through and I really have no need for this rifle. That said, I don't NEED to sell it either so please don't waste my time or yours with low ball type offers. 

Some fun facts about this rifle, most of which is why I end up deciding on this model:

- It can shoot both 5.56 and .223 ammo (unlike most .223 bolt actions that can only shoot .223 ammo). I have several AR's and have a lot of 5.56 ammo accumulated and t's nice to know I can shoot the 5.56 with this rifle as well.
- It has a fully adjustable trigger, as in the owner can adjust it in about 5 minutes without needing any fancy tools or an expensive gunsmith. 
- The barrel is 1:9 twist, meaning is can properly stabilize up to 69 grain ammo. Many .223 bolt action rifles are 1:12 twist meaning they cannot effectively shoot anything higher than 55 grain ammunition. This is important for distance shooting and accuracy.
- This rifle is designed to use standard AR15 magazines. Yup, you read that correctly. any size or form of standard AR15 magazine fits fine (ex. 5/10/20/30 rounders, polymer type like Magpul or metal type like issued by the military...all work in this rifle). No more trying to hunt down specific hard to find magazines, only to pay through the nose.
- Military spec bolt (meaning it is both durable, lightweight, and effective)
- Fluted barrel (20"") for reduced weight and heat dissipation. 
- Integral Weaver-style 2-piece bases for such things as optics

Here is a link to the rifle I purchased from the place I bought it from:
http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Mossberg-MVP-Varmint-Centerfire-Rifle&i=721783&r=view&from=grid

I am willing to take a bit of a loss, within reason, after all it is still brand new unfired. Price is $550. I also have a nice unused rifle butt-stock pouch and cheek pad that holds extra ammo and other stuff as well. I will include this in the deal (paid $45 for it).

To purchase - must be at least 18 years of age with a valid government issued ID. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the Akron area. CHL/CCW holders preferred."

Description

X400U-A-RD
The SureFire X400 Ultra WeaponLight integrates stunningly powerful white-light illumination and bright red laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail-mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close- to medium-range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high-performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt laser sight, located below the primary light, emits a high-visibility red (635 nM) beam. The laser's aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. 

Activating the X400 Ultra is done is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. A separate switch at the rear of the X400 Ultra allows you to (1) activate white light illumination only, (2) activate white light illumination simultaneously with the laser sight, (3) activate the laser sight only, or (4) disable the entire X400 Ultra. See illustration at upper left. 

Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and a pressure activated XT07 tape switch (for long guns) permit the X400 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment/detachment from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.
