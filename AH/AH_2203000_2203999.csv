The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. The barrel is also spiral fluted to reduce weight by 20% and is treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. This rifle has a 12"" lightweight scupted quad rail handguard derived from LWRC's REPR platform. This rifle features LWRC's enhanced fire control group and both it and the bolt carrier group are coated with a proprietary nickel coating for permanent lubricity. The butt stock is a B5 SOPMOD and the pistol grip is a MagPul MOE+. The sights are LWRC folding BUIS.

This one came from Ruger with the fixed synthetic stock and he bought the factory walnut stock and the Butler Creek folder for it. The only wear to speak of on the gun is on the bolt, op rod, and bolt raceway from shooting and cycling the action. He put 500-1000 rounds through it and cleaned it after every shooting session. Very nice gun. Comes with one factory 20 round magazine and all three stocks. The walnut stock has the metal liner intact. Retail, the extra two stocks are worth $200+. $750 firm for the gun and all three stocks, face to face in Hickory, NC. Or, buy the gun with just the original, fixed synthetic stock for $650.  Have several additional factory 20 and 30 round magazines I'll make available to the buyer of the gun for a good price, but won't list them separately unless the gun sells. Thanks for looking!"

This is an 1800's Remington Rolling Block rifle in .50 caliber (""50/70""). It has no markings on it that I see but I am not an expert historian on these by any means.

I have been advised by the previous owner  (passed down to him) that at least a portion of this rifle was carried by his Grandfather who served in the Confederacy in ""A Company""  during the Civil War .

I had some hot head a few months ago going on about the Rolling block not being made during the Civil War and that is true (except for 20,000 very early versions given to Union Troops) and I was not saying that anyway, so let me explain.

A local collector explained to me, after I gave him measurements on the original  bore (.58) and current .50 cal bushing, that it appears to be an early Civil War musket,stock and barrel that was LATER (as in after the Civil War) converted to the superior rolling block mechanism design while still retaining the stock (and barrel,sites etc) that he carved his Confederate Company name and a Christian cross into while serving. 

I do have a letter from the Grandson saying this was carried by the Grandfather that goes with the rifle you are welcome to also.

I am not trying to get the full value I was told it should bring to the right collector as I need a deposit for a Jeep .

At his point I am just going to focus on the fact that this is a very cool, complete, and tight (Grandson has fired it) .50Cal (50/70)Remington Rolling block with a very nice patina that  fortunately has not been  cleaned up or altered by an amateur.

This is a cash price (no shipping etc) and I will deal with someone near the Matthews, NC area. Sorry but I will not be travelling long distances to meet and will not be accepting anything other than cash so thank you in advance for your understanding.

Serious buyers only and I do have additional detailed pictures on request."

=====
The 1911-22 is built to the same dimensions as the full-sized 1911 pistol. It features a lightweight metal frame and slide, low-profile three-dot sights, working grip safety and ambidextrous thumb safety, making the 1911-22 a perfect training tool for 1911 fans as well as a fun plinking pistol for all ages.
=====

I will add that this is a near exact copy of the standard 1911, and it feels identical in the hand.  Full size and weight.  Even the magazine is weighted to feel the same when you handle it.  All controls and safeties are exactly the same.  It has an adjustable trigger and crisp 3-dot sights.

It points and shoots really nice.  Very accurate.  You can even swap out the grip panels for any other regular 1911 grips.  It's as close as you can get without being centerfire.  It will exactly fit all standard 1911 holsters, etc.  This one does have the threaded muzzle, so you can add any device you want.  Everything about the gun is super.  I'm just in need of something else at the moment.

These are $400+ new.  Asking $300 with light use."

I have for sale a Marlin 336, pre-safety, built by Gunslinger Custom in Whitehall, Arkansas. Below is their discription of the work:

Custom marlin 336 in 30-30. These start as standard marlin lever guns but are then cut down to 16 1/4"" and re-crowned and this does NOT hurt accuracy. Cutting eliminates a secondary barrel harmonic causing a more stable barrel during firing. All of these Brush Hogs are then media blasted and refinished in a two tone parkerized finish. The sights are then replaced with a ghost ring set and the lever is then replaced with a larger loop. Stocks are replaced as well. Before assembly we then perform our own trigger job to the rifle bringing it to 4 pounds while also re-hand fitting and deburring your bolt group to your lever and action for smoother more reliable operation. These are very nice refined rifles.

They charge $899 for the complete rifle or
$599 built on your rifle. I am selling mine in excellent condition with an Andy's Leather Buttcuff for $750. Email me for a picture. All offers will be considered. Will try to post a pic this evening.

Since cops started carrying handguns, their needs and preferences have driven the defensive handgun market. FNH USA’s latest defensive handgun, the FNS-9, is a perfect example of this trend. The FNS-9 incorporates many features attractive to law enforcement agencies. These same attributes make the pistol just as appealing to armed citizens and competitive shooters.
We’re living in the age of the modern pistol, which is typified by a polymer frame and a striker firing mechanism. Some like it. Others long for the days when pistols were made of steel. The majority of cops don’t care—most cops are not gun guys like many believe. Modern police officers want a pistol that is reliable, accurate, comfortable to shoot and light enough to carry all day, every day. Most cops would like to start their shift with a .44 Mag. By shift’s end, they’re ready to trade it for a .22. It wasn’t always like that.Back in the day, cops were big men with big hands. It was easy for departments to arm their offi-cers with a single handgun model because most were about the same size. Cops complaining their pistol was too heavy got jail duty or became car salesmen. There might have been a few Barney Fifes, but there were no women wearing a badge. Not all that long ago, diversity was unheard of. Modern cops are men and women, some as big and ugly as Brock Lesnar, others as petite and eye-catching as Eva Longoria. It’s the ability of the FNS-9 to comfortably interface with this diverse mix that will make agencies take notice.
This is primarily accomplished with the polymer frame, which has a grip angle identical to a 1911. There’s also a wide and high beavertail that allows for a low bore axis. Like the 1911, backstraps are interchangeable. Each pistol is shipped with two—one flat, one arched. Just as with the rest of the grip’s surface, the backstraps have very aggressive pebbling or checkering molded in. This might sound uncomfortable; however, due to fear of cuts, punctures and blood-borne diseases, most street officers now wear some sort of gloves. The assertive checkering helps gloved hands hang on."

Here is some additional literature:

The Buckmaster Series riflescopes feature sleek styling with an innovative ultramatte finish. Nikon's BDC reticle gives you the edge you need to determine the correct hold point before taking the shot. Designed for use with most centerfire cartridges, the BDC provides reliable aiming points out to 500 yds. after sighting in at 100 yds. Nikon matched high-resolution lenses with light capabilities up to 92% for bright, clear images. These Buckmaster scopes also feature 1/4""-MOA positive-click (the 6-18x40 has 1/8-MOA), hand-turnable recticle adjustments, a new fast-focus eyepiece and Nikon's full-lifetime warranty.

It is very accurate. I had no problem shooting 1 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with it using 90 grains of Triple Seven and a patched Hornady .530 round ball - that puts it dead-on at 100 yards. The rifle has a nice walnut stock.

The Lyman Great Plains Rifle is a replica of the gun carried by western pioneers and fur trappers. This classic muzzleloader offers high-quality features including a 32"" barrel with 1 in 60"" twist, double set triggers, Hawken-style lock, adjustable sights and wooden ramrod with entry thimble and nose cap.

New turned down bolt is installed. Functions and looks great.
The original stock has been sporterized, with a rubber recoil pad and the barrel is floated. The receiver has been drilled and tapped and is ready for a scope base.

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 M4 Carbine is a unique hybrid of traditional AR15
design and space age Carbon 15 materials. The upper and lower receivers of
the C15M4 Type are molded of Carbon 15 composite which offers a weight
savings of 3/4 of a pound compared to the standard forged aluminum
receivers. In addition, these molded receivers are completely impervious to
moisture, rust or corrosion and offer a 40% increase in strength over
aluminum. The Carbon 15 material is the same throughout, so there is no
surface finish to wear off or require maintenance.
