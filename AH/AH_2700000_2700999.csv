My understanding of its history is that it was used and later sold as surplus by Austrian SWAT (EKO Cobra). The previous owner parkerized it, probably because its finish was wrecked at the time of purchase.

Sixgun connoisseurs will know these are special and rarely seen weapons, still used today by the GIGN French counter-terrorist and hostage rescue unit. They have roughly the same mechanics as a S&W with noteworthy improvements to the trigger action making it the smoothest in double-action of probably any revolver ever made. This is combined with a cold-forged barrel of near Korth level accuracy and built on a frame just a hair smaller than your S&W L frame but with a strength and durability of a Ruger. In mint condition (which this gun is, admittedly, very far from) these are >$2000 guns. A good number of these were recently imported for the first time in over a decade, but from my experience all of them are at least as well used, have a level of exterior wear that more than warrants a similar refinish, and, to my knowledge, none featured adjustable sights.

It's been well used, prior to the refinish, probably in the six figure round count, but it functions well and shoots straight. The clockwork and lockup has loosened up a bit, to the degree that it doesn't always completely lock up on slow single action on two of the six chambers, at least until the trigger is pulled, in which case it always locks up before the hammer actually falls. A gunsmith could most likely correct this easily. Had some endshake, but this was corrected with a Power Custom shim popularly used to correct endshake on S&Ws. The forcing cone also shows some erosion. But the smoothness of the trigger action remains easily and noticeably superior to my 57 vintage S&W pre-29 or 57 vintage Colt Python, and it still groups tighter than either of those guns."

Very clean pistol with very very minor blemishing. 

The biggest difference from in the generation 2 glocks from gen 3, and 4, is the straight frame, and no accessory rail. The modern generations have the finger grooves and rail. Many people like the gen 2 better because of that reason, i however do not, i prefer the light rail and finger grooves. This pistol will function exactly like any of the modern Glocks. 
Soon the generation 2 glock 19 will become a collectors item. many people consider this glock, aside from special addition glocks, and the generation 1 glocks, as the most sought after. many people are in search of them and i happened to stumble on one. 

The gun comes with 1 mag, no box, Night sites installed.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.
The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

This should ONLY be fired with .45 ACP loaded to .455 Eley specs.  The gun has not been chromed or nickle plated.  It is raw buffed steel.  I did none of the work on this gun.

This listing is for (1) LaRue A.P.E.G. AR-15 GRIP ROUGH.

Inspired by the human hand, the unique “flats” on the front and back fall more naturally onto the geometry of the hand’s structure. The flat front also provides indexing to help level and square the firearm to the target. A sculptured palm swell on either side fits nicely into the hollows of the palm. A gentle taper helps seat the hand towards the firearm, and helps to keep the hand from sliding. The generous texture added to the sides gives just the right amount of traction in slippery conditions.

Having an A2 footprint, the A-PEG™ will attach to almost any firearm that has an AR15-type grip interface. Comes complete with mounting hardware. 

Available colors: Black, Flat Dark Earth, Olive Drab, Foliage Green, and Urban Grey.

Shoots anything from light 2 3/4 1 oz. shells to the heavy 3.5 super mags. Bought for 2013 fall waterfowl season but barely used due to an injury that ended my season. Properly Broken in by cycling 50 rounds of 3"" 1 1/4 load shells. Has only had about 40 more shells shot through it: 2 dozen 1 oz. shells on clays and maybe a dozen 3.5"" heavy shells on Canada's. 

The shotguns is super clean. The few times it was used where on local Maryland corn fields. It has never seen mud or water. This gun is basically a Benelli Super Black Eagle without the name and would be perfect for Spring Snow Goose hunting. 

I have receipt from its new purchase this last fall, original box, owners manual, all chokes, choke wrench, recoil reducer, and XXF Turkey Choke. I was originally planning on using for spring turkey season until forced to sell. Stoeger sells a 24"" barrel (not included) and pistol grip (not included) that would transform this into a perfect turkey gun.

Looking for best offer preferably over $600 but will consider any reasonable offer since I cannot use due to shoulder injury. Will consider trading for an Ithaca M37 featherlight or Browning BPS. Will consider partial trades on H&R toppers and/or Mossberg 500.

If you have heard that stainless was released in 1983, its not completely correct. The catalog advertising stainless came out in 83 but a few were shipped late 1982. This is one of them. Also the original stainless came with the gen 3 type wood grips which this one has. (I have not swapped the grips for cheaper rubber ones just to make an extra dime! Gunbroker and armslist fakes and cheats are crazy right now.) 

I do not have the original box. I DO HAVE a period correct box if your interested you can have at no extra charge. I never collected the boxes so I have a safe full of mismatched and some with no labels. I WILL NOT add a fake label and pass it as the original box just to screw someone. (Come on guys really!) 

So, if you are a colt collector and would love a prime example of an early colt stainless, this is it. I have priced it at the lower point of gunbroker (I have seen $3300 - $5000), but again mine still wears the original wood grips. No fakes, no gimmicks, just a great gun in great shape.

I would like face to face meeting but will ship FFL to FFL with buyer paying shipping.

I am happy to send more pics on request. AND I AM HAPPY to answer any questions about my ad OR ANY OTHER COLT AD ON ARMSLIST. We need to stop these con men!"

I won’t seperate either the ammo, gun or mags from the package. Thanks. $1350 for everything. Please, no trades. The next owner will be quite pleased with it and will never have to buy ammo for it again.

803,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2700803,For Sale/Trade:  GBMP1 Fixed Blade Knife by HTM Knives,"Jacksboro; Oak Ridge, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 220,"Listed On: Sunday, February 16, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This knife is as new, unused, unsharpened (still has sharp factory edge), and has not been carried. Description from HTM's website: The GBMP1 was designed by Master Sergeant Grady Burrell. This knife was tested and exceeded the standards set by “Masters Proven” for fixed blade edged weapons. Master Proven is a group of Senior Military retirees that review products for Military and Law Enforcement personal. As a boots on the ground solider, Grady's vision was to build a low profile, very well balanced knife while he was on a overseas Military Tour. He deigned this knife as a tough every day carry for all around survival purposes. ""When designing a knife the balance is a critical component of the overall design when building a purpose driven, edged weapon for fight or flight situations"" Grady said. Our GBMP1 sheath was built by First Spear who has the 6/9TM technology that they use on the knife sheaths. The 6/9™ Modular Pocket Technology is not only completely backward compatible with legacy MOLLE/PALS style load carriage or armor carrier platforms, but also offers significant weight reduction over traditional MOLLE/PALS pockets. Due to the flexible nature of the attachment straps and tighter tolerances when compared to traditional MOLLE/PALS, 6/9™ pockets actually mount closer to the body and conform tighter to the platform. Already adopted by Professional Users within the joint US Special Operations Forces community, this system provides many advantages over the traditional MOLLE/PALS system and can further help facilitate transition into the 6/12™ Modular Pocket Technology where the ultimate in weight savings, signature management and tight fit can be achieved. Specifications: First Spear sheath made in the USA. Clip Point Blade; plain edge (no serrations). DLC Black Blade finish. 154 CM Blade Steel 58-61 RC Hardness. Blade Length 4 Inches. Blade Thickness 1/8"". 3D Carved G10 With Multi Grip tm handle. Lifetime Warranty. MADE IN THE USA. Add $6.99 for insured shipping.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Here is a nice looking old Winchester 94 Saddle Ring Carbine. It has a nice patina and is a tight gun. It appears the wood had been refinished at one time. The wood finish looks good except for where they sanded around the edges it was sanded a little too much so does not match up to the steel as good as it should. I posted photos on my web sight of all the good and bad. You can visit www.bodaciousfirearms.com for all the photos and details. This would make for a nice collector, wall hanger or shooter.
