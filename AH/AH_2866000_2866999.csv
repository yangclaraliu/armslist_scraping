Get yours before they get around to banning it! The design of the sear engagement is similar to high quality match grade triggers and the third mode makes the reset of the trigger seem to be automatic so all you have to do is press as fast as you can. By using NP3 for abrasion resistance, low coefficient of friction, and hardness, the life span of these triggers is greatly increased. One trigger was tested over ten thousand rounds and then measured to see the change in the engagement surfaces. After the ten thousand rounds, the trigger had minimal to no significant change in engagement surfaces and was deemed ready for more endurance testing. The extremely high quality of these parts combined with the unbeatable advantageous of NP3 make for a revolutionary trigger. This is another example of high quality metal parts using NP3 to offer the best product available. Go To their website to learn more http://tacfirecon.com/"

I will not entertain any lowball offers so please don't waste your time or mine. . . . . . serious parties only please. This bike is priced right ...especially with $4 gasoline just around the corner.

This bike is cold-blooded and can be difficult to kick-start. But when it runs, it runs good and has approximately 4900 miles. It could use a carb adjustment to get it running a little smoother otherwise it's great.  This bike weighs almost 400 lbs so it is NOT for kids or rookies; please take this into consideration before you contact me. The bike is stored indoors La Crosse County. 

We can meet anytime if you want to view the bike but I will not allow anyone to ride it before they own it. I am only getting rid of it because I have a new baby to take care and can use the extra capital.

These value packed models offer high-security features at a price that will leave you giddy. A heavy 12-gauge steel body, a rigid 1"" thick formed door with a Force Deflector Lock System and an honest 1200F/45 minute fire rating to put your mind and wallet at ease. Browning ProSteels' Duo-Plus interios package, combined with the DPX door panel provides a wide range of storage options.

WHY CHOOSE A SPORTER SAFE?

Stepping up to the Sporter Series gives the piece of mind that the UL RSC (Residential Security Container) Rating against tool attack provides. A versatile DPX Storage System adds value and convenience.

NEW CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVING

Quickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.

My wife has suggested I sell one, and that's not bad advice.  I did disassemble, clean, lubricate, and test it, so I know the gun is right.  Excellent bore, minimal marks, dings, etc., no rust.  Nice gun, but I don't need duplicates. My experience with Llama's is one made about this time, were well made and nicely finished.  No issues or surprises."

RUGER Model 10/22 TDTMB .22LR 16.6 Inch Blued Barrel Blued Flashhider Mossy Oak Break-Up Camouflage Dipped Stock 25 Round Includes Backpack-Style Case
Model 10/22 TDTMB
Rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. Friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a 16.625 inch threaded barrel with flash suppressor. Adjustable sights. Stock is dipped in Mossy Oak Break-Up camouflage.

This is a United State Rifle, Caliber .30 Model of 1917, Eddystone Arsenal, Bolt Action, .30-06 Cal., 6 Round Capacity.  M1917 Enfield rifle
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 The M1917 Enfield, the ""American Enfield"" (frequently misidentified or mislabeled as the ""P17"", ""P1917"", or ""Pattern 1917""), formally named ""United States Rifle, cal .30, Model of 1917"" was an American modification and production of the British .303 caliber P14 rifle developed and manufactured during the period 1917-1918.

History
 When the British Empire entered World War I, it had an urgent need for rifles and contracts were placed with companies in the United States. In the case of the P14 rifle, Winchester and Remington were selected. When the U.S. entered the war, it had a similar extreme need for rifles. Rather than re-tool completely, the factories, under the close supervision of the US Army Ordnance Department, altered the design for caliber .30-06. Winchester produced the rifle at their New Haven, Connecticut plant and Remington at their main facility at Ilion, New York and at another plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania. The M1917 Bayonet was also produced and used on several other small arms.

 The new rifle was used alongside the M1903 Springfield rifle and quickly surpassed the Springfield design in numbers produced and units issued. By November 11, 1918 about 75% of the AEF were armed with M1917s. After the armistice, M1917 rifles were disposed of as surplus or placed in storage for the most part, although Chemical Mortar units continued to be issued the M1917.

 At the time of the American entry in to World War II, the American Army was still issuing the M1917 to Chemical Mortarmen. Perhaps due to rifle shortages at the start of the war, the M1917 was also issued to artillerymen early in the war, and both mortarmen and artillerymen carried the M1917 in North Africa. Otherwise, before and during World War II, stored rifles were reconditioned for use issue as reserve, training, and Lend-Lease weapons; these rifles are identified by having refinished metal (sandblasted and Parkerized) and sometimes replacement wood (often birch). Many were sent to Britain for use by the British Home Guard. These were prominently marked with red paint to avoid confusion with the earlier P14 that used different ammunition. Others were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese forces and to the Free French, both of which can occasionally be seen in photographs being used in action.

 A continuing source of debate among historians concerns what rifle was used by Sgt. Alvin York during his famous action against the Germans in WWI. While York's son has made mention that Sgt. York used a Springfield, the weapon issued to him was an M1917. (The film starring Gary Cooper as Sgt. York had him using an M1903 and a German Luger pistol.)


Design
 While developed at the same arsenal, the M1917 is not a version of the .303 caliber rifle of c. 1890-1955, the Lee-Enfield (such as the SMLE version). Both were developed at the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield (arsenal) in the United Kingdom. The M1917 was actually a development of the Mauser 98 rifle. Due to the use of rimmed cartridges in the P14, the magazine capacity for the smaller diameter 30-06 was 6 rounds, although stripper clips held only five cartridges.

 The action was used as the basis for a variety of commercial and gunsmith-made sporting rifles between the world wars and after; surplus receivers and tooling were used by Remington to produce their Model 30 series of rifles in the interwar period. Some (approximately 3000) M1917 rifles were produced in 7 mm and sold to Honduras around 1930.  Item G-32418-1

Magazine release and slide release – Swapped out for Glock extended/tactical versions ($12).  I then took a dremel to the mag release to round it off and take off the corners from digging into your hand.  I have unused extended and standard mag releases if you would want it switched.
Recoil springs – The polymer captured spring is standard.  I also have a steel guide rod and uncaptured 15lb spring ($40).  You can also purchase other weight springs to tailor the recoil to your round and preference.
GripForce Adapter – I added the black grip adapter (beavertail) ($10).  This is easily removable.  It allows you to grip higher while eliminating risk of “slide bite”
Trigger – Vanek Super kit (http://www.vanekcustom.com/7.html) ($196).  Adjusted to approx. 3lb pull with significantly reduced pre and over-travel.
Holster – Fury combat solutions kydex (Never used) (http://www.furycarrysolutions.com/Competition-Order.html) ($65) with the RTI adapter wheel (http://www.tacticalholsters.com/product/GCA25.html ) ($25) on a G-Code duty mount (http://www.tacticalholsters.com/product/Accessories/GCA30.html) ($42)

    I'm selling a Sig Sauer imported, Hammerli made Trailside .22LR target pistol. This pistol new is now called the Xesse and costs $700.00 new with no target grips (retail for $156.00)  or red dot (retail for $50.00) I also have 4 magazines for it that I am including (retail for $34.00 a piece).  The red dot is a BSA with a 5 MOA dot. This target pistol has been great, but I rarely shoot and it's such a nice pistol to just sit around since they are in such limited numbers. I'm asking $700.00 for the package but open to offers. Will also entertain offers for AR15s, higher end, plus a little cash possibly. Will need to see Indiana ID and LTCH. You can see more information about this pistol at larrysguns.com. Call, email, or text REDACTED. Thank you!"

Fired around 50 FMJ and 20 JHP through this pistol. No problems at all. I actually really like the pistol for concealment due to its tiny size, but my hands are just too big for the grip area. This is a recent model production pistol, July of 2013.
First $600 cash takes it. Remember this is coming in stainless, laser, grips and extra mag. The standard stainless model only comes with aluminum grips, no extra mag or laser!

Description from Amazon:
""Our Miami Classic is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes. This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately."""

This is a spring/clam shell Hoyt holster from Coupeville WA. This holster was made famous by the L.A.P.D & CHP back in the 60’s and 70’ for law enforcement Officers. Back then know as the fastest lock draw revolver holster in production. This holster is the swivel snap version for comfort while walking or riding, it allows the holster to stay parallel with the users leg while setting or lock the swivel to keep it parallel all the time. This is a black basket weave with nickel snaps 
The holster is a great…. Range, ATV, Motorbike, Horseback or Competition holster, it will do just about anything in the field you can think of, always giving the wearer instantaneous access to the weapon. 
The speed of this holster from the locked holster position can be amazing for revolvers with 6” barrels yet the Hoyt rides very comfortably when carrying a medium and large frame revolver.
I can’t say enough about the quality of the Hoyt Holster; this holster is in 99% looks and works great.

Description from Amazon:
""Serious gun carriers who need deep concealment and prefer an ankle holster almost universally praise Galco’s Ankle Glove. Those who need concealment 80 hours a week, year in and year out, find the Ankle Glove so comfortable to wear that they forget it’s there – until they need it. The Ankle Glove’s wide neoprene ankle band and Velcro closure offer extended wearing comfort and unmatched security. Additional comfort is provided by sheepskin padding between the holster and ankle. It also features a reinforced thumb break for speed of draw and detailed molding for firearm retention. The Ankle Glove may be worn with or without the optional adjustable calf strap (sold separately). Constructed of premium saddle leather stitched to a neoprene band, the Ankle Glove accommodates ankles up to 13"" in circumference. Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the Ankle Glove is available in right or left hand draw in black finish. Ankle Gloves for small revolvers: Models AG158/AG159 are an open top design, meaning they do not have a safety strap and thumbreak. Instead, they have a tension unit, and work with both hammered and hammerless guns. Models AG160/AG161 have a retention strap (thumb break) that runs behind the grip frame (not behind the hammer). They work with both hammered and hammerless guns, but some guns with factory supplied custom or oversized rubber grips will not fit because the retention strap is not long enough to wrap around them. Works best with slim wood or ""boot"" grips."""

They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragunov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragunov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragunov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering also offers a magazine adapter, not included here,  to use AK47 mags. $450.00 Cash only at this time.

This ad is for a used .44 Magnum. It has never been dropped. It's been mechanically maintained, functions flawlessly, and draws EVERYONE's attention at the firing range. If you like to keep a firearm at the ready in your home, know that a revolver will not suffer loss of spring tension; unlike a semi-auto handgun. Load it and leave it. It'll be ready when you need it. When it comes to knock-down power, it's hard to find a handgun with the sheer muzzle-velocity and joules on impact as the infamous .44 Magnum cartridge.

It's important that you know that this handgun has visible wear. The finish is visibly worn down on the cylinder and barrel. Keep in mind that these details are cosmetic. The revolver is and has always been rust-free, and fires every time, without fail. It's not a showpiece, but it will always impress those who you show it to. Especially the bad guys.

I am the second owner, who purchased this weapon from a 65 year old vet in Flatrock, NC. I'm selling it so I can make the payment for my concealed carry license. If you have any questions, let me know!
