This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

This true safe queen has lived its entire life (with the exception of test firing 24rds when I mounted the scope at the range) in the safe. I purchased this rifle new in the early 90's. Included as pictured, is all FACTORY ORIGINAL equipment except the Simmons 3x9x40 scope, the box, manual, scope rings, 6rd and 10rd magazines and the factory 3 shot target. The wood grain in the forend and stock are about as nice as they come. I will provide more pictures if needed. $1100 cash
I prefer a FTF transaction, and I do require a copy of NC CCP as well as a DL. Before I am asked why, I need to know that the purchaser is legal to own. If the purchaser would rather have this rifle transfered through a FFL holder, that will be at the purchasers expense. I know of a few local gunshops that will transfer for $25.00.

Very slim frame for easy carrying but still big enough for any hands to grab onto. Drop free magazines and ambi mag release.

274,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2675274,For Sale:  Marvel 1911 .22 conversion for trade/obo,"Parma, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 525,"Listed On: Sunday, February 9, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new never fired with test groupings 5 shots 0.66"" at 50 yards with all paperwork. Comes with rail top for scope and adjustable sight rib top and 2 metal colt .22 mags. Price is more then fair. This kit the way it sits is over $700. Same as the one in the picture with out the compensator. Does have the barrel to attach one (just buy one off there site) I will not ship and cash only. Unless you got something i actually want. All paper work as when it was purchased. Also has the case with it.

Convert your 1911 frame (and now your SVI/STI frame or Para Ordinance) to a super-accurate .22 LR matchgun!

Convert any 1911 Semi-Auto pistol into one of the most accurate .22 pistols available. Tests from a machine rest have delivered groups around 1.8"" at 50 yards ... for 100 shots with inexpensive ammo (see the sample test targets)! Compare that to extremely expensive European target pistols that boast 1-1/2"" groups (measured center-to-center, which gives you a smaller measurement than edge-to-edge) at 50 yards for 10 shots. The secret to Marvel Conversion Unit's astonishing accuracy is the same as for any breakthrough product: an innovative and unique design executed by experts with top-quality production techniques and components. 

Take the design, for instance, of the barrel locking system. The barrel underlug cutout is machined to precision specifications so when the recoil rod is tightened on to the slide stop, the barrel is drawn down tightly. The barrel is solidly locked to the frame (only the slide moves). Everyone knows minimal tolerances are a necessity for competitive target pistol. Here, there are no tolerances because the barrel does not move or pivot, and the barrel does not depend on support at the muzzle from a moving slide. Notice also that the barrel is directly connected to the sight rib or scope mount, again with no tolerances or play. With a solid barrel-to-frame lockup, accuracy from a machine rest, with the frame locked down, is guaranteed (this is mechanical accuracy). Also, with the sights solidly connected to the barrel, accuracy of the shot via the sights is also guaranteed (this is handheld accuracy).

As we mentioned, precision components are also part of the formula. No more needs to be said about the quality of the barrels. We also utilize aircraft-grade billet aluminum and high-carbon steel.

All machining - barrel, slide and smaller parts - is done by CNC for incredible precision. The slide is made from 7075 aluminum and contains a hardened-steel breech insert (thus a steel-to-steel breech-to-barrel contact and no aluminum battering problems). Aluminum parts are anodized and steel parts are blued, both for corrosion resistance and a rich appearance. Total weight is just over 16 ounces.

The Marvel .22 Conversion Unit converts any caliber 1911 Semi-Auto with no fitting required. Installation time is under a minute, even if you're taking your time. It fits Government, Commander and Officer Model 1911 Frames. Magazine fits all those models also, but will extend below the bottom of the grip on the Officer Model."

Not included, but available for a price I also have two nice IWB holsters and 100 rounds of .40 target ammo.

Must be Florida resident, 21+, legal to own, and we will both sign a bill of sale.

Muzzle report is also substantially reduced making for some of the quietest standard power .22 ammo out there. This ammo is much more powerful than BB and CB cap ammunition or the primer propelled stuff like Aguila Colibri. 

I find it especially good for dispatching yard pests and the reduced noise really helps with staying in good graces with the neighbors. It would also be exactly what you need if you happen to shoot suppressed firearms.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The CZ50 succeeded the CZ24, 27 & 38, and was a staple with Czech police units for many years. It was later improved and served on for years more as the CZ70. 

The CZ50 is a well built all steel pistol that is quite similar to the Walther PPK. As with all CZ built firearms quality is high and function/reliability is excellent.

This particular pistol is in very good condition. It retains about 85% of it's original finish. However there are some rubs/thin spots in the bluing resulting from years of being carried in a holster. Absolutely no rust or pitting though and the bore is bright and shiny.

Grips are very good with no cracks or dings, and function is 100%. 

Pistol comes in it's original importer box with two genuine original CZ thumb rest magazines.  

Additionally a CZ cleaning rod and an original CZ holster made specifically for the CZ50 or the CZ70 is included. This holster has become quite hard to find. 

Finally there are two 50 round boxes of Fiocchi .32ACP ammo included. Ammo is recent production brass case with 73 grain FMJ bullets. 

Asking price is $375. Local FTF sale only to a Florida resident of proper age who can legally own a firearm in Florida. 

Thanks for looking."

674,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2675674,For Sale:  AG42b Ljungman Semi-Auto Rifle with Accessories & Ammo,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,400","Listed On: Monday, February 10, 2014",Rifles,no type,6.5x55 Swedish                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is the best example of the AG42b you will ever likely come across. I bought it from a collector friend nearly 30 years ago and it was one of his most cherished pieces. I waited many years for him to finally decide to let it go. 

The Swedes built the AG42 beginning in 1942 and it was the first truly successful high power rifle using a direct gas impingement system to operate. It fires the powerful and ballistically super-efficient 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser cartridge. As good as it was - there was a problem with the gas tube rusting severely. So from 1953 through 1956 the Swedes sent all existing stockpiles back to the state arsenals where they were modified to the AG42b. 

The conversion included a new stainless steel gas tube, rubber spent cartridge deflector, an improved rear sight adjust knob, a brand new magazine & cleaning rod plus some other things. The renewed rifles then remained in service until the 1960's at which time some were exported to the USA. There were only about 30,000 AG's ever made making them quite scarce in the world of military production rifles. 

This particular rifle was built originally by Carl Gustaf in 1945. It's in truly exceptional condition and couldn't have seen much service after it left the arsenal with the ""B"" conversion in the early 1950's. Metal and wood are in 98% condition or better. Bore is excellent and scores a 1 (the best) on the embedded brass stock disc. It shows almost no wear, and I don't believe it's possible to find a better example. 

Rifle functions perfectly and is a joy to shoot with very little felt recoil thanks to an ingenious muzzle porting system that is quite similar to MagnaPorting except that this system was designed decades before anyone ever heard of MagnaPorting. 

Rifle comes with: 

An original bayonet and scabbard that is in near perfect condition with traces of cosmoline still on the blade. 

An original cleaning/tool/spare parts kit with all pieces still in the factory wrap. 

A special blank firing attachment unique to the rifle that creates enough back pressure to cycle the action and that shreds the wood tip blanks this rifle fires. Caution is a must when firing wood tip blanks because they would be harmful or perhaps even fatal at close range if fired without using the adapter. 

A set of original radium/tritium night sights in leather carry case. The radium/tritium has long since expired but the sight could be renewed with a few dabs of the great luminescent paints available today for firearms use. 

(5) 20 round boxes of original Swedish made 6.5 x 55 ball ammo. This is brass case, berdan primed ammo that is said to be non-corrosive. 

(5) 20 round boxes brass case wood tip blanks also said to be non-corrosive. 

Correct leather sling in beautiful condition. 

Asking price for everything is $1400. Local FTF sales only to a resident of legal age who can legally own a firearm in Florida. I do not want to get involved with shipping as it's simply too much trouble to do so today. 

I'm only allowed 3 pictures and that doesn't even begin to do this fine rifle justice. So I'll be happy to send more or to arrange an inspection for a serious buyer. 

Thanks for looking."

I purchased this Colt LE6920 in June once the prices began to come back down. It has cycled a total of 40 rounds, and is in excellent condition. There are a couple very minor scratches, but it looks pretty much brand new. Comes with:
- stock handguard
- magpul MBUS rear flip up sight
- Colt lock and keys

- 1 Colt 10 round magazine
- AR15 Wonder Wrench (Reverts bullet button to standard mag release configurations)
Again - this rifle is in near new condition - and fire flawlessly. The ONLY reason I am selling it is because I am transferring to UC Irvine from Mesa community college and I need money for school and moving out. I have taken ideal, pristine care of this rifle, as it has only been used once at the range. Save money, buy a rifle that is of the same quality as a new one - and purchase a colt, the closest to military specs a civilian can get with a base model AR15. You'll have a new rifle, with sought after ammo and accessories, less than the 'out the door' price you would pay for a rifle alone.
Current price new for this rifle with the accessories, costs over $1750. Gun, and accessories are all California legal.

I am asking $1190 firm. I believe this is a very fair price, and it is unfortunate that I have to let it go. I am very reluctant to sell this rifle - but I need money for school.

I inherited this gun. I like the looks of it, it's light, and it feels nice in my hands, but I've already got better 22s.

Full disclosure: This gun has 1 plastic factory magazine, and it DOES NOT work well at all. I took the gun out once after receiving it, and I basically had to use the gun as a single shot, because the magazine functioned so poorly.

That said, the gun itself always functioned fine (it's got a heavy trigger, but it works). All the problems stemmed from the magazine. MidwayUSA now sells 10-round metal magazines for this gun. They are expensive ($40), but I hear they are much better than the original plastic magazines.

I'm not out to fool anyone. This gun has some drawbacks. But with a new magazine, it will probably be a serviceable rifle. Or it could function as a single shot as is. It may also be useful as a parts gun to someone.

The scope isn't anything special, but it would work fine for plinking or small game hunting.

I live in the Black Hills area and get to Rapid City fairly often. I'd prefer face to face sales and would rather not ship the gun as this time."
