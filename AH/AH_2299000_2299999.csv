Has a Butler Creek .920"" barrel and stock set installed. Leupold base and rings and Leupold Vari-X IIc 3-9 scope. Built on an older 10/22 with the aluminum triggerguard. Has an aftermarket extended mag release lever. Don't know if the internals are factory or aftermarket, but the trigger pull is somewhere between 1 and 2 pounds with just a touch of creep. Whoever customized it removed the bolt hold-open lever for some reason. Not a big deal to me, as I rarely use one in a 10/22 since they don't engage automatically. Very accurate gun - shot 1"" groups at 50 yards with regular ammo off the bench. Does show some scattered freckling and some scattered wear/marks. Was this way when I got it. The worst is toward the muzzle. The pics make it look worse than it does in hand in regular light. Note that the freckling at the muzzle is around the rim of the crown and won't affect accuracy. I was going to have the barrel threaded for a suppressor, in which case that would all go away.

This AutoMag is a one owner pistol. I purchased it new and I've fired it exactly 144 times. I know this because I bought three 50 round boxes of ammo with the pistol and I still have the last original box with 6 rounds remaining.   

I would put it's overall condition at 98%+, and I believe that the only way to improve on it would be to find one that's never been fired which I think would be quite a challenge.  

It comes in it's original box that's also in excellent shape along with all the literature that came from the factory.  

There are also 3 AMT factory stainless steel magazines included.  

The AutoMag III in the .30 Carbine chambering is one of the most sought after of all
AutoMags. They are very collectible and a ton of fun to shoot!

I bought it brand new when it first hit the stores, and it's a damn good shotgun, I have no regrets for buying it over a Remington 870 (which I was going to buy instead). I was worried about reliability at first since it's walmart exclusive shotgun and I didn't see much on it on the internet, but it surprised me. About 20 target loads later and it was shooting reliably (a short break in period is expected of semi-auto shotguns). It shoots the target loads just normal, I have yet to even use any other loads in it. It features a 20"" barrel and a muzzle break. It's possible to extend the capacity to 8+1 with a Remington 870 extension kit, but you need to shorten the threading by a hair. I'm selling this because I need to make rent, and I just really don't need a shotgun right now. I'm a gun nut, but being young I'm not as responsible as I'd like to be, so it's good I'm selling this. The price is firm at $320, but you basically save $35 in sales tax, plus I'm including a nice $20 hard plastic padded Plano carrying case, as well as 5 shots of 00 buckshot, and roughly 30 shells of a target load."

The concept and practicality of this weapon (this pistol shoots 45 ACP, 45 Colt, and 410 shotgun rounds)is great! Please if you have a biased opinion based on the Taurus Judge let me go ahead and say I've owned both and it blows the Judge out of the water and is an entirely different class and the 45 ACP capability with this Smith makes all the difference in the world. It's a great piece of mind to know that at any given time I can walk into any place that sells ammo and I have yet to find a place that did not at least have one of the three possible!!! I prefer to trade rather than sell but I would sell at asking price.

If you arent familiar with these they are very cool Baby Eagle/Jericho compact clones.  Has all of the typical CZ-75 features, inside the frame slide, SA/DA, cocked and locked carry, and uses CZ-75 magazines.  This one is almost new, only 100 rounds through it.  Comes with its case and everything it came with as well as two mec gar 15 round magazines.

Nothing wrong with it, just wanting to trade for something more compact in 9mm or .40.  Not interested in .380 or .45.  Pretty open to ideas, but would like it to be something in the subcompact or pocket size.  Would really like a Beretta Nano or Kahr CM9/CW9, but again, open to what you have.  Interested in a nice .38 special snub nosed revolver like a Ruger LCR or S&W 38 Bodyguard as well.  Handguns ONLY though, I dont use rifles and already have a shotgun.  Trade only, dont need to get rid of it and not interested in selling it.

Also, if you have something in .40 or .38 I have a fair amount of 9mm I could trade for whatever ammo you may have.

I live in Wichita but I work in Mcpherson so I can also meet there if you're in that area. FTF only, and I have my ccl.

Sig Mosquito: 
This is a Sig Mosquito factory threaded barrel. It has everything from the factory, extra sights, recoil spring, mainspring lock key, YHM 1/2x28"" Suppressor Adapter, barrel thread cap, , (for when suppressor adapter isn't wanted) and 2x 10 round magazines (factory comes with 1).

Rolling Block 22:
A bit about the model: "".22 cal rimfire, rolling block, thumb operated"". A bit about the company: Hopkins and Allen started building falling block rifles around 1887-1914, most commonly seen as the ""Junior"" model. In late 1890s - early 1900s the number 722 was added to their line up. This is stamped "".22 Long Rifle"" on the barrel and ""Royal Junior"" on the receiver. This has a blued barrel and case hardened receiver. This shoots good and sights are pretty true."

The 5.56 PDW Tactical Evo 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate upper.

774,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2299774,"For Sale:  BUFFALO BARNES LEAD FREE 125GR. TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH (ITEM 23D)","azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 5, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel

You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

Power, pure and simple.

Barrett Model 99

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.

Model 99 in action

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.


Mounted NightForce 8-32×56mm NXS Scope:

Since 1992, Nightforce has been a winner in countless benchrest competitions. We have taken that knowledge and success and combined it with the durability and features of our NXS line to create the ultimate long-range field and target riflescopes. Evolved from our tactical line, the 8-32 x 56 offers fast adjustments for precise, repeatable shot placement. The broad magnification range means there is now virtually no target outside the capable shooter’s reach, while it remains highly versatile and appropriate to a wide variety of applications.

NP-R1 Reticle:
1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x, 8-32x and 12-42x NXS models show 20 MOA scale below centerline (at left). In the 3.5-15x, an additional 10 MOA scale below center is indicated on the reticle. 


Pictures are of the exact firearm you will receive.


Rifles are available for in-store pick up or can be shipped to an FFL dealer of your choice for $75.00. PA residents pay sales tax.
