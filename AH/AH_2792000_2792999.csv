The exit ports are not threaded completely through to eliminate the possibility of the screw being over turned into the chamber.

The Mark II designation means that the comps are NOT stack-able! However, the Mark II is lighter and more stream-lined then the Mark I's. 

 Effin-A Compensator MKII is designed to allow users the ability to adjust the manner in which the gas exits from the weapon. The Effin-A Compensator MKII features 8 columns and 3 rows of exit ports that can be either opened or closed through the very simple use of set screws.

 The exit ports are not threaded completely through to eliminate the possibility of the screw being over turned into the chamber. This feature also allows the screw to ""bottom out"" increasing tightness and ensuring that it will not work itself out under the pressure of the gasses being released by the weapon.

 The Effin-A Compensator MKII weighs in at only 2.5 ozs; which is half the weight of the previous (Mark I) version. Allen Key is included."

For sale is my Beretta 92fs with one magazine. The pistol is in good condition, with a fair amount of holster wear (this was a duty gun). The firearm functions perfectly, and the internals are still very nice. Other than some finish wear, this is a great pistol! Would be a great project to get duracoated or cerakoted.

Hi everybody,
I have noticed over the past couple of years on this forum that a lot of you are trying to get healthy, get fit and acquire energy and stamina. I have debated about doing this thread because i don't want it to come across as a sales pitch. It is not intended to be. It is to give information and possible help my fellow shooting enthusiast obtain more out of life. 

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 8 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back and I will tell you how you can become part of it.

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it.

I have noticed over the past couple of years on this forum that a lot of you are trying to get healthy, get fit and acquire energy and stamina. I have debated about doing this thread because i don't want it to come across as a sales pitch. It is not intended to be. It is to give information and possible help my fellow shooting enthusiast obtain more out of life. 

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 8 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it.

It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it.

I have noticed over the past couple of years on this forum that a lot of you are trying to get healthy, get fit and acquire energy and stamina. I have debated about doing this thread because i don't want it to come across as a sales pitch. It is not intended to be. It is to give information and possible help my fellow shooting enthusiast obtain more out of life. 

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 8 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

To those of you that are selling .22lr ammo waiting for a sucker to buy it, why don't you stop trying to screw the shooting community. I don't care what you bought the .22lr ammo for, but stop selling it for $80 a god damn box. And quit buying up all the ammo so my kids and wife can stop shooting all my 45acp. Remember the good days when you only bought 22 lr on the way out  shooting? Wasn't that a nice convenience for all?

I have noticed over the past couple of years on this forum that a lot of you are trying to get healthy, get fit and acquire energy and stamina. I have debated about doing this thread because i don't want it to come across as a sales pitch. It is not intended to be. It is to give information and possible help my fellow shooting enthusiast obtain more out of life. 

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 8 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back and I will tell you how you can become part of it.

519,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2792519,For Sale:  Zeal For Life - The Prepper's and Athletes Whole Food Dream Formula,"Central, Anchorage, Alaska",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, March 9, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi everybody,
I have noticed over the past couple of years on this forum that a lot of you are trying to get healthy, get fit and acquire energy and stamina. I have debated about doing this thread because i don't want it to come across as a sales pitch. It is not intended to be. It is to give information and possible help my fellow shooting enthusiast obtain more out of life. 

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 8 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 8 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Even my cousin, who is a nutritionist and works for a manufacturer of health products in Idaho was really impressed with it when she tested it. She said that she would take it if she didn't think it would cost her her job. lol.

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 8 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. I also just got into the Zeal business and in a very short time made enough extra money to purchase a Arsenal Ak47, G21C and getting ready to buy a G34 Gen4 and Benelli shotgun. So it's also a great opportunity for some extra money if you need it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back and I will tell you how you can become part of it.

First owner told me he put 100 rds through it, I put 250 through it. Gun is accurate and controllable with mild recoil, and the stippling on the Gen4 grip really helps to keep it on target for successive shots. I found it a tad bit bulky for concealed carry, so I'm gonna be looking for a single stack next (when the time comes). This Glock comes with white dot front and white bracket rear standard Glock sights (not tritium), cleaning brush and rod, box, speedloader, and 2 magazines - one flush fit 10 round, and one with pinky extension 12 round. I've got kinda large hands, so I found the extended mag necessary for a positive grip. 9mm caliber.

Condition is excellent to very good, I'd give this gun an overall 95-96%. Obviously the gun fires with no malfunctions - it's a Glock after all. Bore is smooth and clean. Barrel block has very minimal scrathes from shooting. Grip only has one scratch on the rear end of the handle, on the very bottom (it's about 1/4 in. long). Slide is clean, and only has a couple of small scrathes from concealed wear toward the front, right near the barrel (on the left side). I can send more pictures by email or text.

Located in North Dallas, near Tollway and Bush. Will travel a reasonable distance to meet midway, up to 50 mi. Face to face only, public place (prefer a gun shop/range), $500 cash. Require BoS (I will bring 2 copies w/ my info) - will need to see DL/CHL.

You are welcome to contact me with any questions about this weapon by email, I try to reply within 12 hours at most. Thanks for stopping by!

Medical issues force sale of this bullpup. Overall length is 26 and 1/4"". Barrel length is 16"" It's the most sought after rare ""sino-soviet"" model. Milled receiver; not a cheap yugo or what-have-you.  Chrome-lined barrel with good crown. Was imported as a Cowboy's companion, but the wood stock was pitched when I installed the Bullpup kit.  

It has had a trigger job and most of the trigger creep was removed. It now has positive sear engagement with an estimated 8 lb. trigger pull. It has medium trigger/sear springs yet, so no light strike issues. It was bought in 1993 before the Clinton ban, and I can confirm it has a low round count.

The crown is good and with the 1MOA Eotech, will give ~2MOA from a bench without a bench vise using Import steel ammo. Think Kalishnikov reliability but with better accuracy. It has backup flip-up Magpul sights.

The bolt has been modified to accept magazines with the bolt forward and the bolt does lock back on the last round, so if you're into the tactical/speed thing, that's a plus. You can change mags about as fast as an AK47..

The Eotech is model 511 F revision (fixed battery issue) and the glass has no scratches. Very minor marks on the protective steel hood. It's smaller than the 512 and weighs less. It is NV capable.

There are 5 20-rd Tapco mags with bolt hold-open followers and 1 40-rd steel mag that works fine.  400 rounds of Hollow point Wolf come with it.

I will sell the Eotech separately for $350 firm, but would prefer to sell as a package deal. Asking $1200 for all of it, including the ammunition.  I have a ""tactical"" vest in Multicam that will hold 6 of the tapco mags if there's interest in that.  Pic with computer is to show scale of how compact this package is.

Thanks for looking.

It's rusting over a bit and really needs to be buffed but it shoots fine just needs to be cleaned. Have pics for serious inquires. 100 bucks or trade for a hand gun is pretty decent deal when you consider you're getting a decent 22 when it's fixed up (50 bucks max to get it like new again.) And a 12 gauge that just needs a good cleaning and will last another 100 years. REDACTED text me"

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desirable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.
