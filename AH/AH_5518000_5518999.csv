The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1 inch overall length and an 18.5 inch cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3 inch rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75 inch up to the 3 inch..This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. .The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. .The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Aside from the personal quirk I absolutely love the rifle.  It will shoot sub-1/2 MOA all day long with most factory loads and 1/4 MOA with my hand loads.  The action is smooth and quick (70 deg bolt throw) and has never failed to feed.  The gun does favor 140g projectiles but will shoot 120g & 130g with sub-1 MOA groups reliably.  The chassis, receiver and hand guard have been painted and I'll throw in the paint used in the event that any touch-ups are ever needed.Price is firm.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii. Rifles received from IWI in our latest shipment have had a different magazine than the one pictured.

This is an all numbers matching original norinco (chinese) SKS rifle. This is a more rare version of the rifle, it is shorter overall with less barrel as well. This one is all original, including the ""spike"" style bayonet. It also has a green military sling, and a green leather Chinese pouch to hold extra stripper clips. This rifle shoots great, ultra reliable just like any sks and can ring steel all day. This one eats everything you feed it and takes the stripper clips very well. These are getting harder and harder to find especially the paratrooper model. In good shape for the age, but does have a few handling marks. Any questions just ask, more pics on request too. The rifle, sling, pouch, and an original Korean War helmet can be had for $650 OBO.

It has never been used for clays, only hunting.I have never fired it and have kept it in a safe since.

Mechanically this is a very simple rifle, field stripping with just a button push for easy maintenance. Internally it reminds me of an SKS, very straightforward and easy to understand.This rifle is chambered in the original 7.5 French round, so it is without the functional issues that the rifles converted to .308 by Century are infamous for. It is in very good shape with some wear here and there from use, but functions fine, including the gas regulator for the grenade launcher. Ammo can be a bit tough come by unless you order online or have a Cabela's nearby, so I'm including 100 rounds of PPU 7.5 French to get you started. A shooter who reloads their own ammo would do well with this rifle. Also included is the original 10 round magazine.Updated: Found two more boxes of ammo in my pile, 100 rounds total with rifle."

This one is a traditions Vortex ULTRALITE model with hammer. This gun is finished with a cool camo pattern and a grey cerakote finish. (Super Tough) it is very accurate and lightweight.I bought this rifle new from cabelas 2 or 3 years back. Setup with the scope it cost nearly $900. It has only been shot 10 times since I've owned it. Still very clean with just a couple small handling marks. It is a very nice rifle just got bored with the BP. this rifle can stack them tho and would be a great gun for the alternative  season. Why pay top dollar for a muzzleloader this one shoots and looks good for a bargain. If you have any questions or want more pis just ask. I am selling the rifle with or without  the scope. It is a leupold ultimate slam 3x9x40 with a special reticle built for muzzleloaders. It is a great scope especially paired with this rifle. See my other listings for pics. 400 with the scope, 275  without. This is a very fair price so please don't waste my time. First come first served and I'm leaving for Florida in a few days and would like this gone before then. Call/text at 314 nine 74 805 one. Thanks, Nick.   Check my other listings!"

It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, forearm and bolt. It has an excellent 25 inch 5 grooved bore with bright and sharp lands. The headspace is good on a 0.067"" armourers gauge with a No '3' bolt head. The firing pin protrusion is 0.045 inch. The action is very good, tight and clean. The metal shows 99% of the blue finish with a little wear on the edges. It has a good BLO finish to the walnut stock with no cracks or major dings. The butt stock is stamped with the serial number of the scope it was set up with (1890 over another which is illegible). The scope mounts are original with no indications of the screws being re-locked (piened). The scope was produced by REL (Research Enterprises Ltd) with excellent optics and adjustments, complete with original leather lens cover with the broad arrow marking (maybe British as most Canadian equipment was marked C broad arrow). This appears to have been refurbished. Some witness marks of usage on the tube from the leather scope cups are present. The REL scopes were thought by some to be superior quality to the British scopes. The Brits may be excused as they were being bombed during production by the Germans. The wood forearm and hand guards are dark walnut wood. The rear hand guard has a arsenal repair applied at the rear. The butt stock is lighter in color and is stamped and painted with numerous numbers. The cheek piece appears to be of oak wood. This rifle has seen service in the Far East WWII theatre (India) from little patches of green paint on the metal which they used as a secondary protective. It has a serialized standard ten round magazine. This excellent condition is commensurate with one of the WW II Enfields' which has seventy years service.

It's butter smooth and you won't even realize when you chamber a round. I bought this rifle new, one owner low round count. The 300 wsm hits hard and ive never had anything walk off on me. I don't have the original box for it or the scope sorry. I'm leaving for Florida in the next few days and would like to get this gone before. That being said I'm willing to do a fair price/trade. You can look online but new this rifle is $1600 and the scope another $6-700. So new this was around $2300. I'm wanting  $1250 and I think that's a gone quick price. First come first served.

Comes with everything from the factory and more! 3 standard magazines, and 2 extended magazines. The case, lock and manual. OWB holster and a custom fitted IWB holster, ""clipdraw"" belt clip, pinky extension and TRITIUM NIGHT SIGHTS. This gun is the smallest full service weapon capable handgun ever made, by a long shot. Ambidextrous magazine release, metal indestructible magazines, 4inch barrel, crisp quick reset trigger for rapid, accurate follow up shots, rails to mount endless accessories, and not to forget the legendary .45ACP round, this is the badest shit you will ever have that fits in your pocket. This gun is slightly thicker than a deck of cards, so it's never a hassle to put on. I wear tight fitted clothing and it is still virtually invisible in a tank top and shorts. I wear it to the gym! You will never be unarmed again. It kills me to get rid of it, but the Mrs. doesn't love the full power of the .45 ACP.

Comfortable to Conceal and Carry.Pico - The Most Concealable .380 for Personal Defense and Home Protection
At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semiauto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense
Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.Soft-recoiling and Absolutely Reliable
The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta."
