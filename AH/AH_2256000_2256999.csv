For those wanting a deep penetrating all copper expanding 38SPL load, this is it. Depending on impact velocity, (barrel lengths and target distance vary) you can expect between 11 to 13 inches of penetration in flesh and bone. Buffalo Bore was able to engineer a flash suppressed powder for this load and therefore the shooter will not be blinded by his own gun fire in low light. This creates a huge tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.
This load is safe to fire in all 38SPL and all 357 firearms that are in normal operating condition. This cartridge is designed so the bullet will not jump crimp when subjected to recoil from firing in super light 12 OZ revolvers, provided you do not subject any cartridge to the recoil of more than ten to twelve firings."

I am the second owner, to my knowledge. Bought this about 1.5 years ago with the intents of becoming a bow hunter... not really thinking about the fact that I have no where near by to practice with the bow. I don't fell confident in my ability to get a clean, humane kill.. so I've never hunted with it and haven't even had the opportunity to shot it in a year. It's got a couple of dings on it from the previous owner, but all in all is a very nice bow that comes very well equipped with everything you need to start bow hunting or upgrade your current set up.

In addition to the Z9, the package includes: QAD Ultrarest, HHA Adjustable sights, Yellow accents and sling, Axion stabilizer, about 15 easton aluminum arrows (most never shot), target arrow heads, 3 new in box muzzy broadheads, 4 new in box Bludgeon small game arrow heads, and a Plano hard case.

400 Rounds of .223 Ammo Winchester 77 gr BT-HP 
22 Caliber (.224) 77 gr. HPBT Match 
Designed for Service Rifle competition in the M16A2/AR-15A2, our 22 caliber bullets have set an incredible number of new national records.  The 77 grain #9377 MatchKing allows seating to an OAL that permits cartridges to be loaded into M16/AR15 magazines.

Although they are recognized around the world for record-setting accuracy, MatchKing bullets are not recommended for hunting. Widely favored for their extreme accuracy, these bullets have been used for short-range varminting. Having heavier jackets, they will not provide the explosive expansion of the lightly jacketed Hornet or Blitz bullets at equivalent velocities in small varmints. If used for varmint shooting, ranges should be kept short to ensure precise shot placement. 
Please Note!! This bullet requires a 1x7"" to 1x8"" twist barrel for accuracy.

  Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. • The four-position chrome-plated gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor*. • Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid, reliable aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed. • Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock* is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube. • Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. • Fluted barrel (for reduced weight and improved barrel cooling) features an SR-556®/Mini-14®-style flash suppressor* mounted with a 5/8""-24 thread. • Round, smooth-sided Ruger® Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail at 12:00 position that extends the full length of the handguard. Drilled and tapped for additional rails at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions (two additional rail sections included), providing ample space for mounting sights, lights, lasers or other accessories. • Hogue® Monogrip® pistol grip* adds comfort when carrying or shooting. • Chrome-plated bolt and chrome-plated one-piece bolt carrier with oversized and radiused rear bearing surface. • Also Includes: three 20-round MAGPUL® PMAG® magazines*; soft-sided case; three finger-grooved rail covers.

FN SPR™ A3G
Commercial	Law Enforcement
Made In The USA
The FN SPR™ A3G has been selected by the FBI as one of their tactical precision rifles. The A3G offers Controlled Round Feed, blade ejection, the original Model 70-type two lever trigger and a three-position safety. Chambered in 308 Win., the A3G features a cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC fluted barrel with hard-chromed bore and is held to +/- .001"" headspace to produce and maintain a sub-half minute-of-angle (sub-½ MOA ) accuracy standard at 100 yards, making it ideal for long-range target shooting and competition. The forged steel action is hand-bedded with Marine-Tex® epoxy into a fully-adjustable McMillan™ A3 fiberglass tactical stock that is equipped with multiple steel sling studs."

EAA introduces the Witness Elite “Match”. Destined to become a classic, the “Match” is produced in the Tanfoglio custom shop. Your “Match” incorporates many features of Tanfoglio’s competition guns into a streamlined, no nonsense, practical pistol. The “Match” serves equally well as a sport shooting pistol or defensive carry sidearm. It is an excellent alternative to those who prefer a single action pistol, but do not choose the 1911. The “Match” is loaded with the same high quality features you’ll find on other Elite series pistols. Custom features include a 4 3/4 ” match grade barrel, single action trigger with over travel stop, adjustable rear sights, interchangeable front sight posts, extended safety, extended magazine release, extended beavertail, heart shaped hammer, and custom two tone finish.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Elite 16″ Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12″ rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be.

The rifle is the full length barrel with Walnut stock. Condition of entire gun is very good, U.S.M.C logo and inscription have been laser engraved in the rear of the stock. Cleaning kit is brand new and never been installed in the gun. The scope mount is a Gen 4 Springfield Aluminum mount that is also brand new never installed. This gun has had the bolt locking lugs professionally lapped to the receiver to ensure full bearing on both lugs. This is a process of lapping the lugs while spring pressure dives the bolt back, and ensuring proper head space is maintained. The lapping ensures safety and precision as the bolt locking lugs fully share the bolt thrust during the firing cycle. The amount of head space is about 1.63 which puts this at a chamber dimension consistent with that used by the military. It is not excessively tight, but will chamber either NATO 7.62X51 or .308 Win. without overpressure or carbon build up causing clearance issues. This is a very shootable gun. I have sighted it in per the military field manual for M80 147 gr. ball ammo. Elevation adjustments are dead on, I have shot it out as far as 500 yards open sight with precision you would expect from this gun. Also included will be the manuals, the lock, the padded travel case, the military standard marksman sling, 2 original 10 round magazines from Springfield Armory, as well as the scope mount with Leupold rings, and the cleaning kit. Overall this is a very unique, field ready rifle. I will ship all the associated parts to your personal address, the gun will ship in the case to your FFL, all shipping will be covered by a flat fee of $50."
