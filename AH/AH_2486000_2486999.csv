I also opted for the more expensive ghost ring sights; which to me gave more value than the actual $100 upcharge.  With the standard sights, I had a little bit of difficulty (far from impossible though) getting my eye low enough and I wasn't comfortable.  The I tried the ghost ring sights and it was like every puzzle piece just fell into place.  Now the gun was adapted to me, instead of the other way around.

Despite all that however, it has been a safe-queen.  I brought it to the range once and shot a variety of slugs and buck shot with each being full and reduced recoil.  It performed flawlessly. Since it has only shot 50 shells, it isn't even broke in yet.

The only change I made was to add an extended magazine tube to up the capacity to 8 + 1.  I still have the original tube and spring as well as the box, owners manual, chokes and everything else that came with it.  

I know you don't care what I paid, but just bear with me.  I paid 1300 plus tax which brought it up to 1385 or so.  But tax isn't your problem so we will use 1300 and reduce it by 25% which = $975

I prefer to do all the math up front because I don't haggle.  I would rather offer a fair price up front and eliminate the stress of arguing back and forth.  If you find haggling fun the you will have more fun buying elsewhere.  This price is also quite a bit lower than the last couple M2s sold for on here.

More pictures will be sent via email to serious buyers.  

Before the last time I sold something, I always thought that the following was a given but apparently not. Therefore, not-so-new-rule-in-writing - No, I will not take monthly payments from you and let you leave with the gun. Yes, even if you have a competition tomorrow or are leaving for the hunt of a lifetime, you can't have it until I have $975.  Saddest part - that guy seemed serious.

Purchase will be FTF at a time/place agreed upon as most convenient for both parties.  If you are in Phx, I can meet you in Casa Grande if you would like.  

Buyer will sign a bill of sale containing only the following information:
gun info,

and a statement affirming you are not a prohibited possessor.
Then a quick glance at a state ID to confirm name on bill of sale.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up."

It seems the older I get, more things become less and less important to me in the grand scheme we call life.

Theres no better time than the holidays for me to reflect on the people that are closest to me throughout my life, and the way my life may have turned out without them in it.

Nobody truly makes it alone.  It takes an entire family ... sometimes an entire community.

It is in this spirit that I find myself rallying to the cause of a complete stranger.

My FB acquaintance ... Lily Perkins (who is pregnant) ... has been diagnosed with a bone marrow disease.  The prognosis, especially for her baby is not encouraging.

Lily, however, has made the bold decision to avoid premature decisions regarding ending the pregnancy and will attempt to carry her baby to term and deliver.  Endangering her own life for the sake of her child - a brave move for a heroic parent.

Those of you who know me well know that I dont impress easily.  This one gets me!

Therefore I have put together a CONCEALED CARRY LICENSE SERIES OFF CLASSES dedicated to help support Lily and her family in her time of need.

All proceeds go to ""Lifting up Lily""

If you ever thought about getting you carry permit ... and support a great cause ... this is as good as it gets!

PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU CAN ... THE MORE, THE BETTER.

Thanks .... and MERRY CHRISTMAS!"

It works best with Mini Mag plated RN or CCI Blazer LRN Ammo. Federal Premium stove pipes about every other round. This is a super economical way to practice with .22 ammo. Even at the crazy prices .22 is going for it is still cheaper than .223, and it will go back to less than a dime a round eventually. Also, a great way to carry a back up .22 in your bug out bag.

The CMMG Drop In .22 LR AR15 Conversion Kit is what you need to turn your AR-15 rifle into a plinking machine. This conversion kit converts a .223 Remington chambered AR-15 into .22 Long Rifle, allowing you to practice without spending a fortune at the range. The magazine holds 25 rounds of ammunition. All CMMG .22 LR magazines have a bolt hold open follower. For best performance use a round style hammer as notched hammers can cause function issues. 36 grain bullets have proven to be the best choice for function.

It LOOKS really rough.
The pistol has had the rear trunnion re-riveted (rivets are bare metal), the wood is also scored up and a bit ugly. I have the original box and hold-open magazine. 
Gun functions flawlessly, have probably put around 100 rounds through it in total. After it was re-riveted I ran 30 rounds through it as fast as I could, no issues.

The riveting was done by a professional Ukrainian gunsmith from Texas Shooter Supply in Spring, TX. They're still in business and well known for their quality. You can catch them at their booth at every major gun show in Texas. 

This is a great little gun for plinking and having fun with. Not going to win any beauty contests but you could always do a form 1 for an SBR easily.
Comes with Krink-style muzzle break, a FUNCTIONAL ONE, not a hunk of solid steel with a hole in the middle that just LOOKS like one.

Received two for Christmas, so this one can go.  I had already purchased a drop in stainless trigger and hammer, with all new inner components to set the trigger pull at a nice 3.5 lbs...  I am having this installed now at my gunsmith..... I have used these before, and they are a great improvement over stock.  .  Also has a new Pacymyer grip.  The fit on this gun is really nice, tighter than I recall most RIA's being.  The only thing I did was remove all the excess oil, and add the grip.  I am including the original grips as well.

Update.....   I have been getting some real low ball offers, don't need to sell this at all....  here is what I have in the gun, not including any transfer fees,  etc

The gun was 419 from Buds,  The hammer and sear kit was 134 from Cylinder and Slide.....   Trigger to match was 45.....  Installation and additional smoothing of the frame is 100....  finally, the grip was 60.....  almost 760 dollars......  so asking price is more than fair, I realize not everyone wants a 200 dollar trigger job on a RIA, but for those who appreciate what this is, you are getting a very nice deal....."

Act quickly - the new 500 yard Long Shot Range will be open in Homestead in January, and its going to be awesome.  I went to the open house, and was inspired to upgrade.  I am selling this to fund an Accuracy International AX 338.

This rifle started as a Remington 700 LTR (Light Tactical Rifle) Short Action in .308 that was available in their law enforcement group.  It is a 20"" barrel.  It was then mounted to an AICS 2.0 FDE folding stock.  If you are looking at this, you probably know what this stock is all about.  It is regarded as one of the best stocks that money can buy for a Remington 700 action.  It has Badger Ordnance Rings and a Badger 20 MOA base - these alone are $325.  I have a 5 round AI mag and a 10 round Alpha Industries mag for it.  Sitting on top is a Trijicon Accu-point 5-20X50 with the Green dot.  If you have not seen one of these, the glass is amazing.  The word is out on these scopes - you should easily be able to find some stellar reviews of this scope.  The package will also come with a scope coat and Harris HBR-S bipod in 6-9"".  This is the swivel model with the slotted legs.

This is an incredible long range precision package that will get you shooting plates at 500 yards in no time.  The rifle has 370 flawless rounds through it.  The scope has less than 20.  I upgraded it not long ago.  I have ~600 rounds of Match Grade .308 that I will consider selling to the buyer of this gun.  Price will be $1-1.25/round in addition to the sale price - which is cheap for match grade factory ammo.

I have well over $4000 in this gun as it sits.  I will part with it for $3250.  I am open to reasonable offers.  I may consider trades, but it needs to be on the upper end.  I am not interested in any AR's - I have plenty.  On the outside chance you have the AX 338, I am glad to pay the difference!

Thanks for looking!"

OK guys, I purchased this DOUBLE SET TRIGGER MANNLICHER from a collector's estate, and I had to REMOVE THE COSMOLINE from the barrel, action, and trigger!!! I believe to have been unfired due to all the cosmoline. I hand-buffed the stock and added a few layers of Minwax to perfect the finish. Only shot with virgin brass and a starting load of 62gr H1000 powder with 130 grain Nosler Accubonds. I properly broke in the barrel after EACH shot for the first 10 shots using coated Dewey rod, breech bore guide, WipeOut solvent and accelerator. Next cleaned after 5 shots...was shooting 1/2 inch groups at 100 on the second string of 5 and held off on final cleaning till after Elk Hunt. For the hunt, I wrapped the stock in black Coflex medical wrap to keep perfect (works great and inexpensive way to save your stock) almost any horse supply store (e.g. D&B) will carry for around $2 a roll.

This is a brand new in box LWRC M6A2 AR-15 with 16"" barrel. The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. This rifle has a 9"" lightweight quad rail handguard and low profile gas block. The butt stock is a B5 SOPMOD and the pistol grip is a MagPul MIAD. The sights are LWRC folding BUIS.

680,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2486680,For Sale/Trade:  2006 Honda Reflex,"Marietta, Atlanta, Georgia","$ 1,900","Listed On: Thursday, July 3, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking to sell my blue 2006 Honda Reflex. It's a great scooter that I'm really reluctant to sell, but my wife keeps hinting that I should get a ""real car"" so we can have a baby. I'm not sure what cars have to do with babies, but I'm listing the scooter.

Here are some specifications:
* Model: Honda Reflex
* Year: 2006
* Color: Blue
* Mileage: About 10k (currently less, but I'm still using it until it sells)
* Displacement: 250cc
* Seats: 2
* Top Speed: About 85mph
* Fuel Efficiency: 60-70mpg
* Transmission: Continuously-Variable (automatic)
* Number of owners: 2 (I'm the second owner)
* Other features: Large underseat storage

This scooter is a great choice for anyone from newbies to experienced riders. It is very easy to operate, light enough to be nimble, but has the power to keep up on the interstate. Riding my interstate commute (to and from Georgia Tech), I could keep up with traffic and still get better than 70 miles per gallon!

This scooter has been mostly used for commuting. The previous owner was a UGA student who used it for driving around Athens. I'm a recent Georgia Tech grad who used it to drive between Atlanta and Marietta. I'm not sure if the scooter prefers GT or UGA, but I haven't asked it.

The scooter has wear and tear consistent with its age. There are some scratches on one side where the previous owner laid it down, but no significant damage. It has aftermarket hand guards (black in the picture), and will come with an aftermarket trickle charger to keep the battery going if you have to store it for a long time.

The rear tire is a Michellin CityGrips with only about 500 miles, while the front is the original tire and still has tread (though only about a thousand miles left on it, I think).

One great thing about this scooter is how inexpensive it is to operate. Aside from the great fuel economy, the tires are cheap (premium tires are only about $70), insurance is cheap (about $150/yr for comprehensive with Progressive), and taxes are cheap (about $30/yr). Folks on the internet report that these Honda engines will keep going (with regular maintenance) for over 100k miles, so this scooter could certainly be with you for a long time.

I'd be perfectly fine with keeping this scooter, so I'm in no hurry to sell and my price is pretty firm.

I'll also include my full-face helmet and mesh riding jacket with removable liner, if you want."

This carbine is really hard to beat inside of 60 yards, it simply just hits whatever you aim at with absolutely no felt recoil.

The gun comes with 2 30rd magazines, lock, manual and original hard plastic case. The gun has a lifetime factory warranty. This gun was just produced and has the non-fluted barrel. This is a rare model. 

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. 

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

The 1891/30 was the main battle rifle used by the communist forces in Korea against the UN Allies and was found on many North Vietnamese during the Vietnam war."

I built this rifle in 2005 & it has appx 3000 rds on it.  Functions flawlessly and I'd trust it for use on a zombie horde or alien invaders.  It's a shooter & not a safe queen so there are some signs of wear.  Not a beater by any means and overall in better than what you'd expect for an AR with a lot of range time.

Built on a Century Arms stripped lower, JT lower parts kit, Wolff trigger/hammer springs, Mod1 upper.  1:9 twist, 5.56 chamber, M4 profile barrel, M4 feed ramps.  Midwest Industries rear flip sight & Aimpoint knockoff in picture included.  The cantilever mount is pretty nice but the optic itself is average & typical of what you'd expect for a $100 red dot.  Includes 1 USGI 30 rd magazine.

I have 8 ARs so thinning the herd a little to fund another purchase.  This rifle is very accurate and reliable.  Other than a few cosmetic dings typical of any used AR, it's in great shape with no issues.
