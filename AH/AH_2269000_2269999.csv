The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The rifle works flawlessly and shoots great, about a 1 inch group at 100 yards. it comes with a Tasco 3x9-40 scope attached that is in pretty good condition except for some dings on the top dial cover(picture will be included; it fell on a rock while hunting a while back but did not affect the accuracy whatsoever). To make sure that accuracy was not affected by the ding, we took a shot at a turkey's head at 300 yards and made a hit on the first shot. my price is negotiable, but lowballers shall not pass! Unfortunately, I do not have any ammo to go with the rifle. My number is six-zero-one-four-seven-nine-three-three-five-six. Im willing to meet FTF or have it shipped, and Ill take either cash or money order as payment since I do not have a machine to process cards.

Got a beautiful CMP Special grade M1 Garand for sale. Special grade means that it is completely refurbished. The metal has been reparkerized and the wood is brand new. This gun literally looks like it just rolled off the assembly line. This gun is LNIB, I've ran less than 200 rounds through it. The receiver and bolt are both Springfield Arsenal manufactured and the receiver looks to be manufactured in 1943. This rifle is chambered in 308; this is not your granddad's 30-06 Garand. 

The gun will include 26 en bloc clips, a cotton web sling, 200+ rounds of ammo almost all of which is hollow point match grade ammo, a hard CMP plastic case, instructional booklet and a can of 100% pure tung oil. This is the real stuff you find in specialty wood working shops, not the mixed stuff they sell you at Ace or Home Depot. 

This gun would make a fantastic addition to a firearm collector or enthusiast's collection and just in time for the holidays.

The first gun is a Stoeger Condor over under in 20ga for 3"" shells that is in good condition. The barrel has a few scratches through the blueing and there is a dime sized dent in the stock. Overall the gun is in pretty nice shape. A great inexpensive starter gun for trap, skeet or bird hunting. I believe the chokes that are installed are an improved cylinder and a modified. I would like to get $300, but am open to offers and trades.

The second is a 12ga Benelli Nova pump shotgun in Camo that is in great condition. It's barely used and comes with what I believe to be an improved cylinder replaceable choke (I don't have any others for it). I would like to get $375 for it or we can negotiate a price or possible trade. (Unless you have an offer/trade for both guns, this gun is already sold)

This is what midwayusa.com says about the sight:
The EOTech 557 Law Enforcement and Military Night Vision Holographic Red Dot Sight is ideal for use with magnifiers or night vision devices. This sight features the button operation on the side rather than the front making it much more convenient for the user, as well as a ballistic reticle designed for .223 ammunition. The base of the sight is designed to clear the delta ring and handguard on M4 style weapons which reduces the amount of rail space needed for mounting. Making this sight even more appealing is the fact that it runs on easy to find AA batteries.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide,[1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. ceased. In September 2004 the ban expired, but Franchi had already ended production of the SPAS-12. [2]"

Product description:The Hornady Hot Tub takes sonic cleaning to a whole new level. Featuring a 9 liter capacity, the Hot Tub is long enough to accommodate and clean a 16 inch AR-15 upper. In addition to having 4 transducers there is also a heating element that enhances cleaning action, which is especially useful when cleaning gun parts. Combined with One Shot Sonic Clean solution, the microjet action of the Hornady Hot Tub removes carbon residue and other debris from cartridge cases, gun part and other metal equipment. Unlike traditional tumblers, sonic cleaners can clean internal and external surfaces of cartridge cases and primer pockets. One 1.7 qt inner tank comes with the unit and can be used in the main tank for cleaning smaller batches or to use separate solutions at the same time. Additional inner tanks can be purchases separately. Hanging cords have been integrated into the design to allow large objects to take full advantage of the ultrasonic energy. Additionally, the Hot Tub features integrated drain pans in the lids, a small parts basket, a degas function and 5 temperature settings from 100-140 degrees F."

 It's a hand cannon, but one that strikes a nice balance between raw power and controllability compared to the overkill of the  .454 Casull or .500 SW

This gun is not in the standard short foregrip configuration but in the rare extended configuration. The barrel length is the legal 16"" and my local gun shop estimated the package at around $2200. I'm asking 1800 for it but will entertain reasonable offers as well as a trade for a new/like new fde scar 16s. For trades I can add money however ask that you ship to my Ffl first in order to not get scammed since you're contacting me. Please reply via armslist and I can send more pics as well as my cell for serious interest. Thanks and please help me fund my future project/father son bond builder in the scar 16s!"

I say nearly perfect because both have been taken out of the safe over the years to handle & admire. However I'd still rate both as 99%+ with respect to metal/wood finish plus the bores. 

The first is a Lithgow #1 Mark III. The stock has a beautiful reddish brown tone and metal is a deep dark black. You'll have to look with a magnifying glass to find any flaws. 

The second rifle is a #4 Mark II which makes it one of the last true Enfields to be built in the 1950's. This particular rifle can be traced to the so called Fazakerley ""Irish Contract"" order which of course was never fullfilled. 

The stock on the #4 is an unusual light blonde color with a yellow/brown tint. Metal is also a deep dark black and once again the overall package is nearly flawless. This rifle was actually still in it's original arsenal wrapping when I purchased it, but I couldn't resist looking. So I ended up taking it out. Looking back I probably should have left it factory wrapped because it would be worth several hundred dollars more, but hindsight is 20/20! 

As you can see from the pictures there are hundreds of dollars worth of accessories/ammo included with these rifles which are all absolutely original except for the canvas cases which are top quality reproductions, and the 1907 pattern bayonet for the #1 which is a Grade 1 collectors edition model from IMA. I decided on this bayonet for the #1 because I couldn't find an original that wasn't beat up and that wouldn't be a good match for this beautiful rifle. Both bayonets for the #4 are originals. 

Folks I realize that these are serious collector rifles so I'll be happy to arrange a time for any serious buyer to visit and inspect these. 

My asking price for the pair including all the ammo & accessories pictured is $2000. If you happen to have a nice GLOCK 34, SIG 522 rifle, GSG STG44-22, Beretta ARX, ISSC MK-22 rifle then I would consider making you a very fair partial trade allowance. These are the only firearms I'm really interested in right now.  

Rifles are to be picked up in the Brandon, FL area and you'll need to be a Florida resident who is at least 21 to purchase.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.

*Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

$385 WITHOUT the holster or ammo, but for the right deal I'm flexible.

It's the same size as a shield, better grip, very little recoil, holds 8 rds and is super light and easy to to manipulate the slide.  Please do your homework and be kind, I'll do the same.

Two top web images are just for ideas.  I don't have a laser or light that will fit this.
