I received this gun about 10 years ago as a gift. It’s a fun gun to shoot and the 9mm ammo is cost friendly. Just saving for a first house and I don’t shoot it at all anymore. Runs great, previous owner added a shim to help with trigger pull, surprisingly accurate for a pistol carbine. It is tapped and ready for a scope or other optics if you so choose. Stock has some wear as seen in photos. It is also ready for a sling. $600 OBO. Six-0-two-5-seven-4-five-9-zero-1."

I fired exactly 50 rounds thru it, never carried never holstered. I sold off the original sig magazines before even using them and upgraded to the Tripp Research 8rd Cobra Mags pictured, these mags alone are fairly expensive but they are extremely high quality, they are included with the pistol. The original sig sauer case will not be included, the reason for this is because the case that sig ships this pistol in is a bit too small because of the threaded barrel. So the case included is a hard case from plano that i purchased new specifically for this pistol, much better quality than the sig case and more spacious.

The reason for this sale is because I simply cannot afford to shoot 45acp anymore, this pistol is practically new.

I bought this about 2 years ago to use for steel practice.  I now decided I want to practice with a M&P 22 since I use a 9 for USPSA and 3-gun.

The gun came with the threaded adapter and a fake can that I never used.  Also came with 4 different front sights to change the height.  It has been a great little gun and I have had no issues with it.  I kept it very clean and polished a lot of the contacting parts and cleaned up the feed ramp to the barrel.  Some of the p22s had feeding issues with hollow points because of the lip and gap on the barrels.  All work was done following the P22 Bible

Gun will come with the original box, manual, fake can and adapter with wrench, all the front sights, small back strap, 1 mag, original factory key for the lock, and assembly tool.

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. 

Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a very light paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great AR trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. 

Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 I am in the Everett area and willing to travel some. Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records. I.D. and completed bills of sale and we are good to go."

A little bit of a back story, I bought this used and fired 111 rounds through it and the barrel split apart, it was a 2 piece design. Took it back to the FFL I bought it from and they replaced the barrel with a solid 1 piece and that is when I bought my M&P. The replacement barrel has about 20-30 rounds through it.

For those of you that don't know, these guns are an exact copy of a Browning HP. This one has the ring hammer and has a high gloss finish on it. It has a Hogue rugger grip and 3 13rnd mags with it as well. I also have the original barrel and grips. I had also bought a Wolf hammer spring kit that I never installed because I stopped shooting it. There is also a custom IWB holster that will be included if the buyer wants it.

I removed the mag safety so mags would drop freely from the gun and I have those parts as well if the buyer would like it installed back in the gun. 

I live in Fenton and work in Northville on second shift. 

Trades would be for 2011 parts, I change my plan about building a M&P and now have a line up on a gun smith to build a 2011 for me so I'm looking to fund parts for a build or trade for parts, as always +/- cash and OBO.

The Sharpshooter X-Ring is a unique barrel deresonator that tunes the 5 main ballistic vibration waves that affect shot grouping. 
These waves include: expansion, torsion, standing, whip, and elongation. 
Each of these individual waves negatively affects the barrel and the Sharpshooter is specifically designed to control them. 
By reducing this energy and tuning the dampening characteristics to a specific location on the barrel, 
you can consistently control muzzle movement during lock-up time which translates to greater accuracy.

I went through and pegged about 80% of the guns listed as scams. Here are some helpful pointers to identifying them;

They often come 2 or 3 at a time. 
Their pictures and descriptions are pulled straight from other gun sites like gunbroker.com. Do a google search of their description and you will see.
 Check the ""listings by this user"", there are often other guns of similar value all for sale, some of them are for sale in other states.
They are trying to sell guns that are now banned in MD
The gun is displayed really well with good lighting and photos look like it was taken with something better than an iPhone. Dealers on auction sites often have a red or white display table/cloth they take photos on to accent the guns features. Most real sellers typically put their gun on the floor and you can see their feet in the photo.
Their location is maryland, maryland or baltimore, baltimore, maryland
The gun is selling well under its value
If you email them, ask for something specific to the gun and to provide more photos. Also they will often drag on a few emails before asking you to wire money. NEVER WIRE MONEY.

Elite gas piston Ar-15. It is pristine and is truly unfired. It features a very unique gas piston system very similar to the HK 416, making it extremely reliable and very accurate since it is a true free float gas piston AR. The gas piston allows the rifle to run very clean and keep the bolt carrier cool. It has a two piece rail system where the lower part can come off very easily for cleaning and the upper part is incorporated into the gas piston system which allows the rifle to be free float.  It also features a non-reciprocating and reversible forward charging handle along with a traditional Ar-15 charging handle. The lower receiver is a full billet receiver and has a Magpul MOE stock and Blackhawk pistol grip. The barrel is an FN 1/7 twist M249 machine gun cold hammer forged barrel and the rifle also has Magpul MBUS Gen 2 flip up sights.  I paid $2350 for this rifle and I am needing to sell this rifle soon. I am looking for a cash price of $1700.00, a price pint at which I'm losing $650.

Browning has over 50 years of experience with bolt-action high-powered rifles. Today's X-Bolt rifle inherits the strongest, most note-worthy features of its predecessors. The X-Bolt White Gold model has a Monte Carlo stock. This feature is recognized as the comb steps sharply down toward the heel of the buttstock, allowing more contact between the recoil pad of the stock and the shooter's shoulder. With this design, the recoil of the fired shell comes directly back or in-line with the stronger part of the inner shoulder, making the rifle more pleasant to shoot, especially when a long day at the range is expected.

The X-Bolt White Gold is beautifully adorned with a polished stainless steel receiver that is drilled and tapped for scope mounts with engravings both the front and rear. This rifle also has a polished stainless steel barrel. Its stock is a gloss-finished, finely checkered with a rosewood forend and grip cap.

The White Gold's beauty is really on the inside, in how it shoots and what makes it so accurate. The three-lever Feather Trigger™ system is probably the most comfortable, simple trigger on any bolt-action rifle on the market. There is no take-up or creep and very little over-travel. This is the kind of trigger serious hunters and shooters demand. Next is the superb free-floating barrel with Target Crown, then triple-checked for interior finish, straightness and air-guaged for total uniformity. No doubt, this rifle has it all. Looks, handling and most important, dead-on accuracy."

I bought this as a safe queen and collectable as I was looking for one that was basically brand-new. This one is in great shape, has no carry wear and the frame is in almost-mint condition minus a small scuff on the nose. Everything is matching and original, up to and including the pre-upgrade black parts that Glock used in the early 1990's.

The reason I am selling it is because the slide lock notch has been worked on. Meaning, the notch that the slide lock lever locks into to lock the slide back has been filed to actuate an easier release if you use the slide lock lever to drop the slide. It is a small alteration, and does not impede function, however it is a modification that I didn't want as I literally wanted a 100% original, unaltered gen2 G19 for collecting purposes. See picture below.

I am looking for $600. No mag included as I don't have any prebans or 10rounders. I also have a Crimson Trace lasergrip (# LG619) that I am looking to sell separately for $175 which is in likewise excellent condition. If the buyer is interested in both I would do a package for $750 total. Many shops in MA charge $700 for just the G19 alone and often with carry wear.

Since I am a NH resident, this will need to be transferred through a MA FFL at the buyers expense. Buyer must hold a current/valid drivers license and Massachusetts Class A LTC, as well as agree to a bill of sale."

As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep Americas favorite rimfire rifle by your side. The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The stock has amazing figure and feathering running the full length of the blank.

I created this bag recently and almost everything is brand new and it is a compact bag so it is easier to not only store, but carry in any situation. During physically exerting survival situations, light weight is a very important factor. This bag is not only light, but it is small, camouflage and still has a little extra room for items you wish to put in (ammo, more food , etc)

-The bag is brand new, digi camo, MOLLE compatible for all of your personal MOLLE accessories, has drain holes on the bottom, water bottle holder, thicker upper straps for your shoulders, and it has a waist belt for back support while on long treks. Even has a pouch for water bladder.

They also work when wet! 2 silica packs to keep it dry in the Plano case, 10 Tin split shot sinkers, 15 standard black hooks and 1 can opener that can be used in multiple ways. I left a little extra space for whatever you wish.

-An ENTIRE roll of fishing line. It is 150 yards of line and has many many uses: Fishing, snares, shelter, lashing to make spears or arrows, etc.

-Lightweight aluminum LED flashlight

-Smith and Wesson knife sharpener

-Stippled folding pocket knife with a survival paracord lanyard. A diamond sharper kit was used to sharpen this blade and it is extremely sharp. This knife has many uses and hundreds of uses for the paracord. This is a great knife for defense, hunting, fishing, etc. Stippling is a type of grip that really does give you a ton of grip. It is mainly used on firearms but, fits well on this knife.

-2 gallon ziplocks bags. Use them for many many things including water collection.

- BRAND new bushnell GPS. Comes with the instructions and the registration card. This puppy is ready for you to register it.

I went through the gun front to back when I got it two years ago for my home defense gun and made sure it was in tip top shape the only reason I am selling it is because I just acquired a new Keltec KSG so I no longer need the Remington and feel it should be passed along to someone else who needs an awesome home defense gun and this is it. When they purchased these new for the department these were just over $800.00 each and the recoil reducer stock is awesome on this thing it shoots Buck Shot like its trap loads..."

This is a 4+1 capacity but it also comes with a Choate Plus 2 extension tube/spring kit to give you a 6+1 capacity. Takes both 2 3/4"" and 3"" 12 gauge shells. Also included with this listing is a 25 round shotshell holder belt and a padded tactical soft case with MOLLE loops, 4 accessory pockets, carry handles or adjustable shoulder strap sling. This shotgun has seen roughly 500 rounds down the tube. It does NOT like light loads, it only runs on stuff that is over 1300 FPS. It will fire the light birdshot loads from Wal-Mart but they do not have enough power to cycle em all the way out far enough to pick up the next round. This is an excellent and fun shotgun to play with and the only reason I am selling it is because I need money and I want to go a different route with my next 12 gauge.

This pistol is awesome and I hate to get rid of it, but it is my carry gun and I wanted something with a faster draw instead of having to worry about disengaging a manual (thumb) safety. Both the gun and laser grips are in like new condition.

I've carried many of Glocks and XDS's, and the reason I went with a 1911 is because the thumb safety enhanced my comfort level. However, in the best interest of quickly drawing my weapon and shooting (heaven forbid), I want to go with something that is more like what I had before (so long single stack magazines)!

This gun has less than 100 rounds through it and the laser works perfectly. Also included are Wilson Combat extended slide release, thumb safety, and mainspring housing with detachable mag well as well as all stock components and 2 mags. Bottom line: It's a Colt 1911 and functions like one. Need I say more? 

I paid over $1200 for the whole setup so I will entertain offers for a Glock 30S and whatever else you may have to offer. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions.

I can get some pics up this weekend, but here are some stock pics:

Double sided locking padded gun case. Super nice with 3 digit code required to open each side. I've carried 6 small guns in this baby and it is super slick looking and very nice to have.

Make me an offer for everything. Please don't low ball me as I know how much I have in all of this seperately. And please do research on going rate for some of the premium law enforcement ammo as it is by no means cheap. Thanks and have a great day

My first choice would be an LAR15 Operator III. If you have one for sale, and you're located in Michigan, let me know.

I'd consider any Rock River Arms AR rifle as long as it has a mid-length gas system, a 16"" barrel, an A4 flat-top upper and does NOT have a fixed front sight. Let me know what you've got and where you're located in Michigan. Thanks, JD"
