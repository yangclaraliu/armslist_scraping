Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings where we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20E utilizes a Jacketed Hollow Point 125 gr. Jacketed hollow nose bullet. This bullet is designed to expand at low speeds and has no problem opening up at considerably less velocity than our advertised 900 fps, from two inch barrels. Penetration in human tissue is roughly 12 inches."

I just received this optic when I found out my wife is now pregnant, so it has to go.  It was intended for hog hunting and self defense, but now these funds need to be repurposed for insurance deductibles, diapers, etc. It has less than 2 hours on it and it never went into the field.  I walked around the house looking at mine and my dog's footprints on the carpet.  This thing is sweet.  The warranty card is blank, so you will be able to register that under your name.  I ordered the full riser from ARMS because of other reviews stating the optic sits too low.  The package comes with everything you see in the pictures below.  The DVR still has the screen protector on it.  It is not scratched.

Here is what comes with the sale and what I paid for it.

Rear sight is Matech graduated combat flip up. Asking $775 - a little less than whats in the gun (200rds through it).

Bolt carrier group is completely chrome from PSA. Comes with 7 D&H Gen II (25rds) 6.8 magazines, and 220rds of Federal XM68GD. This is the same hot load (90gr Bonded Gold Dot) that the Saudi Security Forces have on contract.

Prussian Charles Daly Drilling (3 barrels) 12 ga 38-55 cal,"Murfreesboro, TN, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, October 14, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"My father has hit some rough financial times and asked me to sell this Prussian CD Drilling he passed down to me to help him out.  I hate to see it go, and this may not be the best place to sell an item like this, but I figured I would offer it up before accepting our offer from Gamefair in Nashville.

This a a Charles Daly Drilling that was acquired in Africa.  It was manufactured by Sauer and Sohn. They were used for bird hunting and had the rifle barrel in case of a dangerous game encounter while out shooting birds.  He needs the cash by this weekend so it will clearly go well under value.  As far a that is concerned I was offered $1300 for it, the fair sale market value on it from Gamefair was at least $2500 and the good folks there were very honest about making a really low offer for it.  These go for much more on Guns Intl etc, but I just don't have the time to wait as my father needs the money by this weekend.  

Here's an opportunity for someone with a little time to turn a great profit, or to acquire a very rare 12 ga brass - 38-55 combo collectible at a ridiculous price. PM me with offers and it will go to the best one I get in the next couple of days.  I can take more photos of the proofmarks etc as need to finalize a deal.  It has a gorgeous Damascus barrels with nice bright bores, great engraving, and checkering.  All matching numbers and proof marks."

This is a WWII French made pistol but it has been powder coated. It's a very accurate gun and is very well made.  It will hold good groups at 25 yards.  Has adjustable rear sights and a grip safety.  Not much to look at but a very good shooting, reliable semi-auto. Leather original holster and 30 rounds come with the gun.  I am very firm at $210."

Blade Hardness: Steel 5160 RC 56 - 58 
Blade thickness: 3/16"" 
Blade Coating: Black Traction Epoxy Hybrid (Powder Coat) 
The blade is 9 inches total, 8 inches of working length; the handle is 5 inches. 
The sheath is made of a ballistic nylon to reduce weight and rot, inherent with leather sheaths. So an awesome 14 inches over all length.
Below is what a blurb from Tops' Site.
Mykel Hawke has teamed up with TOPS Knives to make a new survival knife. Mykel has designed a knife specifically for maximum function and efficiency for the survivor. Hawke's years of real field experience and dirt time found most other blades lacking in one or more areas. TOPS Knife Makers have a combined 100 years of real field, rescue, law, combat, and special ops experience. Together, they have created one of the most useful all purpose utilitarian survival knives ever made. The handle has 2 lanyard holes for left/right or double security. It is made of micarta which actually improves the grip when wet and is designed to be fatter in the middle to give maximum human hand grip, no matter how slippery from water or blood. The handle has a divet in it to be used as the socket for the fire bow drill method. The sheath is made of a ballistic nylon to reduce weight and rot, inherent with leather sheaths. It has a kydex insert shaped for the knife to make it extra strong and extra safe. The sheath can be tied down to the leg for active wear or worn sideways along the belt on the waist. This gives the knife the best general length to serve as both a large tool like a machete and a small tool like a hand knife. The Hellion is the best single tool for any survivor when they can only carry one item to do everything they need to survive. This means the Survivor's best choice for an all-purpose tool is simple: For all things survival, it's HAWKE's HELLION, anytime, anything, anywhere!

This is a Replica of a Colt 1911 made in Spain. She is a semi-automatic LLAMA 45ACP MAX-1-L/F. Manufactured in 1995 (Born on The 4th of July...but in Spain, or it could be the 7th of April?), Stainless Steel and Bluing. Comes with the original 8 rnd. magazine, a Colt 1911 7 rnd. magazine, 100 rounds of 45acp FMJ. Has Pachmayr Sure-Grips. Does show some signs of wear around trigger guard and a few tiny scratches here and there...nothing that affects functionality. This is one of the better replicas, selling for about 1/2 the price of a true 1911. Functionally FLAWLESS, with triple safeties (Grip, hammer, and slide). A simply beautiful piece, (cleaned and lubed with Rem-Oil, inside and out), you will be proud to own!! Check around, the price is right (This is the FULL SIZE, not the mini-max!!)... Thanks!!"

The gun is in great condition and free of any blemishes. This Taurus would make a great conceal carry firearm. One 7 round magazine and the manual are included.

""SLIM"" is the name of this suave new entry into the Taurus line. Elegant in Blue and Stainless this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come.

The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.
