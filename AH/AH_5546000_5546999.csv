This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports.

This pistol is a Walther PP in 7.65mm (or .32ACP) that was manufactured in March of 1945 and is ""ac"" stamped. It has the beech wood grips and does show some wear. This pistol was either a hastily assembled pistol at the end of the war or a GI assembled souvenir. It does have mismatched s/n numbers however both are in the March of '45 range. This is a very attractive pistol for its age and for when it was made.  Everything is tight, like it should be, and you can easily appreciate the German craftsmanship utilized to create this pistol at a time where the world was crumbling around Germany, which was quite an accomplishment.  Don't miss this chance to add a remarkable pistol to your safe and have an unusual piece of history that you can actually shoot."

The information below was copied from Taurus's site.This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

It runs perfectly, could use a buffing to get rid of light scratches(which I've had done many times over the years). I wore it daily until the last couple years. Since then it's sat in the safe.

The reason I suspect an issue is that the trigger became extremely light and the half cock mechanism that allows the cylinder to spin seems temperamental. I am offering it at a loss to someone who knows what to do with it and will give it a good home. $350 takes it.

I am pleased to offer this Zastava Arms M70 Mauser bolt-action rifle in .308 or 7.62x51mm NATO made in 2011. It has only had about 30 rounds fired through it. This rifle is in outstanding condition and in about 98% new condition with no wear or cosmetic issues to declare. This is the same action as the reknown German Mauser and it is made in the Zastava factory where they have been making Mausers since before WWII. This rifle's Mauser action is identical to the Remington 798, Parker-Hale 1200, Charles Daly and Interams Mark X. Zastava actually manufactured the receivers and bolts for ALL of those rifles. Typical Mauser features include a claw extractor on the bolt, a recoil lug that is machined into receiver body, controlled feed and a milled and deeply blued hinged floorplate on a 1 piece milled steel trigger guard/ magazine bottom plate. This rifle has high gloss bluing  the likes of which most rifle makers simply don't do anymore and if they do, it's expensive. Think Winchester M70 Super Grade; that's how nice this rifle's finish is. It also has a an equally attractive walnut stock with beautiful figuring in the wood grain, a classic European design, deluxe cut-checkering (not stamped!), a satin finish, low-profile right hand cheekpiece and a schnabel fore grip. The barrel is made of chrome-vanadium steel and is cold hammer forged providing greater steel density and hardness for consistant accuracy and lifelong durability. The trigger is excellent and fully adjustable as well. The scope in the pictures is not included but the Leupold Scope mount is and I will throw in a NC Star 4-16x50 Mil-Dot scope. Finally, I have mounted a leather rifle sling that is in keeping with this classic bolt-action Mauser. I am not interested in trades and my price is firm. For this rifle set up the way it is, this is a great deal! I will be happy to e-mail better and more pictures of the rifle for the serious would be buyer. If this ad is up on Armslist the rifle is available,"

Also has Ambidextrous slide release.  Minor scuffing on polymer frame (from magnetic bed stand mount).  Has had less than 100 rounds through it and is an excellent shooter.I'm the original owner, purchased this as a Sig 2-Sum kit (which included the full size and subcompact exchange kit).  I eventually purchased an additional new FCU so I could have two ready-to-go pistols, but I never carry this so it's time to go.

This is a well-built Rifle and it is in excellent condition. I bought this Rifle about 10 years ago and it was new old stock in its original box. I have sense fired it putting maybe 20 or so rounds through it. Every time I fired the Rifle I used good ammunition either Remington or Federal and have always cleaned/oiled the barrel and whipped the Rifle down. The walnut stock is nearly perfect with only a couple minor imperfections and it is fit beautifully to the Rifle.  I rate the stock 99% or better. The bluing on the Rifle is excellent as well with the only imperfection being under the rear sight. There is a small amount of rust under the sight shown in the picture. This existed when I purchased the Rifle 10 years ago. The sight could be removed and the rust cleaned up but I want to leave the Rifle in its original condition for the buyer. Because of this imperfection I have to rate the bluing at 95% however if this were not there it would easily be 99%. The action is nice and smooth and operates flawlessly. This is one of the good old Marlin’s not one of the new Remlin’s. The Weaver Scope is virtually new and is a perfect set up for this Rifle. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify. I prefer to sell Face to Face however I will ship Firearms and sell outside of the State of Washington. This will cost an additional $80 and that covers Shipping, paper work done by my FFL and the Sales Tax Washington State charges. In the case of shipping a Firearm the only form of payment I accept is via PayPal*"

Attached to the muzzle is the Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider. New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal. Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block. This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines. With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo.On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel. The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier.Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 13 inches in length. The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster. The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections. One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle. The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods.An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.*NFA rules apply, must ship to an FFL dealer with an SOT.$200.00 tax stamp to ATF. *Included:Knight's Armament SR-15 E3 14.5"" SBR Rifle(7) Keymod rail panels, blackGI aluminum 30 round magazine with Knight's Armament follower (where legal)5 slot picatinny keymod rail sectionKnight's Armament logoed padded hard case(2) KAC QD sling swivelsMagwell block with lockOwner's manual"

I prefer S&W J-Frames without an internal lock. Please do not offer me a J Frame with an internal lock. Prefer 340, 640, 940, 65, 66, 586, 686. I am asking $750.
