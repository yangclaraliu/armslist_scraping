The Glock is almost new, bought it superbowl weekend, and I've only put 100 rounds through it.  Comes with all the Glock stuff, backstraps, three mags, and everything they come with in the case.  I put a Pearce +2 extension on one of the mags for an 11 round capacity and longer grip, though I still have the flush floor plate if wanted.  I've also installed a Glock OEM 3.5 trigger connector which considerably smooths out the trigger pull and lightens it up a bit (Standard on the G34 and G35).

As the title says I""m wanting to trade for a basic AR15, preferably an M&P15 sport as the price point is about the same, though I may consider other entry level AR15's like a DPMS Panther or Oracle or similar.  I dont want something heavily customized, the only extras I would be interested in and might pay extra for is extra mags, ammo, or basic optics.  Absolutely NOT interested in .22 caliber rifles of the same style, must be .223/5.56.

Would also be interested in a .308/7.62 battle rifle such as a Cetme, PTR 91, or FAL, or a NON Romanian AK47, though primarily looking for an AR15

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

The stock has amazing figure color and fiddle running the full length of the blank. A lady who is a world renowned Master Engraver at Colt Firearms did the beautiful flure de lure wrap around checkering and thumb strap. This rifle will out shoot the Lapua 10 to 1 and look beautiful doing it. Gets lots of looks and questions at the range. I have over 4300 invested in this rifle so before you say something that makes you sound like a BUFFON do some research on that little box your looking at and contact Wes at AI and find out what it would cost to duplicate this rifle or build one like it. Im sure hill be happy to take your deposit and get you started. Also comes with a one of only 200 made NRA limited edition slings that were only sold at the Dallas Safari Club Show and a Weatherby 3by9 supreme scope. Thanks for looking.

I have also added an extended magazine release that makes magazine changes much smoother than the stock configuration. 
The stock tang has been removed and replaced with a billet DPH internal stock block adapter with M4 style folding stock mechanism. This enables the ability to put any Mil-Spec AR style multi position stock on the Saiga. 
It has a billet quad rail for a forearm and has both a full length and short upper rail cover. It is not wearing either in the below photos. 
The vertical grip is an all aluminum grip and has a palm swell that fills the hand.
It sports a Phoenix Breach/Break on the barrel with break lock nut.

The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free. $15.00 extra for shipping.

Putting together a heavier bullet, a cleaner powder, a premium lube on the lead round nose projectile gave us consistent velocities and harder hitting performance at subsonic, suppressor-friendly speed. The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. While ""harder hitting"" and .""22lr"" aren't usually associated together, steel silhouette shooters will appreciate the difference between a knockdown and a wobbling target that stays up! A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities. Our testing indicates that the ballistic coefficient for the 42gr GEMTECH bullet is approximately .125.

Sold in 500 round bricks, the GEMTECH SILENCER SUBSONIC .22lr ammunition is sub-packaged in 50 rd tray boxes to keep bullet noses from any accuracy-robbing damage during transit. Only five bricks left. Price posted is per brick. $10.00 extra for shipping."

A push of a button folds the sights securely out of the way until you need them again (they fold to a profile of just 0.460). Troy BattleSights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers. Features: - No tools are required for adjustment - Blackened Stainless Steel - MIL-SPEC Type III Hard Coated - T6 Aircraft Aluminum construction

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

It is an over-under design that is fired by turning the barrel on it's pivot for the second shot. It is single-action and has a half-cock safety. The barrel(s) are stainless steel, the frame is brass and the grips appear to be bakelite. It is chambered for .22 short ammunition. It also comes with a small, clip-on holster, but doesn't really need a holster as this derringer will fit into a cigarette pack or the watch pocket of a pair of jeans! It only weighs 4 ounces!! It has some scratches and marks on it (these could easily be buffed out) but it is in great condition for being almost 40 years old. Price is only $95. Must meet in or near New Port Richey in Pasco county. Must be of age and a Florida resident."

Sig 9389BGAMBI P938 9mm 6+1 2Tone/Blk SAO 3"" Ambi Safety Blackwood Grip

The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the
ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to
the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size
Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet
is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

I accepted this gun in a trade about 4 years ago from a good friend who inherited it from his grandfather from what I am told. It is in great shape in my opinion, it has signs of use but has been taken care of since I have owned it, and appeared to be before I owned it. I've personally put close to 500 shots through it, and as I hate to admit, maybe 4 #6 steel shots through it on my first waterfowl hunt before I bought my 887. Never once had an issue with it, very solid and proven gun. No rust or pitting, any signs of use are very small, wood is in good shape and the finish still looks great. A collector may say differently but come take a look for yourself because I think this is a beautiful gun. 

Anyhow, I am negotiable and motivated to sell, my asking price is $400. Call or Text for quickest response, would like it gone today or tomorrow. REDACTED"

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.

The M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRC to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature a new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The charging handle is also ambidextrous, to accommodate any operator.

LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity."
