Mike told me personally to not take less than $12k so I will not let got for less than that price. That's the rifle, scope, mk 4 rings anodized to match barrel, and the suppressor with the Od storm case. I am willing to break the package up and sell the scope separate and if you're not wanting the can, I would sell the rifle bare with the OD storm case. This is an opportunity many have been waiting years to come across so if you've been wanting a Tac Ops rifle without paying $8,000 and waiting 2-3 years to recieve your rifle, nows your chance to get a ridiculous deal with no wait.

Wilson Case Trimmer,"West, Akron, Ohio",$ 175,"Listed On: Saturday, June 4, 2016",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The L.E. Wilson Case Trimmer aligns and holds your cases square to the cutter during the trim process. This results in a virtually identical trim length for each case. It is accomplished with L.E. Wilson’s unique case holder system which holds the case by the body taper. The trimmer case holder, cutter housing, and micrometer adjustment unit sit in perfect alignment. No pilots or collets are utilized which could influence the trim results negatively. Now in stainless steel, the L.E. Wilson Trimmer is built to last for a lifetime of use.The Sinclair Micrometer head allows the reloader to easily adjust trim length in increments of .001"" with an adjustment length of over 2"". Our micrometer reads in “actual” case length, making it the most pleasurable micro trimmer to work with. Determine your trim length, dial to the exact length on the micrometer, and you’re ready – it’s that simple. The micrometer features crisp, easy-to-read engravings and may be locked in place when set. Easily accommodates cases from 22 Hornet to 416 Rigby. When trimming cases shorter than 1.3” such as pistol cases, the use of a spacer (part number WX11) is necessary.Completing the Sinclair Stainless Ultimate Trimmer is the Sinclair Mounting Stand with Shark Fin Clamp. This system makes easy work of installing and removing your trimmer case holder in a smooth “swing-arm” motion. The Shark Fin trimmer clamp secures the case head firmly against the micrometer adjustment head for a quick and accurate, chatter-free trim. * Trimmer Case Holders and accessories sold separately.The idea for this platform originated from a writer/customer of ours. The platform is a mounting board for the L.E. Wilson trimmer series that provides storage space for nine (9) case holders and a tapping block for knocking the cases out of the holder. The polyethylene platform has rubber feet, but most of us prefer it c-clamped to the bench.  This package also includes Two Case Trimmer holders. One for .308 caliber as well as one for .30-06 Caliber. Now you can trim up all the cases you need for Hi Power shooting.This was used very lightly. This is in very good condition. I was going to go into reloading and load my own ammo. But I changed my mind. I gave up F class shooting. I think I used this for all of 50 rounds."

Now in its third generation, it includes many new features that our customers have requested. The new third generation Sinclair F-Class Bipod is offered with an optional quick-adjust elevation knob for faster target acquisition making follow-up shots easier. Made from 7075 T6 aluminum, it’s lighter yet more rigid - nearly a full pound less than the previous generation (call for exact weight, we did not have a precise weight at the time of print). The Sinclair F-Class Bipod’s adjustable legs include new laser etched graduations so the shooter may easily return to a favorite setting.Other mounting and adjustment features which our customers prefer, have stayed exactly the same. The bipod locking feature enables you to adjust and lock changes for rifle can’t quickly and easily. Firearms mount to the Sinclair F-Class Bipod by utilizing their sling swivel stud in just a few seconds with the captured, hardened pin system. Then, tighten the two tensioning knobs which pull the stock against heavy, low compression felt pads for a movement-free mount. Target rifles with a rail or AR-15’s may be mounted using one of our sling stud adapters.The Sinclair F-Class Bipod is used by shooters in F-Class Competition, varmint hunting, load testing, tactical shooting, sighting in rifles, and more. It provides an extremely strong, stable, and comfortable platform for nearly any rifle.I used it literally for 50 rounds and then decided that F-Class was NOT for me. These Bipods have a spectacular reputation for steadying the rifle for extreme long range shooting."

I am the original owner and have put around 20 rounds through it. Has a small rail on the right side of the shotgun for a tac-light which I could include for an extra 40 dollars or to sweeten a trade deal, and the shotgun also has factory night sights. Third is a Winchester model 88 lever action rifle chambered in .308. Rifle has been in my family since it was manufactured in 1960. Gun has some slight wear on the stock but other than that it is in great condition. The 1' scope rings flip to the side to allow use of iron sights while keeping your scope zeroed. Rifle comes with factory 5 round magazine and I think i have a box or two of winchester .308 ammo in the safe. I am asking 300 for the SR22, 425 for the shotgun, and 850 for the rifle. I think these prices are reasonable and so they are pretty firm, but I will be a little flexable if you have something im interested in trading for.
