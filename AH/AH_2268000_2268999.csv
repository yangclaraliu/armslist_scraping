Needing to sell another safe queen. This is a POF P-308 rifle that was custom chambered from POF in .243. The twist rate is 1:8. I shot mainly the 75gr Hornady V-Max bullets and it would group 1/2 MOA 5-shot just fine. Never found any DTAC's at a decent price, but always wanted to try out the heavier bullet given the fast twist rate. I've put 80 rounds down the barrel, so plenty of life left in this thing. This is the P-308 20"" rifle, gas-piston model. The barrel is fluted and the brake tames recoil down to that comparable of a 5.56 - it really does work that well. The rifle has the NP3. You can view the specs of the rifle at POF's website. Comes with shown Blue Force Vicker's tactical sling, and 1 P-Mags. BTW, the .243 and .308 share the same mag. Also, I changed out the charging handle latch to the tactical charging handle (shown). Scope is the Bushnell AR scope, 3-12x40mm 1"" tube. The rings/base are the Leupold 1-piece AR Tactical mount (as shown). Please be sure this is legal for you to own prior to bidding. Payment and FFL are to be received within 5 days of the close of auction."

It is a .22LR firearm in the original case with two 10-round magazines included and features a slip over ergonomic grip, adjustable rear Nitron sight system, and a removable vertical grip with a laser; these items all add value – the extra magazine alone was retailing for $42.99 at Fleet Farm this morning.

The pistol is in excellent condition and has been well cared for. It will be sold clean with a light coat of oil on the metal-to-metal / contact points.  It also comes with original factory hard case and both recoil springs (standard and high velocity).  

The Sig Sauer Mosquito is designed to be 90% the size of the P226 and useful for maintaining handgun skills at a fraction of the price.  The vertical grip-laser combo also fits other Sig Sauer handguns with similar rail system.  

Trades: I am always interested in .22 revolvers, tube fed .22 rifles, Savage .22 rifles, Savage .17HMR rifles, and I’ll listen (read) whatever other offers someone wants to make. I’m especially interested in High Standard Double Nine .22LR revolvers.  This pistol is in excellent shape and I expect those I’m trading for to be also.  If there is a cash difference between my item and yours we can work that out, no reason for one of us to take it in the shorts.  

I’ll need to see a PTP or PTC and a valid MN ID.

I am just putting some feelers out there with this TRR8. It's in great condition and comes with all the goodies including the top and bottom rails, and the metal performance center locking case. I will also throw in some moon clips as well. This is gun is pretty bad ass, but unfortunately I don't shoot it as much as I should and it needs to go to a good home. In case you don't know, this firearm was developed for SWAT teams. The guy holding shield would carry this during the breach.

I am interested in a Springfield M1A/AR10/.308 bolt action and can add money if needed to make up the difference depending on the package, but may be open to other offers. All I ask is that you do your homework and don't offer 500.00 Glocks. I would put this at 1,000 in trade value."

This still has the original packing grease on it. This is a nice color case hardened & blued model, unlike the cheapo entry-level models with the matte finish. 

$375 obo. FTF transaction, no paperwork required (as it is a muzzleloader). I will need to see a driver's license to confirm age (must be at least 18 years old). If you pick it up, I'm willing to work a little on the price. I'm not an unreasonable person, make an offer. I am taking a pretty hard hit on this one compared to what I bought it for a couple years ago.

These are super, super nice clones, and a great way to get into a legitimate piece of history. Unfortunately, I have to sell off a few toys due to health issues I'm not willing to disclose on the internet. 



Additional: Don't bother asking me to ship, if I was willing to ship, I would have stated that in the ad. Likewise, ridiculous, lowball offers are going to be ignored. This is not a $200 blaster. Go buy a Pietta if you want something on the cheap, otherwise, don't bother me."

I purchased this gun NEW earlier this year and really like it, but I want something slightly larger.  To purchase, you must be a KY resident and legally able to own a handgun.  I will consider trade offers of equal value, but no junk.  This is a nice package and would cost you easily 535.00-550.00 plus a lot of digging around to put together.  I have it here ready to go for a FIRM PRICE OF 425.00.  Looking for something like a Beretta Nano, S&W Shield or S&W M&P Compact. Can meet in the Florence area, but NO, I will not drive to Berea KY so you can look at my gun.  This would make a great CHRISTMAS PACKAGE, but if you are looking to trade, you must have something of equal or greater value worth trading."

1. AB 48: Bans Large Capacity Magazines/Conversion Kits - Beginning on January 1, 2014, anyone who purchases and/or brings into the State of California a collection of parts that can be assembled into an high capacity magazine will be in violation of the law. Further reading into this law I can see it say that the ownership, intention of sale, building or modifying a >10 rd magazine will become illegal as this will cover the ""kit"" loophole or whatever

2. AB 711: Lead Ammunition Ban (Governor's Signing Letter) - Amendments recently taken to this law extends the time period of implimentation from July 1, 2018 to July 1, 2019. Basically :  This law bans lead ammunition ""for hunting"" by Jan 1, 2019.  

So this is what happens when those people buy thousands upon thousands of ammo and magazines and overprice sell to us gun people who want to have fun and respect the sport of shooting guns and hunting. So now there is a panic of selling and now they are trying to sell 10 rd mags for way more than they are worth. 

PLEASE DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF AND BUY THE OVERPRICED GARBAGE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SELLING. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY GET FOR TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT ON SUCH A BIG COMMUNINTY. THIER TIME IS DYING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE OVERSTOCKED WITH, IN THE FUTURE, ILLEGAL MERCHANDISE AND WILL BE IN DEBT.

Gun is in good condition, bore is seasoned & mirror-like. Rifle has typical (small) scratches & dents associated with use, otherwise it is 100% presentable. Comes with a tin of musket caps, and a full box of .544'' conical bullets. As a BONUS, I am including a rear tang sight, with an extra aperture. This rifle does have an operable breechblock, enabling one to load it with paper cartridges which can be made from cigarette rolling paper. If I have any loaded paper cartridges around, I will include them with the rifle. 

I have shot this out to 500yds., and it performs admirably. Unfortunately, due to health issues, I need to sell this off. My loss is your gain. If you were looking for a Sharps without the actual Sharps price-tag, this is your best bet. 

As this is a muzzleloader, it requires no paperwork. I will need to see a driver's license to confirm age (18 years old or older). Bring cash & carry it home. 

$550 obo. Willing to work on price a little if picked up. 

Additional: Don't bother asking me to ship, if I was willing to ship, I would have stated that in the ad. Don't bother making a ridiculous, lowball offer. If you want a $200 blaster, go buy a cookie-cutter inline from Walmart."

It bears serial number 444982. It has a 24"" octagon barrel with good overall bore. The finish on the gun is good, with some discoloring on the top of the bolt. The rifle functions flawlessly. It makes a beautiful sound when it is racked, hammer stays back, fires with a nice and crisp trigger. Also has a half-cock safety. The stock is the prettiest I have seen on a 100+ year old rifle. It has that distinct Winchester gloss on top of high quality walnut. No major dings, only a very few slight scratches on the stock and forearm. There is a very very small piece of the stock missing by the tang. None of the screws on the gun are marred, and most likely have never been removed. The only exception is the rear tang screw, which looks to be new. This rifle bears the following markings: ""MANUFACTURED BY THE WINCHESTER REPEATING ARMS CO. NEW HAVEN. CONN. U.S.A. PATENTED OCTOBER 14, 1884."" and ""32 W C F"" on the barrel, the serial number under the receiver, ""MODEL 1892 -WINCHESTER- TRADE MARK"" on the tang, 10, 30, and 42 by the lever."
