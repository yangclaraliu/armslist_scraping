Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple brand new, FACTORY FRESH Ruger 10/22 Takedown .22LR Rifles! The 10/22 Takedown is a brilliant approach to conveniently storing and transporting rifles. Able to easily and quickly be separated into two halves, the rifle is also shipped with an extremely durable soft zipper case that fits the rifle as well as a large assortment of accessories and magazines.



 I just got THREE in stock, and they are ON SALE and priced to sell quickly for only $319.00 each (cash price).



Ruger 11100 10/22 Takedown .22lr Rifle with Black Synthetic Stock, Stainless Finish, 10-Round Magazine

Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly.

Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer
different carrying options.

The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37” long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4” when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one ten-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

Don't know anyone that has one so never shot one. Got this hi point to try it out and I didn't have very high expectations but this gun really surprised me, it shoots great. No malfunctions of any kind. I had one failure to fire but it was the round not the gun (also didn't fire out of my 9mm pistol). I was then given a Taurus 9mm carbine for my birthday from the lady so I have posted both of them for sale. I will keep one. Whatever sells first goes. Other stays. has a forgrip and 2 mag holders on the stock added to the gun as well as a flash suppressor, also includes orginal box and everything from the factory. Papers locks tools etc. Farthest I've had a chance to shoot it is 100yds and it's was accurate out that far. Can't speak on it at further distances as I've never had the chance to try. I'd imagine with the groups I was having at 100 that it can be accurate further out. Getting rid of it because I was given a Taurus carbine for my birthday from the lady. I don't need to get rid of it just seeing what I can get for it. They sell brand new for 370 at USA performance an ubers. Tgd has a heavily used one for 299. I've been told other places have them but never keep them in for long, those are the only places I've seen them in. Apparently they are popular with the price point they have and the performance. Open to any and all trades. Firearm or non firearm. Just seeing what's out there. Let me know worst I can say is no thanks. REDACTED. Call, text or email. Call after 5pm please, work.

 Ruger 5601 SR-762 .308 Win Rifle, Gas Piston Driven, 16 Inch Barrel, 20-Round


The Ruger SR-762 brings the downrange authority of the .308 cartridge to the popular SR-556 family of two-stage, piston-driven, AR-style rifles. The SR-762 is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform. The .308 Win/7.62 NATO cartridge is perfect for hunting medium and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. The SR-762 retains the features of the original SR556 that make it a solid performer among AR-style rifles. It comes with a Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat Anodized finish and a precision-filed, chrome-lined, cold-hammer-forged MilSpec 41V45 chrome-coly-vanadium steel barrel. It comes with a round, smooth-sided Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver that features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail. It also has a Hogue Monogrip pistol grip and comes with three 20-round Magpul PMAG magazines, a soft-sided case, and three finger-grooved rail covers.

Specializing in custom Kydex and Holstex products, including holsters, mag pouches, knife sheaths and custom carry options for belts and chest rigs; such as cases for multi-tools, hand cuffs, phone, radio, tactical flashlights and batons all of which can be made molle compatible. If you need a case I can make it and I offer over 30 color options to meet almost any need.
Holsters are made custom for each gun and can made to accommodate your custom sight, light and/or laser attachment. Some holsters can be worn “in the waistband” or “out of the waistband” with a quick replacement of belt clips. In addition, many can have molle clips added to allow for installation to a chest rig. 
I also do custom orders, such as pistol holster/mag carrier combo. Please message me about any questions or special request you may have.
Holsters are usually shipped in approx 5-10 days, I order materials and molding guns at time of taking order, which usually takes approx 3 days to receive. Then depending on my backlog, I usually make them within 2 days of materials coming. I strive to have all orders out within 5 days and keep you posted on the status.

Full blown Robar custom started as a Sig Sauer P516 7.5"" piston driven ""pistol"". Blueprinted with Geissele trigger installed and live fire tested, NP3 all internals and controls, Poly T2 OD Green exterior. NP3 PLUS has a 1000 hour salt spray protection level per ASTM-B-117 and Poly T2 exceeds 1000 hours. Robar logo stamped for bona fides, rail system marked w/ alpha numeric system, 4 sling swivel attach points, Magpul furniture inc forend grip, Samson BUIS (back up iron sights).. One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement with the introduction of this Robar/Rocke platform. With its Nitride treated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator it incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating aluminum forend, and you have the most advanced, versatile gas pushrod pistol available. NO SBR STAMP NEEDED! The BATFE has classified this as a pistol. With the addition of the adjustable stock for length of pull it is still legal as the BATFE has classified the stock as a forearm retention device; yes you can legally shoot it the same as an SBR in the same position you shoot any carbine! You get a letter from the BATFE confirming this is a pistol and you do NOT need a stamp.. that said this for all practical purposes is an SBR and operates exactly the same way as any other carbine or SBR.. but legal w/ no stamp; get it? This platform engages silhouettes out to 250 meters no problem topped with the Swedish Aimpoint Comp M4S military issue red dot system; runs continuous for 8 years on a single AA battery, waterproof, military edition units come with Tenebraex ARD (anti- reflective device) and ocular and objective covers. System is awesome for 0-250 meters. We chose this optic over the micro systems as the durability of the M4S is unsurpassed. This SBR/optic combo is built to take abuse and continue to function.. it is tough! When Dorothy tells you an SBR cannot engage and terminate threats at these distances have him go to Cowtown with us. We'll shoot at 300 plus.. Unit delivered zeroed at 100 meters."

The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe.

Browning ProSteel safes lead the industry when it comes to managing safe interior storage. Nowhere is our expertise more evident than with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending).

All premium Browning ProSteel safes feature the Axis Adjustable Shelving system. Platinum Plus and Gold Series safes come fully loaded with an all shelf interior that can be customized to meet your needs.

Spikes is well known for some of the highest quality and most accurate AR15 rifles and uppers made. They use all mil-spec (or better) components. Their quality control is outstanding and the fit and finish of their products are second to none. This is a factory built Spikes upper complete with all Spikes Tactical parts, including the well know and highly regarded Spikes Bolt Carrier Group. Complete specifications are listed below. It is brand new in the box, it has never been fired or on a lower. It has the Spikes Spider logo laser engraved on both the BCG and the upper receiver, and the barrel is marked ""ST"" along with all the other specs in the rollmark. It has a 16"" barrel and mid-length gas system, which is pretty much better in every way than the standard carbine length gas system. Longer hand guards for more versatile hand placement, longer sight radius, and they are also softer shooting and run smoother due to the longer gas system which equals less felt recoil and less wear and tear on components as well. Throw this on any $150-200 lower receiver and you will have a top quality and sweet shooting AR15 for the price of a cheap off-the-shelf Bushy or Windham Walmart or Academy Sports rifle. Cash only and price is firm. Pics available by text if needed. If interested and serious please reply with a phone number to contact you on, thanks.

Specializing in custom Kydex and Holstex products, including holsters, mag pouches, knife sheaths and custom carry options for belts and chest rigs; such as cases for multi-tools, hand cuffs, phone, radio, tactical flashlights and batons all of which can be made molle compatible. If you need a case I can make it and I offer over 30 color options to meet almost any need.
Holsters are made custom for each gun and can made to accommodate your custom sight, light and/or laser attachment. Some holsters can be worn “in the waistband” or “out of the waistband” with a quick replacement of belt clips. In addition, many can have molle clips added to allow for installation to a chest rig. 
I also do custom orders, such as pistol holster/mag carrier combo. Please message me about any questions or special request you may have.
Holsters are usually shipped in approx 5-10 days, I order materials and molding guns at time of taking order, which usually takes approx 3 days to receive. Then depending on my backlog, I usually make them within 2 days of materials coming. I strive to have all orders out within 5 days and keep you posted on the status.

This has been my daily carry since I got it, and has been by my side almost daily. The gun has a black nitron finish, which if you know Sigs, you know is tough as nails. It comes with an extended magazine release, a checkered front strap, steel mainspring housing, novak cut night sights that glow very bright, a beavertail grip safety with memory pad, skeleton combat hammer, adjustable skeletonized trigger, and tons of other upgrades that 1911 enthusiasts look for. The trigger on this gun breaks crisp and clean, making it a dream to shoot. Its far more accurate than I am. I did A LOT of research before settling on this gun, and the only reason I'm parting with it is to fund the purchase of another 1911 that's on the pricey side.

Included with the gun are the sig hard case, paperwork, three sig factory magazines, and one wilson combat magazine for max reliability when carrying. Also included with the stock blackwood grips are a set of Raasco rosewood grips and black box elderwood grips that both look classy as hell (see pics). I'll also throw in a remora in the waistband holster with sweatshield that makes carry comfortable and easy. This gun has been meticulously cared for like all my firearms.

I am asking $925, which is pretty fair considering all I'm including. I saw one of these at Outpost armory in Murfreesboro today going for $1060.

Must be a TN resident and be able to legally own a handgun. Must have valid TN driver's license (carry permit preferred), and be willing to meet face to face and fill out a bill of sale. 

Feel free to email me with any questions. Thanks for looking!"

Specializing in custom Kydex and Holstex products, including holsters, mag pouches, knife sheaths and custom carry options for belts and chest rigs; such as cases for multi-tools, hand cuffs, phone, radio, tactical flashlights and batons all of which can be made molle compatible. If you need a case I can make it and I offer over 30 color options to meet almost any need.
Holsters are made custom for each gun and can made to accommodate your custom sight, light and/or laser attachment. Some holsters can be worn “in the waistband” or “out of the waistband” with a quick replacement of belt clips. In addition, many can have molle clips added to allow for installation to a chest rig. 
I also do custom orders, such as pistol holster/mag carrier combo. Please message me about any questions or special request you may have.
Holsters are usually shipped in approx 5-10 days, I order materials and molding guns at time of taking order, which usually takes approx 3 days to receive. Then depending on my backlog, I usually make them within 2 days of materials coming. I strive to have all orders out within 5 days and keep you posted on the status.

It already has the screw upgrade kit, HK push pins, HK rear sight, and GSG5 conversion kit done. Plus the cocking handle has a buffer installed so you can get slap happy and slap the cocking handle down all day like a real HK. It has 50 rounds through it total. Comes with three 20 round mags, 100 rounds of CCI mini-mag 22lr, the conversion kit if you want to go back to the GSG522 style components, and everything else in the picture. This is NOT the lightweight model with plastic upper. It is the metal standard model.

You can mount the collapsible stock with the push of a pin, BUT do so at your own risk as you are making a SBR subject to NFA rules at that point, so you can get the stamp if you like. I include the stock because I dont want extra parts I wont use for anything else. I have a picture in this config for informative purposes only.

The flash hider screws off and a suppressor adapter is available at hkparts.net. Again, caveat emptor for installing that part as rules apply.Thers are lots of parts and accessories for the GSG. Noise wise this guy is pretty quiet even with nine inches of barrel. It is a little louder than my Ruger 10/22 carbine but not much. If you spent a lot of time around helicopters and artillery you wont even need air plugs.

This is a great little gun and is fun to shoot. It is heavy and feels like a real MP5. The trigger has a long pull and is two stage. Kinda like a real MP5 too. I have other things to buy, so time to liquidate some firearms.

Asking $375 o.b.o.  pick up in Caddo or we can meet if you are on the eastern side of DFW."

The VZ58 - 2008 V (Výsadkový—""airborne""), features a side-folding metal shoulder stock.
 Dubbed the VZ2008, this carbine sports the side-folding steel stock and features a combination of original Czech and new US-made parts for legality.
 light and compact handling characteristics of the carbine. With the stock folded, the 7-pound VZ2008 measures just over 26 inches long. This compact size, combined with the powerful 7.62x39mm chambering and 30 + 1 capacity makes it extremely well suited as a law enforcement patrol rifle.
 Over the course of a few hundred rounds, the rifle performed without a hitch. Despite its light weight and compact dimensions, the perceived recoil of the 7.62x39mm carbine proved to be quite pleasant and manageable. Accuracy at 100 yards was also quite good; particularly considering the fact the rifle was tested with only the iron sights.
• All VZ58 - 2008 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped. 
• Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
• The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
• The VZ 2008 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
• The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ2008.
• The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ2008.
• The VZ2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
• The alloy magazine of the VZ2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine.
• The VZ2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

• We've fired 700+ rounds through our store sample, no cleaning, no problems at all 
• Battle rifle accuracy that I am sure I could improve 
• At $535.00 this rifle is an absolute steal 
• Came with sling, 3 30 rd mags, and a cleaning kit 
• Minimal buildup after shooting 
• Easy to take down 
• Surplus parts available for low prices 
• Ejects to 1:00 consistently, away from other shooters"
