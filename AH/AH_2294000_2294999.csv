This is one of the best shooting 22's I have owned. It comes with the Boyd's Tacticool target stock, which I have modified. I created a system of interchangeable forends for both a normal (sporter) style and a wide (2 7/8"") flat style for benchrest shooting. This makes the weapon ideal for hunting, yet perfect for shooting off a rest competitively or for sighting it in.

May consider a trade but would like to have cash. Please make any offer and I will get back with you.
This rifle has performed flawlessly. With good Eley ammo, I shot 5 shot groups of 1 solid hole (not ragged) at 50 yards. Using some mid level ammo, I consistently shot under 2"" groups at 100 yards, with a best of just under 7/8"". This rifle will consistently hit clay pigeons at 200 yards, and I have no doubt it would do it at 250.

It is in great shape, and has maybe 500-1000 rounds through it. I clean it religiously, and the bore is spotless (can send pictures). I painted it a snake skin style camo, and added the bipod and cheek bag.

I am located in Morgantown but will travel for a good deal. I can send more pictures upon request and will happily discuss the rifle and modifications over the phone."

This is one of the best shooting 22's I have owned. It comes with the Boyd's Tacticool target stock, which I have modified. I created a system of interchangeable forends for both a normal (sporter) style and a wide (2 7/8"") flat style for benchrest shooting. This makes the weapon ideal for hunting, yet perfect for shooting off a rest competitively or for sighting it in.

This rifle has performed flawlessly. With good Eley ammo, I shot 5 shot groups of 1 solid hole (not ragged) at 50 yards. Using some mid level ammo, I consistently shot under 2"" groups at 100 yards, with a best of just under 7/8"". This rifle will consistently hit clay pigeons at 200 yards, and I have no doubt it would do it at 250.

It is in great shape, and has maybe 500-1000 rounds through it. I clean it religiously, and the bore is spotless (can send pictures). I painted it a snake skin style camo, and added the bipod and cheek bag.

I am located in Morgantown but will travel for a good deal. I can send more pictures upon request and will happily discuss the rifle and modifications over the phone.
May consider a trade but would like to have cash. Please make any offer and I will get back with you."

M1 Garand made by Springfield Armory in 308 NATO or 308 Winchester. This rifle was built as a Navy match rifle. It has the rare .308 barrel with the SA 11686514 drawing number MOD 61. The barrel was made/marked 3/66, (March 1966) and measures 1 at the muzzle and 0 at the throat (please see pictures of the gauging). This is one of the later match rifles that did not have the AMF or H&R marking in the chamber area as the conversion was likely done by the Navy shooting team armorers. The bore is clean and bright and is like new. The stock is glass bedded to the receiver

It has WESTERN FIELD DELUXE & MONTGOMERY WARDS & CO. stamped on the barrels. It has two of the three options available with the Western Field guns by special order: dual bead sights and a soft rubber butt pad. The only other option was the ejector that came later.
None of the Western Field guns frames were case hardened, this one was. There are traces of case hardening color under the front of the trigger guard, and on the top tang. The Western Field guns had a setter at point stamped into the frame sides. This one has the LeFever Nitro Special Duck in the Swamp scene. It has serial numbers matching on the frame, for end and barrels that are consistent with a LeFever Nitro Special made in 1929. The serial numbers are not in the Western Field range. The Western Field guns stocks were not checkered and were not normally good Walnut, the stocks on this gun are checkered and have a bit of tiger striping in the walnut.

It’s in an unadulterated form and in perfect functioning condition.

The bores are pristine. Both of the sighting beads have been broken. Bluing on the barrels is excellent with a very few minor surface scratches. The Duck in the Swamp scenes are light, but distinguishable. They aren't worn, just lightly stamped. The frame is dark, but there is no indication that it has been blued.

The barrels are 12 GA., 30”, choked full and modified.

Price is $600.00 cash picked up in Midtown Houston. I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I can send more photos if you are seriously interested.

Price dropped 11/09/13.

100% blue, unissued condition w/ MINT bore and crown (yes, really) in 1967 dated plum heavy profile barrel. Receiver and bolt are captured Soviet, w/ 1936-dated hex receiver showing minor blued over pitting above the stock line - this part would have been salvaged from a dead man's 91/30 during the Winter War. Bolt is ""Finn matched"" to the barrel shank. NEW condition postwar stock with no cracks, dings or plugs, carefully shimmed by the Finns. Late date and no maker on barrel shank makes this a relatively rare example. Comes with a free Finnish leather sling, correct for late-date rifle. Chambered in 7.62x54r. Nice looking gun with an interesting provenance. This is arguably the best variation of the Mosin Nagant in service rifle configuration and certainly the most accurate.

Size Large
 Although it is listed as used there are no rips and or tears. 
(Vest is in mint condition)

The vest features a carrier shell, and three ballistic panel inserts (2 front and 1 back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber.
 These two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant.
 The vest was tested to stop a 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullet at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. 
These soft ballistic panels are size Large, which are installed into their respective pocket on the vest carrier shell.
