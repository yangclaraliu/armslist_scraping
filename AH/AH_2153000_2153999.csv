While Ruger listed this as a varmint model the barrel is only slightly thicker than a medium sporter contour and only 24"" long.  Stiff enough to hold zero for multiple long range shots yet light enough for this short acton rifle to carry like a medium sporter.

Designed in 1953, the Single-Six was Ruger's first revolver, following the initial success in 1949 of Bill Ruger's Mark I semi-auto .22LR pistol. In the decade of the '50s, Westerns were all the rage both in the theater and on the new fangled television. This medium allowed a whole new generation of kids to enjoy the old B westerns of earlier decades.

With that and the subsequent demand for sixguns, Bill Ruger realized that if he could produce a pistol people could afford, he had a sure market. But of course, starting off with a great big .44 special would probably have been a disaster. So he started small and thus we have the Single-Six, now more than 50 years old and still being produced. 

However, while a traditional styled sixgun was the order of the day, Ruger did not simply copy Colt's design of 1873. Instead, he replaced the workings with something a bit more modern and much stronger. In fact, the action is so strong that practically any gunsmith will tell you that they don't have much experience repairing these revolvers (modifying and customizing, yes. Repairing, no.) They simply don't break with any frequency unless they're severely abused. 

The original run of Single-Six production ran from 1953 to 1962 with the early revolvers being offered with two barrel lengths. One interesting aspect of the early production guns is a flat loading gate instead of the contoured shape we normally think of. This was corrected in 1957 as well as the addition of other barrel lengths. Revolvers made during this period are generally refered to as ""Flat Top"" revolvers due to the appearance of the top strap. 

The next production run would last from 1963-1973 with changes in the grip frame, the addition of adjustable sights on some revolvers, and other improvements. Revolvers produced during this period are refered to as the ""Old Model"" while all revolvers made prior to 1973 are frequently known as ""Three Screw"" revolvers for the three screws visible on the frame. 

In 1973, the Single-Six had been in production for 20 years, a decent run by any standard. It is estimated that about 500,000 of these revolvers had been sold at this point. Ruger had produced perhaps one of the most populare sixguns outside of military and law enforcement. But Ruger had also made several advances over those 20 years as well as devloping a means to make their revolvers safer to carry holstered with a full complement of six rounds in the cylinder, at last making six shooters able to safely shoot six. The time was now right for the Single-Six to get an upgrade. In fact, every revolver in the Ruger line up got an upgrade that year, mainly as a result of this innovation.

you know that will all go away when I see the smile on your face when you

action ,went to Proof house dated it at 1957,it is a 9 out of ten easy the 
only flaw is the only other figure he would keep forever and etched very lightly 
I.D. numbers on the barrel and very lightly...then of coarse the old gentleman passed 
and his family sold it to me  therefor don't know how many rounds through it ETC..
I can tell you the in example the cylinder cartridge ports are still tite  enough you have to
push the cartridge down to seat it and when you shoot it there is an even powder film 
and a super light one evenly across the cylinder face ,meaning barrel to cylinder are also matched and tight this gun is very collectable and just keeps appreciating Go ahead book it then call me and buy it as cheap as you likely to find in this condition!"

It's hand forged of good quality carbon steel and has a good edge. This sword is pinned together not threaded, so it will never come apart.

From the manufacturer:

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock,  one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES

- 100% new-production parts and components.
- Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
- Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
- Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
- Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
- Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.)
- Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.
- 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines."

In case you didn't know, Smith & Wesson has issued a major consumer safety alert for **ALL**  M&P Shield Pistols manufactured before August 19, 2013.

Released August 22, 2013, the safety alert identified an issue where the M&P Shield’s trigger bar pin could damage the trigger’s drop safety feature—enabling the pistol to potentially discharge when dropped.

Smith & Wesson **urgently** warns anyone with a Shield to: “STOP USING YOUR PISTOL IMMEDIATELY UNTIL IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND, IF THE CONDITION IS FOUND, REPAIRED.”

This gun of mine for sale was manufactured after the recall as proven by its test firing cartridge dated 8/20/2013.

It is in overall good condition. This is a low number 1903 that has had a hatcher hole added indicating possible USMC use. This is a low numbered receiver, considered by some to be non shooters. From what Ive read online the Marines continued to use low numbered rifles all the way through ww2. This was made in 1917 best I can tell. Finish is mostly patina. The barrel appears to be an Avis dated 10-18. Marking is very faint. I would rate the bore as fair, some light corrosion and looks frosty over all. Not a sewer pipe by any means. The muzzle wear is just over a 2. The stock has been nicely refinished and there is some shine to it. There is a small crack behind the receiver tang. This is some light old pitting on some parts of the receiver.  It is not very noticable. Looks like its been there a long time. No import marks. Please feel free to ask any questions.
FTF on the south side of Indy. Will need to see an Indiana DL, no info will be recorded.

Got it from an LEO and went to the range.It shot five times and then... nothing! In a nutshell: had it worked on by a very good GS--- changed all the springs, FP, etc., etc., but it still doesn't fire. Problem lies in the firing mechanism,most likely.  I can't afford to ship it to Sig for a fix: SO, I'm selling it at a big loss to someone who wants a SIG and who can afford to send it for repair. It has the original hard case, three 17 rd. mags, Sig NS, manual, lock and a brand new Stoner OWB leather holster (made in Hamilton). I have no doubt it will be fixed correctly--- I just can't afford it right now.
FTF, ID, WILL NOT SHIP.

I have 380 rounds of .45acp lead reloads that I acquired in a package deal. They are a Semi-Wad Cutter design (SWC). They are not my reloads and I do not know any information about them like grain, powder, etc. What I do know is that I fired 89 of them with no problems through a full sized 1911. I also fired 21 of them through my Glock 21 Gen 4 and they would cycle the slide properly about half the time. Also tried 10 rounds in an XD and wouldnt cycle in that. They have very low recoil and I assume they were dialed in for the 1911 platform. They should also cycle ok in a gun with a lighter recoil spring than Glock or XD. They were accurate in all guns I used.

Comes with everything you get from the factory.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade, because we cannot examine the firearm before buying it.

I have been thinking about leasing my property for the firearm deer season.
I have 4.5 acres in N.West Jo Davies Co., near Scales Mound.
It is all timber and is surrounded by other timber with farmland nearby.
I have two nice ladder stands already set up with shooting lanes cleared, and there is room for at least one more stand to be placed. 
I know it is short notice but we may be able to discuss bow hunting rights as well.
Please include a name and phone number with your reply, or I probably won't respond."

Colt #184332 was shipped to Simon’s Hardware in St Louis on 15 March 1899. Colt #184354 was shipped to Montgomery Ward in Chicago on 14 March 1899. Legendary founder of the firm that bears his name, John Bianchi, began his business in the mid-1950’s while working as a police officer and this leather rig bearing the stamped serial number “001”, along with his personal autograph confirming the serial number, would date from that period. Both of the pistols, originally supplied by Colt with “blue finish”, would have been engraved, nickel-plated, and fitted with ivory grips about that same time. All metal work on the rig is of the finest Sterling silver and is quite a desirable collector item in and of itself and sure to appreciate in value over the years."
