Very compact but holds 12+1 so plenty of stopping power. Retails for around $850 and this is very gently used.

When you need the most rounds in the smallest package, you need a Para-Ord Hawg (Warthog). The pistol's compact frame makes it easy to carry into any situation, yet the small size won't mean a sacrifice in stopping power. The contoured grip and beavertail grip safety give you control over the pistol, without having to risk hammer bite. Regardless of the situation, you can find the right Para Hawg to back you up.

All Para pistols are shipped with two mags. In the case of the Para PXT Warthogs, there is a bonus on the second mag – it comes with a grip extension. The floor plate on the second magazine adds length to the grip giving you more holding surface and better control, but without altering the capacity of the mag.

Specs: Action : Single. Caliber : 9mm. Barrel Length : 3"". Capacity : 12 + 1. Safety : Grip. Grips : Black Synthetic. Sights : 3-Dot. Weight : 24 oz. Finish : Alloy Regal. # WHX129R."

Hello, today I have for sale a FNH PS90, Law Enforcement Restricted Edition (Including the LE 50 round magazine) & 500 Rounds of Law Enforcement Restricted SS198 Armor Piercing Hollow Point rounds. This gun has never been racked, dry fired/fired, really even touched. Only time the gun was even looked at was when they had to confirm the serial number on the gun. 

I am willing to ship to FFL dealer in another state besides Kansas, as well as meet up, and I also am willing to ship to a residence in Kansas or meet without having to go through an FFL dealer, as long as you vouch you are a lawful citizen that is allowed to possess firearms. 

If your looking at my listing I am guessing you probably don't need to get the run down on a P90, and probably are already in love with the gun. If you have any questions concerning the weapon you can contact me at any time. I have my cell phone listed, text or call is fine as well as responding via email is also okay as well.

The price is 1850 OBO, but understand that this weapon's retail especially for civilian markets and the price this ammo is going for and its rarity, you are looking at a pretty steep discount. 

Though the weapon and rounds are Law Enforcement restricted, that is only for purchase, US Civilians with no affiliation are 100% lawful to own this weapon in 98% of the United States.

Comes with everything I got it with except for the manual.. Don't really need it though it's pretty simple to operate. For those of you who don't know when you lightly press the switch you can hold it and let go to turn it off. If you click it all the way down it stays on. The light also fades on somewhat instead of just popping on immediately.. Giving your eyes a little more time to adjust.

GREAT visibility I can see all the way down my neighborhood street with it. Definitely comes in handy for those ""bump in the night"" situations.

I reluctantly submit this Sig Sauer P226 MK25 for sale. It is the same pistol most often chosen for field use by the U.S. Navy SEALs and other Navy Special Warfare Operations operators.

I have fired no more than 300 rounds through the pistol. It is ridiculously accurate. It fits the hand as though it was custom made for the shooter and this particular pistol has the smoothest slide action I've felt on any factory Sig.

NOTE: Buyer to pay transfer fees (typically $35 total at any Turner's Outdoorsman sporting goods store).

The price is $260 firm for the whole bundle. $130 for just the ammo. $165 for JUST the rifle with scope and sling. $140 for rifle WITHOUT scope and sling. or $260 for all. Your choice. This is the model 64 TR-SR that retails for $335 by itself so to get it with a scope, sling and 1110 in ammo for $260 is a bargain. So do not try to lowball me, my price is firm and this gun is amazing. Only been taken out of box to take a picture for this ad then put right it in.

If you want it call or text me, REDACTED, I can meet in the Las Cruces/El Paso Area. Thanks.

This rifle was designed by bushmaster and Remington for the military and law enforcement as an improvement of the already proven and amazing FNH Scar 16s. And they did improve on the scar. Remington sells this rifle to military an law enforcement only through their sister co. Remington defence. Wile bushmaster sells the same rifle to the civilian market. The only differance is really the fact that the bushmaster is semi automatic only. This rifle is a multi caliber rifle. The whole rifle can be taken down without tools and done so in mins. The barrel can be removed and swapped with a cool one or even changed to a different caliber. The convertion kits when they reliese them will be 300 blackout, 6.8 rem , and 9mm. So this one rifle can fill many different uses with what fits in a small roll that can be fit into a pack with your other gear. And all these calibers use the same mags. So one gun can handle CQB, long range, and stealth. This one is in the fde color and comes with one 30 rd mag and all the items I got from the factory. It also came with flip up Sights and everything is ambi dexterous excep its ejection port. This is a great rifle and has only had a hand full of rounds shot through it. My better half preferred the ar -15 her kids built for her. So we are asking $2650.00 obo. We will concider all serious and reasonable offers."

Have at least $40 worth of ammo. Don't let someone tell you these are junk. It was built in the 1960's, is very tight with zero play,mint finish and like new.

Bought this mint pistol from a retired Marine who thought enough of it to buy it for his wife while he was active. He only fired 3 rounds through it to confirm it operated well, gave it to her and that was it.
