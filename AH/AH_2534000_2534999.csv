This rifle is exactly as I received it from CMP about six months ago - not fielded, not fired, just stored. 

It's a completely refurbished rifle from the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). It has an original M1 Garand Springfield receiver, new production Criterion barrel, and new production American Walnut stock. It is as close to ""new"" as a Garand can be.

The best part, it's a true Garand, but it fires .308. Nice to have common ammo across rifles.

Price is set, please no low offers. And yes! You can buy a Garand directly from CMP for less. After all the paperwork, fees, taxes, FFL hassle, and 4-6 month wait...  you can save $200 or so. Buy this one and have it in your hands 10 days later. (And! price is actually less than if you somehow found one at a local gun store.)

I've probably put around 100 rounds through it, taking it out up to 50 yards. This pistol is crazy accurate and cycles SMOOTH.  I polished and deburred the internals and trigger, brushed the sides of the trigger and hammer, and sanded down the factory grips some to lower profile and increase grip since this was my carry pistol for a while. The trigger is light but crisp, with just enough take up and minimal over travel.  Pistol does show mild wear from carrying and being handled daily but is still clean and feels new.

The XD is in great shape and has been pretty lightly used with only a few hundred rounds through it.  Comes with all the typical XD gear.  XD equivalent to the Glock 19.

I'd like to trade for a pocket sized 9mm.  I'm primarily interested in a Beretta Nano, but might also consider an S&W Shield or XDS 9mm, no Kel Tecs please.  I love the XD line though, so I would also consider an XD9 subcompact or a Glock 26.  Would throw in some extra cash or ammo for a SIG 938.
However, I prefer .40 caliber, so I would also consider mid sized/compact or subcompact guns in .40.  Again, I love the XD line so I'd like an XD40 or XD40 subcompact, but would also consider a Glock 23 or 27.

If you have something in .40 I have 200-300 rounds of assorted 9mm I can swap for .40 or sell for the right price.

This is an awesome baby cannon. I'm not sure exactly how old it is or where is came from. The barrel on this Cannon is about 22"" inches long made from a cast iron barrel with a 11/4"" smooth bore and 20"" inch tall wheels. So its not to big. The Carriage and wheels measure 44"" inches long and about 24"" inches wide. The Carriage is probably made from Locust wood. I'm also including a very nice original 25"" inch 100% bronze/brass ram rod. I've never seen one like it. 
The carriage wheels have ""H105.""  On them & the Wheels spin freely the carriage can be towed by hitch or just pulled out to the field by hand very easily. All bolts are square. All screws are flat. The Barrel swivels nicely up and down on the trunnion’s and the touch-hole for wick is free and clear, leading directly into the chamber. What a great and rare cannon. 
The barrel weighs about 60 lbs. The Carriage also weighs about 60 pounds. So 120 lbs total."

I purchased this firearm for my wife thinking she would like it better than her 9mm Beretta Cougar, I was wrong she prefers the recoil of the 9mm over the .40 so here it is for sale. I have almost 1K into the package after the tax on the ammo and the extra factory magazine I purchased. This has had literally 3 mags down the barrel and then was cleaned extensively then placed in the safe where it has remained. There is not a single blemish in the finish. I carry 1911s and she carries her Beretta so this has never been carried. With it comes the .40 ammo I purchased for it ""250 Rounds"" as well as 2 mags of personal defense ammo which is currently loaded in the magazines. $750 is the price, I will not haggle as this is as close to new as you get without paying retail price+tax, or shipping+FFL transfer not to mention you see what I paid for the ammo as well as the $26 for the extra factory mag. I have the sales receipt as you can see. I paid well over what I am asking, I am looking to sell in order to partially fund an AR build so with that said I am not hard up for cash or looking to lose my rear in a deal any more than I already am.

Only trade I am looking for possibly is for a stripped AR lower, Black Rain, DTI or Spikes preferred no polymer. I will give you retail on your lower but not inflated gouging prices. Lowers are easy to order these days.

Ammo and pistol are a package, I have no other .40 firearms and I am not interested in separating. 

To recap, You get over 250 rounds of ammo, 2 mags, a LNIB Sig P229 .40 and all original paperwork, locks etc for $750.00

I can provide bill of sale, State as well as Military I.D. I will require to see state I.D with no exceptions, CCW preferred. U.S Citizens only, I reserve the right to deny sale."

I have had some work done it as well. I have added a Hogue slip-on rubber grip, a Carver Custom BigMouth magwell, Trijicon night sights(beginning to dim but still useable), and recently had the slide refinished.  The slide was bead blasted to remove original finish and then DuraCoated a clear matte finish to give it a dark, ""battleship grey"".  It has not been fired since the refinishing. There are three(3) thirteen(13) round OEM mags included as well.

This classic firearm is perfect for collectors, recreational shooters, or ""preppers"".

This rifle is in great condition, but it seems to have had the stock repaired by the arsenal, so not all of the numbers match. This is pretty common with these Indian rifles.

It has a very interesting history, but the summary is that the Indians found themselves facing down Chinese AK-47s with only WWII surplus Lee-Enfield rifles. This lead to the Indian government licensing the FAL for their new battle rifle.

Of course, switching factories over to the new rifle takes time, so the Ishapore 2A and 2A1 were designed to bridge between the two rifles. 

The 2A1 has the classic Lee-Enfield look, feel, and action; it uses the same action as the SMLE, and is capable of the same fastest in the world ""mad minute"" volley fire"". 

But, it is chambered in the same 7.62NATO cartridge as the FAL, M14/M1A, AR-10, and other modern battle rifles. Many people also report great success using it with commercial .308 ammunition. Other Enfield rifles shoot the increasingly rare (and expensive) .303 British, but the Ishapore 2A1 will have cheap, available ammo for a long time to come. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the 7.62NATO round is more powerful than the .303!

This rifle is perfect for someone who loves the look and feel of Great War and WWII Enfields, but wants to shoot an updated, modern cartridge.

Features:
* Lee-Enfield bolt-action - The fastest and smoothest of the old bolt actions (can you do this with a Mosin? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFYZHLuxXZ8&html5=1)
* 7.62NATO caliber - Perfect for target shooting, SHTF, or hunting
* 12-Round capacity - More than twice as much as most classic bolt rifles
* Beautiful wood stock - Let's face it, there's something very pleasing about a nice wood rifle.
* Compatible with many aftermarket options - I don't generally hold with ""sporterizing"" neat old guns, but if you want to, there are a number of scope mounts and the like available for this gun. Some don't require making any permanent changes, which is a nice plus.
* Great value - Enfield rifles of all types have been going up in price as supplies dry up. I don't hold with alarmists, but you may look back ten years from now and think about how cheap guns used to be.

I live in Marietta and I work in Alpharetta, so (depending on time of day), I can meet in either location.

If u have any question just ask I didn't get a lot of info on the gun when I traded for it so I'll answer what I can. It had a custom carbon fiber flash suppressor on it that the previous owner had made. But during some spirited shooting the glue got hot and it tilted and I put a round threw it before I noticed it so it will need a flash hider if I haven't bought one by the time it sales. If I get a new flash hider the price will go up to reflect it. The only pic I have right now is from before the flash hider fail I'll get a recent one up asap but u can use your imagination the barrel ends right about where the rail ends. Also comes with a little over 250 rnds of hornady vmax 6.8. Call or text REDACTED

I shoot almost daily and keep most of my ammo for myself and friends. I am not purchasing solely to resell. I don't think any one should by this ammo from me if finances are an issue for them, take the time to find them at Walmart. I am offering these in case anyone does not want to take the time at Walmart and the extra $12 is worth it to them not to have to go to Walmart at 7 in the morning 4 times a week.

 The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:8 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.

Jacketed Hollow Point (1,150fps/M.E. 411 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box","Azusa, California, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 7, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=106

Typical full power 357 magnum loads offer several tactical problems for use in self defense and duty applications, especially when used in the shorter/lighter revolvers that are typical of concealed, defensive and duty carry. First, the muzzle flash can be blinding, especially from short barrels. Second, felt recoil can be a life-threatening drawback if fast follow-up shots are required. Third, the level of report can be deafening and cause permanent hearing loss, especially if fired indoors.

All three Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel loads address the above problems and make the 357 magnum ideal for concealed, defensive and duty carry in smaller revolvers.

Muzzle flash: These exciting new 357 magnum loads utilize a flash suppressed powder that will not blind you, should you need to drop the hammer in a low light situation. It is estimated that over 90% of all defensive civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light-that is when the criminal element is at work. Wouldn't it be horrible if you fired at an assailant, in the dark, to protect your family, only to find that you missed the bad guy and you are now blind due to your own muzzle flash? This is a scenario that has happened many times in the real world with the 357 magnum. Through the use of our non-canister, flash suppressed powder, the tactical problem of blinding muzzle flash is now greatly reduced with Buffalo Bore's new Tactical Short Barrel loads! 

Recoil: Felt recoil is exacerbated by the use of shorter barreled, smaller framed, lighter weight 357 revolvers, typically used for concealed and duty carry. The new Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel 357 loads are not the normal full power ""barn burner"", 357 magnum loads we make and as such, felt recoil is substantially reduced, although they remain very powerful. Hence, deadly, and faster follow-up shots are more possible. 

Your ears: Most folks don't think of the level of ""report"" as being a problem during a life threatening/defensive shooting and that may be correct for the actual moment of conflict. However, to lose some of your hearing for the rest of your life, following the shooting incident, is unnecessary and undesirable. Full power 357 magnum ammunition is deafening, even more so when fired from short barrels and even worse if you are required to shoot from an enclosed area such as a vehicle or indoors. Buffalo Bore's Tactical Short Barrel 357 magnum loads are not as hard on your hearing as full power ammunition. Although the use of hearing protection is still desirable, if possible, when using this ammo. 

For those who wish to carry a 357 magnum revolver for potential ""conflict resolution"", these new Buffalo Bore loads put an end to the ""tactical"" draw backs associated with our regular 357 magnum ammo. These loads are great for use in longer barreled firearms too.

Special Information Note: The below velocities were obtained from my personal, real world, factory stock, over the counter, (NOT TEST BARRELS) 357 magnum, revolvers. Also, note that the 6 inch Python, is considerably slower than the 4 inch S&W. This has nothing to do with barrel length. It is most likely a combination of differences in chamber/throat dimensions, barrel -cylinder gap, barrel internals, and forcing cone dimensions in the Python, versus the S&W. If the Python and the S&W had the same dimensions in their chamber/throats, barrel cylinder gap and forcing cone, the longer barreled Python would give much faster speeds. We have found that all of our Python test revolvers are much slower than our late model S&W revolvers of equal or even shorter barrel length.

We could have reduced the recoil, flash and blast even more by ""watering down"" these loads further than we did, but then you wouldn't have a real 357 magnum in your hands. So we looked for and found a balance between very powerful, fight stopping ammo that recoils and flashes much less than ours and some other makers, full power 357 loads. If we were to ""water down"" this ""Tactical Short Barrel"" 357 ammo any more, we would simply not manufacture it and suggest that you use our 38 SPL+P ammunition.

None of these loads caused crimp/bullet jump (in five shots) in my 12 OZ. Scandium S&W Model 340, but they did generate considerable felt recoil.

Item 19F/20-140gr. (jacketed hollow cavity) @ 1,150 fps from a 2.5 inch barreled S&W mod. 66. Designed to mushroom and penetrate deeply-roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue.
