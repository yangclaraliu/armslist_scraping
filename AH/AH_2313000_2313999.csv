The only powder perfect for the greatest match, varmint and sniper rounds today---223 Remington/ 5.56mm, 308 Win. 7.62 mm, 6mm PPC, 204 Ruger, 6mm BR, 22-250 Remington.   Load density ideal for top performance in cartridges that use this burn speed, like those listed above, i.e. 96 to 103%.  Nothing beats a full case for best accuracy.  

Virtually no change in velocity in temps from -40 degrees F to +165 degrees F a feat no other powder can match.   Meters in ANY powder measure to +/- .1 grain.   Uniformity from shot to shot that translates into tack driving accuracy, cartridge after cartridge, and velocities that equal or exceed all competitive propellants.  Be it Sniper, Varmint or Match competition, IMR 8208 XBR has no equal.  

This powder won the IBS National, Heavy Varmint Aggregate (best combined score) for the 100 and 200-yard competition in 2009.  Because conditions change, bench rest shooters change charge weights during a day’s competition, but at this match the winner, Mr. Jim Carmichael, shot the exact same load both days, at all times, because this powder does not change with the conditions!  So, the load that shot the best when he developed it for that gun/components remained the same throughout the competition.  Advantage IMR 8208 XBR has perfect temperature sensitivity, perfect burn rate, perfect loading density, perfect metering,  and perfect uniformity/accuracy."

It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet."

This AR15 has been built with a Sun Devil billet lower receiver and Bushmaster 450 Cal
Upper with 16in barrel and M4 feed port profile. The lower receiver was milled out of a solid piece of billet aluminum right here in Mesa, AZ and was chosen for superior strength and durability. Link: http://www.sundevilmfg.com/products.php

If you haven't heard about the 450 Bushmaster then you owe it to your self to research this large caliber in a AR-15 platform. This is the rifle used for most large hog and ferrel pig hunts all over the mid-west. 

Less than 20 rounds fired with the barrel cleaned between rounds. Gun shot just enough to sight in iron sights.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

ACCURATE SIGHTING SYSTEM features precision-adjustable rear, fixed front sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver®-style scope base adapters (included) for easy mounting of optics.
COMFORTABLE, PRECISION-MOLDED ZYTEL® POLYMER GRIP FRAME with a serrated front strap and backstrap.
Replaceable Grip Panel: this model features replaceable, checkered, cocobolo, 1911-style grip panels for a great appearance and
comfortable, non-slip hold.
INTERNAL CYLINDRICAL BOLT CONSTRUCTION ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than
conventional moving-slide designs.
MANUAL SAFETY positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in
the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
PATENTED LOADED CHAMBER INDICATOR provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
MAGAZINE DISCONNECT prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
ALSO INCLUDES: bull barrel, contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, a conveniently located push button
magazine release on the left side of the frame, two magazines and hard plastic case.

246,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2313246,For Trade:  Like New Barrnett Vengeance Crossbow,"Karns, Knoxville, Tennessee",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, December 16, 2013",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Barnett Vengeance
 Just in time for bow season!!!


Personifying a steely resolve and determination, the new Barnett Vengeance crossbow is aptly named. The Barnett Vengeance represents a quantum leap in crossbow evolution. It is the first crossbow to combine a lightweight CarbonLite Riser with reverse draw technology. As a result, the Vengeance exhibits significantly less vibration and noise than a traditional draw crossbow without sacrificing speed or accuracy.

In this radical new reverse draw configuration, the limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter’s body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well-balanced shot.

In addition, the Vengeance features a CarbonLite Riser assembly, which further reduces the weight without compromising strength or accuracy. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow, the CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43 percent of weight from the front end, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible.

Like all other Barnett Crossbows, the Vengeance is proudly made in the USA.

Specs:

Speed: 365 fps.
Draw Weight: 140 pounds.
Power Stroke: 18 inches.
From its inception, over a half century ago, Barnett Crossbows has led the industry with pioneering innovations and patents to become the world’s number one manufacturer of crossbows. Barnett’s engineers have created its latest range of crossbows based on the changing needs and desires of today’s hunters. Lightweight, adjustable and powerful, Barnett has brought crossbow technology to the height it stands at today. Barnett is committed to delivering high quality performance products with unparalleled service and value for all that use the Barnett Range. Built for maximum speed, efficiency and Built for the Hunt!"

* How it works*
It is an upper receiver and uses the lower of an AR15 for trigger/hammer/etc. The bolt comes back through the stock. It's single fed. I had an m16A2 stock but the recoil was too great. I switched it out for a higher end and the recoil is almost comparable to a .308"

(Not the S.G.). They took over production when the government shut down Irwin Pederson. Early serial number, typical govt rebuild with some S' G' parts. Winchestor stock with rebuild cartouches. Non-Import, purchased by me as CMP Service Grade, their highest grade for barrel condition and overall condition. A nice restoration candidate, or leave as is. Very collectible and will only rise in value. Priced accordingly, as this is not an Inland, Standard Products or other maker.Barrel is Underwood, 5-?? (Year is unreadable, common for Underwood). Ordnance bomb is under date. Please note that Saginaw did not make their own barrels, and that this barrel is correct for this carbine.

Serial # is 180xxxx.

Manufacturer name is at rear of receiver, with serial #. There are no sub-contractor marks.

I dont see any markings on bolt, didnt know there were any by manufacturer, other than the Win punch mark. I will look at trigger group later, but I doubt it is S'G' or IP.

Not an import.

Stock has a W and a Ordnance bomb mark in the slingwell.

Has RRA and RIA/EB rebuild marks on left side.

There is a non-serifed 'P' in a circle on the wrist. Directly above that is a non-serifed 'P' in a box.

Every single carbine you find in ""original"" condition is rebuilt/restored, unless it was sold by the old DCM and there are papers to prove it, and many of those were in fact rebuilt.There have been some appear on CMP auction from what I understand as well. However, the majority of ""correct"" carbines use mix-matched parts, or reproduction parts that are junk.
 The only other way an original carbine exists is for a GI from years ago to have stolen it from the government. There were no ""bringbacks"" of US weapons. If he brought it home, he stole it, period. Every other one was rebuilt, most of them several times over, and constantly upgraded by unit and post level armorers. Yes, it has a flat bolt and a four handguard, as most of the two rivet ones would break, hence the upgrade to the four rivet.

No mags for sale. Stay away from most USGI 30 rounders, as the springs are worn and they do not feed. Test any and all you plan to use, and you will find the failure rate on those is high. Numrich/Sarco used to have rebuild kits for them and then they work fine if the bodies are in good repair.

Other than the IP this is the rarest of the carbines.

Not sure who flagged this when I posted it before, but I would appreciate it if you would not take this down as it is not a scam. If you do not like the price, dont buy it. Have the courtesy of emailing me and asking questions rather than identifying this for flagging. This is a real M1 Carbine, for sale by a real person.
Thank you."

The PM5 is an uncommon design because it uses a detachable seven round box magazine, and was available with either a Monte Carlo style fixed stock, a fixed pistol grip stock, or a skeleton wire frame stock that doubles as a carry handle when folded. The rear folding stock assembly can be easily removed by extracting a single pin resulting in a pistol grip only configuration. The Valtro is reported to be one of the most reliable and fastest cycling pump shotguns available, and the detachable box magazine is an excellent feature; resulting in faster full reload times and better balance since the ammo load is directly under the receiver instead of forward under the barrel.

This is the Marine rated grey finish version, NOT the standard black matte anodized that is much more common.

Basic features include:

18.5” barrel (later models had 20” with available porting)

3” chamber (will fit 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells)

Threaded for choke tubes (cylinder choke included, uses Benelli tubes)

Alloy receiver with Marine rated finish

7 round detachable box magazine (+1 in chamber)

This early version weapon is in very good cosmetic condition except for a few scuffs around the magazine well and some rub marks on the upper left receiver, likely from a sling swivel (some “touch-up” has been applied at some point). It is not a “safe queen” but it is not a “range rat” either and is offered in AS-IS but in fully functional condition. The set includes everything pictured, a Valtro PM5 shotgun, the factory fixed pistol grip stock, the factory folding pistol grip stock, and TWO functional factory seven round magazines.

In addition to the extra magazine, this weapon also comes with a vented steel barrel shroud installed as well as a specially customized  M4 style collapsible stock and pistol grip assembly unavailable anywhere else. The adapter is composite, the mount is anodized aluminum (NOT plastic), the buffer tube is five position adjustable, includes a basic A2 grip and stock with removable buffer pad. This assembly will allow the installation of ANY available M16/AR-15 grip or stock on the market!

$1000 or best offer, please feel free to ask questions, and thank you for your interest.

130 rounds of ammo included:  30 rds of Hornady low recoil jhp, and 100 rds Federal red box soft point.

Very accurate, perfect 3"" barrel, magna-ported and protected recessed crown.  This revolver shoots 4 different .32 cartridges:  .327 magnum; .32 H&R magnum; .32 long; 32 short,...so a very wide variety for defense, hunting, range/practice.


Rare, future collector's model S&W Pro revolver.  Very versatile: carry, home, vehicle, range/target/practice, female/new shooters....

It may make a good project gun for someone, also the front sight looks like it has white out or white nail polish, I think it will remove with a little effort.
This is FTF in Indy, if this ad is up, then yes it is available.
