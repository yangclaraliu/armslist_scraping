MARK 23
The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

In an emergency, your hands are the first tool you will use! Think of all the things you can come in contact with in an emergency, broken glass, twisted steel, splintered wood, hot surfaces.

Features include padded leather palms and rubber finger and knuckle guards on the top. They will keep your hands scratch and cut free! They make awesome shooting gloves. No more cold, numb fingers getting scraped and cut! These also make excellent work gloves too! I have all sizes. Payment through PayPal is fast and secure. Shipping is FREE!!! Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

-My brother informed me that your gloves held up in combat without any glitches. I guess you can say combat proven. Thanks again."

The only makers mark is a CA. It is on the right side of the blade just at the hilt.
These swords were issued by Italy up to the start of WWII.
Also known as a Hussars or Briquet sword. It is a French pattern 1816 sword.
There is some rust spots on the blade but, it is in good shape.
The unsharpened blade is 23.5"" long and the overall length with scabbard is 29.75""

The Brass hilt and brass on the scabbard have some tarnish.

I've tried to do my homework on these but take any information provided with a grain of salt, I am not an expert.
Both swords were war trophies along with several firearms from a WWII veteran who recently passed away.
I've shown both sword to military collectors in the area. About the only thing they can agree on is the top sword is Imperial German.

Not looking for any trades, but I will deal if you want to purchase both swords and the bayonet.

In an emergency, your hands are the first tool you will use! Think of all the things you can come in contact with in an emergency, broken glass, twisted steel, splintered wood, hot surfaces. The list has no end! You may be tough, but an infected cut can be disastrous when there are no hospitals to go to! Buy a pair today and be ready when the SHTF. These are brand new first quality. Features include padded leather palms and rubber finger and knuckle guards on the top. They will keep your hands scratch and cut free! They make awesome shooting gloves. No more cold, numb fingers getting scraped and cut! These also make excellent work gloves too! I have all sizes. Payment through PayPal is fast and secure. Shipping is FREE!!! Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

-My brother informed me that your gloves held up in combat without any glitches. I guess you can say combat proven. Thanks again."

$2550.00 or more worth of parts for the Springfield M1903A3. All USGI. Some New Old Stock, (NOS), still new in the wrapper. Only repro item is a M1903 sight hood. Some Smith Corona parts, as evidenced by markings, and lack of markings. No wood, receivers, barrels or triggerguards, but lots of the rest.  Can help you finish out many M1903A3s. Found it as a horde of parts several years ago at a small show in the UP of Michigan. You just don't find large lots of original USGI parts for US martial firearms like this anymore. I am only wanting about a third of the retail cost of these, as some of the bands may require refinishing, and some of the screw heads, etc.,  are not pristine.None of the screw threads are buggered.  Many of the screws and other bits are near NOS, though. I can provide more pictures.
I will sell for $1150.00 OBO. Will consider trade for M1 rifle, m1 carbine, AR-15 such as the Colt 6920 or an older SP1, Windham Weaponry, Bushmaster, etc.

At the same time, we need to practice our shooting - versus sticking a gun in our pocket and hoping we will use it correctly.  

Meanwhile, you do not need to waste your time contacting me and telling me the price is too high!  This is what I have into it; if with shipping and/or tax, you can get this exact same ammo more cheaply, then please, just go and do that!

I'd like to also sell my NIB enhanced version Ruger LCP along with the ammo described below as a package, but I am willing to split it up.  It will be $225 for just the ammo, $295 for just the gun and $475 now, if you buy both.  Again, that pricing is firm.  

I am including 250 rounds of Federal 95 grain .380 target ammo and 125 rounds of THE BEST short-barrel SD ammo.  100 rounds of Precision One HP/XTP and 25 rounds of Fiocchi Extrema HP/XTP, ranked #1 and #2 for the combination of penetration and expansion.

Go to http://shootingthebull.net/blog/final-results-of-the-380-acp-ammo-quest/ to see the story and video.

You will learn about the testing done on a variety of commonly manufactured .380 ammo.  The usual suspects, like Hornady Critical Defense and Federal Hydra-Shok did not do nearly as well as the ammo noted above that scored the best.  I will sell the ammo as a package, not going to break it up.  

If this stuff does not sell in the next ten days, I'll pull the ad and keep the stuff."

When nature’s toughest predators become your prey, you can trust the lightweight T/C Venture Predator to give you the concealment, ruggedness, and accuracy you need to make the perfect shot. The T/C Venture Predator rifle is available in Realtree® Advantage HD Max-1® and features T/C’s MOA accuracy guarantee. 

The Venture Predator is a convenient “walking varminter” size, weighing in at an easy-to-carry 6.75 pounds. 

On a predator hunt, where a quick follow-up shot may be required, you can’t afford a difficult bolt that could cause a missed opportunity. The corrosion resistant-coated bolt on the Venture rifle doesn’t require a break in period and always has a smooth action. 

T/C’s 5R rifling delivers superior accuracy by causing less bullet deformation, giving greater bullet stability over multiple shots. 

With an MOA accuracy guarantee, your Venture Predator is ready to take on predators from a distance.

It is a low production M39 that does not come up for sale very often due to there rarity and condition.

Bolt is clearly stamped and numbers matching on the cocking knob, the floor-plate and butt-plate are unumbered as is correct.

The stock is a nice Sako, wartime, rounded finger joint, example that has been recycled by the ""Finn's"" and has it's original stock shims as it was setup by the Finnish armory.

This rifle also has a bright and shiny bore and should be an excellent shooter however I personally haven't shot it so I can only judge by condition. 

The overall pic.s really did not do it justice so I have included a couple of closeup condition pic.s.

If your into vintage rifle matches might be ideal for you.

Gun shoots absolutely fantastic, but I find myself preferring to shoot my USP 45's before I shoot this, so it's a bit redundant in my collection is all. I'm open to all sorts of trades, just has to be the right trade, so feel free to make an offer, the worst I'll say is no.

*NOTE*
The gun is not worn, the slide was oiled and the sun was directly shining on it for the photos. I am not interested in consumer goods unless it's coming with a fairly substantial amount of money, nor am I particularly interested in cheaper firearms without a fair sum of cash on top. 

*NOTE #2* 
Please only offer on the firearm if you actually plan to follow through with a deal, I've had a few people completely flake out on me now, and it's rather annoying when I waste my time and my FFL's getting things set up."

Browning was hand fitting these A5 during that time, with all parts matched, numbered and hand polished to the specific receiver. In addition, this gun has been stocked with a most stunning piece of French walnut, expertly shaped, fitted, checkered and finished. It was made to be EXACTLY like the original, except for the factory Browning marked recoil pad. There is one tiniest of blemishes on the forend, and some minor gold plating wear, off of the trigger and safety. The barrel is 26 inch vent rib with unaltered Imp Cyl choke with matching numbers.

I purchased the kit last winter in order to get started with the hobby of reloading, but have re-enrolled in school, and simply do not have time to pursue this hobby.  The complete kit came with the single-stage Rock Chucker press, Uniflow powder measure, powder scale, Speer reloading manual, and hand priming tool. These are some (but not all) of the following accessories accompanying the purchase: 

Three RCBS Tungsten Carbide die sets complete with case holders (.38 Special/.357 Mag, .40S&W, and .45 ACP/GAP) 

Vibratory tumbler along with corncob polishing media and Dillon case polish

Large assortment of brass, including an entire 5 gallon bucket of once fired .40S&W and gallon containers of .45 ACP and .38 Special

Hundreds of projectiles including jacketed .45 ACP and .40 S&W, as well as cast .38 Special 

Hundreds of small pistol and large pistol primers to accompany any standard handgun case

Large assortment of reloading trays and bullet cases for various handgun calibers 

RCBS inertial bullet puller

This is truly everything someone would need to break into the world of reloading.  I am looking to sell this as a complete set. I have well over $1000 invested in my equipment and think that the price I am asking is quite reasonable. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions, or call at (three one four) four four three- three seven six zero.
