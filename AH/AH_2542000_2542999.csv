Few random minor dents and dings, nothing major and is still a decent looking truck. She runs and drives well, with 2 exceptions. The water pump started leaking, so I am replacing that tomorrow. The other is the lower ballpoints on the front are needing replaced, they are worn out. I do not have time to replace them right now, so I have priced the truck accordingly to allow you to have them replaced. There is no rear bumper, has a hitch on the rear. Interior cleans up, but has some staining in the seats/carpet and a few minor seam separations on the drivers seat.

The lower is a Centurion Sporter 15 and the upper is a CH stamped (Colt Harvey) receiver. The bolt and the lower make it a semi auto shooter only. The information I have been able to gather is that the upper was originally mated to an M-16 lower. Apparently the upper was sold in the civilian market and the original bolt and carrier were replaced with semi auto guts. The stock is a Magpul Adjustable Precision Stock($260 retail) and the rifle has a Nikon Prostaff scope($150 retail) along with a rifle length Daniel Defense free float hand guard ($235 retail). The grip is the rubber Hogue grip and the folding bipod is of heavy duty steel. The rifle shoots great and has been well cared for. I got the rifle used so I do not know how many rounds have been shot through it. Examples of these rifles without the accessories are going for around $1900-$2000, do the math and you see that the listed price is well worth it.  Should there be any questions feel free to call Kevin at REDACTED or send me a text or email. I am in need of a M4 type rifle or a bullpup type rifle that I can deploy in a quick tactical situation. With that said I would be interested in trading for a rifle in that category. I am also open to mutliple gun trades or trades with cash. Thanks."

I bought this from PSA last year. It has been mounted to a lower for 2 months and has 100 to 120 flawless shots down the tube. I shot it once and cleaned it once. No rust or anything just like the day I got it. It will come in the original PSA box. Message me to set something up. This is built with the most desirable features for an AR; chambered in 5.56 (so you can shoot 5.56 or .223 ammo); it has 1 in 7” twist rate, a 13.5” rail, mid-length gas system, and a premium chrome-lined F&N barrel. If you are not familiar with F&N they make barrels for our military! Very high quality upper!

This has been sold out on their site since I ordered it last May and waited a month to get it. $ave $ome buck$ and get it now for only $550! Selling because I ordered a 14” PSA. I really like their stuff and I know you will too. The slim rail feels great, finish your build with this beauty today! 

Only The Upper Is For Sale. No Other Parts, please don't contact to ask what else I have to sell because I am only selling the upper assembly. The bottom 2 pictures are the upper mounted on my lower/stock none of which are for sale or included.

EXPLANATION OF CHOSEN PARTS: starting from the back to the front of the gun. i chose the CTR stock because it is a battle proven weapon and has a lock on it to prevent it from wiggling, on the ctr stock is a LaRue RISR and LaRue POD (read below for abbreviation meaning). the RISR helps aid in accuracy by putting the face in a higher height of position perfectly aligning it with your sights, it also is retractible meaning when you pull back the charging handle the RISR moves back and snaps back into its original position keeping your charging motions fluent instead of backing off the stock and backing it forward to charge your gun like all other cheek risers. the LaRue POD was picked for when shooting in prone position, you can let the back of the gun rest evenly on the ground to enhance accuracy. the enhance magpul butt-pad also reduces recoil enhance accuracy yet again. inside the BCM buffer tube is a blue springco spring and spikes tactical st-t2 heavy buffer, after some research the st-t2 buffer would be perfect fitting for the 14.5 noveske barrel, i chose springco springs because they are the best and most likely last over 10,000 rounds with no fatigue, but I'm excessive and bought 4 one for the gun and 3 extra (2 blue, 2 white). noveske QD endplate to go with the tactical link sling. magpul MOE+ grip cause it it rubberized for better grip, lightweight, and has storage capacity. Bad-Ass selector switch for its durability and styling. yankee hill machine pivot pins for quick easy access to the internals. geissele super dynamic combat trigger cause its accuracy is crisp and superb for a combat effective weapon. holding the geissele trigger in place is some ins ten 2 anti rotational pins obviously to prevent the trigger pins from walking out. a wmd nickel-boron full auto bolt carrier group for its easy cleaning, self lubricating, and smooth action. rainier arms raptor charging handle for it ambidextrous properties. seekins precision bolt catch and mag release for their textured grip and styling, and norgon ambi-catch mag release on opposite side. as you can see i tried to put as many ambidextrous parts on the gun as i could for that possible moment your primary arm is injured and unusable. pmags were chosen mail for there lightweight but the durability of them is uncompromising. the reason i chose the seekins precision SAR 12"" rail over the noveske NSR is plainly because the NSR can not take tough abuse and needs key mod picatinny mounts for items(lights,grips,lasers,etc..), attachments can be put wherever whenever on the SAR without having to unscrew any key mod attachments. noveske barrel for accuracy in shorter barrels, 14.5 because its the perfect size for the guns intentions. rainier arms low profile match grade gas block for its match grade qualities and its .005 larger for better fitment on match grade barrels. the AAC blackout 51t flash hider (pinned and welded) was chosen for toughness and suppressor ready capability which i thought was perfect cause it can't be removed anyway, giving you the option to add a suppressor in the future if you wish to do so. finally the pelican case simply cause they're the best, i also left the top area of the foam uncut for when iron sights or/and a scope is added"

It exhibits high-hardness that is approved for use within the Department of the Army and is available for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense. The high hardness properties of MIL-A-46100E provide for excellent resistance to penetration. This steel was developed specifically for military ballistic threats in personnel carriers, tanks, buildings, and anything else that requires protection against high velocity projectiles. This steel far outperforms AR500, which was developed for abrasion resistance and was never meant for ballistics. There is a reason the military developed this steel to use to protect our troops."

The most comparable model is this gun that they make in taurus is a five shot stainless gun that retails for 500. This one is a six, compensated , and high polished. My best estimate of an original msrp  new is 550-625. If you were to find this in a store for say 550 plus backround check and tax would be 592.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

 Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 1911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semi automatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappa alloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

E-RPC, LLC, is proud to introduce the REMINGTON MODEL 1911 R1 CENTENNIAL. The opportunity to own a commemorative pistol of this quality is rare and this model will only be available for a limited time. Since its adoption by the US Army on March 29, 1911, the M1911 pistol design has proven timeless.

In 2010, more than 90 years later, E-RPC, LLC re-introduced the Remington Model 1911 R1 pistol to a new generation of handgun enthusiasts and collectors.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

At the base of the mountain, 4 acres is maintained by a local farmer and functions as an excellent food plot for hunting. The mountain has several old logging roads which are well maintained and allow accesses to the majority of the mountain for hunting. Established ladder and permanent tree stands will remain with the property. There is a large sportsman's condo located at the base of the mountain overlooking the fields which will also stay. The field is surrounded by apple trees, sawtooth oaks, persimmon and chestnut trees. The property is currently enrolled in the clean and green program keeping taxes to the minimum.

This property is surveyed and we have up to date tax maps. The property is also well posted.

Our family has hunted this property for the last 10 years and have been very successful at harvesting deer, bear and turkey. We have also seen coyote, fox, bobcat, grouse, black squirrel. Lots of ducks use the creek as a flyway. We have even seen bald eagles and osprey who nest nearby.

5.56 AR Performance Barrel,  16 inches long and:

Is a mid weight at 2 pounds 2 ounces.  It has a heavier SOCOM profile similar to the military replacement of the M4 barrel.

Is made of 4150 11595-e alloy, milspec CMV, nitro-carburized (QPQ Melonite) treated barrels which have been shown to last much longer than chrome lined barrels. Melonite gives a very hard surface treatment allowing you to shoot steel cased ammo or any 5.56/.223 ammo.

Has a 1 in 8 twist ratio to handle all but the heaviest 90 grain bullets.

Uses hybrid 5R rifling which means 5 lands and 5 grooves instead of the traditional 6. The sides of each land are cut at a proprietary (hybrid) angle versus the usual 90 degrees. This results in less bullet jacket deformation and when the bullet jacket is less deformed there will be less jacket fouling in the grooves. You get tighter groups, greater bullet stability over multiple shots, and a rifle barrel that’s easier to clean.

Has a mid length gas system allowing more time for the pressure in the chamber to lower (the shell will have more time to contract), making extraction easier, which means less stress on the bolt, carrier and extractor.  The extractor may be the single most broken part; if the extractor breaks the rifle stops running. The mid length gas system also softens the recoil impulse felt by the operator.

Has a .223 wylde chamber; shoot .223 or 5.56 NATO including steel cased ammo.

All barrels have M4 feed ramps and use a .750 gas block.

NOTICE*** THIS BARREL HAS 5/8-24 threads to keep the bore at the muzzle from swelling like most barrels threaded 1/2-28. The tighter bore at the crown gives better accuracy. Do not use Armalite 308 crush washers, YHM or DPMS 5/8 or 308 crush washers work better.

As the title states, I'm looking to purchase a converted saiga AK-- preferably lightly used but I'll look at new rifles as well of course. I'm most interested in those which have already had the front end converted though it isn't an absolute necessity. I'm specifically looking for the 7.62x39 variety unless you are also offering a good deal on mags and ammo for an ak74  (No .223 please!!) to get me started.

I'm not looking for a tacti-cool or ""tricked/pimped out"" AK--the more bare bones, the more I can customize it to my own preferences and thus, the better (less is more!). Please be reasonable with your asking prices... I don't want to pay for accessories I don't need and I don't wish to pay full price for a used firearm. 

With that out of the way, please don't hesitate to send me your offers. Thanks for reading!
