As you can see by the pictures, it does have some use wear but this scope is a tank!  It was designed to withstand the rigors of the modern day battlefield and it has held up very well with U.S. soldiers and special forces.  Another plus is the lifetime warranty that comes with U.S. Optics scopes, regardless of whether or not you are the original owner.  I cannot say enough good things about this scope.

The U.S. Optics SN-4s is a terrific choice to mount on an AR-15 or similar semi-automatic rifle (will not mount on a FNH Scar 16s).  At 1x magnification, the user can shoot with both eyes open at point blank range and at the maximum 4x magnification, the user can rely upon precision shot placement at much longer ranges.  The fully multi-coated Schott glass lenses allow full transmission of 94.6% of available light, which when paired with the red illuminated reticle, makes them ideal for use from dawn until dusk.  The illuminated reticle is also adjustable via an 11 position rheostat to allow the user to adjust intensity.  Windage and elevation knobs are U.S. #1 5/8 MOA Slimline which are finger adjustable to allow for quick adjustments whenever the need arises.  Each U.S. Optics Rifle Scope is hand-built by one person to ensure that the utmost care is taken in producing a quality scope.

The bike is in good shape as far as the body goes. There are scratches on the fairings and a small repainted dent in the gas tank, but nothing major. As far as the internals of the bike go, it is in great shape. I bought the bike in late 2011. Did a little work on it, and pretty much rode it about 1500 miles. It has had a brand new rear tire, new rear brakes, the clutch was replaced and the engine tuned in July, and all the fluids done then as well. Currently, the bike is housed indoors, and needs a new battery and windshield. I am posting it without these things fixed simply hoping for a quick sale. As soon as I return home, I am going to post pics and a listing on Theoutdoorstrader.com; and a link to this posting. I have 100% positive feedback on that forum for my other transactions and want that to reflect in what I am relaying about the bike. I am the owner with title in hand. Id like a partial trade on a Glock 36, 26, 27, or 29sf. Please feel free to email with questions.

The only part of the gun that needs to be purchased prior to October 1st is the lower receiver with the serial number. Will provide a purchase order if desired. AR-15s will be banned in Maryland after October 1st, but if you have paid for and completed Maryland State Police's 77R regulated firearms transfer/registration paperwork before the ban date, you may take delivery of the rifle after the ban date without any additional paperwork.

YOU DO NOT NEED THE NEW HANDGUN QUALIFICATION LICENSE in order to receive a RIFLE receiver after the ban date. The final date to sign for a pistol is Monday, September 23rd, but the final date to sign for a rifle is the 30th of September. Delivery of rifles and rifle receivers can be any date after the ban date as long as you have proof of purchase prior to October 1st. (can I make it any clearer?)

The remainder of the parts can be ordered and assembled at your leisure in the comfort of your home, so long as your gun meets the specifications set forth in the new law. It must be over 29"" in overall length with the butt stock fully extended, and it must NOT possess ANY TWO of the following features: 1) folding stock, 2) grenade launcher, 3) flash hider. It is up to the end user to be compliant with the new law. I assume no responsibility for what you decide to build

Stripped Palmetto State Armory AR-15 receiver is $300. For an additional cost, I can complete the lower receiver with whatever parts you want. I even have two 30rd Magpul PMag repair/rebuild kits available for sale if you need magazines. These will only be for sale to whomever buys the receiver. Contact me for details on additional costs for completing the receiver and/or buying the magazine rebuild kits.

Buyer pays $10 personal check or money order to Maryland State Police for paperwork costs. Must have current/valid Maryland driver's license and safety certification from www.mdgunsafety.com (or current/retired police/military credentials). Buyer must not have received a regulated firearm in Maryland within the last 30 days without a designated collectors license.

RPGs, with the exception of self-contained versions, are loaded from the muzzle. RPGs with HEAT warheads are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs).

This is a very durable, reliable, comfortable, and accurate 9mm semi automatic handgun.  I encourage you to check out some reviews.

The price of the gun, magazines, speed loader, case, and ammo is $420.  I believe that any knowledgeable and reasonable person would agree that this is a fair price and hereâs why: 
-  The average used price of the gun, magazines, speed loader, and case is $350.
 -  9mm ammo is difficult to find right now, and if you can find it, itâs overpriced.  Iâm  asking $70 for 177 rounds.  Thatâs $0.40 per round.  Canât beat that with a stick!
-  So, $350 + $70 = $420 = a fair price.

Trades:  Sub-compact 40.  

Below is a list of Probably Gonna Ask Questions (PGAQ) that I have answered to help save time, yours and mine:
Q:   If itâs so great, why do you want to sell or trade it?
A:   Not that itâs relevant, or should be relevant to your decision process, but I need (actually want) a sub-compact.  The P95 is a full-size.  
Q:   I live in another state and would REALLY like to own this fine weapon.  Will you ship it?
A:   Nope.  Local buyers only.
Q:   Why do you want a sub-compact?  I have a really nice Norinco that slides right down my pant leg and is hardly noticeable.  You interested?
A:   No, idiot!
Q:   Will you take $300 cash?
A:   Again, idiot!  As if the magical âcashâ term at the end would make me want to accept less.  How else would you pay, in chickens?
Q:   I have 28 Rhode Island Reds I might be interested in trading for the Ruger.
A:   No thank you.  Please see the trades section, above.

In summary, if youâre willing to offer $420 âcashâ or a sub-compact 40 for this Ruger P95, please contact me by email.  Otherwise, please donât.

There are some minor scratches along the slide and on the front of the trigger guard where you insert the shells. I have used this gun only for trap / clay shooting so it is in good shape. The choke is not adjustable or interchangeable. It has a simple bead front sight.

Two shotguns for $225? Yep. I will require a FOID card and a signed bill of sale or I can send them to an authorized gun dealer (you will have to pay actual shipping costs and any costs accrued by the transfer)."

This bow is unusual in that it has a aluminum arrow rest assembly that is machined to accept the two arrow guide strips that form a slot to accept the fin adapters and arrow. The string of the bow travels down the center of the rest. Also attached to the rest is an arrow holding spring to keep the arrow in place at all times before the shot. The release is a dual caliper model with a pistol grip handle and trigger. When the bow is drawn the release, rest, string and arrow are all in equal motion. At release only the string and arrow move forward. The rest is mounted to the bow using an aluminum fixture equipped with five rollers. These rollers allow the rest to be drawn with no noise. The attachment fixture is also hinged to allow the bow to be placed in the stored/resting position.

I am asking $150 obo or possible trade. Things I am interested in tradjng toward are a TC Pro Hunter or a semi-auto turkey gun, but I will consider all offers.

777,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2142777,For Sale:  NEW Magpul M3 Windowed PMags FREE SHIPPING,"Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 17,"Listed On: Thursday, April 24, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non ColtÂ®-spec platforms such as the HKÂ® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FNÂ® SCARâ¢ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevelâ¢ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

Made in U.S.A.

The first buyer fell through and I was attempting to sell a package deal. Instead, everyone emailed me about specific pieces of the package. So, I am now breaking it all up. This is a 7.62x39 YUGO SKS CAI Import from Serbia. Upon a little research, I found out that the reason it would only fire bolt action is because of the gas valve is set in the ""grenade"" position. I located the valve, but like most of these imports, I can't get it to move. The button pushes in smoothly with no crunching sound, and it even moves a little. I just don't want to use an persuasion as I am trying to sell it. Other than that, the rifle is in pristine condition. It comes with 1 30rnd metal magazine, 1 20 rnd metal mag, the original 10 rnd box mag, a trigger lock and 20 rounds of 7.62 Herters ammunition. I live in Monroe so here's my limits: I will travel East as far as Startup, West to Everett, South to Lynnwood or North to Lake Stevens/ Marysville.

When we set out to design a watch we wanted one that would truly serve the needs of law enforcement and military professionals. The Field Ops watch has all of the features needed for day to day activities and includes our revolutionary SureShotÂ® calculator. In a partnership with Horus Vision, makers of proven long-range ballistic software, we bring sophisticated point of impact software to your wrist. We give you the ability to input thirteen critical variables needed for long range shooting solutions quickly and easily. Our shooting solutions are provided in Mils, True Minute of Angle (TMOA) and Shooterâs Minute of Angle (SMOA). And thatâs not all, this rugged watch can take a real beating. Weâve beefed up the Field Ops Watch pins to stand the strain of a wrestling match, sealed the watch for 100 meters of water resistance and given you a switchable backlight so you can see your data when you need it and turn the light off when you dont. This great looking timepiece is perfect for any activity.
Functionality
The Field Ops Watch has all the features youâll need for work and play. Weâve included digital day and date, and two digital time zones. Along with an audible alarm, there is an hourly chime, a countdown, timer and you can check your lap times with a digital chronograph. Weâve included an omni-directional bezel along with a backlight. The Field Ops Watch also has a fully functional digital compass which can be adjusted for true north readings. And last but not least, weâve given you a full function ballistic calculator. The SureShotÂ® calculator accepts thirteen critical shooting variables to give you point of impact shooting solutions out to 1000 meters. Input your known ballistic data (bore height, ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity and zero range), then add your environmental data (range, temperature, altitude, inclination) and the SureShotÂ® calculator will give you a shooting solution in MILS, TMOA or SMOA. You can even get your solution in clicks for both windage and elevation. The calculator is very easy to use and most of the variables can be put into the Field Ops Watch before going out to the field. This full function time piece is unique in the world of watches.
Durability
The Field Ops Watch has a high-density polycarbonate case which is lightweight and tough. The mineral glass crystal face is scratch resistant and reduces glare. Weâve beefed up the watch pins to secure the watch to your wrist in even the most arduous activities.
Fit
Weâve included an extended length band so that you can wear your watch over outerwear or a glove. That way your SureShotÂ® is available anytime you need it.
Value
The Field Ops sports a digital compass and a variety of timekeeping features that give you an outstanding watch, plus our proprietary ballistic calculator software, all in a package that looks great and works hard."
