Bought this as my backup gun for IDPA (International Defensive Pistol Association) shooting.   Shooting this in matches feels like cheating, so I am competing with my G19s instead.  Comes with everything you see here (i.e. gun, 3 mags, mag loader, box, user manual and back straps). Total round count is <500.  All Austria parts.  It is in mint condition and has no marks on it.
G34 is very accurate, has a great trigger and is a soft shooter. It is the ultimate gun for shooting production class competition in IDPA, IPSC or USPSA. It also would make a tremendous home defense gun that you never intended to carry due to the high capacity and the ease of shooting it well.  You can buy an aftermarket barrel, extractor and ejector and convert this to 40 S&W if you want—it is the same thing as a G35 except chambered for 9mm.
PM me or call/text me at 971 two-one-nine 1015.  You pay the $10 OSP (Oregon State Police) background check and I will pay up to $20 for half of the convenience fee a FFL charges (most Pawn Shops charge $10 OSP + $20 transfer)."

This rifle comes with a LOT of extras! I’ve had it since 2013 and have put a lot of money and time into it. Unfortunately I need to move onto other projects and I never shoot it. Selling it would help me do just that.I changed out the composite wood stock, grip and fore grip with polymer ones so I could fit optics, etc. I also liked the tactical look on the rifle better. I fitted it with a single point sling attachment and AR stock tube kit so I could use an adjustable stock (includes Magpul STR stock in black).Once the stock and extra kit were fitted I wanted to get more into suppression. Since the VZ has a thinner barrel and odd thread type I had to have the barrel re-done. I had it shortened and an AAC 51T muzzle device welded on, then the rifle and all 5 magazines were all then cerakoted.I track EVERY purchase to the penny and I can tell you that I have exactly $2,537.01 invested in this rifle.

Gun comes with all of the Nordic components (extended magazine tube, end cap and magazine / barrel clamp) Single owner shotgun, used primarily for sporting clays and some upland bird. Gun functions and fires just fine, no issues with it; just wanting to upgrade so i'm passing along a fine shotgun to someone who can use it for similar sport or 3 Gun.Two items i'll note is that it is missing the Mossberg ""M"" horn button (bottm of the grip) as it came loose and apparantly was lost in the field somewhere. This does not affect the gun whatsoever, it is a cosmetic item. Other ""issue"" is that the latch catch pin had come loose in the past, so a gun smith replaced the pin and sealed it with some light epoxy so it couldn't back out again. This does not affect the gun's shooting / ejection at all but want to be transparent for when you look at it.Looking to get $425 and fairly firm on the price. Email me OBO and we can chat, schedule a time to look at it. Thanks for looking."

After purchasing a glock 19 for EDC I decided to have a bit of fun with my oft neglected 22. For the past four months I've been developing slide improvements, magazine wells, and magazine base pads using soildworks, edgecam, and our FEA suite to make sure everything is as robust as necessary. The result of that research and development is what I have for sale today. Despite the improvements, I still don't shoot the 22 very often and would rather have a 17. All of the design work and machining was done by me with the help of a few other engineers and a 40 year veteran machinist. The actual work was done on a Fadal CNC machine with carbide tools and liquid coolant. The Cerakote was applied by the gentlemen at Johnson Customs in Springfield and they did an exceptional job. They are a factory trained and certified Cerakote dealer and do thousands of parts for large operations. The stippling is comfortable for hours of shooting as it is a relatively low profile pattern. The area around the mag release has been scalloped to facilitate depressing the release. If you have any other questions about the build or the firearm itself, please feel free to ask. If you don't want this gun but have a glock you would like modified in a similar fashion, feel free to contact me. I have a full suite of other designs including windows, other serration patterns, RMR cuts, etc. The magazine well in the photos is a 3D printed prototype that I am working on. The aircraft grade aluminum production version will be ready to go in the coming days and that will be included with the pistol. The magazine base pads are further away from completion so they will not come with this gun.Pistol comes with 6 factory 15 round glock mags. 
The streamlight is not included in this sale. This wonderful pistol is going for $1250. Thanks,Casey"

No modifications, drilling, or alterations. Actions operate smoothly. Triggers are smooth with crisp let off, and very light single action and easy double action as is characteristic of these revolvers. $600 - The first pistol (first 2 pictures) was purchased as a parts pistol if the need ever came up, but it never did, though I am selling it as such. Never shot it and it appears to be mechanically complete.$700 - The second pistol (third picture) is in better cosmetic condition than the former.
