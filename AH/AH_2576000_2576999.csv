It has been bore sighted and includes 4-30rd mags, a pouch, a shoulder strap, and a sight alignment tool.  All is new and has never been fired.

From the manufacturer:

There’s a new option in concealed carry performance: the P220® Compact. The P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring enhanced ergonomics and true concealability in the powerful .45 Auto platform. The shortened frame provides concealability while the ergonomically contoured magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. The hard coat anodize alloy frame combines light weight and strength for extreme durability. The integrated accessory rail ensures compatibility with industry standard options, such as our STL-900L Tactical Light & Laser. Topping the compact frame is a shorter, “commander-length” stainless slide housing a 3.9” cold hammer forged barrel and external extractor, for enhanced reliability. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact’s improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame make the pistol the ideal choice. And with the SIG name you know that when it comes to protecting your life you’re backed by a standard of excellence unmatched in the firearms world.

68,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2576068,For Sale:  Serbu Super Shorty 870 AOW,"Madison, New Haven, Connecticut",$ 870,"Listed On: Friday, January 17, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The SUPER-SHORTY is considered an AOW (Any Other Weapon) and can be transferred with a $5 stamp! The gun holds two 2-3/4"" or 3"" shells in the magazine, plus one in the chamber. The 16.5"" overall length, 6.5"" barrel and spring-locked foregrip, which pivots out of the way when not in use, make for a very compact package. As far as I know, this is the shortest 12-gauge pump shotgun available. All parts for the SUPER-SHORTY are made in-house on their own CNC machinery using materials ideally suited to the task. All welds are done by the TIG process, and the manganese phosphate finish is MIL-spec. The SUPER-SHORTY is currently being used by various law enforcement agencies and military units worldwide. If you like the idea of concealed carry with a 12-gauge, or like a lot of ""bang"" in a small package, or just want the most compact breaching weapon available, then this is the gun for you. You won't find a better made AOW pump shotgun than the SUPER-SHORTY!

I am selling my Serbu because I really do not need an easily concealable 12 gauge nor do I need a special purpose breaching tool. This is classified as an NFA firearm but only requires a $5 tax stamp as opposed to the $200 for machine guns, short-barreled shotguns, and silencers, etc. This is the costlier model based off the Remington 870. This weapon has only been test fired by myself with Mark Serbu at his shop in Tampa. Otherwise, it's like new.

This sale will need to be handled by a CLASS III FFL holder in each state who is willing to complete the transfer. It will be the buyers responsibility for obtaining the approved ATF form 4 and working with the dealer. I will deliver the firearm to the Connecticut CLASS III FFL holder on the date of transfer at which time I will need to be paid in cash.

If you are unfamiliar with the process of purchasing an NFA firearm, please contact your local CLASS III FFL holder or the ATF. I will gladly answer any questions about my firearm but will not give any legal advice how to purchase this weapon with a CLEO sign-off like I did or through a corporation or trust. Thank you for your interest."

The DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA by.Diamondback Firearms. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This is not to be confused with the newer (and vastly inferior) SAR-8 sold by Springfield with the cast aluminum receiver, this is all steel receiver, and not some parts kit build.
These are HK-91 clones made on HK tooling set-up by HK engineers, made by HK trained technicians at Hellenic Arms. These were imported by Springfield as SAR-3 for a while before being caught up in the early assault weapon ban. Springfield slapped a thumb hole stock on them, pinned and welded a non flash suppressor on them and overstamped the SAR-3 with an SAR-8. The quality on these is thought to be second only to HK since everything was set-up by HK.
 Included are 3x 20rd steel magazines, 5x 20 rd aluminum magazines, and the original 5 rd magazine. This rifle does have some small handling marks but is still in very good condition. It has been kept in a safe and very well taken care of. I'm parting with it because my interests have changed and I need to make room for some other projects.

This is a low cost .40 cal gun with great reputation as a dependable shooter and performer.
This gun comes with a pair of mags for it, a 9 round and a 10 round with an extension.
You carry the gun with whichever you choose and carry the other in the mag carrier that is included with the deal, all for one low package deal price. Big savings in package! 
I am including a Blackhawk Close Quarters Concealment adjustable holster, AND, a Fobus paddle holster as well. Use them both and decide which to use depending on preference and situations. These are some nice extras to get with a carry pistol package.
You can grab a box of ammo from me( included at no charge ) while you are getting this bargain and be shooting the same day without spending any more money or making any more stops.
One of the mags has some cosmetic scratch marks on the lower edge(chew marks?), nothing that affects the function of the gun. The other mag is unmarked. The gun has no issues accepting either mag, and feeds ammo fine through both. The gun is mechanically 100%, with only minor marks, scuffs, scratches on it. I have priced it with these things in mind and have put together a package with the ammo and the holsters that makes it a bargain for the next owner. I took it on trade on a higher end pistol, and now its time for some one else to get a bargain.
Im a private collector, trader, hobbyist, so there aren't any taxes, fees, or permit hassles.
Im available by email, cell phone or text every day.

Stock is in great shape.  It has a 1"" Limbsaver and is completely LOP and Comb height adjustable.  There is a stripped screw holding on the Limbsaver so if you want to swap it out you would have to drill out that screw.  Otherwise there is a couple of small barely noticeable dimples in the stock.  Not really scratches or dings, just little impressions where the bolt handle locks in place and another one on the body of the stock.  This stock is spectacular, I just need some extra cash and do not want to sell the whole rifle. Varmint/ Sporter style stock in green mountain camo.  I have the parts to make the recoil pad height adjustable as well, but the limbsaver has to come off in order to install it.  That is where the screw got stripped.  That is the only drawback to this stock, the soft torx screws that hold the recoil pad in place.  I have never tightened them, I stripped one trying to take them out, but this should not affect the functionality of the stock unless you want to switch out the recoil pad.  I am not sure why anyone would want to, as the stock is fully adjustable with the pad, and it is a really nice pad anyway.  $700 new + upgraded to 1"" recoil from 1/2"" and the parts to make the recoil pad height adjustable as well LOP adjustable.

You can make some really nice grips from this material. All you need is a razor blade and/or scissors and a heat gun. You cut to fit then use the heat gun so it sticks really well and molds to the area for a custom fit. This is the fully rubberized stuff and is not gritty."

Received as a gift for Christmas.  Brand new, never used.  This is the latest and most compact EOTech magnifier.   It's shorter and has a QD / Flip to side mount.  Includes optional riser for both absolute co-witness and lower 1/3 co-witness.  Great for quickly switching from long range to CQB shooting. 

$475.

Will ship.


From EOTech website:
The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

both rifles are in great shape and their prices are firm and only what ive got in them. only selling them to fund another project. each will come with one 30 round steel magazine. no ammo will be included in any transaction. the ONLY TRADES i may consider would be for an HK pistol or possibly glock and cash. also would consider a Magnum Research .22 magnum or .17hmr semi auto rifle. prefer to sell both outright though.

If you understand what Devine M1As are, I don't have to explain save for the fact that there were less than 2000 made. This one was made in 1971. I painstakingly converted the standard rifle into the XM21 over the period of several years. The gas system is unitized and the flash suppressor reamed by Ted Brown. Ted Brown also did a 4.5 lb trigger job. The stock is an original Sykes XM21 stock obtained from and bedded by Art Lupino. Op Rod Spring Guide is BPT. The scope is a genuine Redfield AR TEL scope which is serialized to match and marry it to the weapon as was done with XM21s. All the parts are original Springfield Armory marked. The Sparrow Hawk faux selector lock was installed by myself to complete package. The only thing NOT National Match is the barrel. This was not unheard of in the late 1960's when the XM21s were being built for Vietnam. Beside, if I changed the barrel, it would lose it's Devine Texas stampings and lose it's identity. Shoots between 1 and 1.25 MOA at 300 meters using M852 ammunition so it's a good shooter. More pictures can be provided on request."
