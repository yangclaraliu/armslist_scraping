Built this high quality/ highly accurate rifle about a year ago and have been on the road for work since.  I haven't had the time to shoot it thus only 30 rounds have been put through it and it is a waste to see it sitting in my gun safe.

I put a 24 inch stainless steel bull barrel with a 1/8 twist because I was determined to make this an insanely accurate gun at a far distance.  Furthers I have been able to test this gun is 200 yards with extreme accuracy.  If you consider purchasing this gun I hope you know a place that you can shoot further and update me on the accuracy so I know if in the future wether this build needs modified or not.

Buy it now!! (All NFA rules apply) A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.* Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included."

I'm asking $1,200 for all of this. Cabela's asks the same price with none of the accessories, and this gun is in the same condition. Great gun, I'm just more attached to the ARs I've built myself and I need the space. 

The second rifle is a SIG 522 Classic 22lr. Looks and feels just like it's big brother, the SIG556. This comes with an old Aimpoint 5000 that still works great and holds zero no matter what. I also installed the bolt on rails on the fore end. This is a fun, accurate little rifle, and comes with two 25 round mags and one 10 rounder. Again this has roughly 200 rounds through it, maybe even a little less. I'm asking $400 for this one. 

If you want both I'll do it for $1,500 and I'll even throw in a nice Drago Tactical double rifle bag in OD Green."

I inherited this 5 screw K22 Masterpiece and since im not a collector of classic firearms, this would not fit very well into my arsonal.  I figure its best to pass it on to someone that will appreciate the beauty in its history.  The serial number is K206xxx.  It has the 4 line logo on the right side and "".22 LONG RIFLE CTG"" on the right side of the barrel.  Also has ""SMITH WESSON"" on the left side of the barrel.  It has some muzzle wear on the tip and has the normal cylinder line.  It has adjustable rear sights and a red dot on the front sights.  Currently has Pachmayr grips that are in execellent shape.  I do not have the original wood diamond grips.  But those can be purchased on ebay for $50.  This is not only a gorgeous looking revolver, but a great example of the ever popular 5 screw K22 Masterpiece.  If you collect Smith & Wesson revolvers this is one you certainly would like to add to your collection.  I can text or email more pictures, just ask.  Im having a hard time taking quality pictures for some reason.  If you would like to see it in person, just ask.

Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. is pleased to introduced the Ruger SR-556C, a
carbine length derivative of the popular SR-556. The 16.1"" barrel on the
SR-556C features an integrally machined flash suppressor, which minimizes
the overall length of the barrel while complying with ATF regulations for
civilian and commercial sales. Many of the customers appreciate the limited
muzzle rise when shooting the original SR-556. The SR-556C offers the same
great features that made the original SR-556 such a success  it includes
the two stage piston driven operating system with a four-position
adjustable gas regulator; chrome lined, cold hammer forged barrel; folding
battlesights, quad rail, and rail overs; chrome plated bolt carrier group
and operating system, six-position stock and Hogue grip.

The SR-556E offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory
standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing
a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system
that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm
that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and
chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power
delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are
vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping
the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is
significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I originally purchased this gun to train my teen children. When I did, I found that the trigger pull was too hard for them to use, so It’s been sitting for about 9 months now, and I have gotten them a Sig 1911 .22 to train on.

I have polished the feed ramp as seen in the pictures to feed the rounds better. Smoothed and polished the trigger bar to lessen the trigger pull, which it did to help the trigger pull when the kids were shooting. Gun is in 99% overall condition. Mechanically speaking the gun is in excellent shape see the pictures.

It includes a chair and ottoman, a sofa, and a loveseat, and provides seating for up to 6.

They are all in very good shape. The pictures don't really do justice...we didn't clean the couches before storing them so they could look a lot better.

The only issue is very minor. There is a tear about 3 inches long on the back side of the sofa. When put against the wall, it is completely unnoticeable-and actually could be fixed by an upholsterer for a relatively minor cost. Other than that, they are in good condition.

Asking $550 cash, or $750-1000 in trade. They retailed for over $3,000. Seems fair.

Would also consider trades for guns, a hot tub, or motorcycles. Can add cash where necessary.

Please let me know if you have any questions. If you are a serious buyer, I would be happy to show them to you...just please don't be a tire-kicker or try to lowball me.

They are all in very good shape. The pictures don't really do justice...we didn't clean the couches before storing them so they could look a lot better.

The only issue is very minor. There is a tear about 3 inches long on the back side of the sofa. When put against the wall, it is completely unnoticeable-and actually could be fixed by an upholsterer for a relatively minor cost. Other than that, they are in good condition.

Would also consider trades for guns, a hot tub, or motorcycles. Can add cash where necessary.

This is a very well known commercial variant. It has a shorter 16.5"" paratrooper style barrel, scope rail, standard 10 round magazine, and It's my opinion that the Companion has no bayonet lug. Poyer's book says yes, there is a lug and a bayonet, Long's says no there isn't. I have never seen one with a bayonet, so who's right? Maybe it's a mixed bag, who knows with the Chinese. It would make sense if there was not a lug because if these were really made with the rancher vs. varmints in mind, a bayonet lug would get constantly caught up in a saddle rifle holster.

Rifle is 98% with ~500 rounds through it.  It comes in the factory box with all original papers, gunlock + key, and the following items:

1. 4 Ruger factory 20 round magazines (some bluing has faded)
2. Ruger factory black synthetic stock
3. Ruger factory magazine well brace and screws for wood stock (installed)
4. A pair of Ruger factory ""high"" height scope rings (installed)
5. 1 Ruger factory ""medium"" height scope ring, and 1 Ruger factory ""low"" height scope ring (don't ask, but I'm giving them to you now, haha.)

7. Tasco 3-9x40mm wide angle scope (installed)
8. Ruger factory wood stock (installed)
9. ~40 or so loose rounds of .223/5.56

The only reason this rifle is 98% grade is because the front handguard has a chip in the corner of it (pictured), but it does not affect the function or structure of the rifle in any way.  A new handguard costs $20 from Ruger.  All metal is in excellent condition, with no barrel pitting or other defects.  

This rifle has served me well over the years and was a worker, not a safe queen.  The scope comes sighted in at a 200 yard ""battle zero"", and has put plenty of deer meat on the table, as well as kept plenty of coyote and fox out of the chicken coop with a single shot.

This rifle has chewed through every single kind of .223 AND 5.56 you could imagine, and has not had one single FTE, FTF, or other malfunction of any kind.  This rifle is indeed %100 reliable, you have my word on that.

As you can probably tell, I really don't want to sell this rifle.  It means that much to me, but you've got to pay your dues before you pay the rent.

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Looking to trade or sell an Iver Johnson Safety Hammer Revolver ""Owl's Head"" chambered for 32 S&W (32 short) in the Roanoke Valley. I know nothing about them and have never fired this one. 

The finish is really not too bad for an OLD pocket gun. As far as function, best I can tell it should fire. The trigger sticks and needs to be pushed back forward when releasing the hammer. Maybe a thorough cleaning or replacement spring of some sort would correct that?? The cylinder seems to line up and lock well when hammer is cocked, the shell ejector pops up just fine when the gun is opened, and the top latches into place securely when the gun is closed.

If you have dealt with it before you know it is somewhat a pita to get off, but it shows this is a brand new gun essentially.

All numbers match on every part that is numbered. Comes with the cleaning kit in butt stock, military sling, spiked bayonet possibly a soft case for the right deal. This is a complete rifle. It was made in 1968 if I recall correctly at factory 26. Again very good condition chrome lined barrel shines very bright.


I purchased this not for me but for my girlfriend as her first ""rifle"" however she did not like the recoil or the weight of it. She is very small so I guess I can understand. Yesterday was the first time it has been to the range, had 60 rounds through it since taken out of the cosmoline ran perfect no malfunctions. After we were done on the range I purchased here a Ruger 10/22. So the is for sale since she will never use it and I don't plan on ever using it because I have my own toys. I will clean the rifle again before buyer picks it up.
