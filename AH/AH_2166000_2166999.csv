of Bellingham, and 2 6-round magazines

The P64 is an all steel DA/SA pistol with a chrome-lined barrel, loaded chamber indicator, 
hammer-drop safety,and firing pin block. The pistol is chambered for the 9X18 Makarov
round and it has functioned flawlessly for me with approximaely 500 rounds fired. 

I have installed Wolf hammer and recoil springs to smooth out the trigger 
and dampen the recoil impulse. DA pull is very heavy at about 16 pounds, however 
SA pull is under 4 pounds with a little  take-up and a clean break. The pistol 
is very thin making it perfect for concealed carry. The P64 has a bit of a cult 
following and plenty of positive reviews -- take a minute and google it yourself.

Current online prices for the P64 are around $230 (if you can find one) with 
shipping, transfer fees and tax. This brings the total to about $300. I will sell 
mine with installed Wolf springs, 2 magazines and a Kydex
IWB holster custom fit to the P64 for $300. 9X18 ammo readily available online 
and is currently selling for about $14 for 50 rounds. This is a great little pistol -- I'm 
just ready move on to something new.

Since I purchased this pistol with my C&R FFL, I will need to record the transaction
in my log. Local sales only. I'll need to see a Washington driver's license and either a CPL,

It is chambered for the modern, rimless 7.5x54 French cartridge. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles used, like the British SMLE rifle (rear locking lugs resistant to dirt), the US M1917 Enfield rifle (turned down bolt, peep sight), and the German Mauser (five-round box-magazine), to produce an immensely strong and reliable service rifle.
The MAS-36 carries a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle.
These rifles were in service from 1936–1978 and served in World War II, Algerian War, First Indochina War, Suez Crisis, Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War.

If you are unfamiliar with the firearm or the caliber all the info can be found on google pretty easily. My trade/cash value on this would be $750.

Mine is a 2002 date of manufacture 6.5 inch stainless steel model. this is the polished stainless as opposed to the satin finish they use on the current production line up. Finish is in excellent condition. It is a manual double lock 5 shot in either .454 or the less powerful (and cheaper) .45 long colt.

As for what I'm looking for that's kind of up for debate. Anything interesting really. These handguns are fairly expensive and don't come around often so I might be a little picky. I'm not really interested in shotguns. A budget AR or AK would be nice (or some other tactical or surplus semi-auto). A decent 1911 would also be soemthing I'd look into. Offer just about anything that Is a firearm and I'll at least give it some thought.

Picture is not of the weapon im selling, it is just an example. I can send pictures via phone to someone interested."

Nikon 3x32 P-223 Rifle Scope 8496 is a powerful close-range rifle scope that combines high-brightness optics with quick adjustment capabilities. These effective Nikon rifle scopes feature a 3x magnification and a wide, 32mm objective lens that is fully multi-coated, providing an astonishing 98% light transmission rate, allowing you to do some great hunting during sunrise or sunset. Optimized for the trajectory of a 5.56 NATO round, the Nikon P223 3x BDC Carbine Reticle Riflescopes are equipped with a BDC Carbine reticle with 400 and 600 yard hashmarks; using Nikon's Spot On Ballistic Match Technology, you can tailor the reticle to your specific load. 
Adjustments in windage and elevation are easy to make with these rifle scopes, which utilize 1/4 MOA tactical-style windage and elevation turrets with a zero reset feature that makes adjusting the reticle of the Nikon 3x32mm P223 Ballistic Match Rifle Scope as easy as dialing in the appropriate range.

All these adjustment possibilities plus a 100 yard parallax setting makes for some highly accurate shooting with the Nikon P-223 Rifle Scope. Not only is the Nikon P 223 3x32 Matte Black Rifle Scope precise and accurate, it is also comfortable to use, easy to mount, and as durable a rifle scope as you'll find anywhere else. Nikon has equipped these scopes with generous eye relief that's big enough to guard against heavy recoil, harsh shooting angles, and lighter rifles. 
For a close-range rifle scope that combines fast target acquisition with precise windage and elevation adjustments and crystal clear optics, mount the Nikon P223 Matte BDC Carbine Scope to your rifle of choice.

This gun is almost 20 years old (19 to be exact), and yet looks like it just came from the manufacturer and landed on a Dealers' shelf. It's in pristine condition, with only a very, very, very slight 1/4 inch straight scratch along the exact edge of the slide where it sat in my computer desk, and another tiny pinprick dot (1/16 of an inch) also on the slide edge where it must've contacted the surface of the desk drawer. The gun was shot exactly twice in 19 years, probably the first weekend I bought it, and has sat in my computer desk ever since 1994... This is old school, vintage Sig Sauer P228 where it all began about 20 years ago, with its then adoption by the FBI as a primary duty weapon. It's interesting to see that the design of this gun has been so successful that it has barely been modified in nearly 20 years. Interesting too is the fact I did notice a few years ago they did try once to tinker with a re-design of the P228, but are now back again re-issuing this classic design calling it their M11 variant, but it is essentially this same gun, just with night sights. This gun is to Sigs, what the original 80's era Gen 1 Glocks are to Glocks...Comes with original box and original manual, 2 original 13 round mags. 

That said, though the condition on this is truly mint and it's barely been touched in 19 years, I could see how someone might hesitate spending this amount of money on what is still technically a ""used gun"" (although probably vintage by now), and so I do have a BRAND NEW HK P2000 SK 9mm with night sights still available, contact me"

Ready for immediate use. OBO.

 DETAILS:
 Standardized by the DEA, ATF, and FBI SWAT, the EOTECH 552 Holographic Weapon Sight, Ballistic .50 Reticle, NV Compatible, AA Battery (552.XR500) is by far the most popular HWS model.

 This NV compatible, AA battery model is the sight of choice by military units like Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. It is battle proven to withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out.

 The EOTech 552 Eotech Holosight with Ballistic .50 reticle provides a multi purpose image that is calibrated to the specific trajectory of the .50 cal BMG round on an M2. The center dot is used for 0-300 meters. Three additional calibrated aiming dots are for 1km, 1.5km and 2km. No matter what .50 cal platform you own, the 552.XR500 can take your speed and accuracy gains to the next level. In addition to the M2 machine gun, the sight works with other .50 cal platforms such as Barrett, Cobb, and many other .50 cal rifles. 

 The 552 HWS uses laser light to illuminate a holographic reticle pattern embedded in the heads-up display window and forms a virtual image of a reticle pattern. The shooter looks through the heads-up display window and sees a bright red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. There is absolutely no light projected onto the target plane. This model has no magnification.

 The 552 Holographic Weapon Sight is equipped with mounting hardware to attach to a standard 1"" dovetail or Picatinny style rail. To achieve the best results and accuracy, the HWS must be mounted properly.

 FEATURES:
 AA Battery model (supports Lithium and Alkaline)
 Interfaces to 1"" Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) rail
 Ballistic drop compensated reticle for .50 caliber

BUILD YOUR OWN AK!

Complete romanian ""G"" AK 47 (7.62x39) parts kit for building an AK, good condition, with matching numbers and a WORKING COMMUNIST MADE CHROME LINED BARREL (imported before the barrel ban).

This is not American made barrel crap.

That's right, they banned barrels on gun parts kits :/

But before the ban happened some of these fine kits got imported, if you're unfamiliar with these... These kits are off mill issued guns made for the communists youth camps... They made these semi auto only...  and most of the kits have been used by those little commies sparingly.  This particular kit has some surface rust and scratches, but the bore is BRIGHT, plenty of use left in it and refinishing is part of the building process anyway.

I've already started work on this, removing the bbl from trunion... Sanding some of the wood... Getting a Tapco G2 trigger...

This will require a receiver that can be had for under $100... And some basic tools.

This rifle features black phosphate/anodized aluminum finishes, a Stark SE-1 pistol grip with battery compartment, a 6 position adjustable stock by UTI, a Picatinny quad-rail forearm and top rail, rail mounted front/rear adjustable sights, and a stock sling mount. The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years.

This caliber gives you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.
The rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

It was made in 1993. It's all original but also comes with a Beartooth Mercantile safety delete and a Beartooth Mercantile stainless steel follower (it's dished for properly cycling Hornady's LEVERevolution ammo). It has a one-piece mount and steel rings holding a Bushnell Trophy 1.75-4x32mm scope which is zero'd for 100 yards and nice and bright. It has a sight blank where the rear sight was but I also have the original sights and other original parts.

It also comes with one full and one partial box of Hornady LEVERevolution 325gr ammo.

The gun shows no real wear except just normal handling use. It's been fired probably a hundred times or so, mostly just sighting in the scope and getting it ready for deer season each year. I can shoot 3 shots in a couple of inches at 100 yards from a rest. I'm sure working up a load someone could do even better. This is a shooter.

I'll try to get some pictures up later today."

The rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."
