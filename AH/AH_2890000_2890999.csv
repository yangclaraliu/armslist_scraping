The stock has a mirror finish and you can see my reflection in the pictures.  Manufactured around 1972, it's a safe queen.  Has a few tiny nics on barrel, stock has a few small scratches on the left side of the butt, a small repaired chip by the cross bolt, and some scuffs on the floor plate.  All handling marks from being in a safe for 42 years with other guns.  Appears to be unfired or fired very little and cleaned very well, most of the 80 guns in this collection were new in the box unfired, but no boxes for the rifles.  Comes with factory Sako 1"" scope rings.  Research these rifles and you will find they are some of the finest factory guns made.  Has a fully adjustable factory trigger that has zero creep or over travel and breaks like a glass rod, seriously it's way better than the custom Jard trigger on my AR!  These early Sako's are renowned for their accuracy right from the factory.  This rifle is NOT Garcia import marked, it also does NOT have the ""Bofor's Steel"" marked barrel.  It came with a Leupold VX-2 3x9 scope that can be included for an extra $280.  Also included is a padded leather sling.  This is a beautiful firearm and it doesn't need to go, but I already have an awesome deer rifle and I would rather it go to someone that will use it, rather than spend more years in my safe (I would definitely take this baby to the range to see what it can do!).  I would rather do FTF for cash, I live in Owatonna but am in the twin cities and suburbs 3-4 times a week including some weekends if needed.  More pics at:

I have for sale or trade a 1976 Ruger Security Six American Bicentennial Revolver, 6"" Barrel, Blued, .357 Magnum/.38 Special, Original Ruger wood grips. Has holster wear around the muzzle.

These are rare, cause of the Rollmark this one was only made 1 year.

Before they arrived I was talked into trading off the 4.25"" Compact 9mm and 45acp I had intended to use them in.  These springs reduce felt recoil, muzzle flip, and are much smoother than the standard Wolff round wire springs.  In my opinion the biggest benefit they offer especially with the Compact 1911's is that instead of the 500 - 1500 round replacement that the round wire springs require, the Everslast flatwire springs only require replacement every 15,000 - 20, 000 rounds.  These sets come with two springs and the reduced diameter guide rod required with flatwire springs due to their reduced interior diameter.  Both sets are brand new.  I paid over $60.00 each including shipping.  I will sell them for $35.00 and I will pay the shipping."

Details on the MK I are below courtesy of Wikipedia

These guns feature a gas rather than recoil action and are surprisingly easy to shoot.
I bought this from a local sherrif about 30? years ago and changed the 357 barrell etc out immediately and went to the 44 Mag.  I have had at least half a dozen of these over the years.  The 357 is wasted in this heavyweight semiauto pistol as is the 41.  The 50 AE is an expensive round and no matter how tight I wrap my Gorilla hands around it the brass which exits differently than all the others will brush the hair on the top of my head most of the time.  So the 44 is the best round for this gun by far.

This gun includes a Sidekick shoulder rig, belt mag pouch and 4 magazines.  Three of the mags are still brand new

From Wiki;
The Mark I, which is no longer produced, was offered with a steel, stainless steel or aluminum alloy frame and differs primarily in the size and shape of the safety levers and slide catch.[5] The Mark VII includes an adjustable trigger (retrofittable to Mark I pistols). The Mark I and VII are both available in .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum; the Mark VII has been chambered for .41 Magnum. The barrels had a 3/8"" dovetail, to which an accessory mount could be attached. Later Mark VII models were offered in .50 Action Express with a 7/8"" Weaver-pattern rail on the barrel; the .50 Mark VII would later become the Mark XIX platform. Barrel lengths were 6, 10 and 14 inches[5] for .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum, but only 6 or 10 inches for .41 Magnum.

The price is firm, some trades considered
Am looking for a nice 44mag single action cowboy revolver, maybe a dbl action and a 44 mag lever action to go with it might consider the Desert Eagle for a nice setup with holster in 2XL or 44 waist

Only selling because I have put 4 magazines through it ever and just don't get around to shooting it much. I also need to buy an engagement ring so I figured this is a good start to it.

I've decided not to build another AR15 so I am parting with my stripped Palmetto State Armory lower receiver and Enhanced Lower Build Kit.  The lower is a LW prefix with high shelf, Safe/Fire markings and excellent finish.  The Enhanced Lower Build kit includes a standard lower receiver parts kit, carbine receiver extension kit and ""enhanced"" buttstock with QD swivel socket on the sides.  All PSA parts, no cheap PTAC crap.  

This set will give you a complete carbine lower when assembled.  Just add your choice of upper and BCG and you are good to go.

Asking $175.00 for the receiver and kit.  Prefer not to separate the set at this time.  No shipping.  Face-to-face transaction only.

From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

In mid-1956, the hammer and trigger mechanisms were slightly modified for the R-101 series.
 sentinel HI-STANDARD .22 CAL
 1955, probably at the request of Sears Roebuck, which was a major customer and owned quite a bit of High Standard stock.  Sears wanted a low-cost kit gun or “tackle box” revolver to sell under their J.C. Higgins brand.  It was sold by Sears as the J.C. Higgins Model 88.  The J.C. Higgins guns were given distinctive grips, cylinder flutes, and cylinder release pins.  Private label versions of the Sentinel were also made for Western Auto and Armamex (Colonel Rex Applegate’s company in Mexico).
The Sentinel was a 9-shot .22 revolver.  It was advertised to have an anodized aluminum frame, high-tensile carbon steel barrel and cylinder, single-stroke multiple ejection, a swing-out counterbored cylinder, a movable square-notched rear sight, a non- slip scored trigger, a diamond-checkered grip (though they didn’t mention it was plastic), and target accuracy.

The innovative design was completed by Harry Sefried, High Standard’s young design engineer, in a mere six months.  Sefried wasn’t afraid to incorporate good ideas wherever he found them.  The squared-off grip on the first model was modified from the Colt New Model .36 Pocket Pistol of 1862, and one shooter was said to remark that it was “the first decent grip on a revolver since the Civil War.”  It remains to this day one of the most comfortable revolver grips I have ever encountered.  The simplified cylinder lock design was taken from Hugo Borchardt’s experimental revolver of 1876, which he designed while working for Winchester and which was observed by Sefried during his own five years at Winchester.  The gun, like the Broomhandle Mauser, is screwless but for the grip screw.



These two are R-101 Sentinel revolvers made in 1958.


The top revolver is an R-106 Sentinel Deluxe from 1974, and beneath it is an R-103 Sentinel from 1965.

There is an integral thumb rest molded into the frame behind the cylinder housing on each side, making the gun feel quite natural in the hand.  The grip section and frame are die cast from aluminum.  There is no cylinder thumb release to interrupt the smooth frame or complicate manufacture and assembly.  The gun can be broken down into four main component groups: (1) the cylinder and crane, (2) the trigger-guard/grip, (3) the barrel and frame assembly, and (4) the hammer, trigger, and other lockwork components.  Everything is held together by the hammer pin, which runs through both the trigger-guard/grip and the main frame.  Coil springs are used throughout.



Sefried designed a unique ratchet mechanism that utilizes nine holes drilled into the rear of the extractor, worked by a traditional pawl that extends from the frame.  The holes give the pawl a positive interface, providing flawless cylinder rotation and reducing the machining necessary on the frame and cylinder.  The design also reduces wear to the ratchet mechanism that eventually causes problems with more traditional designs.  The nine-hole ratchet mechanism was abandoned in later-production Sentinels.
The Sentinel has an extended forcing cone that nearly eliminates lead shaving as the bullet enters the barrel.  I hate it when a revolver spits hot lead out the side when I’m standing next to the shooter--it could be a fatal distraction in a fire fight.

The Sentinel was originally available in a so-called blued finish (which was actually a selenium black).  The nickel finish was available in April of 1956.  The early nickeled guns cost $5 or $6 more than the blued guns.  The MSRP for the blued gun in 1955 was $37.50.  The Sentinel had a one-piece wrap-around plastic grip.  Originally the blue guns had a brown grip and the nickel guns had a white grip, but that scheme was not retained throughout production.

A 1955 catalog says the gun was available with a 3 or a 5 inch barrel.  A parts list circa 1957 or 1958 shows 3 inch, 4 inch, and 2-3/8 inch barrels were available.  By 1956, a 6 inch barrel was also available.  The 3 inch barrel was dropped in 1964.

In 1957 a snub-nose model of the Sentinel was introduced, with a rounded butt on the grip.  The early guns had a bobbed hammer, through about 1960, after which they featured a spur hammer.  Color finishes in gold, turquoise, and pink, known as Dura-Tone colors, were offered for the snub-barrel Sentinels.  The Dura-Tone guns came in a deluxe presentation case and had white smooth grips.
In 1958 a line of western-style revolvers was spun off the Sentinel line, the first model of which was called the Double-Nine.  It was sold by Sears as the J.C. Higgins Ranger Model 90."

In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

It is in caliber 7.65 Browning or as we know it 32acp.   All serial numbers match including the magazine.   It is a copy (improved) of the Walther PP.  The gun was ceracoted (or something) by a previous owner.  Please look carefully and you will see what appears to be pitting under the ceracote on the slide.  The barrel is pristine.  I imagine this was carried and carried and carried and hardly shot at all.  When I got it the trigger pull must have been twenty pounds.  I put a  nine pound Wolff hammer spring in it and I’d guess it is about seven to eight pounds double action and smooth.  The kit came with a 9, 11 and 13 pound springs.  I still have the original for any glutton for punishment. Shoots extremely well.  Shoots about an inch low at 10 yards but they’re all together centered.  $199 or what I was hoping for was a trade for a Ruger 10/22.  [By the way, it's an excellent cc gun for a female.  The first double action trigger pull is not heavy.  The recoil is mild and it doesn't weigh that much with the aluminum (or whatever they choose to call it) frame.  I have a place in Efland to try it out."

Federal American Eagle Suppressor Ammunition was designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate in reliability and cleanliness in suppressed firearms. The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest, fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent, accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

This has been fired exactly 150 times and is in perfect condition. A word to this wise for those looking at these with the ""Tac-Pac"", the Surefire light that mounts above the barrel is crap. It does integrate nicely into the hole made for it, the problem is it's a light. So it should do just that, give off light. I had one and sent it back to Surefire for a refund. I just wasn't worth the money. Please email with questions. Cash in person or US Postal money orders only. I will consider a partial trade of tactical rifles, shotguns and pistols. Please email photos to mattchristiani at hotmail dot com for consideration. Update: Had a few emails about the EOTech and the battery type. It is a AA battery sight not an N Cell. Thanks Matt Update: Had a question about after market magazines in the weapon. I can tell you that it is not recommended by TDI that you attempt to use anything other than a genuine Glock magazibe in this weapon. Yes the 3 magazines that come with this package are all genuine Glock 21 magazines. The TDI Kriss extension you see on the bottom of the magazine is to increase the magazine capacity to 30 rounds. This is a device made by TDI Kriss and it works flawlessly in both this weapon and a Glock 21 SF or standard Glock 21."

Following is description

LONG RANGE PRECISION FOR THE AR PLATFORM

The P-223 4-12x40 has all the essential features that long-range shooters demand.  With Nikon’s BDC 600 reticle, rapid action turrets and quick focus eyepiece, reaching out to the most distant targets is easier than ever before.
BDC 600 Reticle

Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Rem /5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet, the BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open  circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards.

Hand-turn 1/4 MOA adjustments with Rapid Action Turrets

With this combination, you can either dial-in your distances with Rapid Action Turrets or use the BDC 600 reticle to compensate for bullet drop. Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions.

Fully Multicoated Optical System

High Resolution From Dawn to Dusk.

Multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds on every glass surface provide bright and vivid sight pictures and optimum light transmission and maximum brightness from dawn to dusk.
Spring Loaded Instant Zero-Reset Turrets

To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into the P-223 riflescope. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and reengage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.

Spot On Ballistic Match Technology

Custom precision at your fingertips
The P-223 series, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load."

If you don't know the history on these, you can read more at http://www.star-firearms.com/firearm...ar/index.shtml . They are one of the few guns designed from the ground up to handle full power 10mm and lots of it - I think 15 rounds per mag. This one is in Starvel finish - looks like stainless steel, but I think it is actually some sort of nickel. It does have a few spots on the grip area and back strap. They were there when I bought it, and I didn't try too hard to get rid of them. I suggest you look at the pics below and then look at it in person. Comes with 1 magazine, no box or docs. I have an additional factory mag for sale if you purchase the gun for an additional $150 - it is brand new in factory wrap. At the time I write this, I am not aware of another one of these beasts for sale anywhere in the US. If you don't like my price, feel free to make me an offer, but don't be offended if I don't reply. Trades must be heavily in my favor."

Is in overall good shape, has a little bit of surface wear but in great working order. Deceptively compact and lightweight, same size as a Glock 19 if you're looking for something compact. Has a beautifully light and smooth SA/DA action and is exceptionally accurate because of this.

Just looking to try a different compact or full sized 9mm or .40 handgun.

There's no better AK or variant made than this.  I put a Phantom flash supressor on it and replaced the stock and grip which triggers the 922(r) compliance requirements, which of course are exceeded (see this>> http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk103/lronchef/922r_zps661858e1.png).  This rifle is currently impossible to get anymore as the production of these 16"" barreled ones has stopped only offering 20"" models.  I'm including two 1080 round tins and several hundred loose rounds of this currently banned (this specific ammo is banned for importation) 7N6 ammo (something you could probably turn around and sell in a month for crazy money).

1 - 5 round mag included with gun
1 - 10 round mag modded to hold 12 included with gun

Totalled, this gun has $1922 into it and has a round count of around 500 without issues.   Fit and finish surpasses the Arsenal/Izhevsk imports as does the accuracy.  This gun has been cleaned meticulously, trigger group is polished nicely along with the carrier.  No scratches, gouges, dents or other aesthetic blemishes.  

The heft of this gun and superior receiver and barrel strength and thickness allow you super fast and nearly recoil-less fire with this caliber.  I'm asking considerably less than it's worth so I'd appreciate what I'm asking.  Without the ammo I'll charge $1400 making the deal with the ammo an insane offer ($1800 with ammo). 

Cash only, no trades, FACE TO FACE SALE ONLY.  Shipping not available unless you want to send me cash first (so don't ask).

Flashlight and laser are NOT included in this deal.

The rifle has about 120-150 break-in shots through it.  I've decided to go .308, so selling to fund.  Rifle is surface-cleaned after a windy day at the range (some dust here and there) and well lubricated; however any weapon you buy should be detail stripped before shooting. This is not a safe queen, but is in good low-count condition.

Primary Arms 2 MOA red dot.  6oz including mount!  T1 clone, crisp-clear dot even in bright AZ sun.  This is PA 2014 new model with much better build quality, a solid optic.
Cheap Magpul PTS sights come with it.  Not combat grade, but they sighted in fine...

Carbine buffer and matched coated spring save weight over the H2/H3.  Recoils soft as it is.
Ambi clip on back of receiver and also QD slot in the stock.
Grippy grip from Tangodown easy to swap if not your style.

High quality bungee single point sling.
2 aluminum GI magazines with anti-tilt followers.
60 rounds SS109/M855 5.56 ammunition if local.
does NOT include the muffs (they belong to wife).

For AZ sales, I will comply with AZ law.  You must provide an AZ license, showing that you are over 18 and a resident.  I will ask you:
""Are you allowed to own a firearm?"" and ""Are you purchasing this for someone else?""
I do not require a bill of sale, as AZ does not require one for in-state transfers between residents.

I can have my FFL ship to your FFL and we can use PistolPay escrow if out of state.

Price is firm for complete rifle, as the components aren't cheap.  Lowballs will be ignored sorry.  I've adjusted this down to $950 for the package after looking at comparable builds on gunbroker; am firm at that price.  Can do $850 sans optic and sling if you have your own.

Its chambered in 9mm and is a cz-75 clone. I contacted Tanfoglio and they told me via email it was Made in Nov. 1990 and Sold to Israel Dec. 4 1990. These pistols were supposedly given to Mossad agents as there off duty carry but that has never been confirmed. This particular pistol has an Israeli shooting association stamp on it, so more than likely after its service it was sent to there civilian marksmanship program and used there.
The pistol is in used condition.It has some pitting on the frame. I cleaned it the best I could and took it to the range once and fired a box of 50rds through it. It functioned just fine except on FTE. I think its because I didnt have it lubed or it could have been the wolf ammo. After the range I cleaned it once again and put it away. It comes with 1 16rd mecgar mag. 

Price is firm. $300.00 (check Gunbroker for similar conditioned ones, then add in shipping and transfer fee) and I think this is a fair price. 
I can throw in 5 boxes of FMJ so 250rds for an extra 50 bucks. 
I added the hogue grip but can throw in the beat up wood grips that came with it just let me know.

The button is still there, but non functional.  The gun functions flawlessly.
