Marlin 70620 Model 60 Semi-Auto 22LR 19"" 14+1 Lam Hardwood Stock Blued

An economically priced rifle that's earned the title of ""most popular 22 in

represented one of America's finest rimfire values. It has a 19""
micro-groove rifled barrel, cross-bolt safety, manual bolt hold-open and a
patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open. The tubular magazine holds
up to 14 Long Rifle rounds. And with features such as its sleek
walnut-finished hardwood stock and a precision-crowned muzzle for enhanced
accuracy, it's easy to see why the Model 60 continues to be one of
America's best-selling rifles.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

Arkansas Concealed Carry Course Available

Act 746 of 2013 -- Moves defenses to certain ""carrying of weapon"" law to exceptions in ACA §5-73-120. This Act defines ""journey"" to be travel beyond the county in which the person lives. This Act defines ""knife"" as three inches or longer. This Act allows CHCL holders to possess a concealed handgun if they have a valid license and are not in a prohibited place. This Act becomes effective on approximately August 16, 2013.

With the law change under this Act, do I really need a CHCL? If you are always ""at home"" or on a ""journey outside the county in which you reside"" (which is a question of fact determined at the time of contact with law enforcement) and never travel outside of Arkansas, then you are correct, a person may not need a CHCL. However, if you travel inside the county or to another state and you want to carry a handgun, you will need a concealed handgun carry license. 

Does this Act allow ""open carry"" of a handgun? If the previous ""carrying a weapon"" law did not allow ""open carry"" of a handgun, then there are no changes in the law that would allow open carry. This law changes what the title states, made ""technical corrections""; such as moving the items (such as journey and having a CHCL) from defenses to exceptions. NOTE: in our opinion, ""journey"" does not mean you can open carry when you are in another county. That means your may possess a firearm in your vehicle (or other mode of transportation) beyond your county listed as your residence on your driver' license. But once you arrive at your destination (end of your journey), the only way you can carry a handgun legally is concealed with a valid CHCL.

*The only ""open carry"" bill this session was the ""open carry with a license"" bill by Rep Sue Scott (HB 1408) and that bill failed in House Judiciary Committee.

Act 1089 of 2013 -- Changes the CHCL reciprocity law to ""A person in possession of a valid license to carry a concealed handgun issued to the person by another state is entitled to the privileges and subject to the restrictions prescribed by this subchapter"". This Act deletes the provision that gives ASP the authority to determine reciprocity with other states. Under this Act ASP is no longer required or authorized to create or issue a list of reciprocal states. Arkansas CHCL holders traveling to another state with their handgun will need to check with that state to see if that state will honor their Arkansas concealed handgun carry license. Under this Act ""transfer"" applications will be accepted from any state that issues a CHCL. This Act becomes effective on approximately August 16, 2013."

you'll find guys dissing wasr's saying that they are garbage, crap, ect... Mine has always performed flawlessly for me & everyone else that has ever shot it. It has always been well maintained & kept oiled. I would not hesitate to use this rifle to defend my life if need be, without question.

I do not ""need"" to sell it and am firm on the price. Only reason I am selling is I don't shoot it as often as I'd like to now that I have kids and I could use the cash to put towards moving cost & buying a house. I don't really want to sell it & will gladly keep it if it does not sell, just giving someone else a chance to own a great reliable AK."

This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol. Click the below links to get magazines.

It is a Regent R350CR commander sized 1911 with rail chambered in .45 ACP. These firearms are made in Turkey therefore, a slightly better price than some of your other manufacturers like Springfield, Kimber, etc. but have great quality, accuracy, and dependability. The gun is in great shape with a few light handling marks here and there but overall like new condition. The gun has a low round count and honestly shoots just as well as my dads Springfield A1 Loaded. If you shot both firearms next to each other you would be shocked at how well this firearm performs for half the price. 

This gun is very easy to break down, similar to a Glock. Pull the slide halfway back, remove slide release pin by pushing from opposite side, and then the slide will slip right off the frame. No tools required. I have installed a Wilson Combat Magwell and a set of Ergo Hard-Rough Texture Grips. The gun will come as pictured with original hardcase, one Chip McCormick Powermag, and one original mag. Both function perfectly. Also included is a set of Pachmeyer overmold rubber grip inserts and the original rubber grips. I will also throw in a brand new Blackhawk Serpa retention holster. This holster has never been used or even worn! 

I bought this as a project gun with several ideas in mind but I have a new rifle on order and I need some optics, so this is one of many handguns I am selling. I am looking to get $525 for everything and I am willing to drive within a reasonable distance from Bloomington. . Thanks for looking!"

I remember my dad giving a solid block of rust when I was a kid.  After working for weeks. A Marlin 22 pump emerged with an octangle barrel pitted so evenly it resembled engraving.  I restored the rifle and refinished the wood; it became one of my fondest possessions.  Would you deny your kid that?

   Heavy duty compensator designed by noted custom gunsmith and 3-gun competitor Benny Hill employs a unique internal expansion chamber that redirects some of the combustion gas out a topside gas port to virtually eliminate muzzle climb. The sights stay on the target, so you can make exceptionally fast follow up shots. Precision machined from a solid billet of high-grade stainless steel, with large side ports that vent more gas to help reduce felt recoil. Solid bottom prevents dust signature when shooting close to the ground. Perfect for USPSA and 3-gun competition where seconds count, and for varmint hunters who want the sight to stay the target when they take a shot. Models available for rifles chambered in .223"

398,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2459398,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD FREE 45-70 MAG. +P 300 gr. TSX-FN (2350 fps) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 60,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 17, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=306

This is a super powerful 45-70+P loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on to them) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese Mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 300gr. TSX long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as they typical 350+gr. lead core expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and gives flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 2200+ fps is screaming and is powerful and for those that understand the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit to many shooters, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

2215 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22 inch barrel
2201 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18 inch barrel
Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

Stevens Favorite model 1894 Falling Block  .22 rim fire  20.5 in barrel, first 6.25 in octagon barrel.  Patent date is Apr 17 '94.  It is the take down model on which the user could change barrels and calibers.  On the right side of the rear sight, the manufacturer information is stamped in upside down.  Only one person has told me that they have even heard of this happening.

The serial number is R932.  From what I can piece together this was one of the second model (No. 17) of the 1894 Favorite.  On the left side of the rear sight it is marked ""22 LONG RIFLE"" most are marked ""22 RF"" 

The original bluing is gone.  A corner is broken off the butt plate.

I test fired the weapon, it works fine.  The safety (half-cock) is still functional.

I have a like new XD 9 Subcompact with one 13 round mag and one 16 round mag; a Stainless Steel Taurus PT92 with two 15 round mags, one 17 round mag, and two 18 round mags. Lastly, I have a Reck La Fury .25 caliber pocket pistol. It comes with one 7 round mag.

Thank you for looking!

For sale is a completely new Kel-Tec P11.  The P11 is widely known for it's reliability and easy concealment.  It is a 9mm pistol that has considerably more stopping power than the similar sized .380 pistols.  If you're not familiar with the P11, here is a good video review of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns_FGn_8dK4 I bought this pistol with the thought of having another relatively inexpensive 9mm to carry in one of my vehicles and not have to worry about possibly losing a $1500 high dollar Kimber or the like. I have had a P11 for quite a while now and it has never had a failure to fire so I bought this as a second one with intentions of using it as a 'stashed' pistol in another vehicle. However, I've found that I really don't mind just carrying my other little Kel-Tec. This is a very lightweight pistol that holds 10 +1 rounds (thus the 'P11' designation) of 9mm instead of other small pistols firing the .380 (9mm short). I have a lot more confidence in the stopping power of a 9mm over a .380. IMHO, you can't buy a more reliable yet inexpensive pistol than a Kel-Tec. You can own this pistol that has only been out of the box for pictures today for $275! Buyer must have valid IN identification and be legally able to purchase a firearm. Contact me with any questions."

The SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Only 1850 estimated SPAS-12 shotguns were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, meaning it can be set to cycle either semi-automatically or through pump-action. The SPAS-12 has sold well to military and police users around the world,[1] as well as to the civilian market, and has been featured in various movies and video games. The Franchi factory price in the last year of production 2000, listed for approx. USD. $1500.00 each shotgun for the worldwide market.- Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12

Legal Status in the United States
US firearm laws, in recent years, have universally blocked the importation of the SPAS-12 shotgun, because the shotgun fits under the profile of a military shotgun (which is defined as an illegal destructive device). Transfers and re-sales within the country are generally unobstructed, but few SPAS-12s are being imported from foreign countries. Additionally, in 2000 Franchi stopped production of the SPAS-12 altogether, and Franchi has since shifted its entire marketing focus towards the SPAS-15. Together, these drastic events have made the SPAS-12 a true collector's item both in the United States and abroad.

The Franchi SPAS-12 was a semi-automatic, 12-gauge shotgun noted for its variable-mode firing method in which the weapon could be fired via a gas-operated, semi-automatic mode (featuring self-loading) or a manually-actuated, pump-action / slide-action system. The SPAS-12 could, therefore, fire up to four rounds per second in the former mode, its dual-mode system managed by way of a two-position selector switch near the foregrip. The SPAS-12 was specifically designed as a combat shotgun and anti-riot measure but eventually marketed as a sporting system to civilians. Production of the series - handled by Luigi Franchi Development of Brescia, Italy (Franchi S.p.A), known for good quality shotguns - ran from 1979 to 2000 to which global operators became Austria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States. The Franchi firm was eventually sold to SOCIMI of Milan, which filed for bankruptcy in 1993, leaving Franchi to come under the experienced leadership of the famed Beretta concern. its imposing external characteristics made it a popular featured firearm in Hollywood films such as ""Terminator"", ""3,000 Miles to Graceland"", ""Underworld"" and ""Jurassic Park"".

Despite its futuristic appearance and dual-function fire mode, design of the SPAS-12 was somewhat conventional as a whole. The shoulder stock (detachable wooden, synthetic or folding metal) was appropriately set at the rear behind the pistol-type grip with the trigger system protected by an oblong ring. The receiver was mostly rectangular in shape with clean straight lines throughout and sported the cartridge ejection port along the right hand side. Perhaps the forend hand guard / slide of the SPAS-12 was its most identifiable design element, wrapping around the tube magazine fitted underneath the barrel. Shells were inserted into the tube magazine one behind the other. Sights were optional as were muzzle accessories, broadening the tactical scope of the weapon. General iron sighting was accomplished by a rear aperture and front blade arrangement. Beyond standard slug and spread rounds common to shotguns, the SPAS-12 could also ""fire less-than-lethal"" ammunition for the purposes of riot control - hence its interest by security parties. While fitted with an integrated lever safety, issues with the system resulted in a product recall.

There were few variations in the SPAS-12 production line and early forms were actually completed with a wooden fully detachable stock but this eventually gave way to the more common folding metal version. A synthetic stock was also later offered. The metal version could also be fitted with an optional folding underarm ""loop"" for improved single-handed firing - though this was always thought as impractical to most, considering the sheer weight and recoil of the weapon. The SPAS-12 family could subsequently be found sporting between 18- and 24-inch barrel systems and ammunition counts ranging from 5-, 6- and 8-rounds.

The SPAS-12 attempted to break the civilian sporting gun market but the system ultimately proved too unwieldy and generally complex for big game hunting or competition and the shotgun was eventually outlawed from import in the United States for its very ""militaristic"" features (high ammunition count, semi-automatic fire mode, heat shield for sustained firing, etc...). With the American gun market out of reach and global interest limited, Franchi ended production of their SPAS-12 in 2000. However, the lessons learned in its design and development went on to forge the later SPAS-15 series of automatic shotguns.

In the military market, the Franchi SPAS-12 found a home with Austria's EKO Cobra counter-terrorism units. Similarly, Indonesia fielded the SPAS-12 with their Komando Pasukan Katak and Komando Pasukan Khusus special warfare groups. Malaysia assigned the shotgun to their Special Operations Force and Bangladesh purchased the weapon in quantity for their Presidential Special Security Force. In the United States, SWAT teams were given access to the SPAS-12 for a time but the shotgun never found a permanent military home with the American military.

Incidentally, the acronym used to designate the SPAS-12 stood for ""Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun"", this being something of a psychological effort on the part of Franchi S.p.A. to help counter import bans and other restrictions arising within several countries by making the gun appear as more of a ""sporting"" system than the obvious. Regardless of its limitations and reach, the SPAS-12 went on to become one of the most recognizable shotguns in history.

On one side it is marked Olympic Arms and the other side it is marked Stevens 5100. It is by no means new. I do not exactly know when it was manufactured but from what I have found it could be as old as 1941. There is finish wear on the barrels as well as a bit on the receiver. Gun fires nicely and breaks clay pigeons nicely. It locks up nice and tight the receiver does not wiggle at all from the stock. The only issue is the action can get a little stiff once the barrels heat up from use and they will get fairly warm. Email me with any offers or questions. I am willing to add money for the right trade. I will NOT ship the gun. Do not ask.

U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4

MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

Elevation adjustable to 600 meters.
 Windage: 1/2 MOA 
 Elevation: 0-600m
 NSN 1005-01-484-8000 , PN# 12996812

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any .223 5.56  rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

G-10 Comp Grip Black
with the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite night sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The P938 is most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. 
Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.
