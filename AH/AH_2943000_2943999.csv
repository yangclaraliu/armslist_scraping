If you can find a new 320 Gb, then it won't be from the store. They stopped making them arter they sold out. It was limited because of the hard drive size. All games have no smudges or scratches. A RPG player or a collector's dream. Perfect games and great compilation of games. All bought this year or a few months before last year's end. These are NOT dime a dozen, or easy to come by games.

All of this for a nice gun. I do not own one piece of cheap electronics and can get up to twelve hundred more dollars for the right weapon. But I don't want to and need the rest of my money for other things, but when and if push comes to shove, I can offer $1400.00 of my money that I need for far more important things and the weapon is for a concealed weapon license to protect my father who was given two years to live a year and a half ago. One blow to his chest and he's dead. Point is, I want to keep him alive a lot longer than two years. I don't want your sympathy. I want this gun to protect my father and keep him alive two or much longer than that. So if you see something you want or must have, we can trade even up or I might add cash if your gun is worth it. Thanks. 

Call, text or e-mail me. Just be quick. I need a new gun sooner than later to protect his well-being and livelihood:

Restrictions apply for some areas in the US, please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Mec-Gar magazines are vastly less likely to mis-perform than any other aftermarket magazines. Mec Gar manufactures the factory magazines for many brands, including Browning, Beretta, Rock Island, and Kel-Tec. That is the reason, for example, that the cheap little Kel-Tecs are so reliable. Here are representatives of the Mec Gar 16 round blue steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols that were manufactured after 1991, and chambered in 9mm caliber. They will also fit the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. They will fit Bernardelli P01 and P18 Pistols, with some protrusion. They may not fit a Pre-B CZ75 manufactured before 1990. Manufacturer is Mec-Gar s.r.l. of Brescia, Italy. Importer is Mec-Gar USA of Meriden, CT. Mec Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is as slickly blued as a Colt Python, as the photos show. Each magazine holds 16 rounds of 9mm Ammunition – 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Our single mag price is $29 per.

It is a Hohner acoustic guitar in a black see-thru finish. I don't remember the model but I do know the nut and bridge are made from nu-bone (synthetic ivory) and the bridge is string-thru as opposed to the classic pin style.

It comes in a hard carry case along with an electric tuner, glass slide, humidifier, ""how to play guitar in every key"" and a few dozen picks in different sizes and thicknesses.

I'm located in Eli Whitney, which is south of Graham, and west of Carrboro. I prefer not to travel too far.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY	
         This listing is for THREE magazines; Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on.  Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  Here are special edition Mec-Gar 10 round magazines for the Browning Hi-Power Pistol. They fit only the Browning 1935 Hi-Power, its descendants and FEG clones, all of them Single Action. They will not fit a Browning BDM; will not fit a Beretta 92; will not fit the carburetor of a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air. They will only fit Browning Hi-Power Pistols and their FEG clones. Any shoppers who aren’t sure whether your Browning is a Hi-Power or a BDM, please see the attached instruction manual photos. Manuals are not included with this listing. These magazines came to us in their plastic wrappers, but no display boxes. These are circa 2003 – 2004 production for FN in Belgium and Browning in the United States. These magazines have never been loaded, fired, or inserted into a firearm. Photos show their original shipping cartons where they shipped from Manufacturer Mec-Gar S.R.L. in Brescia Italy, for Fabrique Nationale in Herstal Belgium. Importer was NOT Mec-Gar USA. Note the distinctive magazine release cut in the bodies, so designed for an experimental ambidextrous mag release Browning variant that never went into production. The FEG 9HP shown in some of our photos is not included. Mec-Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and extended floorplate assembly that limits what it will hold to ten rounds of 9mm ammunition: 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Some of them are marked only with the caliber on the body face, Caliber 9x19mm; and some have the words Made in Italy stamped on them. All these are part of a special buy we made, and we have substantial quantities of these magazines on hand at press time. Buyers will receive from the same lot as the photo specimens. Note the Mec-Gar sealing tape on the cartons. Normal retail pricing on any Mec-Gar magazine is upwards of $40 apiece; and if one has the Browning Deer Head logo on it, make that upwards of $60. Our Single Magazine Price is $24, but we have a separate ad for Single Magazine buyers. We’re offering these three at a time, however, for the wholesale level price of only $19 each.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. The old model Browning B.A.R. Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes. Here is the standard factory Magazine for those two most popular B.A.R. Rifles, the .270 Winchester and the venerable .30-06. These are brand new, never opened or chambered factory Browning Magazines in their factory packages just like they shipped from the factory several years after the Safari Mark II version was introduced in 1993. These magazines are not for the later Safari Mark II models with the bolt release lever; they are only for the Belgian and Belgian/Portuguese original B.A.R. Sporters manufactured from 1967 until 1993 which do not have an external bolt release lever. Each magazine will hold 4 rounds of .270 Winchester, .280 Remington, or .30-06 Springfield cartridges. Replacement pricing nowadays, if a person can even find One of these, is upwards of $75 apiece. Our single magazine price is $35.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

>>> This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. The old model Browning B.A.R. Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes. Here is the standard factory Magazine for the two highly popular short action B.A.R. Rifles, the .243 Winchester and the venerable .308. These are brand new, never opened or chambered factory Browning Magazines in their factory packages just like they shipped from the factory some 10 years ago when Browning discontinued the magazines. These magazines are not for the later Safari Mark II models with the bolt release lever; they are only for the Belgian and Belgian/Portuguese original B.A.R. Sporters manufactured from 1967 until 1993 which do not have an external bolt release lever. These magazines will hold 4 rounds of .243 Winchester or .308 Winchester caliber cartridges.

Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes.

This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. The old model Browning B.A.R. Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes. Here is the standard factory Magazine for those popular Magnum chambered B.A.R. Rifles, the .300 Winchester Magnum. These are brand new, never opened or chambered factory Browning Magazines in their factory packages just like they shipped from the factory some 10 years ago when Browning discontinued the magazines. These magazines are not for the later Safari Mark II models with the bolt release lever; they are only for the Belgian and Belgian/Portuguese original B.A.R. Sporters manufactured from 1967 until 1993 which do not have an external bolt release lever. These magazines will hold 3 rounds of .300 Winchester Magnum caliber cartridges. We are unclear as to whether these will work reliably in the 7mm Remington Magnum and .338 Magnum guns, but we have correct magazines for those two available for the same price. Replacement pricing nowadays, if a person can even find One of these, is upwards of $75 apiece. Our single magazine price is $35.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. The old model Browning B.A.R. Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes. Here is the standard factory Magazine for those popular Magnum chambered B.A.R. Rifles, the 7mm Remington Magnum. These are brand new, never opened or chambered factory Browning Magazines in their factory packages just like they shipped from the factory some 10 years ago when Browning discontinued the magazines. These magazines are not for the later Safari Mark II models with the bolt release lever; they are only for the Belgian and Belgian/Portuguese original B.A.R. Sporters manufactured from 1967 until 1993 which do not have an external bolt release lever. These magazines will hold 3 rounds of 7mm Remington Magnum caliber cartridges. We are unclear as to whether these will work reliably in the .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Magnum guns, but we have correct magazines for those two available for the same price at press time. Replacement pricing nowadays, if a person can even find One of these, is upwards of $75 apiece. Our single magazine price is $35.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each. Own 3	 	for only	$ 69.00.  Not for sale to residents of New York City. 
Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Replacement pricing on these in the past few months have run as high as $50 apiece. Our single magazine price is $29 per. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each.

I have 2 Safariland duty holsters for sale. I was cleaning out my safe and I came across these holsters for a G22 that I no longer own. 
First is a g280-832. 
This is a level 2 holster made for a Glock 22 or 17 with a light attached. 
I used it for about a year so it has some very slight wear. 
I never put a Glock 17 in it but it fits a Glock 22 perfectly. 
This holster retails new for $133 give or take. 
I would like $50. 

Second is a Safariland 6070 Raptor Level 3 Holster.
This is also for a Glock 22 but without the light. 
It has the Self Locking System and the Middle Finger Release Tab. 
It takes some practice to get used to drawing the holster but the retention is awesome. 
Online I found this one going for about $100. 
I bought this one a few years ago as a backup in case I need another holster but I switched to a Glock 21. 
I would like $ 50 .

If you want to buy both I'll drop the price to $75.

This listing is for THREE magazines, single magazine buyers please see our separate ad or feel free to contact us. In our experience, factory magazines work best, especially for Colt pistols. Like the pistols themselves, the factory mags are smooth and slick; they work like they're supposed to. For Colt Pistols, the factory magazines enhance their value for resale and collectability. That holds true for any other brand or clone of the venerable 1911 pistols; and this magazine works in any 1911 Government Pistol, including Colt Clones Armscor, Detonics, Kimber, Smith & Wesson, and Taurus. Manufacturer is most likely Check-Mate Industries of New York, principal factory magazine supplier for Colt Pistols and arch-competitor Smith & Wesson for many years. Construction is entirely stainless steel, from the top of the stainless cartridge follower to the bottom of the Rampant Colt factory logo floorplate. Each Magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP / 45 Automatic Ammunition. Our onesy twosy single mag price is $29 each, and we usually have a separate ad on single mags. We're offering these fine magazines, the real thing, in lots of 3 or more, however, for only $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Restrictions apply on high capacity magazines in some jurisdictions of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Any current production quality polymer magazines, like the MOE Produced Smith & Wessons, owe a debt to Canadian Company Thermold. Ever since they came onto the market 20 years ago, Thermold brand, now Master Molder, magazines have been outstanding. They work. They do not necessarily free-fall or lock the bolt open, but they feed a mag full. These are not to be confused with the Eagle or Ram-Line magazines of the early 1990s; these are quality magazines. Manufacturer is Master Molder, aka Thermold Design & Development, of Wilson, NC, and Sandy Springs, GA. This magazine holds 20 cartridges or rounds of .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO ammunition; construction is high impact beveled graphite-based polymer. All these are brand new magazines. Sometimes they come to us packaged, other times shipped in bulk. We’re always glad to get them. Our Single Mag, onesy twosy price, is $20 per. We’re offering these fine magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $12.00 each. Own 3 for only $ 36.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL , Cook County / Chicago IL, California, Connecticut, Colorado, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where 20 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement. Not for sale to civilian owners of Bushmaster or Kel-Tec .223 caliber Pistols in Hawaii.

Any current production quality polymer magazines, like the MOE Produced Smith & Wessons, owe a debt to Canadian Company Thermold. Ever since they came onto the market 20 years ago, Thermold brand, now Master Molder, magazines have been outstanding. They work. They do not necessarily free-fall or lock the bolt open, but they feed a mag full. These are not to be confused with the Eagle or Ram-Line magazines of the early 1990s; these are quality magazines. Manufacturer is Master Molder, aka Thermold Design & Development, of Wilson, NC, and Sandy Springs, GA. This magazine holds 15 cartridges or rounds of .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO ammunition; construction is high impact beveled graphite-based polymer. All these are brand new magazines. Sometimes they come to us packaged, other times shipped in bulk. We're always glad to get them. For civilian buyers who reside in jurisdictions where twenty round magazines are not restricted to Law Enforcement only may sub twenty rounders at the same price; excludes Aurora IL, Cook County / Chicago IL, California, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, and New York. Our Single Mag, onesy twosy price, is $20 per. We’re offering these fine magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $16.00 each. Own 3 for only $ 48.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, D.C., Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 11 round or higher magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Any current production quality polymer magazines, like the MOE Produced Smith & Wessons, owe a debt to Canadian Company Thermold. Ever since they came onto the market 20 years ago, Thermold brand, now Master Molder, magazines have been outstanding. They work. They do not necessarily free-fall or lock the bolt open, but they feed a mag full. These are not to be confused with the Eagle or Ram-Line magazines of the early 1990s; these are quality magazines. Manufacturer is Master Molder, aka Thermold Design & Development, of Wilson, NC, and Sandy Springs, GA. This magazine holds 10 cartridges or rounds of .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO ammunition; construction is high impact beveled graphite-based polymer. All these are brand new magazines. Sometimes they come to us packaged, other times shipped in bulk. We're always glad to get them. For civilian buyers who reside in jurisdictions where twenty round magazines are not restricted to Law Enforcement only may sub twenty rounders at the same price; excludes Aurora IL, Cook County / Chicago IL, California, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and South Bend IN. Our Single Mag, onesy twosy price, is $25 per. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $16.00 each. Own 3 for only $ 48.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. In our experience, factory magazines work best, especially for Colt pistols. Like the pistols themselves, the factory mags are smooth and slick; they work like they're supposed to. For Colt Pistols, the factory magazines enhance their value for resale and collectability. That holds true for any other brand or clone of the venerable 1911 pistols; and this magazine works in any 1911 Government Pistol, including Colt Clones Armscor, Detonics, Kimber, Smith & Wesson, and Taurus. Manufacturer is most likely Check-Mate Industries of New York, principal factory magazine supplier for Colt Pistols and arch-competitor Smith & Wesson for many years. Construction is entirely stainless steel, from the top of the stainless cartridge follower to the bottom of the Rampant Colt factory logo floorplate. Each Magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP / 45 Automatic Ammunition. Our onesy twosy single mag price is $39 each, and we usually have a separate ad on single mags. We're offering them, the real thing, in lots of 3 or more, however, for only $26	each. Own 3	for only  	$ 78.00.	Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.
