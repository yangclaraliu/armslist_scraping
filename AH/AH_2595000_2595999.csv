For sale, Olin Kodensha Nikko E-712 (Winchester 101) competitively priced for a quick sale. Sale of this shotgun will fund another project.

Nikko E-712, 28"" Solid Rib, 12ga Over and Under. Fixed chokes(full/mod). Hand engraved/ Hand checkered. This model is rarer than the standard EVB-712. This gun was made on the exact same tooling as ALL Winchester model 101's. The only difference is this gun has hand selected, first pick stocks(wood) and a nickel coated receiver(as opposed to blued like 101's. This gun is manufactured and assembled by the same people contracted to manufacture 101's. It uses the same parts.

Condition: This firearm is considered ""good"" condition, and was recently purchased from On Target Guns of Kalamazoo, hand picked and recommended by the owner(Eric) as one of the best over and unders on the shelves @ that price point ($800-$1200USD) IMO its metal is 75-80%, wood is 85-90%, bore is 90-95% and very shiny. The gun has a natural patina visible in artificial light. In daylight the bluing looks great. There are some  blemishes as expected in an older gun and are only cosmetic and do not effect function in any way. I have added 10 ounces of shot in a custom configuration that noticeably reduces felt recoil by 20-40%. The added weight is removable and placed in the butt stock bolt hole, behind the factory butt plate. Butt stock cast right for right hand shooters. It shoulders very naturally for a med-large person. I weigh 165ish, and my brother weighs 220ish, and we both agree that it is very comfortable to operate.

This gun shoots better than my 2000 dollar Beretta O/U. It was assembled by Japanese for Japanese. It was not meant for westerner devils and was treated with more care and
respect because of this. That's one reason for the nickel plating and hand selected first pick french hardwood blanks.

This gun performs awesome! It locks up tight and performs extremely accurately. It breaks tight, and not at all loose or sloppy. It features auto ejectors and boy do they kick out those empties with a positive ""click""! The box type lock lever is visually cast to the right of center indicating very minimal usage. As over and unders wear, the lever will slowly drift leftward indicating heavy usage. That is NOT the case here.

This gun is my first choice field gun and I have walked with it during the 2013-2014 upland game season. It has more belt ""notches"" than my Italian O/U. It swings great and handles perfect. Tang mounted, selectable trigger with integrated safety. The only thing I have done mechanically is remove the stock and action covers, clean years of dust and garbage out, in kerosene parts washer, and greased with white lithium grease, and resealed.

I have found another interest which, to me, outweighs these features. Therefor it must go to appease the wife. Pfft! -'Grumbles ""happy wife, happy bla bla bla"" under breath'.

What does all of this mean to you?

It means you get a great gun at a great price. First 700 takes it! This is a firm, fair price and not priced high to make you feel like you got a great deal because you talked me down to 700. I have many gun sales under my belt and I know this will be a quick one.

Because of serious requests to reduce price, PRICE REDUCED TO 600 OBO! One time reduction.

Good luck, and Thanks for looking! Next owner will not be dissatisfied!"

Yugo SKS

The SKS series created by a soviet named Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov is truly a success in the firearm industry. Why? Looking at the variety of SKS released today, why won’t it be a success? China’s success in the marketing of SKS series is the biggest example that Sergei’s masterpiece was truly influential to several countries. Russia, East Germany, Romania, North Korea, Albania, China etc. had their own variations of the SKS series. But what would be the best in quality? The Yugo SKS would be the best among the rest.

Yugo SKS with Grenade Launcher

Today, the most popular SKS rifles are the ones made by Yugoslavia particularly the Yugoslavian Model 59/66. Updated versions of this model had a 22 mm grenade launcher attached to it which is a very good addition to boost up the firepower and capabilities of the Yugoslavian Model 59/66. In combination with the 22 mm grenade launcher is a Front Sight with a fold-up ladder for a better grenade shooting accuracy. Because of the addition of the grenade launcher, manufacturers of the Yugoslavian Model 59/66 made adjustments for safety precautions of the users. When the grenade launcher sight is lifted up, the gas system is blocked for safety and the action of the gun must be manually cycled up to get back to its original status. Another means for safety precaution is that the grenade launcher can only be fired if the cartridge is empty. The stock is made up of Beech wood which is actually a fine piece of wood.

The first releases of the Yugoslavian SKS models were high-quality and still lives up to the reputation today. Newly released models actually had a very considerable price and if not taken as soon as possible, prices may climb to enormous heights and make the model expensive enough to consider. So it is advisable for firearm collectors to hastily purchase one because the demand for the Yugo SKS is actually high. It isn’t really a surprise because the Yugoslavian variants lived up to the reputation they made. They created variants that are very good in quality. They are highly durable, has high accuracy, incredible add-ons, incredible design, probably exceptional in all aspects. For collectors, the Yugoslavian SKS is a must have."

I'm looking for a decent 12 gauge shotgun, preferably a pump action.  I like the Mossberg 500's, and Remington 870's, and the Browning BPS's as well.  If you have another option, I will entertain any suggestions.  Typical used condition is fine.  I'm looking for function, not beauty.

Please no home defense shotguns.  I have one.  I'm looking for a hunting/recreational trap shooting gun. (I know, it's not a top notch gun for trap.  Don't worry, I'm not a top notch trap shooter!)  

Also, I know Mossy's were going for $289.00 around Christmas for the field/slug barrel combo in the 500 model.  I just don't have the cash.  They were $299 at Dicks and $289 at Dunhams.  So please, don't offer your 500 Mossy, used, with no slug barrel/scope for $300.  Guys, only special guns go up in price.  The shotguns I seek don't go up in price with use.  I know what the kel-tecs are worth, and I'm not kidding myself about it.  

One is a P-11, a 10 shot 9mm (11 with one in the chamber).  It is of typical used condition.  It works perfectly, and has never failed with the 200+ rounds I have fired through it.  No FTE, no FTF.  Just pull the trigger and bang.  With it comes a Desantis pocket holster.  I only have one magazine for it.

The other is a P3-AT.  One of the smallest .380's on the market, and it slips easily into the pocket.  I have 2 different holsters to go with it as well as the box.  I didn't fire it as much because .380 was hard to find for a while.  But it always functioned fine. I only shot FMJ's through it.  If you buy that one, I have a few boxes of .380 FMJ to go with it.

If we do a trade, the pistols have to go through an FFL, at your cost.  

Thanks for reading this far!"

    Then take the remaining thirty rounds and shoot ten three shot  groups, cleaning the barrel thoroughly after each group and allowing it  to cool completely before firing the next group.  Once ten, three shot  groups have been fired the barrel is adequately broken in.  At this  point the rifle can be sighted in and used.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.

FROM BURRIS WEBSITE:

Burris AR-536 is designed for lawmen, military, and competitive shooters who want additional range from a compact, fast- acquisition optic. The red or green illuminated reticle offers nano-second response to immediate targets but also allows for careful shooting at distant threats. A rotary, 10-position power selector allows for all lighting conditions and the reticle is powered by a CR2032 battery. The Ballistic CQ reticle features holdover dots, good out to 600 yards, that work best with 5.56 or 7.62 ammunition.

The sight has Picatinny rails for piggy-backing additional sights, lasers or lights. The entire design is rugged and backed by the Forever Warranty."

The ammo you see in the photos includes (3) 20rd pmags color coded with specific types of defensive ammo that stay in the case with the rifle.  I also have 30rd pmags and several hundred rounds of 5.56 and .223 ammo.  I can provide a complete breakdown upon request.   

I added up prices and figure there’s about $2,500 worth of gear in this package.  I do not want to separate the gear.  I’m looking for the right buyer who wants the total shooters package.  I can provide further photos and/or a complete breakdown of all the gear and prices if requested.

Please, serious inquiries only.  As mentioned, I am not interested in breaking the gear apart.  
_______________________________________________________________________
UPDATE - I looked around armslist to find what this gear would go for if purchased seperately.  I remove the price outliers (extreme highs and lows) and found the following averages:

Colt 6920 w Magpul gear - $1200
(5) 30rd pmags @ $15 ea = $75
(3) 20rd pmags @ $12 ea = $35
Vortex 3-9 Crossfire = $160
Vortex Strikefire = $150
Magpul MS4 sling = $55

Some stuff is difficult to determine used pricing for but here's the retail price with what I feel is a good used price in ($).

Front rail w tac light $60 ($50)
Noveske QD end plate $25 ($25) These can be a pain to install, since I already did it I'm charging the full price of the end plate.
MSA forward sling attachment $25 ($20)
Plano tac case $100 and Drago soft case $60 ($150)
Ammo $400-$500 ($200)

Total = $2,120.  Based on USED prices there's still over $2,000 worth of gear in this package.  I'll be looking for offers of over $2,000.  Any less and I won't respond.  I don't NEED to sell this gear and I'm not looking to get screwed.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."

This young fellow wants to get a firearm quickly without the credentials.
I asked him if he had a concealed Carry permit or VA Voters card and he said no.  I told him that I would not risk making any deals with him...  He then proceeded to be disrespectful and send me text messages for two days.  I was working and could not return the texts.  He continued to use foul language, etc... when I refused to make the trade with him. He THEN asked me to sell the gun to his brother who had the credentials so that he could then give it to him... I once again told him no.
Be careful when dealing with this guy...  IN fact... do not deal with this guy.  If he wants a firearm, he can go to an FFL and get one, or get the proper credentails needed to buy one on here."

From the manufacturer:

The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry
firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless
appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. PPK/S is the 1968
""Sport"" version, with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931 design. The
top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

Designed for professionals, the GLOCK 17, in 9x19, is one of the most widely used law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 rounds in the standard magazine, and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers around the globe. With Glock's revolutionary ""Safe Action"" trigger system, the G17 9x19 pistol is safe, easy, and quick-just what you need in high-pressure situations. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.
