This rifle is beautiful!!! MSRP new is $930 and that's without a scope so $800 is a steal!! Functions flawlessly and is just incredibly beautiful while maintaining functionality. I have the original box and paperwork for the rifle and scope. Only 22 rounds fired through the gun. Also has iron sights.

The barrel is a 6 land, 6 groove match grade with the proper profile to support most suppressors. The muzzle brake tolerances are within .002 and warrantied for life. 
I broke this rifle in by cleaning the barrel after the each of the first 40 shots.  For each cleaning, I removed the barrel and scrubbed it.  After replacing the barrel, it maintained zero.  After the 40 cleanings, I shot a 10 shot group at 100 yards.  9 of the 10 were under a dime.  I have not fired this rifle since.  Total rounds: 50.  Cost new was $5131.00.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The Bushmaster is a model XM15 and it comes with a 30 round magazine, (2) picatanny mounts for optics, a sling, and owners manual. It is chambered in 5.56/.223 and comes with a 16"" chrome lined M4 profile barrel with a 6 position lightweight collapsible stock. 

Here is a link to Bushmaster for more info on this rifle: https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/XM-15.asp#myModal-90391

Purchased both these items back in January of this year, had every intention of taking the AR out when it got warm, but priorities changed and I'm on to bigger and better things. That said, I don't NEED to sell so please no low ball offers. Thanks.

Paid roughly $1300 for both items with tax, shipping, FFL fees, etc. Since they are both still new and unused, looking to get $1200 OBO. I would prefer to sell as a package, but I am not opposed to selling the AR or EOTech separately. 

If you buy the package I will also include a brand new Balckhawk fully modular tactical soft carrying case. It easily fits this rifle (including the EOTech) with plenty of room for many other items such as mags, ammo, etc. Also included is 40 rounds of quality brass ammo. 

Must be 18 to purchase with valid ID. CCW preferred. FTF only. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. Might consider trades for 9mm semi-auto pistol (no junk please). Cash either way to even out. Thanks for looking."

The Bushmaster is a model XM15 and it comes with a 30 round magazine, (2) picatanny mounts for optics, a sling, and owners manual. It is chambered in 5.56/.223 and comes with a 16"" chrome lined M4 profile barrel with a 6 position lightweight collapsible stock. 

Here is a link to Bushmaster for more info on this rifle: https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/XM-15.asp#myModal-90391

The EOTech is a model 512. Waterproof, submersible to 10 ft. Mounts to Picatinny rail with return-to-zero after remounting. Run time is 1,000 continuous hours on lithium batteries, 600 hours with two AA batteries. 5""L x 1.8""W x 2.25""H. Weight: 11.5 oz.

Purchased both these items back in January of this year, had every intention of taking the AR out when it got warm, but priorities changed and I'm on to bigger and better things. That said, I don't NEED to sell so please no low ball offers. Thanks.

Paid roughly $1300 for both items with tax, shipping, FFL fees, etc. Since they are both still new and unused, looking to get $1200 OBO. I would prefer to sell as a package, but I am not opposed to selling the AR or EOTech separately. Prices are $800 (Bushmaster) and $400 (EOTech) OBO. 

If you buy the package I will also include a brand new Balckhawk fully modular tactical soft carrying case. It easily fits this rifle (including the EOTech) with plenty of room for many other items such as mags, ammo, etc. Also included is 40 rounds of ammo. 

Must be 18 to purchase with valid ID. CCW preferred. FTF only. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. Might consider trades for 9mm semi-auto pistol (no junk please). Cash either way to even out. Thanks for looking."

I have only put about 100rds downrange from it, and every single one has fired flawlessly. Cleaned, oiled, and ready to go. It's pretty self explanatory, but ask any questions you need.

I'm looking to sell or trade. I'm open to pretty much anything. Pistols, rifles, shotguns. Less value, you add cash, greater and I'll add some. There are some things I have more or less interest in, but I'm really open to any offers. Let me know what you've got, and as always, cash is king. 450 obo if not a trade.

I can drive around most of Atlanta and the Northern / Southern regions with enough notice, such as down towards Macon / Columbus or up near Woodstock / Buford / Gainsville.
