nightforce 3.5 x 15 x 50 with the NPR-1 recticle mounted in the provided OBR mount-NF is the non zerstop and MOA knobs model 
-scope has all the factory stuff as well as box.

This rifle shoots amazingly well-with PMC 147gr plinking ammo, i was getting 1-1.5"" fairly easy. with PPU 168gr match/Fiocchi 168gr match/federal 168gr gmm, it was about .5 or better depending on how well i shot. like i said, its a lazer.

Will ship in a hard case. Would like to keep this together as a whole set up-will only split the scope from rifle, if i have it all spoken for.

Would like to get 2785 shipped for the whole deal. If you look at whats added to the rifle(BUIS, bipod) this is a really good deal for a barely used OBR."

In the end, the Winchester Model 67 couldn’t compete with the Marlin 60 and Winchester discontinued production in 1960.  A single-shot .22 is about as basic a rifle as one can imagine.  The bolt-action Winchester Model 67 in particular is about as basic as a gun can get, and yet it still has a certain charm.

The 67 has a few unique design features.  The receiver and barrel are a single unit forged from the same steel.  The rifle is essentially a takedown unit, since only a single broad screw needs to be removed to pull it out of the stock.  That stock is a nicer piece of walnut than one usually finds on high-priced production rifles today.  The open sights are serviceable enough for typical plinking inside of 50 yards.  I suppose that you could scope one of these if you really wanted to, but you will have to have a gunsmith drill and tap it for the mount (which would have to be custom made) and by the time all is said and done you could buy a newer scoped rifle for less money.  Note that this model has been out of production since the 1960’s and parts can be hard to come by.

The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

It came on a rifle I bought and while I really like the scope, a 30/30 just doesn't feel right with a scope on it. Scope has ring marks on the rear ring location that I tried to photograph very well, but other than that the scope appears to be in great shape. It was mounted using warne bases and burris rings. The scope is gloss, which is hard to find these days and looks great on a nicely blued gun. The adjustments are click adjustable coin slots. 

I can't find a technical spec sheet on this model scope, but it is about 9.25"" long and the optics seem plenty clear to me. If there ever is a problem, Leupold has a superb warranty. The new version of the scope, the vx3, appears to be the same size and weight so here is the link to it http://www.midwayusa.com/product/136211691 0/leupold-vx-3-rifle-scope-15-5x-20mm?cm_vc=ProductFinding  maybe it will help you with technical info. This scope is perfect for a lightweight rifle, a carbine, or any rifle that you don't want to overwhelm with a giant scope.

Like I said, I really am loathe to let this go, I just don't have a particular use for it at this time. So price is non-negotialbe. look them up on ebay and they have been selling for between 275 and 300 for the most part.

It was originally bought for a Ruger LCP but it won’t fit mine since I have the Crimson Trace Laser sight on it too, so I’m selling it.  I don’t have the box but I have the holster and paperwork, as shown in the pics.  No guns are included, just the holster!  

Deep concealment and amazing affordability combine in Galco’s Tuck-N-Go™, which builds on the success of the enduring USA/UDC tuckable holsters and the huge popularity of the Stow-N-Go IWB.

The Tuck-N-Go's open top allows a fast draw once the concealing garment is swept up and away, while the reinforced mouth allows a smooth and easy return to the holster. For the utmost in conceal ability, the holster features Galco's patented Generation III tuckable J-Hook. The Gen III J-Hook’s streamlined design hooks over the pants and behind the belt, hooking upward and only showing a small piece at the bottom. A tucked-in shirt will completely conceal your firearm.

The Tuck-N-Go carries the handgun in a vertical orientation, with no cant or angle. Constructed of comfortable premium Center Cut Steerhide™, the Tuck-N-Go fits belts up to 1 1/2"".

Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the Tuck-N-Go is available in right and left hand designs in natural finish.

I have been told that this holster will work on the below pistols, and others, but I have not tried it with these guns.  If you go to the Galco site (https://www.galcogunleather.com/) and then enter “TUC436” into the search box on top of the screen, you can then see what guns it is supposed to fit.

Today I am listing a new in box, never fired Colt M4/M16 22 rimfire rifle for sale.
I bought this about a month ago for my wife, now she decided  she doesn't want a rifle at all .
I have too many guns so shes up for sale (the colt 22).
This is absolutly new in the box, its never been fired,or even taken out of the box yet for that matter.
Everything is there,all the manuals, the trigger lock and a 30 round mag, everything.
This  one sweet little rifle,full metal construction, not the cheap plastic like the smith and mossy toys out there.
This one feels like the real thing.
Checking the various prices from locations on the net, they range anywhere from 469.00 on line, 539.00 in local stores was the lowest I seen and wait for it- to all the way up to 699.00 (Gander Mountain-Yikes!!)
Then you have to add taxes,shipping and or ffl fees and any way you look at it your over 500.00.
Save yourself some cash, and have it today.
Im going to ask 450.00 picked up, Im losing over 65.00 on this so my price is firm,it is brand new.
Any questions?
Please call me at 9two0 -987- 51one2
Thanks for checking out my listing."

That time of year again where I buy out the brass from a Wisconsin police range. Range does not allow reloads. This time they quit offering 40 and 45 so officers had to bring their own so as you can imagine there is very little other than 9mm that they supply. In fact having processed all of it there was less than 1/2 of a small coffee can that isn't 9mm. This year they also did more small purchases so there are several brands from Winchester, CBC and FC.

So, only 9mm available this year. Polished. $30 clean and tumbled per 1000. Only have 850 pounds this year :-) 500 lbs left 4/15 350 4/24

Super nice vest, and extremely difficult to get ahold of. This vest will hold up to size large plates (10x12) front and back. It is Flame Resistant (FR) and 30% lighter than the average vest. If you know anything about Grey Ghost Gear then you know this is a high end, high quality piece of equipment. I will include the side plate pockets with the vest. There are a lot of unique features to this vest such as the drag handle being sewn down the sides of the back panel in a MOLLE style pattern, making it great for routing your Comms Cables and/or Hydration Tube while giving it added strength and durability. Another fun feature is a dual access pocket/admin pouch built in to the top front panel, great for holding documents, gloves, or used as a hand warmer when the weather is rough. These are just two out of multiple features that you wont find on any other rig. Cummerbun and shoulder straps are adjustable for a custom fit. The size Large reffers to the size plates it will hold. This is customizable to fit most people. I am short and chubby and it can adjust to fit me perfect while still able to fit a much taller, much skinnier person just as well. Any questions, just ask."

Just the gun. No paperwork, box, etc.

Based on the serial number (35192x) and diamond grips, this Model 36 can be dated to between 1962 and 1968. The serial number is much closer to 1962, for what that's worth. That's as close as I've been able to get on the date.

1962 = starts at 295000
1969 = ends at 786544
1968 - diamond grips end

I really have no idea how to rate this thing, so I tried to get some photos that would accurately represent it's condition. I'd say it looks pretty darn good for it's age, but I'm far from an expert on these older guns. I thought about using some bronze wool to clean it up a bit, but I didn't want my first attempt to be with this gun. I'll leave that to someone who knows what they are going. While it isn't in perfect condition, it appears to have been shot very little. 

As far as the price goes, they really seem all over the place. I tried to go with something in the middle. If I am way off (either way), please feel free to let me know. 

$475 - I prefer cash, but am willing to listen to possible trades.

I am located in Springfield, but am willing to meet within reason. I work out of Nashville, and travel throughout Middle Tennessee during the week.

Please excuse the pictures. No matter how much I wiped it down, there were always streaks."

The Kestrel 4000 Pocket Weather Meter is the baseline wind and weather meter in the Kestrel 4000 series. What sets the 4000 series apart from the rest of the Kestrel family is that these high tech weather meters have the capability to store up to 2000 points of weather data, enabling you to track changes in the environment over time. This unique function opens up an entirely new realm of weather tracking capabilities for Kestrel Weather Meter users.

For military professionals, the Desert Tan NV version of the Kestrel 4000 features a night-vision preserving backlight. The backlight incorporates optical filter to reduce overall brightness and minimize blue and green spectrum light to preserve night vision. 

The advantage the Kestrel 4000 provides to scientists, athletes, firefighters, automotive technicians, and agricultural specialists is immeasurable. With Kestrel 4000 technology, you will not only know the current weather conditions, but be able to track changes in the environment and therefore make predictions as to what may happen next.


The Kestrel 4000 accurately measures:

Barometric pressure
Pressure trend
Altitude
Relative humidity
Heat stress index
Dew point
Wet bulb temperature
Air, water, and snow temperature
Current wind speed, maximum wind gust & average wind speed

Most of us prefer 98 Mausers to the Russian M91/30 Mosin-Nagant, but the Mosin won in the Red Army’s hands against the Nazis with their Mausers. From Ukrainian Government arsenals comes this very attractive lot of the WWII Red Army’s principal battle rifle. It is representative of the one that the buyer will receive. Manufacturers, from their Delta character chamber marking, or from their Star with Arrow marking was Izhevsk Mechanical Plant or Tula Arsenal in the Russian cities by those names. Each rifle is Import stamped on its chamber area, and renumbered for its serial number of record by order of the BATFE. Original numbers match on the bolt, receiver, and magazine, but those are not to be used as the serial number of record any longer for purposes of compliance with U.S. Law.  Construction is entirely blued steel, with white steel bolt. Bolt is pull cocker Mauser type with 90 degree throw; and the firing mechanism will rest with a depressed trigger throw. Stock is beveled two piece Russian hardwood, steel escutcheon slotted for tab style leather sling. Caliber is 7.62x54R, one of the most plentiful and most effective hunting rounds in the world. Magazine is straight line steel box type with swivel floorplate, designed for, but not requiring, 5 round stripper clips. Capacity is 5+1 rounds.  Barrel is 29 inch 1:10 right hand 4 groove. Sights are flat steel military rear square notch, calibrated from 100 to 2000 meters; front sight is steel hood protected blade type. The front sight interlocks with bayonet hardware and serves as its lug; original issue but non matching 4 flute 17 inch bayonet is included. Weight empty is 8.8 pounds, with center of gravity at the chamber. Overall length is 48 1/2 inches, with 13 1/4 inch length of pull from the trigger face to the center of the curved steel buttplate. Each rifle has been professionally Ukrainian Armorer refinished, with excellent marking preservation. Stock cartouches are Ukrainian. Surface detractions are minimal; we rate these rifles as Excellent Refinish, 90 percent or better. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bores are Very Good, etchy texture rifling grooves but fully pronounced lands throughout. Chamber and mechanism are bright, clean, and excellent. We’re offering this attractive, serviceable, collectable World War II Soviet 91/30, the one in the photos or one of its substantially identical mates, each	for only	$ 149.00.

Rifle comes with 11 mags.  Three 42 round mags and eight 30 round mags.  Not willing to separate the gun from the magazines, so make sure you include their value in any trade.  I can include the optic as well but if you don't want it no big deal.  It is a PA fixed 3x CQB style scope for $150 on top of the mags and rifle.

Looking to trade not sell outright, I can do trades plus cash.  Guns I am interested in.  20 ga over/unders or side by sides, brands like Beretta, Browning, Caesar Guerini, and Fox.  Winchester Feather weight in 300 Win mag or 338.  Will consider other hunting bolt action rifles in 300 Win mag or 338.  C93's, 20"" A2 or A4 AR 15 rifles.  AK's in 7.62x39, Arsenal or kit builds with original import barrels.  No Yugo Ak's please.  Sig 226's or 229's (no DAK please).  FAL's.  Nor C&R rifles please.

This gun has been a safe queen.  I am in no rush to get rid of this gun, if the right trade doesn't come along I have no issue keeping it forever.  If you make a trade offer make sure and include what you think your gun(s) are worth plus any cash you plan on adding to the deal or what cash you expect in the deal (if applicable).  If you expect full retail for your gun, I will expect retail for mine.  

I typically value guns at the middle priced auctions on gunbroker."
