To the best of our knowledge this rifle dates to 1958. This gun has definitely been used alot but everything seems to be in working and shooting condition. The but plate is cracked and missing a piece, the collar near the muzzle is missing a pin which causes the magazine tube to move a bit. The stock and forearm has nicks and scratches, the bluing has some wear and pitting. This rifle would make someone a nice project. If this listing is still up the firearm is still for sale.

Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about.

A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy and with the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight makes it great at night.

-	Front sight bead

Practically new… only shot a few rounds through it, cleaned it and put it up.  Have the box, papers, lock, etc...  

Added the BlackHawk Knoxx recoil reducing adjustable stock.  This is a great stock as it greatly reduces the kick when shooting defensive rounds like double or triple 00 buck, etc... Has a nice butt pad plus the recoil reducing spring technology and has 6 (I think, maybe 7) adjustable positions to match the shooter and the situation.

Does have a mark (not a scratch) on the barrel where something rubbed against it (see picture - looks much worse than it is).  I’m sure it can be removed but I haven’t tried.

FTF in Greensboro and all laws will be followed.

202,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2571202,For Sale:  Greentrees 48 Plant hydroponic container gardening system,"Roxboro, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, January 16, 2014",Farming,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Multi Flow Hydroponic System

Multi Flow Hydroponic SystemThe Multi Flow System is basically an ebb & flow type hydroponic system that uses gravity as its major source of moving water through the system. The brains of this system is a controller unit assembly which consists of a 3.5 gallon container, with a timer and relay box mounted on the side, and float switches mounted inside of it to control the level of water in the system automatically. Each timer pin on the controller has a duration of 15 minutes which allows for better control over watering cycles. Each pin pushed down on the timer will water the system for 15 minutes. This is an advantage over most 30 minute increment timers because the plants really only need to be watered to the point the roots are saturated and then the water should be drained out. Also, because this system is an ebb & flow system, as the water is drained out it actually pulls oxygen down to the roots.

""So how does this system actually work,"" you ask? Well its actually very simple. First of all you must layout all of the pots and set them up on a level surface. Then connect the pots together using various fittings and tubing (included). Once you have done this you plug the power cord of the pump in the reservoir into the controller unit and set your watering times. When the timer reaches the watering time you have selected, the pump turns on inside the reservoir pumping nutrient solution into the controller unit. This will continue pumping into the controller while gravity is then pushing the water out to the other pots. Once the desired watering level is reached the float switches will then cut the power to the pump in the reservoir. As long as the timer is on the system will maintain this watering level. Once the timer turns off, the pump inside the controller is engaged and the nutrient solution is then pumped back into the reservoir. This will continue until the water level reaches the preset drain depth then the pump will be turned off. Since the pumps are only pumping a short distance, to and from the reservoir, wear and tear is greatly reduced and will ensure that your pumps last for a long time.

Multi Flow Schematic

The two gallon pots used in the Multi Flow allow your plants to grow strong and tall while giving them a spacious container to produce a large root structure. The two gallon growing containers actually sit inside of other two gallon pots which serve as the watering cells.� So, all the growing containers can be pulled out and moved around according to plant growth. You are not stuck trying to re-layout the system and cut new tubing or relocate a bunch of drippers, all you do is pull the plant and growing container out and move it to a new location. It couldn't be any easier to move your smaller plants directly under the lights and move your larger plants out to the perimeter of the room to promote uniform growth throughout the grow room. ""Versatility"" is the key word when describing the Multi Flow. It is easily expanded to a system consisting of up to 48 pots available with the 6 add on pot expansion.

Hydroponics, gardening without soil














A hydroponic garden can be as simple as a plant in a pot filled with rock or some other type of inert growing media, that is watered by hand. The water must contain the elements required for plant growth that the plant doesn't get from the air. Water mixed with these elements is called the ""nutrient solution"".









Flora NutrientThe elements required for a nutrient solution are Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Sulfur, Iron, Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Molybdenum, Boron, and Chlorine. Off the shelf soil fertilizers don't contain all the elements, in the right proportions, to make a hydroponic nutrient solution. Only quality hydroponic nutrient formulas contain all the elements required.









A nutrient formula can be made from scratch with a little knowledge of chemistry and what chemical form the elements should be in. But that is beyond the scope of this discussion. We will be adding a link to a book on this topic in the future.









Watering a hydroponic garden by hand may be impractical with more than a couple of plants or with a growing medium like rock that will dry out in a few hours. Most hydroponic gardens have a ""hydroponic system"" that is automated with pumps and timers to do the work for you.









Most hobby growers like to experiment with different types of hydroponic systems, often building them from parts. Here is a few of the most common systems with a brief description.









Flood/Drain system




Flood Drain SystemA plastic tray filled with plants (usually in pots), on top of a reservoir filled with nutrient solution. A pump in the reservoir is connected to the bottom of the tray. When the pump turns on, the tray fills with water. When the pump turns off, the water runs back down through the pump into the reservoir. The tray must be above the top of the reservoir so gravity pulls the water back down. An overflow fitting must be added in the tray to regulate the depth of the flood. When the water level reaches the top of the overflow, it runs back into the reservoir. The pump can be turned on with a timer. A system like this usually waters 3-4 times a day.









Drip system




Dutch Pot with dripperDrip systems can use a number of different types of containers but the operation is usually very similar. The nutrient solution is stored in a reservoir. A pump in the reservoir has tube connected to it that runs up to the base of the plant. The tube may branch off to smaller tubes feeding many plants. It works just like a drip irrigation system in your yard. In fact, you can use most of the parts available for drip irrigation systems like drippers, stakes, tubing and fittings. If the nutrient solution is going to be recovered, the containers should be above the reservoir so gravity can do the return work for you. If not, the system becomes more complex with another pump to return the water. Of course you don't need to recover the nutrient solution at all, it could just run off. This may not be the best setup if it's in your extra bedroom. Some drip systems run continuously, others are on a timer.









Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system




Wall mounted NFT systemThe NFT system starts like a drip system, it has a reservoir with a pump. The pump has a tube that branches off to smaller tubes to feed the plants. But, the plants are watered at the roots. The plants are setup in troughs like rain gutters. The trough has a cover with round or square holes cut out for each plant. The holes are spaced correctly for the crop. The plants are growing in small plastic baskets about 2 inches across, filled with rock or rockwool. The baskets are placed in the holes in the cover of the trough. Some systems don't use baskets just a cube of rockwool or similar growing material. The water comes in the trough at one end and drains out the other. Most of the roots will fill the bottom of the trough.

It has a solid frame, round barrel and unfluted cylinder.
It's a small frame, 7 shot , in .22 cal. with a 2 inch barrel.
Grips are in good shape, front sight isn't filed down, hammer is original and unfiled.
It's nickel plated with no flaking but some signs of wear. I tried to get some decent pictures that show the true condition but it's tough with a nickel plated gun. It really looks pretty good but certainly isn't perfect. Very good looking for it's age.
Overall the gun is very original and shoots fine in both double and single action.
""Victor 22 Cal R.F."" is stamped on top and ""H&R Arms Co. Worcester Mass U.S.A."" is stamped on bottom grip strap.
Serial number is 116XXX which suggests (from my research) that it's probably from around 1925-1930. The antique Victors aren't cataloged so exact dating them is tough.
I've shot this several times with .22 shorts and it works fine but .22LR DO NOT fit in this gun since they are too long for the cylinder.
Thanks for looking,

This is a cool rifle, it may or may not appeal to some people because the barrel has been cut down to 17.25"" to make it more of a tactical style bolt action rifle. It was done right, nice clean cut with chamfered edge. It is in great shape has a smooth bolt and nice trigger. The bluing is good except a couple tooling marks near the muzzle and the stock is nice, the bore is clean and shiny. Would make someone fun little rifle.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter."

There is the standard K9, the K9 Elite and finally the rarest of the three is the ""Lady K9"".  The K9 Elite and Lady K9s have a lighter trigger pull than the standard K9.  The Lady K9 also came from the factory with a 16lb slide spring rather than the standard 20lb spring.  I guess it was Kahr's thinking that it would be easier for a woman to pull back the slide.  Kahr only made a limited number of the Lady K9 for just a couple of years and they are extremely hard to find.  Good luck finding one on Gunbroker, I've checked.  

The package I have is the all stainless Lady K9 with all original paperwork, box, 4 mags (three 7 round & one 8 round), and a custom leather and kydex Hidden Hybrid Holster.  This holster is very comfortable both inside the waistband and outside.  To wear it as a regular belt holster, just remove the steel clips and wear it on the outside of your belt.  Check out the reviews online.  I also have the original factory 16lb slide spring and a brand new Wolff Springs Co 20lb slide spring.  The pics here are ones I found online.  I'll update with my personal pics as soon as I get home.

I'm only selling this to fund another AR15 project.  Make a reasonable offer.  The only trade I'd be interested in is a quality AR15 rifle or pistol.  I have another listing for a Kahr CW45 with 2 mags, leather Barsony holster and possibly some ammo.  I'd trade both Kahrs for a very nice AR15 with upgrades.  Please text questions to REDACTED.

Great Gun

Great gun. My first two clips I put a nice hole in the center of the target from about 30 ft. Good trigger that once you learn where it breaks is very predictable. Put about 250 rounds through it so far. One thing that may be a little negative would be that when you load the magazine with 16 bullets it is very hard and tight so when you pull the slide back to grab a round its tough and scraps the bullet, plus if you have one in the chamber and a full clip the frictions from the slide hitting the bullet in the magazine causes a failure to eject and feed when shooting. I'm sure once the gun is broke in this issue will be resolved though.

Great Value!

I bought this gun about 10 months ago and I am absolutely satisfied. I have the two-tone, metal/black trim to mine. For a compact 9mm, this baby really gives a great ""bang"" for the buck (pun intended). The manufacturer sights that it comes with are great and easy to see with the white on them. The 16+1 magazines that it comes with are very easy to use load and feed bullets very smoothly. I have 1000+ rounds through this gun, using the same two magazines and it has yet to jam up on me. If you are a beginner and are absolutely sure that you want a semi-auto handgun, go with this one, but honestly any revolver would be a beginners best choice due to less moving parts and more easily maintained.

I have two minor dislikes though... The polymer that they use for the hand grip and the fact that there is no hammer. Obviously this gun is meant to have a round carried and loaded with one in the chamber because of the 8 lb trigger pull, but I would still prefer a hammer. Make sure that if you have children in the house that you have a trigger lock or a gun safe if you plan on keeping it loaded. The Polymer hand grip is definitely very solid, but it just feels cheap. When you take the gun apart to clean it, you hold the grip in your hand and think to yourself.. ""wow, this feels like it could break!"". I paid $12 for some stick-on rubber grips that adhere to the sides and back of the grip and now everything is much better. 

Overall, this is an amazing gun and I would recommend it to anyone.

P.S. I also have a .38 and a .357.. for comparative purposes, I shot one round from each gun into several water jugs filled with colored water. The water jugs were in a line, about 5 in a row. This SD9 went thru 4 jugs cleanly then exploded the 5th one pretty nicely. The .38 went thru all 5 and the .357 went thru the first two then blew up the 3rd and fourth and didn't touch the 5th. So you could say that the 9mm has more knock-down power than a .38. This is a very good buy.

I also have a Mathews ignition youth bow with everything needed to start shooting.  I would consider trading for the right 336. It's listed in the archery adds.

I shot 6 rounds through it when I bought it new about 5 years ago, and put it back in the box. It shoots fantastic and the recoil buffer is great.  Ergonomically it feels great too.  I am not a shooter, just a collector that is thinning my collection.  I have 2 17 round mags with box, locks, and all papers. These are pretty hard to find as they don't make them anymore. It is made in Italy. The 90two is an attempt at better-ing the 92fs. Grips are completely different. It has a rail. The 90two answered the few complaints that law enforcement had with the 92 and beretta has rounded off the trigger and trigger guard as well as the hammer and sighting areas. Law enforcement complained that the 92 was easy to get caught on clothing and holsters. The 90-two is a polymer frame and still has the decocking lever and also a firing pin visual indicator. The 90-Two also has built in, a recoil buffer to make it more durable. It has a rail, with a cover, and the mags hold 17 rounds instead of the 15 for the 92. Might trade for glock 9 with $200 boot to me. Thanks"

Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design.

The Golden Boy rifle's awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's Old West, when Henry's company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.

Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version also holds 16 rounds. Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it's time to reload the tubular magazines.

This is the 4th Generation, which is the newest generation. Without any doubt, love them or hate them, Glocks have a worldwide reputation as being the ultimate in dependable, durable and accurate! Here is your chance to save some $$$ on a totally unused Glock 30 Gen4. Like many, many other firearms, I bought this brand new and it has only sat in my safe. Absolutely everything shipped with it from the factory comes with it. If you have any questions, just Google Glock 30 generation 4.

I'm really torn whether I should sell this pistol or not. I don't really need a dozen Glock pistols though. I picked this one to list over a 99% Gen3 Glock 27 simply because this pistol has never even had a round chambered and I spent $100 on the G27 having TFO night sights installed on it. Hey, if you're looking to Glock-up, I'll make you a deal on both. I'm not really looking for any trades, but sometimes I get stupid and trade for something in spite of myself. Buyer MUST have valid Indiana ID and preferably a LTCH. I have sold many firearms on here and not a single person has been unhappy with the firearm they have received from me. You won't find a brand new G30 Gen4 for $550 total anywhere else. If you want one, here is your chance. I'll be in town through Thursday night and then will be gone for almost a week. Any questions, just ask. Unless you're just being rude, I answer all emails."

This rifle was designed by bushmaster and Remington for the military and law enforcement as an improvement of the already proven and amazing FNH Scar 16s. And they did improve on the scar. Remington sells this rifle to military an law enforcement only through their sister co. Remington defence. Wile bushmaster sells the same rifle to the civilian market. The only differance is really the fact that the bushmaster is semi automatic only. This rifle is a multi caliber rifle. The whole rifle can be taken down without tools and done so in mins. The barrel can be removed and swapped with a cool one or even changed to a different caliber. The convertion kits when they reliese them will be 300 blackout, 6.8 rem , and 9mm. So this one rifle can fill many different uses with what fits in a small roll that can be fit into a pack with your other gear. And all these calibers use the same mags. So one gun can handle CQB, long range, and stealth. This one is in the fde color and comes with one 30 rd mag and all the items I got from the factory. It also came with flip up Sights and everything is ambi dexterous excep its ejection port. This is a great rifle and has only had a hand full of rounds shot through it. My better half preferred the ar -15 her kids built for her. So we are asking $2,300.00 obo. We will concider all serious and reasonable offers."
