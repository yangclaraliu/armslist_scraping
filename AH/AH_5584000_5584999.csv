Available in blued or stainless steel, or light alloy frame. Features include adjustable sights, full underlug on 4 and 5 inch barrels, transfer bar safety system and soft rubber grips.About the Manufacturer:This company was founded in 1939 to make Smith & Wesson-type revolvers and is now part of a group that makes products ranging from hand tools to sports equipment. In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's Sao Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. By the early 1990s the company was employing more than 3000 people in four factories in Brazil. In order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary in 1984 stationed in Miami, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA.About the Cartridge:This cartridge is based on a .22 Magnum (WMR) rimfire case that is necked down to seat a 17 grain, .17 caliber Hornady V-Max bullet. As done with the .17 Mach 2, the .17 HMR is sized such that manufacturers can easily re-tool .22 WMR gun designs to the new .17 HMR cartridge. This is a supersonic varmint round that travels over twice the speed of sound with near flat trajectory to 100 yards. The larger cartridge and load gives the .17 HMR more than 1-1/2 times the energy at 100 yards than the smaller .17 Mach 2."

My favorite part about this particular Mosin is the trigger. If you want to own only one Mosin, this would be the one to have. It has some minor cracking on the back of the stock near the metal butt plate and some of the bluing is gone but this rifle is still a great shooter.

It has 3 - 10 round mags.  I also have a 9MM lone wolf barrel and recoil spring that goes with the G23 which makes it a 9MM gun. You would need 9MM mags for the conversion barrel if you wanted to shoot 9MM. Yes, I know what you are going to say, ""hey that is a 9MM barrel why not keep it?"". Well it is a 9MM conversion kit BUT I bought the G23 to be a 40 caliber and the conversion was a nice bonus. I have never used the G23 with the 9MM barrel. The barrel has to go with the gun as the barrel walls are thicker to accomodate the wider barrel in the G23.If your in Massachusetts, I will do a face to face. If else where, you pay your FFL fee and I will pay mine. All laws will be obeyed.Pictures later."

The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.

Palmetto State Armory slide and frame. Slide and frame were hand fit to ensure tightest fit, this is the same process Springfield Armory uses to produce their Tactical Response Pistol (TRP). The Barrel bushing and grip safety are Ed Brown. Sights are green Tru-Glo high visibility (both light and dark conditions). Grips are wood Pachmayr. All other parts are Wilson combat. I have tweaked the trigger for a smooth pull, crisp SNAP, and short reset. The pistol comes with 3 magazines, a Galco Miami Classic holster and dual magazine holder. The strap broke and that is why it is not included, however replacements are available from Galco from $30-$60 (and I have taken that into consideration as far as the price is concerned).

The size, shape, and design is similar to the Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" OAL and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube which is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail accepts many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

This rifle was manufactured in 1917 and is in excellent condition. The bluing on the gun looks great with some white metal on the back of the receiver and on the sharp edges. The wood is likewise in great condition with some bumps and dings that you normally see on a rifle of this age. The straight bolt action on this gun is in great shape and the bore is very bright and clean. The fact that Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars ensured that these rifles are in far better condition, on average, than the rifles of other European nations of its vintage.

I've put 100-200 rounds through it. Not even broken in yet. I've cleaned it more times than I've shot it. I've changed the handguard to add rails for the hand grip. The trigger was upgraded to a two stage Geissele ($250 upgrade). Also changed out the stock gas block to a low profile one as the stock oneblocked the red dot. Price for the rifle is $550 alone or $700 with the Vortex sparc. I have a few 223 rounds that I will include as well. Buyer pays all transfer fees. I would prefer to do the transfer at Greta's or smokin barrel in Simi Valley. If you have any questions please contact me. Thanks.
