I recently aquired this from a friend  who bought it for his father over 25 years ago. When his father passed it sat in his safe for the last 18 years. Neither ever fired it , nor have I . It is in beautiful condition. No rust or pitting. It is import stamped by blue sky. The stock is refinished and is lighter in color then the hand guards. What you see is all I have, just the gun.

This truck is not in mint condition but is far from gone.  Runs and drives great, has been a regular driver since I purchased it. Clean title, plates, passed DEQ just fine, all that legal stuff.  Nice and reliable small block 350 and th350 trans.  Mileage on odometer is ~44000.  Obviously probably rolled over and is 140,000.  Don't think more then that due to the shape that it's in.  Needs a little cosmetic work....well doesn't NEED but it would look better.  I haven't minded too much, it gets me where I need to go just fine.  I have attached a few photos and will gladly send more to interested parties.  I will be sorry to see this truck go but need to drastically downsize for an upcoming long distance move.  I value the truck at $2000.  That is low for the condition (and just plain greatness) of the truck and I'm not willing to go much lower then that."

For you non-glock guys out there, it's the 9mm. First, the pistol has been shot less than one hundred times and has been cleaned regularly after shooting. It looks brand new. I have the (Glock Tactical Light attachment) GTL-10 for it (if you've never seen them, this thing is awesome). There is a Houge grip sleeve on it, custom ""G17"" logos on the slide cover plate and magazine plate (only on one of the mags), and the OEM GLOCK night sights-NOT fiber optic-these actually glow in the dark. There is also an extended ""break-down"" bar on it to disassemble the pistol easier. There is also a Sunset Enterprises grip plug on it with a secret compartment to store an extra round in the grip of the gun. I have a 33 round extended magazine to go with it and 650 rounds of ammunition. 550 brass FMJ's, 25 Hornday Custom Self Defense hollow points, and 25 Golden Saber hollow points. Comes with FOUR seventeen round magazines, as well. TEXT me at 4two3-7five4-8nine5four because I'm in class all the time for college.

Also, I have a brand new Safari Land concealment holster for it. It has the STX tactical finish and is suede lined to protect the finish of the gun (belt or paddle attachments). This holster has RETENTION. You can't just pull it out; there is a lever you have to push to get it out. With the purchase comes an extra magazine pouch and utility pouch for the GTL-10 light attachment. These are also made out of the STX tactical finish and go on the belt. They are brand new, also. The holster and two pouches have NEVER been used.

I'm not in a hurry to sell it. If you're interested, please don't low ball me. I know what it's worth. These pistols (bone stock and highly used) sell all day for 500 bucks.. Not including all of the accessories. If you bought all of this new, you would easily spend over 1,200 bucks!! I'm not asking this because I know most people don't have that kind of money to drop on a firearm, but you won't be disappointed with this thing.. It's awesome! (Keep in mind, there is about 200 dollars in ammunition coming with it) Thanks for looking!"

BELOW is the info from the manufacturers website. ********************



The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.

The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.

The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.

Second Gen Glock 19 pistol, so no finger grooves (better for larger hands). Factory night sights, shoots beautifully, ideal for conceal carry, and of course carries Glocks lifetime warranty. This, unlike a Gen3 or Gen4 Glock is much more pleasant to shoot, due to the lack of finger grooves for those with larger hands. If you want a CHEAP Glock, look elsewhere. There are VERY few 2nd Generation Glock 19s for sale. So, if you want a cheap one, please buy a Gen3, and leave this for someone who finds 3rd and 4th gens uncomfortable to shoot, and will appreciate this gun for what it is.



Comes with 2 15 round magazines.

All NC laws apply, Valid CCW or pistol purchase permit required.  This pistol is also legal for sale in MASS as it's date of manufacture is before 1994.  Buyer pays all shipping and FFL Fees.

Also has Traction Grips on it currently, but those can be removed easily. Also come with an extra magazine. I have three holsters that make up a pretty complete system. A Nylon clip on the belt holster, a DeSantis Superfly Pocket Holster, and a DeSantis PocketTuk Tuckable IWB holster. All are designed to fit the Crimson Trace Laser (i.e. hard to find.) Also included is a back-up battery for the CT laser as well as enough Critical Defense Ammo to fill the gun and spare mag. Come with original box, paperwork, and box/paperwork for the laser as well. I've spent somewhere between $700-$800 on this carry system, not counting sales tax. This truly is a complete carry system for one of the smallest, most concealable handguns out there (under 4 inches tall/.75 inches thick)."

It's essentially a Model 1936 that has been strengthened to accommodate the built in grenade launching system. 

This rifle is finished differently than most of the 36's and 49/56's you'll see. The wood has a smoother and more glossy finish while the metal has a much darker almost black look. Most of the MAS rifles I've seen sport a medium gray finish. I suspect it is a black phosphate type coating, or perhaps a matte bluing, because it does not appear to be paint. 

Overall condition is at least 95% with only the most minor handling and storage marks. The bore is mirror bright and the rifle may be unfired. 

The numbers on the receiver, bolt, magazine floor plate and buttstock match. 

The sling is original in tan colored leather and it's in excellent condition. 

The needle style bayonet that stores inside the lower handguard has the same dark finish and is excellent. 

The black slip on recoil pad is marked MAS 51 and the rubber is soft and pliable with no cracking or hardening at all. 

Rifle inclusdes three boxes of clean brass case surplus ammo which is probably corrosive primed so be sure to clean after firing. 

Price is $600 with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be a Florida resident and at least 18 to purchase. 

Thanks for looking."

It's quite unusual as it has both a 7.62 x 25, and a 9mm Luger barrel that have matching numbers from the factory. 

I've done a good deal of research and there isn't much info available on this pistol. I can only find one other on-line example with the matching barrels and it sold on GunBroker about a year ago. It did have factory matching barrels but the entire forward portion of the left side of the slide was stamped with a very large and unsightly import mark. The pistol for sale today has an import mark, but it's so small and lightly struck that I need a strong magnifying glass to see it. Pistol is unfired and it's as close to 100% condition you are likely to get. 

Grips & metal finishes are nearly perfect and the bore in both barrels is pristine. All numbers match. The holster, lanyard and three of the four magazines I purchased with the pistol are still in their original sealed factory packaging. 

Pistol comes with: 

7.62 x 25 & 9mm Luger barrels - numbers factory matched to pistol 
Brand new Czech tan leather holster still sealed in factory packaging

578,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2374578,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T (Taking Offers),"Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, November 25, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This 3.5-10x40 is the optic that the military uses on many of the MK12 Special Purpose Rifles (SPR). It is also the same optic that Marcus Luttrell was using during the 'Lone Survivor' event where he and a few other brave SEALs fought hundreds of Afghan a**holes. 

The scope is in excellent condition with only the edges of the turrets shined a bit (barely noticeable) due to living and traveling in a soft case. It features an illuminated Tactical Milling Reticle that can be used as a ballistic reticle. It has been converted to .5 MOA adjustments from the Leupold custom shop and has a custom BDC turret that is calibrated to a 77 grain bullet at 2850 feet per second (determine the range and turn the elevation turret to the corresponding number). I have tested the BDC turret extensively and it is true to 600 yards which was the longest shot I could take until I recently secured a place with just over 1000 meters. Additionally, I have turrets for 62 grain 5.56, 168 grain 7.62, and the standard MOA turret.

The mount is a LaRue QD SPR mount that is also in very good condition. I have also tested the return to zero quality of this mount extensively and have never experienced a discernable shift even at 600 yards. LaRue claims that it will return to 1/10 of a MOA and after owning several of these mounts I know for a fact it is that good or better.

I am now shooting larger cartridges at greater distances and need more magnification. I'm going to have to sacrifice this Leupold to fund the high end optic for this application. After the work from the custom shop I have over $1700 in this optic and mount. I am open to offers but lowball offers will not get a response, don't waste your time. This is a face to face sale only in the North Alabama area, I will not ship. For the most part I'm interested in cash, however, I may consider a trade for ARs, AR uppers, or high end optics if something is offered that would compel me to sell something else."

 there is a lesser similar version at AIM right now that does not come with the FN cold hammer forged barrel . I sought this barrel out for its long life and accuracy . The barrel on the AIM model is a lightweight ""non FN"" barrel of cheaper quality

Two are where the rings held the scope to the rifle and one along the front portion that is less prominent.  See the pictures.  Email for questions  This was mounted and used about 2-3 months and then put away.  It requires one CR2025 battery.  The warranty card was never filled out and is included.

See SC code section 23-31-520
Supreme court agrees.
See MIchigan v. Long, 103 S. Ct. 3469 (1983)

""Officer Safety"" does not permit them to seize your weapon and run the serial numbers through NCIC. Officer safety  is satisfied when you are away from your weapon.

The law is settled but you would be shocked which county/counties has an ""unwritten policy"" to seize weapons, not only from your car but your home if you are contacted by an officer. I just went through it and it needs to stop. I never expected it in South Carolina or from this ""pro-gun rights"" Sheriff's Dept.

I have video of the confrontation. I am a law abiding CWP holder. I have kept a detailed arrest journal with all contact I have had with officer and his supervisor.

I won't tell the story in an open forum or to strangers at this time. It will come out soon enough. Just know the laws above if you are stopped with a weapon legally stored in your vehicle cwp or no. 
As a matter of fact, you do not have to give officers your cwp unless you are concealing it on your person because it is legal to have in your glove box. This may have been mistaught in your cwp class and has been confirmed with the highest authority on the matter. Don't get bullied if you aren't breaking the law. Authority is not derived from a gun and a badge.

There is action coming up on this soon"

History:
They were originally powdercoated a gloss-black. So after I purchased them, I had them refinished a White Diamond Pearl to match the color of my TL @ Sergey's House of Wheels. I mounted 2 of them for fitment measurements so the condition of them are pretty much flawless, other than the lug holes being scratched up a little bit. You will not see this area when you mount the wheels."

Unfortunately I need to sell a few guns to take care of a few bills. This is the centerpiece of my collection. It is a fully functioning Colt SAA . This is a special and rare piece. Not because it is one of the few found in the Nettleton series, but in that it was delivered on March 13, 1880 in the middle of the David F. Clark series of revolvers. This revolver functions flawlessly. It is fully matching. The only detractors are that it was reblued ages ago, the barrel was cut from its original length to 4-3/4 inches, and the one piece walnut grips are replacements. The loading gate DOES match the frame,This would be a nice revolver to be accompanied by a KOPEC LETTER. I never got one, and deeply regret it now that I am selling.

You read correctly this gun has made a 700 yd (640 M) shot on a hog and missed the target point by 3/8"" with a 7mph wind on 72 grain loads. This rifle has a 24"" stainless heavy duty barrel with a 1:8 twist that was built by a gunsmith who builds custom competition rifles in North Carolina, so this guy knows about long range shooting. The only way I was able to get this upper was by my affiliation with some Marine Snipers and I don't think I could get another one. It is sitting on a Spikes lower with a Wilson tactical trigger assembly. It has a magpul custom grip and buttstock with storage, an adjustable bi-pod that allows you to swivel while set, and a Nikon 3-12 X 40 1/4 MOA scope. It has a Black Dawn BCG and charge handle for smooth long lasting use. I have only put about 80 rounds through this rifle and hunted it once and has a 100% take down record. The rifle is capable of 600+yd shots with extreme accuracy and can handle heavier loads than standard AR's. The rifle is most fun at a range of about 3-400yds and is extremely accurate and effective, not to mention just fun to shoot. I love the rifle, but I have decided to go 338 and it's gonna cost a lot of $$$ to get there. I'm not really interested in trading, except for maybe a SCAR or an FNAR 308, Savage and Remington 700's or certain pistols ( Springfield, S&W, FNH or certain Glocks ) but will entertain any offers. If you would like to contact the Marine who built this I would gladly make that possible, I have nothing to hide and he will confirm that this is a fantastic rifle on a platform that is both accurate and affordable to operate. I will gladly demo this rifle at a nearby range, it's a short range but a range nonetheless, but bring your own ammo.  The upper alone cost almost $1500, if you can find a shelf unit like this they range from $12-1800, and I am asking $2150 OBO for the entire rifle with a case a two mags. If I don't sell it I won't be upset, it's a great rifle to shoot and hunt with and I really enjoy its capabilities and accuracy.  
 If you want to know what it cost to build this rifle just go find all of the components, if they're available, and add it up, then you will see why I'm asking what I'm asking. Not trying to be a jerk, it's just the facts, this a very unique rifle that I don't think I could even reproduce at a reasonable cost, especially not the upper. 
 There is NOTHING stock about this rifle and you can tell when you shoot it, very smooth, very accurate and extremely reliable, never a FTF or FTE, EVER!

If you have any questions just call    210-25 nine- thirty 20

He is making these guns available due to his age and not a need to sell. He has a vast collection of fine firearms and has decided to reduce the size of his collection in some areas such as this set of Colt Single Action Army Revolvers. The description of the guns is as follows: Gun number one is a Colt SAA Blue finish with a 7 1/2 inch barrel in 45 LC and was made in 1876 and shipped to H & D Folsom Arms Co. in Georgia on Dec.30, 1876. The number of guns in this shipment was 50, which tells me this gun was not a special order gun because of the number of guns in the shipment. The gun however does have a custom set of Eagle/Snake carved Ivory grips, carvings on the left grip that are nicely aged to this gun they are fit so well. I believe Colt did this set along with the same exact style carved grip on right grip of gun number two. This gun is in excellent shape. Also the cylinder is matching. The lockup on the cylinder is amazingly tight for a gun this old and it still has the four clicks when cocking hammer. The gun, as most Colts of this age, is a nice even wear Patina/Blue finish with the blue about 40% that has not had steel wool or sand paper rubbed all over it. The screws are all in good shape. The cylinder pin screw does show wear. The bore is somewhat dark but excellent for a gun of this age. The Carved Ivory Grips are outstanding on both guns. Gun number two is in as good or better condition than the first gun. This gun is also a Colt SAA Blue finish with a 7 1/2 inch barrel in 45 LC Serial number 40885, made one year later than gun one. We do not have the Colt letter to this gun but if important one can be obtained. The gun does have matching serial numbers on the frame, trigger guard, grip frame, and cylinder. The lockup on the cylinder is tight and again it has the familiar Colt sound of four distinctive clicks when cocking the hammer. This gun,as the first gun, is a very nice even patina finish with slightly more percentage blue finish left on barrel, that has not been messed with and is ALL ORIGINAL as is gun number one. The screws are excellent except again the cylinder pin screw does show wear. The bore is also the same condition as the first gun.As always even with the guns in tight condition shooting modern ammo is not a good idea we are selling this set as a collectable not shooters. The Carved Ivory Grips are as nice a pair of carved ivorys as you will find if you like time period ivory instead of brand new ivory. These two guns were purchased as a set by my friend in 1975 and in my opinion the original person who purchased these guns over 130 years ago had Colt install these Ivory grips at the same time or very close to the same time. I say this because the grips are exact in every way and show the same amount of aging, as do the guns and it would make sense to have one right panel and one left panel carved so they would be a right and left hand set..."
