Full story - I saw it, I bought it for a weekend friends were staying in my house, and it's vastly too small for the number of guns I have.

Stack-On 10-Gun Safe with Combination Lock, Hunter Green:
5 locking points
Fully convertible with adjustable shelves and a fully carpeted interior
A drill resistant, hardened steel plate located behind lock for greater security
3-number combination lock with drill-resistant, hardened steel plate behind the lock provides greater security
Exterior Dimensions: 15-7/8"" W (40.3cm), 15-1/8"" D (38.4cm), 55-1/8"" H (140cm)
So - if you want something cheap, but better than one of those Stack-On security cabinets, and just a few things to store in it - this is a winner.

It has floor bolts, and I never installed them - so they have the anchors and whatnot. It fit into my lil station wagon, so a car with fold down seats is enough to drive it home. Me and my Wife were able to carry it when empty, so you can move it into an upstairs apartment before you bolt it down. Just looking to recoup MOST of the cost of this guy and still give someone a deal on a almost new safe. All paperwork that came with it are still in the plastic.

GLOCK 21 GEN 4
Purchased new by me on July 27th of this year.
Good to Excellent condition, has very minor handling marks, one slight scratch on top of slide in front of rear sight (not bad, honestly).
Around 300rds fired through it with zero issues.
The only ""mod"" on the gun is on the trigger guard. I sanded the one edge with 2000 grit sandpaper to eliminate ""Glock Knuckle"", if you are unfamiliar with that term Google it. It was not a hack job, does not affect the function of the gun, and does not look bad or horrible. I have included a pic of this area for those who are deeply concerned by this minor modification.

Comes with the following:
All factory components (box, papers, 3-13rd mags, backstraps - yes the new updated beavertail ones, etc.)
Has Truglo Tritium night sights (installed, but not pictured, does not come with original sights).
Glock brand Extended slide release (original included)
Blackhawk Serpa Holster RH-black (paddle and belt mount)
SigTac double magazine paddle holster
Glock brand single mag pouch (NIB)

I ALSO HAVE AMMO AVAILABLE: 400rds of Blazer Brass 230gr FMJ & 40rds of Speer Gold Dot 230gr JHP for an additional $250. Gun buyer is first in line to buy the ammo, will sell separately if not sold with gun first.

Colt Model 1903 32 cal

This is a Colt Model 1903 ""Hammerless"" Pocket .32 caliber. The serial number is 383800, which puts its manufacture date in 1921.  It was in the first 6500 of over 32,000 made that year.  

It is certainly a valuable collector’s piece, but because of its size, the fact that it is in perfect working condition and that it was specifically designed to carry in a pocket, all make it a perfect weapon for concealed carry with true style.

Original grips are in perfect shape as is the original magazine.

The finish is probably 85% overall. The deterioration of the bluing is most obvious on the top and left top of side of the slide, as shown in the pictures.  Given the included shoulder holster and the way the weapon slides in and out, the visible wear very well may be nothing more than holster wear, but I cannot guarantee it.  On the right side and handle, 98%+ of the original blue remains.  The barrel is clean - with no rust and excellent rifling.  The rest of the weapon is also free of rust.

This weapon is in perfect mechanical shape, and is still very tight.  The action is still very smooth.

As mentioned, I am including the leather shoulder holster.  The leather is real and is in excellent shape.  The weapon is a perfect fit as the picture demonstrates.  There are no loose seams, threads or buckles.  The holster is truly a nice addition for a gun that was originally built for easy concealment.  

This weapon is easily an 8 out of 10.  There is wear externally as indicated but the interior parts are not badly worn and the gun fires everytime. 

Please contact me if you would like to see any other pictures. 

If sold in Colorado and you can get to the North Denver Metro Area (Broomfield) to meet for the sale, the transaction for the weapon must be either cash or certified bank check.  I have a friend with an FFL who can facilitate the background check (Yes – as of July 1, even private sales in CO require a background check.) and transfer.  The fees add up to $15 and my Smith/FFL needs to be paid in cash by the buyer.  

If sold outside of Colorado or you live in Colorado and cannot make it to Denver, locating a local FFL to where I can ship the weapon is the responsibility of the buyer as are the shipping charges.  All fees required to complete this transaction are to be paid by the buyer.  For the sale of the weapon, PayPal, some other 3rd party guarantor or a USPS Money Order is required.  This protects both of us from fraud.

Here is some fun trivia...

First the family story...
The weapon has a fun family history as this is the weapon my Grandfather carried when he started his wholesale jewelers business in 1922.  He may have bought the 32 brand new.  Early on, he carried all the gems and most of the gold from all over the Middle East to India to South Africa and back to the US.  When the depression came, the job became even more dangerous.  So Gramps strapped a snub nosed .38 revolver (which is missing thus far) to his right leg and a 22 short, 7 shot mini revolver to the left leg.  I have the mini revolver.  The nickel is chipped and it has no makings at all.  If you want to see pics, email me.  I might be crazy but early research puts the 22 short as a civil war weapon.  I am happy to say, Gramps never had to draw any of his weapons!

Also, many gangsters of the pre-World War II era favored the Model 1903 because they were relatively small and easily concealed.   It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh.   Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton kept one when was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952.

This is really a fun piece full of US history no matter how you slice it.  This weapon will not disappoint the new owner.

389,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2424389,For Sale/Trade:  Amazing Doomsday/SHTF preparedness package for sale,"Loganville, Atlanta, Georgia","$ 3,600","Listed On: Sunday, December 8, 2013",Rifles,DPMS                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Scared that the world is going to end? Do you fear anarchy, chaos, death, and destruction? Would you be caught with your pants around your ankles is a Katrina-type disaster happened?

Well fear no more! This package will have you prepared for anything that comes your way, and will provide you and your loved ones safety as you get out of the city and head to greener pastures. It provides offense, defense, AND mobility.

First is a DPMS rifle package. Rifle is VERY far from stock, has had some work done to it and a lot added on. I am the original owner of the rifle. It's had around 300-400 rounds through it without a single issue (loves cheaper steel cased ammo as much as high end match grade!), and has been meticulously maintained.

Upgrades:
-Trigger smoothed and tweaked by a gunsmith
- MIAD grip in FDE
-ACS stock in FDE
-FAB Defense mag well grip
-MBUS gen 2 FDE
-RVG in FDE
-Eotech 512 with box
-Primary Arms 3x magnifier with flip mount (had windage and elevation adjustment knobs)
-BCM low profile gas block
-extended charging handle
-Noveske NSR 13.5 free float rail
-Noveske hand stop
-Troy battle lever
-Accuwedge
-Magpul sling mount on rail

Comes with factory flash hider, back-threaded mock suppressor, and a Solvent Trapper. Also comes with 1 FDE Pmag, 1 windowed blk Pmag, 2 nonwindowed Pmags, and 1 PSA steel mag.
Package includes rifle, mags, 4 mag pouch, and 950 rounds of .223, most is nice steel cased, but 80 rounds are hollow points, 30 rounds are steel penetrator, and 30 are green tip 5.56.

Next is a Condor plate carrier in FDE, and includes AR500 plates for the front and back. The plates will stop multiple rounds of .308, and is coated to prevent round fragmentation and spalling. Carrier is covered front and rear in MOLLE webbing and padded on the inside to add to the comfort of wearing it.

And finally is a 2000 Ford Explorer Limited 4WD/2WD. Has right under 200k miles, it's a Limited so it's got every option offered, automatic, v6, 4WD, PS, PL, PW, cruise control, power sunroof, 6 disc changer, power seats with memory for driver seat, heated seats and mirrors, leather interior (in great shape, only bad spot on driver seat), steering wheel had controls for radio, thermostat and cruise control, center console display, full sized spare, like I said its got every option, runs and drives fine. Windshield got vandalized and needs replaced (cracked but can still drive and see through it), interior and exterior in good shape. Just had both upper control arms replaced, new tires on front and the rear tires only have about 1k miles on them, and will replace transmission filter before it is sold. Its worth around $3500, but it's not doing any good sitting in my yard, so my loss is your gain.

So close your jaw, clean up your drool, change your panties, and break out your checkbook, because this killer deal will not last long as this price. Asking $3600 for EVERYTHING, and anyone with a brain will see this is worth easily twice that.

Will entertain all trade offers, but mainly interested in high end weapons, especially a KelTec RFB."

472,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2424472,"Want To Buy:  Handguns, rifles, shotguns, black guns, pink and purple","Greater Seattle and the State of Washington, Seattle, Washington",$ 500,"Listed On: Sunday, December 8, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For those of you wanting to sell your guns a few suggestions. First of all don't bother with anyone who isn't a registered user. If you really need quick cash there are a number of honest brick and mortar dealers, DJ's, Wades, Ben's, Pinto's etc in the Seattle area. They won't pay retail, they can't because they have real businesses with real overhead and they all need to feed their families. If you have a bit of time they also accept consignments. The other route is to try and get as close to retail yourself. For this you need to write a complete description to the best of your ability. Look on gunbroker or guns america for your specific gun to compare, this will take some research. You also need to take GOOD pictures, this isn't easy for most of us, but can be done. Don't use your flash if at all possible, use natural or good artificial lighting. Be realistic, most of us that collect and or shoot competitively do not achieve retail when we go to sell. As an NRA pistol instructor many manufacturers give us significant discounts, just like LE and sometimes better than dealers. CONDITION is everything, especially with a collectible firearm. There's a huge difference between a 90% Gold Cup, or Hi Power and a 98%-99% with the original box and all the goodies. It's not easy to tell a gun in 80% to one in 90% to one that's 95% or greater. Less expensive firearms have a much larger market. $200 to $500 guns sell rather quickly, those that are around a thousand have a smaller audience. Those around $2,000 have a very small audience and those that are priced above that you better list with gunbroker, and be patient. All that being said if you have a nice gun or collection to sell, myself or any member of a good gun club or WAC will try to direct you in the right direction. Good luck and try the local shops or to network with someone that's active in the community."

A self defense rifle has to perform the first time, every time. The ultra-reliable A.R.G.O. system incorporated into the new Benelli MR1 does it for the U.S. military, and makes the MR1 the best home defense rifle available. MR1 self defense guns are chambered in 5.56 mm NATO (.223 Remington) and use the battle-proven Auto Regulating Gas Operated (ARGO) system—the same system developed by Benelli for the M1014 (M4) and used for over a decade in multiple conflicts by the United States Marine Corps.
Built to the same tough military specifications and embodying the solid reliability that the U.S. Marines rely upon, the MR1 has no equal among home defense weapons. It features a stainless steel, self-cleaning piston that operates directly against the proven rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for complex linkages found on other, inferior gas systems. This piston-driven system, perfected by Benelli, incorporates a gas port located just forward of the chamber, where the gases are hotter and cleaner, resulting in less fouling and more reliable cycling. The result—a Benelli carbine with features rivaling all other home defense rifles, including Marine—tough reliability and the ability to function in the harshest environmental conditions

I have for sale My safe queen under folding AK in 7.62. It was built by an custom builder with over 20 years experience.  I painstakingly acquired quality parts for this build, which include a polish folding mechanism. The polish is superior to that of Romanian and other design's in that when extended it forms a straight and not drooping point of contact with the shooters shoulder.

It was built on a NODAK NDS1P receiver, with a polish barrel, polish stock, wood and dust cover and bolt. Krebs retaining plate I believe. I then had the rifle CERAKOTED a nice flat black which doesn't reflect light.

Rifle has 10 rounds through it to test function.

Includes 5 boxes of Yugoslavian brass cased mil surp. 5 European steal mags that will last a lifetime no tapco of Korean junk here. one polish polymer magazine that is just a freebie, but did work in perfectly well in my romy and arsenal aks. Polish bayonet, and sling.

For sale is an unfired Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) MK114 MOD 0 with upgraded trigger and buffer tube.  If you're looking at this rifle, you know exactly what you're getting.  PWS uses a proprietary piston technology which in my opinion is much better than a direct impingement system.  This an original MOD 0 rifle which means there are rails all around the upper as opposed to a MOD 1 version which uses the KeyMod rail system.  Again, my opinion on the two styles is that the MOD 0 may be a little heavier but you can put just about any attachment on the rails without having to purchase additional rails.  Currently, the MOD 1 versions of this rifle cost $1,949 retail (with no upgrades) and take up to 6 months to build/ship.  I'm open to REASONABLE offers but new, this rifle would cost you $2,000+.

About 1/2 of them are stock rebuild's and the other 1/2 are using anti-tilt followers (both magpul and c-products followers from when they reproduced magpul's design before they got sued and shut down for doing that).
They have all been stored empty and in with those silicone dry packs in a sealed ammo can, some are painted others have the factory finish, all are in good shape and reliable with strong springs. All are US made.

I am converting over to Pmag's (still 30's! Gotta love Ohio!) and I'm lookin to trade some of my USGI's for PMAG's, I'm even welling to take a loss and not trade at 1:1 but I'd prefer to field offers and see if anyone's welling to do better than 2:1, especially on the anti-tilt ones since I've really got alot in these. I would be very happy at 18:12 but again I'm really open to offers here for all or part.

I don't really care about what generation of PMAG, the big reason behind it is cause my old kydex gear won't work with my new Pmag's so I'm trying to standardize, not because I have any problem with USGI mags, actually I would still be more than happy with my metal mags but I've gotten pmags for my birthday and just now got some Windows'd pmags for Xmas so I figure I'll breakdown and convert.

Please EMAIL me at REDACTED to send offers, it doesn't have to be for all 18, I will trade any number of them depending on the offer."

It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal.

Springfield Armory® XD-S™

Perfect for compact, concealed carry
3.3"" barrel
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
Loaded Chamber Indicator
Single-position Picatinny rail
To create the XD-S™, Springfield Armory took the best innovations of the award-winning XD Series and trimmed down the frame to a perfect size for compact, concealed carry. Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The rear sight on the XD-S is low-profile and holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual."

This looks almost new and has had only a few mags of ammo through it to test the sights, recoil, and the function of the mechanicals. As you can see the only real markings are on the ejection door from normal function. I also purchased a PT145 at the same time to choose the one that gave me the best fit and feel for concealed carry. I loved both of them and have procrastinated selling this for a long time, Research proves the superiority of the 40 cal ballistics but I have more of the 45 ammo so this is the one for sale. I have tried some of the top of the line guns also but these are just as dependable and it makes no sense to me to carry a $1200.00 weapon and expose it to the elements when these work so well. This comes with the extra mag but the original boxes were lost in a divorce just after purchase.
I will require an Iowa permit to purchase this. Warren REDACTED"

Also included is around 1200 pieces of brass (279 of it is new unprimed Remington and around 250-300 is 1x or 2x fired and primed), 1000 Remington 110g FMJ bullets, 200 Remington 110g JSP bullets and a set of RCBS carbide dies with shell holder (I think they’re new). This is a great shooting little rifle that has served me well, but it's been supplanted by a levergun that I shoot more often. It has been well taken care of and shows it for being 65+ years old. I'd like to trade for silver bullion or possibly older pistol-caliber Marlin leverguns.  I'd sell the whole package for $2000."

This model is a Carbine and was issued to non-coms, officers and troops in the rear as well as some civilians.  As a Carbine, it does not have a bayonet nor mount.  It is basically the shorter, Carbine version of the 91/30.  Fewer of these around.  There are several manufacturers that make a kit that will allow you to mount a scope without having to drill it out.

I have put at least 300 rounds through it in the last few years and never had a misfire or jam.  I am able to consistently shoot a very small pattern at 100 yds. with just the closed iron sights.  Any farther, and I would need a scope - lol.  True to a lot of Russian weapons, I think you could drag this one through the mud and it would still fire every time.  Also, since these weapons were realistically built for use by a peasant army, it has few parts and can be broken down, cleaned and reassembled in just a few minutes.

I bought this for my older boy with the intent to put a scope on it for hunting mule deer and elk.  I picked through at least 30 Carbines to pick this one out.  When my Dad past away a few years ago, I upgraded my son to Dad's 30-06 so I now have no need for this weapon.

964,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2424964,For Sale:  Elvis Presley and Graceland Commemorative Winchester 1894 rifle gold plated beautiful wood engraving.,"Lakewood, Denver, Colorado","$ 2,199","Listed On: Sunday, December 8, 2013",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,30-30 Winchester                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I purchased this rifle mainly because I wanted a Winchester lever action now that they are no longer making them in the USA. This one is just too nice looking to shoot and I cannot yet afford the man cave I want to be able to hang it over a fireplace or gun display or jukebox. I could not find a stray mark in it, it's in perfect condition. It's a modern production sold through ""America Remembers"" manufactured as an authorized commemorative or collectible rifle by Elvis's heirs. I realize that things manufactured as ""collectible"" rarely are actual collectibles, but this rifle is just too interesting and nice to ignore. It was ONLY available through America remembers for $2599. It is the model 1894 lever action angle eject (94AE) with modern cross bolt safety. It does not appear to have ever been fired, and I certainly have not fired it. It comes with the hang tag, but no owners manual. #451 out of 1000 made. Caliber is 30-30 Winchester. I have seen some sell for more than $2599, and seen some sell for less than $2599. I am pricing mine below the lowest priced sale I found on gunsamerica or any other sold rifle.
I see that America Remembers just issued another Elvis tribute in the form of a Colt Government model 45. It was in the most recent issue of American Rifleman. They also made a Colt Single Action Army model. If you love Elvis, you could pick up an entire firearms collection, Colt SAA Revolver, Colt 1911 Pistol, and Winchester 1894 Rifle. Now if they will just make a Remington 870 pump shotgun and a Colt AR15, you would never need a gun WITHOUT Elvis on it :) You can check my feedback scores on ebay and gunbroker under ""evlgreg"" with 14+ years of 100% perfect feedback and reputation and over 1000 transactions.
The gun is located in Colorado which means face to face sales are not possible. I will not respond to anyone offering to buy it outside of the new Colorado laws. If you know of a local dealer that will perform the transfer, then please let me know. All the dealers I contacted will not do a full transfer for the new state mandated $10 maximum. I am happy to package and ship the rifle and will include a padded gun case to insure the rifle arrives safely to your dealer for a non person-to-person transfer. You will have to send me your Dealer's current FFL document for me to ship."
