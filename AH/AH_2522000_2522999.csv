When I bought the bullets at Cabelas I was kind of wondering why the box was on the shelf. They will not go thru the lips of a single stack magazine but will thru a Glock magazine. However they will not feed up the ramp in my Glock 30. Bottom line is that I am looking for someone that has a revolver that might be able to use them. They are loaded with about 6 grains of UNIQUE and used brass. Interested? Give me a call and we can talk about my loss and your gain.

These are incredibly rare and hard to find. As a pre-ban it is one of a very limited number of H&KS in the country which are eligible to be converted to full auto assuming you're willing to jump through the legal hoops and pay the cost to complete the conversion. What makes this rifle even more rare is that it comes with a factory installed ambi safety (almost unheard of) and also a shell deflector. These were never included in standard production, so the fact that they are factory OEM parts makes this rifle a real one of a kind. This rifle had been professionally assessed by a well respected Knoxville gunsmith and is certified as all original parts and also in 90-95% condition. The rifle also has a collapsible stock rather than the fixed stock as well as fully operational sights peeps for zeroing at 100, 200, 300 and 400 yards. Book value on this rifle easily exceeds $3,000 and I have turned down a cash offer in that amount. This .308 is a true battle rifle and kicks like a mule - this is not a plinker or a good choice as al first rifle. Experienced shooters will appreciate this rifle, inexperienced shooters will regret the purchase / trade. If you have a serious interest in working a sale / trade on this rifle I would be happy for you to have it assessed by your own gunsmith prior to the transaction."

You may purchase the same rifle for less at Big5, Budsgunshop.com, Classicfirearms.com etc. You will pay less but you have no idea what you will receive.

Looking for an AR-15 (.556) or sell for 800.

Also have a Taurus PT111 9mm with holster and 2 mags.  1 is 10rd and other is 14 or 15rd.  The higher capacity mag needs tlc. Doesn't work properly.  Gun shoots nice.  May include this gun as well for the right deal.  I do have some ammo to include on the right deal.

Safe, effective, and innovative, the Shot Indicating Resetting Trigger (SIRT) Training Pistol was developed by shooters for shooters, to complement, not replace, live fire training. The SIRT Training Pistol brings together a host of patent pending technologies critical to improving shooting accuracy while addressing issues of cost and liability.

Ergonomic Frame Built to the highest standards of strength and durability, the SIRT frame has all the functional grip features of the Glock 17/22, and when fully assembled is designed to match the weight of your live fire pistol. Adjustable Resetting Trigger The SIRT's Adjustable Auto-resetting Trigger allows for multiple strings of fire during training without racking the slide, encouraging more repetitions per training session. Weighted Training Magazine The mags have a rubberized base plate for durability in training. Dual Indicator Lasers A red Trigger Prep Indicating laser gives you immediate feedback on your trigger mechanics while you prep your trigger. A green Shot Indicating laser gives you shot indication feedback on your follow-through. Laser Take-Up Toggle Switch The Laser Take-Up Toggle Switch allows you to shut off the Take-Up Indicating Laser, and just train with the Shot Indicating Laser. The Red and Green (Pro Model) Lasers may also be reversed with an internal switch.  Lasers allow for training practice anywhere range practice is impractical. Green laser leaves a trail on dark and you can even practice shoot at the moon and stars in the night sky and you will see the powerful beam going as far as the eye can see. Also, being exact deminsiobs of a a Glock 17/22,  any Glock holster or accesory is compatible. For more info on this model, check out www.nextleveltraining.com"

They have been fired and still have the primers. You will need to clean and deprime them yourself. I try to pick out pieces that are Berdan primed or are bent or cracked to the point that they cannot be reloaded. However, some of these may get into the bags. I try to weigh out an extra 10 pieces for every 500 to ensure you have quality pieces. They are all brass or nickel coated brass! These are mixed headstamp and the .45s have NOT been sorted for primer size (I would estimate 5-10% small primer). Most of it is .223 as well as a 5.56 once in a while. In the pistol cartridges, the majority are blazers, remingtons, winchesters, and federals.  I have tried to pick out the military rounds in .45 and 9mm.  I have handsorted every single piece to make sure its to high quality.

You can meet me for the brass at M6 and 131 for Grand Rapids residents.  Or, I can ship the package nationally, including Alaska and Hawaii in flat rate boxes.  I will accept cash or paypal for all transactions.  I charge $7, $14, and $18 for 3 sizes of flat rate boxes.  A very small handling/paypal fee is included in those shipping prices to help cover my expenses.  No fee for paying with cash.  The $7 box can take very small packages while the $14 and $18 boxes will be more common for most orders.  I have had great feedback from my online customers.

It has a high let off which really help a youngster with shooting.
Other length cams are a available on eBay for around $50

The bow also comes with 12 carbon arrows. (6 are brand new in box, 5 are in excellent condition, and one is damaged on the tip.) And a release. 

I will sell the now for $325 OBO. I have over $550 into it.

I just have no use for it anymore,  my son has outgrown it.
Make me an offer. 

Also open to trades
No junk. No single shots. No hipoints or anything like that.
Prefer lever guns, or something in 17 hmr but open to any caliber.
Worst I can do is say no.

I understand most guns are worth more than $325. I'm not necessarily looking for a straight trade. I can throw in cash for the right trade.

Heres the stats for it.  It is great for conceal and carry and shoots very well.  It's almost like new. It comes with 2 6 round short mags. It also comes with a belt attached double mag holster and a belt attached gun holster.  And it also comes with a nylon inside the panse holster as well and fits very comfortably for a 1911. I have only shot it a few times. Looking to sell this very soon so if you are interested enough to contact me please be serious. Thank you."
