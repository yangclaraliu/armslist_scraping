- The rifle
- ~400 rounds of ammo: 
	120 rds. of new manufacture Red Army Standard ammo 
     	Approximately 280 rds. of surplus ammo (I'm estimating there's about 20 rds. in the two opened bags. All the others are unopened with 30 rds.) 
- 6 magazines total: 
	3 NIB ProMag 40 rd. magazines 
	2 NIB Tapco 30 rd. magazines 
	1 surplus 30 rd. magazine 
- Carry bag

Didn't use this rifle much but it performed flawlessly when I did. Cleaned it after every outing and it wasn't bump-fired or anything that would cause undue stress. 

The smaller 5.45x39 ammo compared to it's big brother gives an almost non-existent recoil impulse, so it's comfortable to shoot even for novices/younger people. It's also demonstrated excellent accuracy even with surplus ammo, it's probably one of the best AR alternatives on the market. 


18+ with valid AZ DL, local sale only. Just need a photo of your Arizona driver's license, no bill of sale needed. Not interested in trades since I'm putting money from this toward school. 

Located on the East side in Gilbert, but can definitely travel within reason to meet. 

Thanks for looking!

(5) 20 round boxes of Hungarian Silver/Yellow Tip. This ammo was made in the late 80's which is practically brand new in the world of 7.62x54 ammo. It features a heavy FMJ 182 grain bullet with a steel core. It's loaded in lacquered steel cases giving it a pleasant gray appearance. The bullet and primer are both sealed with a red lacquer. I've shot a ton of this long ago when it was available and it's some of the very best ammo I've ever used. It's quite accurate, packs a heavy punch and it penetrates like crazy- far more than the light ball steel core ammo available today. The only flaw with this ammo is that recoil is noticeably heavier. Asking $75 for the 100 rounds. 

(5) 20 round boxes Russian made Match Ammo. This ammo was specifically loaded for accuracy. Tolerances are tighter and it uses a match grade propellant. It's brass case with a heavy FMJ 182 grain boat-tail bullet. The box is marked 1971, but it is bright, shiny and sure fire. It's without a doubt the most accurate ammo of this caliber that I've ever shot and I was able to routinely achieve sub-MOA 5 shot groups with a nice Finnish M27 rifle I used to own. It also performed very nicely in my Mosins and a SVT40. Asking $90 for the 100 rounds. 

(5) 20 round boxes East German M39 7.62x54 ammo. M39 ammo was originally designed as practice/training ammo primarily for machine guns. It's loaded with special black 124 grain FMJ steel core bullet. Velocity is not reduced, and the thought process was that the lighter projectile would travel less far than standard weight bullets. It's definitely not your typical training ammo as it penetrates 1/4"" steel plate with ease at 100 yards. One big benefit is that felt recoil is greatly reduced because of the light weight 124 grain bullet making it suitable for younger shooters and the ladies. This ammo is nearly impossible to find anymore and I've had it stashed away for many years. Asking $100 for the 100 rounds.

Really a nice firearm. I would be happy to keep but it's just collecting dust. With ammo, scope, and rifle I have about 2000$ invested in it. Only fired a couple times for function. Performed flawlessly from the start. Cash offers are preferred as I just bought a new Harley and want to replenish my acct. I will entertain trade offers but I want cash with it. I will not trade straight up. I will text or email pics upon request. Thx for looking. 920327zero856"

This is also the upgraded version with the fluted barrel, billet upper, forward assist and dust cover NOT the cheaper slickside model.  

I have upgraded the following things in this gun:

1) DPMS SASS Free Float Rail... Very sleek.

Here is the link to the rail:  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/329285/dpms-lrt-sass-low-quad-rail-free-float-handguard-lr-308-rifle-length-aluminum-black?cm_vc=ProductFinding

3) KNS Anti-Tilt Roll Pins

4) CAA AR15 Grip with storage compartment in the grip.

5) Barska Swat 6-24 x 60 illuminated Mil-Dot Scope - A good scope and Barska's top of the line model... Tracks well and holds zero... Cost $330

As you can see there is a good amount of money in this setup.  Gun also comes with a 20 round PMAG and a 10 Round PMAG for hunting.  It would cost well over $1600 to recreate this setup.

This gun is ready to go as a complete, long range setup...Only reason I am selling it is I have replaced it with a SCAR 17 and my Rem 700 SPS.  

PRICE is $1550...Trade value would be higher but prefer cash.

The Bipod and 18"" Lite Hunter Upper chambered in 338 Federal in the pictures are not included, but could potentially be negotiated in for the right deal (would make a great long range/battle rifle combo and the 338 Federal uses the same bolt and mags as the 308)."

The gun was bought brand new in 2010 and I am the original owner. I have put approximately 5,000 rounds through the gun, not an extreme amount, but its been shot some. I paid $1,100 for the gun + tax new. 

I also have about 4,000 rounds of 223/5.56 ammo that may go with the gun for the right price. (about 400-500 are Federal TRU- Tactical Rifle Urban- Noslier Ballistic Tip) The rest are different FMJ 55gr brands. about 1000 PMC Bronze, some BVAC, about 500 American Eagle (black box), Some Federal XM193..... NOTE (I WILL NOT SELL AMO ONLY SO DONT ASK, IF YOU BUY THE RIFLE I CAN PUT SOME IN THE DEAL, I HAVE OTHER RIFLES AND AM NOT SELLING ANY AMMO UNLES YOU BUY THIS RIFE OR THE MINI 14 I HAVE LISTED).

Optional accessories that are one the gun and may go with it if the price is right- EoTech model 552 ($500 new), Midwest Industries Quad Rail ($125 New), Streamlight TLR-1 HP light ($135) several spare mags, magpul adapters on mags, magpul flip up rear sight, CAA stock/cheek weld adapter, foregrip, extended latch on charging handle, Single point sling, Sling adaptor (switch from right to left handed shooting with out removing sling or any fancy work, simply put gun in other hand, shoulder weapon and sling is able to slide under stock and transition to other side of stock... if this is not visible in pics I will send you up close pics of the sling adaptor on stock of firearm and it will make perfect sence) Blackhawk tactical vest, ect.... many other accessories available if interested. 
Streamlight TLR-1 HP.... If you have never seen this light in action it is truly impressive. it is brighter than the 400-600 dollar ""tactical lights"" I guarantee it. I was in law enforcement and on a SWAT team and I have seen guys buy those $400 lights... during training and night fire exercises they could not believe that my $100+ was not only brighter, but had a better focused beam that reached farther and the batteries last longer than there ""tactical lights"" that cost them a full pay check. If you are familiar with hand held lights and you know about the stinger LED HP light, the TLR 1 HP is the same as far as performance its just able to be mounted on a weapon. it is truly a bright, reliable, awesome light. I have TLR1s lights on all my pistols and I used to have one on the AR until they came out with the TLR 1 HP, once I have seen that light in action in dark, smoke, fog.... I have never considered any other light. 

If you are looking for a TOTAL PACKAGE, gun/gear/amo in one easy transaction... this is definitely the place to look. I am moving soon and I am selling a few guns to finance the move. I do not have to sell anything, I WANT to, I know it can all be replaced after the move. so please no low ball offers. but like I was saying if your in the market for an AR style weapon ""system"" you can try and buy it piece by piece and (like I have done in the past) buy stuff that ends up not being what you needed, or you can just text and look at the gear I have. as I said, I was on a SWAT team, this is real gear that really works, its not all the stuff gun magazines tell you that you need, its what through practice and trial and error I have found that works for me in a tactical situation. 

*********Serious Inquiries only please TEXT ONLY REDACTED make offer*********


asking price- rifle only with no accessories, mags, ammo, sling... and minus the heat shield as I don't have the original anymore since I put on the quad rail........ $950

Asking price for everything pictured and ONLY what's pictured, gun, one mag, and all attached accessories.... $1,750

Asking price for TOTAL PACKAGE (including approximately 4,000 rounds of 223/5.56 ammo) all gear and accessories that I have listed and some that aren't but are AR accessories....... $4,500.

these prices are negotiable, but these were listed to give you an idea or ""ballpark"" figure. anyone wanting total package ($4,500 listing) I will be more open to trades and you may trade for up to HALF of the asking price, I would still need approx. $2000 in cash (unless you have a trade that just blows me away and is of equal value)"

It has had roughly 200 rounds of High grade American made Ammo through it. It's practically brand new.
I want $900 for the complete upper + Bravo Company posters and DVDs that came with it. (not including any accessories)
for $1000.00 I will throw in the UTG red/green dot scope, the 3x magnifier and flip-up backup sights. (the laser, flash light, slanted fore grip, vertical grip, and plastic rail guards are not for sale, they are coated to match the stock and grip). 
This is a great deal, price is firm. F2F deal, no shipping, I can meet you at any gun store or range in NJ, Philadelphia or greater Philadelphia area, NYC or greater NYC area.
Thanks.
Note: The bravo company Image below shows the price for just the upper but does not include the BCG + charging handle price. I paid $1135 for the complete upper."
