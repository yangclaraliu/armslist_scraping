The Remington Model 700™ Special Purpose Synthetic Tactical rifle delivers everything shooters love about the legendary Model 700 at an affordable price. From the rock-solid receiver’s ""three rings of steel"" configuration to exceptional right-out-of-the-box accuracy, the 700 SPS™ has all you’d expect from America’s most popular bolt-action centerfire rifle. Its improved all-weather synthetic stock is more ergonomic for better handling and has sling swivel studs. The carbon steel barrel comes clean without sights and is drilled and tapped to accept scope mounts. All exterior metal features a matte blued finish.
The SPS™ Tactical version adds features to deliver even more incredible tack-driving, game-dropping accuracy. Its X-Mark Pro® trigger is externally adjustable so you can customize the trigger pull. A SuperCell™ recoil pad minimizes kick for fast follow-up shots. The 20"" heavy-contour barrel teams with dual-point pillar bedding to enhance accuracy. The ergonomic black synthetic stock has Hogue® overmoldings for a sure grip in any weather, and a semi-beavertail forend aids stable shooting off a rest.

I have a like new Glock 26, gen 4. Comes with everything you would get if buying new (3 mags), plus talon grips (easily removed if you don't like them) and factory night sights.

About 200 rounds fired. Performs perfectly as all Glocks do. You must be an Indiana resident and willing to meet at an FFL for the transfer. I use Downrange Dynamics and they charge $25 will split it with you.

If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED. Yes, it is an out of state number, but I am located in Valparaiso. Thanks for looking and have a good day/night.  I have had a lot of time wasters lately so here is my FAQ section.

Q) I have XXXX for trade, are you interested?
A) NO, thank you, but not interested in any trades.

Q) Can we just do a bill of sale, I have a lifetime carry permit?
A) NO, through the FFL, sorry

Q) I will give you $500 for your Glock.
A) Well first, that isn't a question, that is a statement. Second, NO you will not give me $500 because my price is $550. I am firm at that price, if it doesn't sell, oh well.

Q) I can get that same gun at XXXX for $XXXX.
A) Again, that isn't a question, that is a statement. If you can get it here or there for this or that, GREAT, go get it. I know what the prices are locally and online and mine is well within reason, even for a used Glock.

Q) Do you have any extras?
A) Yes, for additional cost. I have 2 33 round mags that I would be willing to part with for $40 each. Price is set. Need ammo, I may have some I can spare, but you will need to let me know how much you want and I can give you a price."

Benefits Of Gun Consignment
We've been asked several times about gun consignment both how it works and why we keep a percentage of the final sale price.

First, when you consign a gun with us we take the hassle and burden out of selling a firearm to an unknown individual. Federal law requires us to file the appropriate paperwork that takes the gun out of your name and into the name of the buyer. We cover the expense of background checks, paperwork and insurance. 

Second, we not only market guns locally but we also list many of them nationally. With an FFL, we are able to ship the guns to other FFL's without too much hassle. Forget answering a ton of questions from online inquiries, taking a bunch of photos and then communicating with the purchasing party to coordinate shipping to their FFL. 

Third, we understand some people have no clue when it comes to guns. Either it was passed down from generation to generation or even received as a birthday gift, Christmas present or Fathers Day surprise. We are always willing to help someone come up with a value for a gun. The choice is yours to consign it with us or sell it using one of the online auctions or local newspapers. We can even help you with the private transaction for a nominal fee. 

Just remember, LineSiders is not a pawn shop. We are a fishing, hunting, camping and now firearms consignment store. We don't loan money on guns and we generally do not buy guns out right. Our family friendly atmosphere is what keeps customers coming back time and time again. We're here to get to know you and your family. Granted we can't remember everyones name but we do our best. So please, stop in and say hello. See what we're all about."

From the manufacturer
The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. It features a black synthetic collapsible stock, 16.12"" barrel with a Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat Anodized finish, shoots 5.56mm NATO and .223 Rem"

This is a low hour unit in great condition.  I had one of the deck boards crack when I was moving it from the garage to the shed due to that piece of the deck being dropped since it was removed for transport.  It will come on a stand as well, so it's up nice and high.

I went back to a sliding compound miter saw to safe space in the shed and make it easier to get it out.

Rifle Features Features:
Fluted Bull Barrel, threaded for suppressor use
Accu-trigger (this thing is incredible!)
5 round detachable box magazine
Lightweight, durable synthetic stock

This is a well maintained, Custom-Camo painted (woods with snakeskin effect) rifle topped with a Bushnell Sportsman 3-9x40 rifle scope that comes with a Savage 5rd magazine, new padded shoulder strap and carrying case. This package is ready to go, needs nothing but ammo! 

IF you can find one, you know this is a hard-to-get tack driver of a rifle.. and a great one to perfect/train your technique on. It's also great for new or younger shooters but is still a blast for experienced shooters. Fluted barrel is threaded for a suppressor. It will shoot nearly any ammo you feed it, including sub-sonic ammo, though we've come to love the High Velocity CCI goods.

The Scope is a Waterproof Bushnell Sportsman with their incredible 3-2-1 low light reticle, and personally, I love it. It gathers light extremely well, has clear optics and never fogs up. 

There is NO DAMAGE, period. It is in excellent condition and has always been stored indoors, in a padded case. The camo paint it new and without dings, chips or blemish. The bolt and action have been polished which makes it cycle like it's lube with butter, it's amazing to shoot! 

I don't want to sell it,. but we just moved, and well, you know how moving across country goes: it always costs more than you'd imagined it would! So, as they say, ""My loss, your gain"""

Let it sit for a while now it is time to re-list it.

Bought about 3 years ago, because I just had to try a Glock. Well, I’ve tried but they just don’t fit my hands well and I hate just letting it sit in the safe. It is a great shooting pistol, has been completely reliable and accurate. I bought it used, so I do not know the actual round count, but I don’t believe it to be very many (look at the wear on the outside of barrel – not much there). I have personally only put (60) – (75) .40 rounds through it and (32) 9mm rounds. Since I have owned it, I have added the following;

-(3) Additional standard capacity magazines – LE Marked, if that matters to you.
-Trijicon “Operator” night sights. They are 2008 vintage and still have plenty of glow to them.
-Crimson Trace Grip mounted laser – Not currently installed. Works very well. Have original box and tools.
-KKM .40 to 9mm conversion barrel, bought used, previous owner claimed about one hundred rounds through it. I have put another (32) through it. It is actually for a long slide model (35?), but fits and functions just fine. I had plans to get it threaded, but never ended up doing it. 
-(2) standard capacity 9mm mags and (1) 10-round 9mm mag.

As for condition, everything looks really good except for some very light finish wear near the muzzle end of the slide and on the slide release. As far as value goes, here is what I am figuring (I could be wrong too);
-Pistol, box, (1) magazine and orig. accessories = $400 
-(3) additional magazines @ $20.00 each = $ 60.00
-Trijicon Operator Night Sights = $100.00
-Crimson Trace grip mounted laser = $125.00
-KKM .40 to 9mm conversion barrel = $100.00
-(2) Standard capacity 9mm mags at $20.00 ea. = $40.00
-(1) 10-round capacity 9mm mag at $15.00 = $15.00

Subtotal = $840 

I am asking $725 (dropped from $800)  (Prefer to sell or trade this as a package.)

Depending on your trade, the trade could be + cash on either side. Also have some Speer Lawman ammunition I might be convinced to part with as part of a trade.

Trade interests, in no particular order; CZ P-01, CZ SP-01, CZ P-09, CZ Rifles (prefer .223, .308), VZ 58, Dan Wesson 1911, Colt 1911, Springfield Loaded, Marlin 1894 in .357 (might consider a .44 as well) – needs to be JM marked, Aimpoint - Comp M4 or Micro, Smith & Wesson MP 15-22, Smith & Wesson Shield in 9mm - combinations of these and knives or silver or maybe something else I haven’t thought of – the worst I could say is a polite “no thank you”."

So yes, when you want to convert this gun over to a Glock 19 and shoot 9mm then you just change barrels and magazines and save yourself $10 a box of ammo while target shooting.  There are only 2 reasons why I am selling this gun.  I am going to all 9mm pistols and the other reason is because Glock's don't fit my hand welll.  

I do have a few hundred rounds of UMC 40 S&W FMJ brass ammunition that I would selll for what ever I paid for it at Dunham's and I have a used in good condition Galco King Tuk IWB Holster for it as well as a new in the package Galco Royal Guard holster and a Bianchi Paddle Holster.  I have the Royal Guard and Bianchi holster listed on this site as well.

Here's the run down on the money.  $550 for the gun + $100 for the nearly new conversion barrel + $25x2=$50 for the 2 new 9mm magazines.  If you want the ammo or one of the holsters we can discuss that when you buy the gun.

It was built here in Knoxville on a WW receiver with a Bulgarian parts kit. The numbers match, and the parts look brand new. This rifle has a gunkote finish, which in my opinion is twice as nice as the Arsenal SGL-31's finish. This rifle also has a new ESS USA made chrome lined barrel with a 1:8 twist. I have put 270 rounds through it without a hitch. I've decided to sell all of my 5.45 stuff with this rifle, as I am moving forward with 7.62 instead. So, if you have been wanting to get into an AK74 for cheap, here is your chance. I am selling the whole lot. This consists of:

1) Waffen Werks AK74 with Polish AKM sling.
2) 870 rounds of military surplus 7N6 5.45x39 ammo, plus 180 rounds of Golden Tiger non-corrosive ammo. 1,050 rounds total.
3) 16 mags total. 4 are ((21)) Bulgarian brown mags, 3 Russian plum mags, 1 ((10)) black Bulgarian mag, 1 bakelite Russian Molot RPK 45 round mag, 4 black Tapco mags, and 3 Bulgarian commercial mags. All the mags listed are 30 rounders, except for the 45 rounder. All of the mags except for the commercial Bulgarians and the Tapcos have steel reinforced feed lips, locking lugs and tabs. The mags alone are worth over $300 in today's market.

I am asking $1100 for it all, which in my opinion is more than fair. I will trade for an AKM in 7.62x39 plus boot, or we could probably work out a deal in trading ammo for ammo and mags for mags. If I left something out, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Make me a reasonable offer."

It resides in a handmade stock by Paulson himself, and sports vintage Redfield sights. It is in the original 7.65x53 Argentine, unlike it`s thousands of similar sporters, which were converted to .30-06. In my limited experience, I`ve found that it is a lot cheaper than .30-06 too. The weapon has been used, and it shows. It has no Rust, just some patina on the Bolt face. Mr. Paulson is now deceased, and that only makes this Mauser worth more. Most of his work is in private collections, too. I had it priced at about $700-$750 by a friend who is very knowledgeable on this subject. It only needs a good bolt cleaning, although everything functions exactly as it should.
