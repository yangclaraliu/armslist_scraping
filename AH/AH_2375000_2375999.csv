I have installed a Hogue Overmolded pistol grip (the #1 upgrade you can make to your AK) and a MAKO group recoil absorbing adjustable stock (I no longer have the Warsaw stcok).  
The camo is self applied using a technique learned from Rich Graham (look him up on Youtube).  All important areas were covered or taped.  
The rifle comes with a five round Arsenal magazine. I have several 30 round imported magazines as well.
100 rounds of Brown Bear ammo will be included with purchase.
YES, I am open to partial trades.  BUT I am only interested in a fairly new Glock 22 or 23 (with a 31 or 32 be acceptable).

I’ve bought a new compact .45ACP, so one of these will need to go.  I really love both of these pistols – but I really don’t shoot pistols much (just luv my rifles too much and not enough time), so my pistols are more about getting cleaned than shot (frown). Neither of these 1911’s have had a lot of rounds through them (not that it matters for a pistol) and both have been taken really well care of. So here they are:

Springfield 1911-A1 Loaded Target (Model PI9132LP)
 All Springfield Armory Loaded 1911-A1 pistols include all the modern-day improvements that used to be performed only by custom gunsmiths.  This model includes a Precision-fit forged frame, slide and barrel, front and rear cocking serrations, flat, serrated mainspring housing, lowered and flared ejection port, delta lightweight hammer, loaded chamber indicator, titanium firing pin, Carry Bevel Treatment, ambidextrous thumb safety, High-Hand Beavertail Grip Safety, dovetail front sight, premium adjustable rear sights, Torx-head grip screws and lightweight, adjustable speed trigger. Made in USA
Pistol is near perfect and comes with the original case and accessories. I bought this pistol brand new and have babied it ever since….               Asking $725

Springfield 1911-A1 GI Mil-spec Polished Stainless (Model PW9151L)

I have a very nice condition model 27-2 magnum with the 6 inch barrel. I have owned it for about 30 years as my desk/night stand gun. It shoots sweet and clean and looks very nice. The 27 models are referred to as the ""cadillac"" of S & W full size N frame revolvers. I do believe the previous owner had it reblued at some point, it has some very slight color differences in the finish, but the whole gun overall is very pretty and has not a single problem or blemish. I have shot this less than 100 times in 30 years, so very little use. An impressive gun and a great home defense weapon. A little big to carry, but I will throw in a nylon shoulder holster should you choose that option. Do a little research and you will see this is a gun made the right way and will last a long time. Would be a great gun for a hunting sidearm too. The grips are Pachmayr Presentation models. I do not have the original grips etc. Just the gun the way you see it and the holster. The price is very well below going rate on this and other sites, this is to reflect the reblue issue. Same gun reblued went for over $800 on Guns America Auction site."

All the small parts are correct for this pistol, including the barrel. The pistol looks like it has been cleaned many years ago but not buffed. The markings are all crisp and deep and there does not appear to be any buffing. The barrel is original but has old rust and pits throughout. The grips are original but show much wear and age. The checkering is worn and the edges are rounded and soft. It did not have a magazine when I purchased it so I simply put a WWII mag in there.

Product Information

    Introducing America’s next tactical and home-defense, semi-automatic shotgun, the SRM Model 1216. This revolutionary new design features a 16-round detachable magazine. The 1216 provides force multiplication and unsurpassed firepower for a single operator. With an ambidextrous shooting design, picatinny rail, and triple-faced hand-guard, the 1216 is a paradigm shift in the tactical shotgun industry. Additional NFA short-barreled models feature a 12-round (1212 model) or 8-round (1208 model) magazine.

    Design Features of the SRM 1216 include:
        Ergonomic compact design along with the flexibility of a detachable magazine provides unsurpassed firepower, force multiplication, and tactical advantages.
        Rotary, Detachable high capacity magazine holding 8, 12, or 16 rounds of either 2 3/4 or 3 inch shotshells.
        Semi-automatic action that self feeds following the rotation of the quad-tube, revolving magazine.
        Roller delayed action provides fast cycling and reduced felt recoil.
        Overall length of the 1216 model is only 34 inches with a standard 18 inch barrel, but the more compact 1212 and 1208 are available.
        An integrated picatinny rail combined with a three face handguard rail offers the shooter a broad range of options for mounting optics, sights, lights and other tactical accessories.
        Pushpin disassembly and break open design allows for easy field stripping and maintenance.
        Ambidextrous receiver and controls can be set up for either right or left handed shooters."

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

I bought this gun on August 21, 2013. So I have had it a little over 90 days. I have NEVER fired this gun. It was an impulse buy for defensive carry. Honestly, it does not fit my carry needs. 
I paid 385.84 out the door (receipt shown in picture) with tax, law enforcement discount, ammo, extra mag and fobus holster. I am asking 350.00 and I am firm. Being that I have a lot going on, if people inquire if I will take less, I will simply will not reply. The extra magazine was 25, ammo was 19 (stickered boxes shown in pictures), and fobus paddle holster was 25.
This gun comes with the white cardboard box, ruger pad lock, instruction manual and two spare butt plates. You are getting a new gun for 350.00
This is a legitimate deal so please have your CPL present.

This firearm is recently back from the recall issued by Springfield. The gun has had 200 rounds fired through it. This listing includes 8 magazines, (4) 5 rounders and (4) 7 rounders. The gun has trouble feeding Gold Dot through the 7 rounders if fully loaded. If there are six rounds in the mag, it feeds GD fine. This tells me that the mags probably just need to sit loaded for a while. Also included is a Multi Holsters IWB right handed holster, also used. A Blackpoint Tactical Modular Accessory Pouch (used) which holds 1 mag and a Streamlight 1L or 2L. A Streamlight 1L is included also, it too is used. THe gun has a Talon gun grip on it, and a second one will be included. All the used items are in excellent condition. I am the original owner of the firearm. The gun was purchased on 10/31/12 at GA Firing Line. The receipt is in the box. Buyer will also receive a range pass to Hi Caliber, in Canton, GA. You're not just getting a gun, you're getting an entire carry system.

For sale is 100 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W.
I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)
3. Ruger SP101, 3 inch barrel - 930 fps (303 ft. lbs.)

It has two magazines (both are 10 round mags since it was purchased originally in California). There is a tad bit of rust on the slide because it wasn't oiled when I was deployed and I found it when I got back. I cleaned it up nice and you can barely see it. Other than that, no problems firing it, ever. 

I love the gun but have been concealing it lately, and it's just too large and uncomfortable for the clothes that I wear. 

I am looking for something smaller to trade for like a S&W Shield 9mm, or a Kimber Ultra Carry ii (obviously I would add $ to that trade).  Other trade offers are welcome, but please don't contact me for a trade if it's not a medium-small concealable handgun. Not interested in shotguns, hunting rifles, etc. 

If you aren't interested in trading, I will gladly sell and go grab a small handgun from Big Boys later. Price is 450 or best offer. 

PICTURES: for some reason I can't find the pics I took of it on my computer so I will try to add them later, or email/text them to you when I get home later tonight and can snap a few. Other than that...it looks just like a S&W MP .40."

So far it has had a new clutch installed last year and oil changes periodically. Tires are still good. Only cosmetic damage is to the front left turn signal, front left fender and front left hood.

He bought a box of knives from Rudy Ruana and sold them to a group of us gathered to learn wilderness survival techniques.  Our knife was one of our main survival tools (2nd only to our brain).  This knife has enough weight to do the work of a small axe, and the length to be a small machete.

It saw average use for about 4 years, then was put away for about 20.  It's been carried on a couple of hunting trips in the last decade, but that's all.

Ruana knives are not very common, and this configuration is less common than most.  Look at the bone on the handle.  I've seen some as nice, but never seen any nicer.  Everything is tight and smooth.  The sheath might could use a shot of saddle soap, but this was a tool, not some 'safe queen'.  It could be spiffed up for display, but I'm not into that.

You won't be disappointed with this knife.  I currently have it listed on E-Bay, so depending on the auction, any deal we want to make may be delayed.  This listing will evaporate when the knife is no longer available."

Ok , ok . I apologize, I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.  
I'm certain that I responded to the correct ad and now I trust that the gun is in great condition.  
I assume you meant ""it"" instead of ""if"" in your third from last sentence below.  I hate assuming though because you know the old saying....  
I am really interested in the gun, would you be willing to trade it for some ""items""?  I have an extensive adult video collection containing anything you could possibly imagine, therefore you could get videos going either way you prefer or even a mixture going both ways if that's your thing. 
I have cassettes I value at $20 each, DVDs valued at $30, and even a limited selection of Blue Ray Discs at $45 each.  You could give me a general idea of what interests you and what type of media you'd need and I could pull a large selection and meet you somewhere.  That way you could choose your favorites and get as many as it would take to get to your asking price, depending on what type of media you need. 
Does this sound like a trade you might be interested in?  If not, I have other things too.  Just list a few things you're looking for and I'll let you know if I have them.  Things such as an ATV , boat, camping tent, pocket toys, you name it.  I consider myself a collector. 
Thank you sir, I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  I'm hoping the first trade option I mentioned will tickle your fancy, but if not I'm sure we can work something out. 

Thanks again,"

The MCS-T5A stock is offered in two version a T5 non adjustable cheek and the T5A with a adjustable cheek and KMW hardware. The T5A version is designed as a right hand grip, with a small thumb rest on the left side of the stock. The T5 non adjustable cheek version has a ambidextrous grip.

Although the T5A version is a right hand stock, we designed it so that if you have to shoot with your weak hand it stills feels good. A lot of time went into the design of the grip on this stock, it moves your hand down and forward so your trigger finger is in a more natural position and you are not having to reach for the trigger. The area behind the trigger looks odd but it is designed to make your hand return to the same spot each time you grip the stock. It works very well with all sizes of hands, small or large.

Both versions come standard with a fixed 1 Pachmyer Decelerator pad. It can also be ordered with the optional butt spacer system and a 1/2 Decelerator pad .The standard weight for the T5A is 4.0 lbs. And the T5 is 2.7 lbs. The forend is 2.40” wide at the tip and will take barrels up to 1.350 inches in diameter. The very top end of the forend is designed with a slight flare to accept the Badger Ordance EFR night vision mount. It also has a butt hook that can be used to ride the bags or control your rifle with your non-trigger hand. The MCS-T5 was designed around a Rem 700 style action, but can be had for Winchester, Savage, Howa and other actions. For a complete list please check out the order online/stock builder, or call for more details."

The left side of the barrel is marked “COLT”, “ARMY / SPECIAL”, and “32-20 W.C.F.”. The crane cut is marked “322798” and the crane is marked “322798”. There is the Colt “VP” proof mark at the top left front of the trigger guard and a “3” at the top left rear of the trigger guard. The left side plate is marked with a Rampant Colt over a stylized “C”.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly both single action and double action. 
Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None
My assessment: The Colt Army Special was brought out in 1908, about two years before this particular example was manufactured. The “Army Special” was later renamed the “Official Police”. This caliber ammunition is still commercially available. This caliber was popular as a small game cartridge and was offered in both revolvers and rifles. You can still enjoy shooting this revolver, either for it’s ability to harvest small game or for its ability to control pests and varmints. It makes a decent home protection gun as well. 

My grandfather purchased this Colt revolver new and it has passed to me. I have shot only three rounds through it and that may be the extent of it's use.  This is a real nice ""cowboy"" gun.  Very well balanced and a pleasure to hold.  I have enjoyed owning this gun and it has never failed to impress those friends that I have showed it to.  I live aboard a boat now and sail it to Canada frequently which requires that I must find a someone to babysit my Colt each time.  Owing it is simply no longer practical for me and it's time I find a new, good home for the Colt Army Special."

I took it to the range and ran through two winchester white boxes, and half a box of hornady zombie max without any issues.(pretty sure my buddy was limp wristing the gun causing it to jam) It did not like the steel cases Tulammo. This is a small pistol that you can throw in your pocket. The only reason that I am selling it is because I don't like the idea of carrying a .380.

I had planned on using it but now need the money for Christmas.  I took it one time to an indoor range and put only 50 rounds through it; it is not even broken in yet!  This Henry is absolutely beautiful.  After I purchased it and held it I can now see why people buy these and display them without ever firing one round.  I put one box of specials and one box of magnums through at the range to test it out.  I highly recommend this rifle because the beauty of it is the variety of ammunition you can use.  If you use .44 specials, the recoil is non-existent.  Honestly, a teenager could shoot this with zero concern at all about recoil.  On the other hand if you use a .44 magnum (I used one box of Hornady LEVERevolution 225 grain FTX) this gun is all macho!  The .44 magnums go though super clean and the power is amazing!  I bought this Henry for $750.00.  The gun is in mint, brand new condition and is super clean.  When I received it, it had a very insignificant mark from the factory on the walnut butt stock so I called Henry Repeating Arms and they sent me a brand new one that I never installed.  Honestly, I just called them because I paid enough for it that I wanted it 100% perfect.  The mark on the stock is really something that most people would have let go anyway because it is so small.  I am asking $725.00 firm and will include much more for you.  You will receive an actual value of somewhere around $900.00.  Thank you very much for your time.

Firearm is in 80% condition and functionally A1. The only issues are with bluing wear from holster wear. The firearm has many exceptional features including a throated chamber which makes feeding of hollow point or flat-nose rounds more reliable, 8+1 capacity, a beveled magazine well, and a magazine interlock safety. I have shot this pistol and find it quite pleasant to fire and very accurate.

There are currently 5 of these for sale on Armslist in the entire country. People seem to hold onto them, but I am trying to avoid having yet another caliber to stockpile. Not pictured is a very hard to find NIB Triple K magazine. ($50 with shipping.) This is supposed to arrive in the mail tomorrow and goes to the buyer. Also included are over 200 rounds of ammo: 20 rounds Federal low recoil JHP. 125 FMJ rounds. 61 JHP round, as well as a range holster."
