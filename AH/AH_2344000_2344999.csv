The fit, feel and finish of the Horseman is similar to the old west models, but with improvements that make the gun stronger and easier to handle. The transfer-bar combined with a coil main spring provides durability and reliability that the cowboys of yesteryear would love to have had. 

The Horseman embodies other upgraded features; including a wider trigger, and a smoother, crisper trigger pull. There are other single-action revolvers with transfer-bar safeties on the market, but the Uberti 1873 Horseman is the only one with the classic look and feel of the original 1873 Colt Single-Action Army."

This rifle is nicer than anything you will find at Cabela's or Gander Mountain. All parts are original and were manufactured in 1933 at the Izhevsk arsenal in Russia. All cosmoline has been thoroughly removed from all parts of the rifle, and the bolt has been polished to a beautiful shine. The hex receiver has a beautiful, smooth blue finish. Unlike the wartime rifles, this piece was milled with care and with much more attention to detail. All numbered parts match, and all non-numbered parts bear the Izzy markings. The wood has been treated with oil (typical of the earlier pre-war rifles) and not that yucky dark lacquer that you find on the vast majority of M91/30s. I will also throw in a lovely, sharp bayonet along with 40 rounds of Barnaul 7.62x54R. Price is $225 and is FIRM, cash only, no trades. Sorry, but any offers for trades or less than $225 cash will be ignored. If interested, please TEXT (214) 519-9102. Thanks for looking!!!"

While the new OPTIMA V2 shares the name of its popular predecessor, the “Version 2” gun has a completely different design in many ways. Modeled after CVA’s top-of-the-line ACCURA V2, the OPTIMA V2 features the same trigger-guard actuated breeching lever, internal parts, and “neutral center-of-gravity” trigger. Add in CVA’s Quick Release Breech Plug (which is finger removable without any tool what-so-ever), 100% ambidextrous stock, and CrushZone recoil pad, and you’ve got a gun with more quality features than any other muzzleloading rifle in its price range. Equipped with a 26” 416 grade stainless steel barrel, the OPTIMA V2 is easy to maneuver in the tree stand and comfortable to carry in the mountains. And it comes standard with a DuraSight® DEAD-ON™ one-piece scope mount and CVA’s solid aluminum PalmSaver Ramrod.

Comes with 2 stainless steel magazines, one with a finger exstension and one without. Also comes with an aftermarket plastic pistol box and an Owner's manual that I downloaded and copied from the internet. This gun was made in 2005 according to Smith & Wesson. It has light handling marks as you can see in the pictures. The scratch just forward and below the ejection port on the right side is hard to see when you're looking at the pistol, you have to hold the gun just right under the light to see it.The grips and rifling are very good to near new. The barrel bore is shiny and the rifling is strong.  I've only put something like a 150 - 200 rounds through this gun. When I got it this summer it had what appeared to be factory grease on it still which was why I bought it. If it had been fired, it wasn't much. This gun is one of the PPK/S's that was on a recall list. I personnaly sent it to Smith & Wesson. They repaired it and sent it back to me. Cash only if transfered locally to an Indiana resident, certified bank check or USPS money order if shipped out via FedEx or UPS. For $100.00 I can ship this to your FFL. It is EXPENSIVE because I have to ship it over night via FedEx or UPS. I will need a verifiable, valid/current copy of your dealer's FFL to ship this. If sold to an Indiana resident, I need a photocopy of your valid/current state issued Indiana ID for my file. Thank you for your interest.

Nothing wrong with it, I just miss having something in .40 and would like to get another one as the title says.

It is almost new, bought it new last week and have only put 100 rounds through it, shoots very well. These are S&W's take on the LCR, polymer frame with an excellent DA trigger and built in laser, +P rated.  If you're looking for something to carry these are very easy to do so, they weigh less than a pound (14.3oz) and are easily pocket carried while still being comfortable to shoot.

As the title says I'm really wanting to trade for something in .40.  I'm primarily looking for a .40 caliber Glock (23 or 27) or Springfield XD.  Open to other .40's though, so let me know what you have.  Be reasonable though, I'm not interested in Hi Points or Sigma's.  Might look at 9mm's and .45's as well, but again, focusing on a .40.  I would really like to have a Beretta Nano as well.

If not interested in trading I will sell it along with a speedloader and a box of .38 special for $450

I have my CCL.

They are matte stainless. They have crimson trace grips and both have had action jobs as well as the triggers have been contoured. They have about 50 rounds through them. They do have the locks on them but they have been disabled. I have the parts to enable them if you wanted to. They come with original box. I'm not in a hurry to get rid of these. My price is $600.00 OBO. I have over $700 in the pistol. I'd also entertain trade. See below. I will not ship and transfers must be made through a FFL. You pay your transfer fee and I'll pay mine.

Today, I shot 100 rds. of .45 ACP FMJ Feds through my new ULTRA CDP II I trad WOW!! what a handgun with no malfuntions. I am extremely pleased with this weapon. I shot the bullseye out of the paper; much more accurate than the Colt Defender I used to own. I don't have my CCW renewed yet but wore it concealed around the house the first day I got it and it proved light and quite comfortable with the melt Kimber did as a standard feature. The Colt Defender runs around $1150 now days and this gun at 1,100 has so many more features.

Only two of the mags have been loaded and fired, the 10 rd. and 1 of the 20 rd. This rifle comes with everything you would need to care for it. If someone wanted to put the other flash suppressor with the bayonet lug on the barrel they could, and I have a bayonet that I'll include with it as well. I believe I can find the original butt pad for the stock as well, it's rubber. I used the G.I. issue metal one that is on it, as it makes the recoil more manageable in rapid fire.  This will be a face to face transaction only, in Jacksonville, NC, no exceptions.  No trade interests."

Never been crashed, wrecked, laid down or whatsoever. Never seen a rain. Always garage kept. 95% plus condition. No scratches or dents are found. Gas mileage is about 65-70 MPG. The first oil change was done at 700 miles as recommended by manufacture to completely broken in the bike. The latest change was done recently at 3683 miles. The air filter was cleaned also at the same time. 
Now, the number on speedometer is 4225. So, you're still have around 2500 miles to ride before the next oil change.

The only thing I have modified on the bike is the slip-on, aftermarket HOT BODIES carbon fiber exhaust. Sound great. Still have the original one, so you'll get both. 

All the services on this bike were performed by MidAmericaPowersport, not in my garage.

There is nothing wrong with the bike. I just don't have time to ride anymore. As you can tell in the pictures, the bike is nice and clean. It is well maintained and absolutely beautiful. I washed it and it's ready to go. It needs nothing but a new owner. Clean and clear KS title.

If you're interested and want to take a look at it, please call or text 316 5one9, seven399. Must have cash in hand to test ride. No joy rider."

I really don't know why they would name this a ""Plinker"", because with a six inch barrel and adjustable sights, this revolver is more accurate than most offhand marksman.  In other words, It will shoot more accurately than the shooter is able to master.  This gorgeous piece has gone up in the retail listings (when you can find it) $60 since I first purchased it.  These are scarce to find, more so than the four inch and they're pretty tough themself.  I will only do the transfer in the Florissant area, in early morning, and for cash or money order.  There will be a bill of sale with a signature and Missouri drivers license number required."

I got this rifle not too long ago, lubed it, and shot it at the range.  I found out three things.  First, it cycles 38 a little better than .357 - maybe 1-3 .357 rounds out of 20 that didn't chamber easily in my experience, possibly attributable to short-stroking the action on my part.  Second, it's pretty accurate at 50 yards both with .357 (a little above point of aim) and .38 (a little below point of aim).  Third, I realized that I didn't like it very much.  

Part of my problem I guess is that redundant safety switch on the bolt; the whole time I've owned this I've not moved it more than about 5-6 times.  It's also ugly and has no place on a lever-action.  I thought I could get used to it but it just ruins the lines of the rifle for me.  Somebody else may either like it/accept it or be willing to put in the effort to get it removed/replaced.  

It's had about 50 rounds down the pipe, and has had multiple dummy rounds of both .38 and .357 cycled through the action (it seems to like real rounds better than the light-weight dummy rounds).  Like all lever-actions it doesn't seem to like being short-stroked - indeed, I'd say this one is pretty sensitive to short-stroking.  

Please contact me by email only.  Please also note that while I am obviously looking to sell it I'm not giving it away either; at the quoted price I'm taking a loss, so if I can't get that I'll be getting it cleaned and lubed and keeping it for a while.  Please keep these things in mind when making any offers.  I'm not interested in trades at this time.

As always, the arm is as is.  I will require an Ohio DL for ID purposes and a receipt to be signed.
