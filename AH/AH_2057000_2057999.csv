The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber.

The stock has a couple minor dings, but the barrel and metal are all in great shape.  

This rifle was designed as a competition gun and was imported from Germany.  It was sold there as the Diana model 45, and it is still extremely accurate.  It's really fun to shoot, but I just don't shoot it enough to justify holding onto it.  

This would be an awesome gun for kids or adults looking to get into competition air rifle shooting, but not looking to spend 600 dollars or more for a gun alone, or even teaching your kid to shoot without breaking the bank on crazy ammo prices.  This air rifle isn't a toy bb gun!

The rifle features an adjustable trigger, a rear site that is adjustable for windage and elevation, and an adjustable front site as well.  It sits in a really nice monte carlo style stock, and has great balance and accuracy.

I will consider trades for firearms, and possibly accessories, but I'm not really looking for ammo and cash is always king."

Up for sale/trade is my lightly used Sig P238 w/night sights.
The sights are SIGLITES on the rear and a Tru-Glo TFO on the front in Green/Green.
It will come with factory box, literature, Hogue wrap around grip, factory grips, 7 round mag, Comp-Tac Infidel IWB kydex holster and an Uncle Mike's pocket holster.
The night sights are quite impressive and bright.
I like the pistol, it's just too small for my hands and I need something a little bigger.
I'll check with my FFL but shipping will be at your cost if we can't do FTF in the Dallas area.

It is in great shape and aside from some slight wearing on the control surfaces it appears to have been handled and fired very little.  Has a set of Hogue grips on it that make it fit the hand very nicely, also has older but still usable night sights.  Only comes with one mag but it is an extended 8 round mag and P239 mags are readily available online.

I'm primarily interested in trading for a XDM 40 3.8in compact (needs to be the compact with the shorter grip, not interested in one with a fullsize grip.) I would trade straight across for one assuming its in great shape and comes with all the xd gear.  

I would also be interested in either a glock 27 or 23, an XD40 subcompact or service model, or a Beretta PX4 compact or subcompact in .40, but let me know if you have any other double stack .40 that I might be interested in, though I'm not wanting anything full sized.  I might also consider a higher end (no Tauruses) snub nosed .38/.357 revolver, but I'm really more interested in semi autos.

Will sell for $600 firm if not interested in trading.

Please don't offer me a stock 26 with 2 mags and nothing else and expect a reply. I'm looking for a set up 26 ready to go.
I have a converted saiga ak74 with two mags and about 200 rounds of milsurp ammo to trade. Tapco conversion parts. Not beat up or ugly, function is flawless. If you aren't familiar with the ballistics of 5.45x39 it's pretty much the russian 5.56 except it's cheaper, steel core, and has marginally better ballistics. Great rifle.

45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living."

No other rifle holds the power and mystique of the legendary Winchester Model 70 Super Grade – the ultimate expression of the Rifleman’s Rifle. For the first time ever, The Midway Foundation was proud to offer a matching set of four truly unique  limited production Winchester Model 70 Super Grade rifles, each of which is chambered in a cartridge that’s ideal for the game animals they commemorate, and is so marked on the magazine floorplate. The Varmint rifle is chambered in the blistering  22-250 Remington, the Deer/Antelope in the flat shooting 270 Winchester, the Elk/Moose in the potent 300 Winchester Magnum and the Dangerous Game rifle in the bone crushing 375 H&H Magnum. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheekpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt  head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection.

Included are two 8 round magazines, foam taurus case and a galco KingTuk hybrid style (like a crossbreed) in the waistband holster for comfortable concealed carry. 

I really don't want to sell this gun, but money is tight. This gun shoots just as well as my other 1911s that cost twice as much. Because it is a Taurus, it will also come with their lifetime warranty. If you research the taurus 1911, you will see it comes with ALOT of features you only see at much higher price points, like checkered trigger guard, mainspring housing, and frontstrap, ambidextrous safety, beavertail grip safety with memory pad, target hammer, skeleton trigger (this trigger on this pistol is amazing, crisp and clean), novak sights, polished throat and feedramp, lowered and flared ejection port, custom internal extractor, extended magazine release, and beveled magazine well. Do your research, I think you will find this to be a great gun and a very fair price. This gun gets excellent reviews everywhere you look.
