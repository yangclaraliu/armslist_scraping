I bought it on sale for $475 plus 7% tax the total came out to be $508 and change. I mounted it on my M4 and stuck it in my safe. I only had the battery in it for 10 minutes tops to check for function and it is 100%.  I got a offer for my M4 I just could not pass up so I sold it. So back in the box it went. It comes with the factory warranty card as well. I will ship it for actual shipping but it has to have insurance to cover the original 508 just in case. Which I believe is $1 per $100.

Requirements were issued in 1949 that the pistol had to be chambered for 9 mm Parabellum and could not exceed 7 inches in length or weigh more than 25 ounces.[2]
Candidates included Browning Hi-Power variants by Canada's Inglis and Belgium's Fabrique Nationale, and Smith & Wesson's S&W Model 39. Colt entered a modified version of their M1911 pistol that was chambered for 9 mm Parabellum, had an aluminum alloy frame, a short 4.25-inch barrel, and a 9-round magazine. In 1951, Colt moved their candidate into regular production. It was the first aluminum-framed large frame pistol in major production and the first Colt pistol to be originally chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. The first year's production included 45 ACP and 38 Super chamberings.
In 1970, Colt introduced the all-steel ""Colt Combat Commander"", with an optional model in satin nickel. To differentiate between the two models, the aluminum-framed model was renamed the ""Lightweight Commander"".

I bought a new Marlin 917 that was cut down (it is 16.5"" now) and re-crowned (professionally) and I didn't like the color scheme or stock so I continued to work on it. As the rifle currently sits:


- Marlin 917 action .17HMR $250

- Boyd's tacticool stock $100

- Tasco 6x24x42 varmint scope $80

- KRG bolt lift knob $30

- Harris adjustable notched and tilt bipod $100

- Glass bedding, free floating barrel and duracoat $200

TOTAL = $800



I then took the action to a gunsmith (A&J) and had him bead blast the action, glass bed it in the stock and duracoat the entire thing in matte black. I shot it once with less than 50 rounds and got it sighted in. It shoots far more accurately than I can. I discovered its just not my thing and I am a city dweller so no opportunity to hunt with it. Hence the sale.

I have about 200 rounds of ammo I will include with it. Comes with the factory 7 and 4 round mags. I have the original box and lock etc. You can even have the old plastic stock.

Savage 111 in .25-06. Sport taper barrel, laminate stock, accutrigger, Pine Ridge 6-18X40 optics with flip up covers. Internal magazine. No scratches, rust, or visible wear, has 100 rounds through. Also included are a set of RCBS reloading dies, a few hundred 100 grn bullets, 3 boxes Core Lokt 100 and 120 grn factory ammo, and some 100 grn handloads I worked up. Will cover a dime at 100 yards with factory ammo, this rifle is a shooter. Have shot several deer with this rifle, not one made it more than 10 steps. I have shot it on the 600 yard line, and it will hold 5"" groups at that distance the way it sits, with factory ammo. 

I paid $575 for the bare rifle, this is NOT an Axis, or one of the ""cheaper"" Savage models. Basically a long action Model 11 with the accustock. Add optics, rings, bases, ammo, and other extras, I have nearly $1000 into this setup. This rifle will not disappoint. Absolutely perfect deer rifle for the upcoming season."

And what makes this pistol so unique is that it was previously owned by Brigadier General S.W. Fitzgerald of the US Army Air Corps,This pistol has been fully restored by Turnbull Manufacturing Company. It is currently in (like new) condition, unfired since the day that it left the Turnbull gun shop, with no marks and no scratches, it's about as beautiful as they come! This pistol also comes with a (collector's guide) 1911 book showing the previous ownership by Lieutenant S.W. Fitzgerald. It also comes with one 7 round magazine (keyhole style).

 I bought this rifle and decided to go with a bolt action instead.

This is one of the best all-around hunting rifles made, perfect for any Florida hunting trip!

 I am really looking to trade for a nice 1911 rather than selling it, but if you want to buy it the price needs to be $700.00. This is less than what I paid for the rifle and ammo so I don't have much wiggle room on the price, please don't try to low ball me this is already a great deal and I am in no hurry to get rid of this rifle.

636,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2216636,"For Sale:  Collectible, Hard to Find Ammo - Part 1","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 1, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey everyone. I've just about finished selling my life long collection of military small arms from around the world so now I've opened up my ammo & accessories safe and I'll be selling it's contents as I have time. 

All of this ammo has been stored in my air conditioned home inside a dehumidified safe.  

A few things to keep in mind: First most of this ammo was originally designed for either military or LE use, and a lot of it is either steel jacketed, steel core or both. So any ammo I describe as magnetic means that it will potentially penetrate targets much deeper than standard commercial ammo. Therefore please be extra cautious with your backstop if you decide to shoot any of it. I feel quite sure that it all will fire so be careful. Second any of the tracer ammo can and will start fires. So again please use with all due caution. Here is the ammo in this lot: 

(2) 40 round boxes Czech military 7.62x25 - brass case, corrosive & magnetic (in this case steel core). Ammo is loaded on eight round chargers. All 7.62x25 penetrates well but this ammo takes that to a whole new level with it's steel core. Extreme caution necessary. $40 for the 80 rounds. 

(1) 50 round box 9mm Kurz - another name for .380 ACP. Ammo made by Lapua in 1942. It's brass case, corrosive and in incredibly good shape for it's age. $25 

(2) 50 round sealed boxes of 9mm Steyr caliber by Hirtenberger. Brass case, non corrosive & magnetic. Asking $120 for both boxes - super rare ammo. 1 sold 1 available 

(2) 25 round boxes GECO 7.65mm or .32 ACP here. Ammo is brass case, non corrosive and very magnetic so it penetrates like crazy. $30 for both boxes. Sold

(2) 25 round boxes S&B 6.35mm or .25 ACP here. Brass case, non corrosive and magnetic. So again it will penetrate much more than any current commercial ammo. $25 for both boxes. 

(1) partial box of the old Winchester yellow & red box .38 Special 158 grain lead bullet. 10 rounds remaining. Box is in fair shape and ammo is excellent. $10 

(4) 25 round boxes Santa Barbara (Spain) 9mm Largo. Brass case, brass plated bullet & non corrosive. Hard to find ammo that is perfect for your Astra & Star pistols, Destroyer carbines and many more. $70 for all 4 boxes. 

(2) 50 round boxes of Hirtenberger 9mm LE ammo. Ammo has a 100 grain copper jacketed, truncated cone, soft point bullet. Ammo is non corrosive and it's loaded to very high velocities for 9mm Luger ammo. Head stamp is +P+. It's safe to use in well constructed modern pistols by GLOCK, Colt, Ruger, S&W, SIG, etc. However it should never be used in older or poor quality pistols as doing so could be very unsafe. This was imported in very limited quantities and is tough to find today. It's certainly not practice ammo, but rather what you'd want to use when your life could depend on it. $100 for both boxes. 1 sold 1 available

I have additional quantities of some of the ammo listed above but not all. So just ask if you are looking for more than is listed. 

Thanks for looking."

656,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2216656,"For Sale:  Rare, Collectible, Hard to Find Ammo - Part 2","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, October 13, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey everyone. I've just about finished selling my life long collection of military small arms from around the world so now I've opened up my ammo & accessories safe and I'll be selling it's contents as I have time.  

All of this ammo has been stored in my air conditioned home inside a dehumidified safe.   

A few things to keep in mind: First most of this ammo was originally designed for either military or LE use, and a lot of it is either steel jacketed, steel core or both. So any ammo I describe as magnetic means that it will potentially penetrate targets much deeper than standard commercial ammo. Therfore please be extra cautious with your backstop if you decide to shoot any of it. I feel quite sure that it all will fire so be careful. Second any of the tracer ammo can and will start fires. So again please use with all due caution. Here is the ammo in this lot:  

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser. Brass case, non corrosive & magnetic. Very clean military surplus ammo. $35 for both boxes. 

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser with wooden bullet. This ammo is intended as a blank round but requires a special adapter to shred the bullet at the muzzle. Without this adapter the wooden bullet is dangerous and could be fatal at close range so use caution when firing. $15 for both boxes. 

(5) 10 round boxes of Nazi 8x56R for use in Steyr Straight Pull rifles & carbines. This ammo is brass case, corrosive and magnetic. It's unbelievably clean for being made in 1938. This ammo is truly collectible and the box plus every round is stamped with the Nazi War Eagle. Each box has 10 rounds loaded on 2 stripper clips. These clips & empty boxes sell on Ebay for as much or more than I'm asking for the real live ammo. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. 

(1) 50 rounds Kynoch 7mm Mauser loaded on 5 round chargers. Ammo is brass case, corrosive & very magnetic. This box is unopened so I did not want to disturb it. However I have a partial box of the same ammo and it's unbelievably clean... looks like it was just made, but it was actually produced in January 1938, and it's noted right on the box. Vintage Kynoch is among the most collectible ammo available. Asking $100 for the box. 

(1) 100 round bulk box of 7mm Mauser made by FN Belgium in 1936. Ammo was made for lVenezuela, and it's brass case, corrosive and very magnetic.This ammo is also in unbelievable condition for it's age. Cases are bright and there are no signs or corrosion or deterioration at all. Very collectible and perfect to display with your South American Mauser(s).  $75 for the box. 

I do have additional quantities of some, but not all of the ammo listed above. So just ask if you are looking for more. 

Thanks for looking."

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

M6A2 description: 
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

This VZ-52 is a 1955, chambered in the VERY unique 7.62x45mm round.
The bore is EXCELLENT, a lot of these rifles have ""sewer pipe"" barrels from the corrosive ammo.. how ever this barrel is bright,with strong lands and grooves, no pitting or frosting. 
Functions and fires wonderfully (A lot of the FTF issues with these rifles are from the ammo, NOT the rifle.. Hard primers and time )
there have been a few times I have had to eject, then reload a round to get the primers to pop.
This rifle is Numbers matching minus the Stock..
Over all excellent rifle, I have a few more of these rifles and they are a joy to shoot
and a Unique part of history.

Any questions feel free to ask and I will answer best i can,

I only used it at two sporting clays events and soon realized that, with my frame and stature, I should be using a smaller, lighter gun. I stumbled upon a lightly used Benelli 20 gauge and it suits me much better.

Now you can be the big winner by stumbling upon this lightly used prize!

This Beretta Urika 2 Silver has a 28 in. barrel and sports a black synthetic stock. It is an especially nice example featuring a unique nickel-silver receiver that you will not find on most AL391s. This one is a special-edition that was made exclusively for Dick's Sporting Goods in 2012. The improved gas system of the Urika 2 reduces felt recoil and even helps clean the gun. Beretta makes fine firearms and this shotgun is first class. 

My offering comes with everything like it was new in the box. You get a hard case, chokes, oil, tools, manuals, and the spacers for the butt of the stock to adjust LOP.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

1 – Sig Sauer P226 Elite Dark .40 - $875
The new P226® Elite Dark is the newest edition to the P226 Elite and features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Adjustable Combat Night Sights, custom aluminum grips (may differ from image shown) and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting.

This is a great personal protection handgun. It is in very good overall condition. Mechanically it is in excellent condition. Cosmetically it has a few blemishes from handling and some holster wear. Because the photos are high resolution, some of the blemishes you see in the photos can barely be seen with the naked eye. It includes the original factory hard case and (3) mags. Please email me with any questions.

But with that being said its still a great rifle I just been shooting a 10/22 for over 20 years so it just feels more familiar to me. Maybe a brick of ammo down the pipe (550) no gun problems all ammo related (its a .22 so I expected that) id like to keep it around but really don't need anymore .22's so id like to trade for a nice 10/22
