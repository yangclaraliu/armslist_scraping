7 packets - $23.00 for all

background information:

The M291 Kit has been extensively tested and proven highly effective for skin decontamination. Each packet contains a non-woven fiber-fill laminated pad impregnated with the decontamination compounds. Each pad provides the individual with a single step, non-toxic/non-irritating decontamination application, which can be used on the skin, including the face and around wounds. Instructions for use are marked on the case and packets. The individual decontamination pads are impregnated with the decontamination compound ""Ambergard XE-555 Resin"", which is the black, free-flowing, resin based powder. As the pad is scrubbed over the contaminated skin the chemicals are rapidly transferred into and trapped in the interior of the resin particles. The presence of acidic and basic groups in the resin promotes the destruction of trapped chemical agents by acid and base hydrolysis. Because the resin is black it maps out the areas that have been decontaminated.

This rifle was never fired. I got this setup for my future father in law so he could feel the full size AR to see if that was what he wanted. He's fixing his other AR now which is costly (Alfa Romeo).

The handguard does not sit flush against itself. Not an issue, but a pet peeve of mine and PSA wanted me to send the whole upper back to swap. If you want a new in box MOE handguard for it, I can include it for an extra $25.

BCMGUNFIGHTER Charging Handle (5.56mm/.223) w/ (MEDIUM) Latch

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.
1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.
2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation."

To all the armchair federal agents out there. Please do your research before emailing me B.S. about this being an illegal SBR. This is a 100% straight from the factory and fully BATFE approved pistol. It comes with the compliance letter for the fore arm brace. Yes, you can legally CCW this and carry it around or just have it loaded in your car as a ""get home gun"". Go rant and rave on facebook all you want but don't email me about the legalities of something you have no clue about. I don't drive behind you at work and tell you how to collect trash properly."

I liked this gun because it has a lot of power (relative to other small calibers) with all the perks of a full size gun. When you hold it, it feels like a Real Gun. Not a toy polymer- not starting a debate over what is better, I am just stating the great things about this gun. It handles recoil like a champ with the OEM clip and the Beaver Tail to lean on top of your hand/forearm whatever you call it.
Bought this gun a year ago for home defense and went to the range a few times. Perfect for CHL holders. Small and solid bodied stainless steel body makes it nice for absorbing recoil. Comes with the original clip that has the plastic finger grip for extra control, and one extra clip without the grip. I have put 200 rounds through it roughly.Never jams, always on point. Personally, it was my dream gun, but no job kinda trumps dream gun. It comes with a KnJ holster made to hold the gun inside the waistband (not out like a 6 shooter it is a unique design.) You will be locked and loaded as I will include 2 boxes (40 rounds) of federal premium low recoil hollow points. It also comes with 2 boxes of practice rounds.I kept the gun in the case when not in use and didn't even use the holster to carry it around-just when shooting. Neeeever used steel rounds- always brass.Never dropped in sand or dirt. You will be happy with this gun.
 Will only meet during day time hours, heavily populated area, refuse to speak with anyone not eligible or supposed to buy a gun. If you are normal, you have nothing to worry about."

If you flag these jackass, they are just going to keep working harder and harder to put up ads and a in the end, the people reading the ad, they have the power. Then they are going to start flagging over priced guns, which lets face it 80-90% of guns for sale on this site are listed for more than what you can buy them for new, so when you flag overpriced ammo! your being a hypocrite if you don't flag the overpriced AR-15s the KImbers, the Sig Sauer etc. 

All they have to do is keep calm, and not hoard. Understand if they don't feed the scalpers, the supply will come back. There is no shortage. There is plenty out there. They are not all unemployed people selling the ammo or hoarding it.

Again all new in the box and have original parts also. Have $750 into the gun

Looking to trade into a decent AK, like a maddi, nice romanian,hungarian, mak 90 or??

Not to picky on type , besides not looking for garbage, something in good shape, non canted sights, prefer wood stock no tacticool junk... Would prefer some mags and ammo with the deal, but that can be negotiated.

possibly a sks, but would have to be a very nice shape one or one with at least good metal, receiver and good bore.

All deals would have to be of equal trade, could do cash, ammo or? to make up trade

No pic at the moment, but it looks like every other m&P 45 , just has upgraded apex dcaek kit installed to help the trigger pull, per and over travel. Much better then stock.

This would be a great stock for field or casual use, even tougher than the original because the expert refinishing it put in brass pins as reinforcement of areas - notably in the selector cutout area - where cracks were known to be likely. These pins are hardly visible when the stock is on the rifle. Ask any stock refinisher: Brass pins make the stock stronger than it was, before!"

Hey guys, I have a Mid-80's pre-ban Colt Sporter II for sale. I have nearly everything it came with except the box and a few small things like price tag and plastic rod that was in the barrel. With that said, this rifle is 95-98%... Looks great. All original with bayonet lug up front etc... The front and rear sight were swapped out at some point but, I have the originals (pictured in the clear case). It also has the original first birdcage flash hider (orange cover as well). Colt booklet is also included! From the looks of it, I think (I am not an expert on these things) I would say that $1450.00 (firm)

2. Is a 1926 hex receiver mosin that has been sporterized to a shorter barrel length and re-crowned with a after market front sight.

This is #53/100 of the original Colt Pony Automatic. Only 100 of these were made. These pistols were manufactured by Colt in a factory based in Washington D.C. (Washington D.C. Firearms International). This pistol is a .380 and it shoots great. These pistols are extremely rare and highly sought after by Colt collectors that know a little Colt History. There isn't a lot of information known about these pistols and their manufacture because the D.C. factory they were produced in, was destroyed in the 1968 D.C. riots.

I have contacted Colt and I have received some interesting news about these pistols. These pistols were made for Colt because Colt was considering have their .380 handguns manufactured by another company, this did not end up happening. However, 100 of these pistols were made for Colt in the 60's and 11 of them were retained by Colt Firearms, the other 89 were given back to the D.C. company.

You know you have one of these rare pistols when the serial number on it begins with CPA (Colt Pony Automatic).
