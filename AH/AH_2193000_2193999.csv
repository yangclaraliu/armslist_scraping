THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

On butt of gun has inscription of H.P.D. no 901  This is a used condition revolver....it still shoots great.

Still fully functional self defense weapon for male or female.  I've shot it and cleaned it after wards, then it just got put up for 10 years, so I figured I'd see if anyone else would have more use for it.

I do not have a box for it or any papers as I inherited it.

Just a leather holster that came with it. It has wear on the grips, the left is better than the right one and holster wear.

The bluing is discolored. Best to look at pics and see gun first hand. Overall its in good shape for a gun from 1944. That's based on the serial number I looked up on Colts website and an independent website.



I've been watching them on gunbroker the past few months and they are listed anywhere from $425 for much worse condition up to $800 in better condition. 



So I figured I'd split it down the middle and ask $575 obo cash or open to trade offers for something I can use for home defense or fun with the kids. 



Throw me any gun offers............I'm wide open.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Benchmade raises the bar on Bali once more! A patented liner-spring latch opens with a squeeze, yet locks open, too. Solid, machined slab construction is built on jeweled titanium liners. Heat treated kicker pins keep things rockin' hard and fast, and a practical blade shape is detailed out with a crowned blade spine.

Not sure what this means but thought I would let you know. I have only shot .223 in this gun just in case. The gun is in excellent condition and has been stored for much of its life in a safe. Four twenty round magazines are also included. Three of the magazines have Armalite AR-18 stamped on the bottom and the fourth is blank. The AR-18 is the full auto version of the AR-180 semi-auto and the magazines for both are the same. Pictures show both sides of the rifle and magazines. Magazines show some wear from use.

I transitioned to a Sig Mosquito for my training .22LR pistol, so my Walther is now surplus to my needs and has sat in the back of my safe for over a year now.

My P22 is in VG condition. (Excellent mechanical, Good Exterior finish) and has had less than 500 rounds through it. Function, like all .22 pistols is dependent on ammo selection. For me, CCI minimag and Federal Bulk pack has been perfect. Remington White box (USGI Ammo from CMP so-so), and Remington Thunderbolt is crap.

Included with the P22 pistol is 4 x original Walther 10-rd magazines (two with flush base plates and two with finger extension base plates) and a Fobus Paddle Holster.

$395.00 FTF in the Fridley or Burnsville Area.

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

The bolt cocks, the trigger and extractor function also. I just don't have the time or interest to replace the firing pin or anything else, perhaps you do in which case you could have a good plinker on your hands. Or maybe you already have one and could use this one for parts or vice versa. Whatever floats your boat. 

Read several possibilities of what it could be comparable to since it was more than likely made by major gun company and sold in department stores (Sears Roebuck). Maybe a Marlin model 65 or a Sevens model 66A .... dunno??

We are selling BRAND NEW in the box HENRY model #H001 15rd 22 long rifle standard loop lever action carbine with a blue finish and walnut stock for the great low low price of only $289.99 + tax CASH price (add 3% for credit or debit card)

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

Must be 18 years or older with a valid AZ Drivers License and be able to fill out 4473 form.

Rockford Fosgate Power HX2 RFR3112
Original price $399.95 each + shipping 
Our take on the Rockford Fosgate Power HX2 RFR3112 Rockford Fosgate
Here's the Incredible Hulk of subwoofers, but it's your friends who will turn green (with envy) once they hear it! The RFR3112 is 12"" of pure sonic terror, with a roar that'll run up to 2,000 watts of peak power. The massive magnet structure (18-3/4 pounds) is the largest ever on a Rockford Fosgate sub, and a major reason why you'll want to stay on this beast's good side.
The FIBERlock treated paper cone is reinforced with a special ""high solids"" coating for incredible durability. It's strong enough to support the weight of a grown man, yet still delivers superior sound quality. The 2-ohm dual voice coil structure maximizes amplifier performance and provides hook-up versatility. Massive 4-inch, 4-layer voice coils contribute to exceptional power handling capability. The Santoprene™ rubber surround is as tough as the Hulk himself, repelling road and climate conditions that cause deterioration.
Note: If you are wiring this DVC sub for lower impedance, make sure that your amp is compatible. Most car amplifiers are stable down to 2 ohms in standard mode, or 4 ohms in bridged operation.
Details:
FIBERlock treated paper cone with Santoprene™ rubber surround
frequency response 26-400 Hz
power range 150-1,000 watts RMS (500 watts per coil)

Rockford Fosgate Power bd1500.1
Original price $999.95 + shipping
Our take on the Rockford Fosgate Power bd1500.1
If you've been searching for the big boss man of bass, say hello to the Big Dog — Rockford Fosgate's Power bd1500.1. Thanks to Class bd technology (Rockford Fosgate's patented amp design), this mono machine boasts an amazing 75% efficiency rating with a highly stable output. Even when cranked to the max, it will maintain steady power flow and a cool temperature, saving your music from clipping and distortion.
Class bd efficiency also allows Rockford Fosgate to design this amp with a smaller footprint, giving you more installation options than high-power amps usually afford. Hooked up to a 2-ohm load, the Power bd1500.1 will rock your world with an awesome 2500 watts — that's one Big Dog with a bark to match!
Important Note: Because of this amp's 150-amp fuse rating, 4-gauge wiring kits cannot be used alone to install the amp.
