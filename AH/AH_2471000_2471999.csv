You cannot legally install this on a rifle lower without it being registered as an SBR.  However you have the option of pinning and welding an extended length flash hider to it for an additional $60.00.  It won't be a pretty weld, as I'm not that good at pretty. :) If you have a pistol lower, you can use this as is, but cannot run it with the vertical foregrip.  All NFA rules apply.  I can answer any questions you may have in regards to the legality of this upper.

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps
Item 4B is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is NOT suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

I have up for trade or sale a milled Arsenal SA 93 Ak-47 with a chrome lined barrel. This is a rare Ak, and one of the best ever made. It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desireable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver.

This was a virgin lower transferred to me via my FFL Dealer as ""other"" on ATF form 4473. This is the only legit method of building a true pistol AR (do your own research, there is plenty of info online about this...). This lower is not marked/engraved as pistol but that engraving doesn't actually mean anything if not transferred correctly as ""other"" on ATF Form 4473. Please don't ask further questions about this, IT has been explained here and online ad nauseam. Thanks!

Gun runs flawlessly and will cycle any ammo you put in it. Very reliable and good shooter. This gun is legally a pistol and you cannot put a rifle carbine buffer tube and stock or forward pistol grip on it without filing NFA paperwork with the ATF first.

U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4

 MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

 Elevation adjustable to 600 meters.
 Windage: 1/2 MOA 
 Elevation: 0-600m
 NSN 1005-01-484-8000 , PN# 12996812

 Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any .223 5.56 rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

Repeat... this is NOT an EX-SNIPER RIFLE, and NO WELDED HOLES IN RECEIVER. The bolt is arsenal installed and (stamped) numbered to match the rifle.  Bit that doesn't mean it won't shoot straighter than an arrow.,

Real Soviet Sniper bolts run between $79 & $99, so this price is a great deal. Each rifle has stamped matching bolt and action serial numbers... bolt is not electro penciled. These both  have force matched butt plate & magazine serials. Re-arsenaled by Soviets. Rifle comes with a bayonet, sling and ammo pouch.

Some have asked if I'd sell the bolt, or trade for the common straight bolt... sorry no bolt trading as this bolt is head spaced with this rifle, and makes it worth much more being matching serial numbers with the receiver.
