Upper receiver is forged 7075 aluminum, hard coat anodized to mil-spec, coating of dry film lube inside, mil-spec delta ring, mil-spec stainless steel gas tube, all mil-spec components (shell deflector, dust cover, forward assist). 
Bolt carrier group is Failzero FA EXO coated. Shot peened, stress relieved, heat treated, high pressure tested/magnetic particle inspected. Comes complete and ready to drop in. Standard charging handle. Everything you need.
Only serious buyers please. This upper assembly is in perfect condition. Still basically brand new with only 150-200 rounds fired on it by me. Purchased by myself brand new and was strictly maintained (cleaned, lubricated, properly stored) Money is more important right now for me then toys. I have sold many items before and know one has ever had a problem with me. I am a combat veteran, very honest, and guarantee no problems on my end. Prefer face to face, however will ship. Paypal or western union for long distance transactions. Prefer fellow Pennsylvania residents but will deal with out of state buyers if this is legal for use in his/her state including the 30 round magazines and also because this is not a rifle but simply an upper and can be shipped directly to you if long distance is the case. If you are interested, feel free to ask me any questions. If you want to buy and say you are going to, please follow through with it. Each time someone says they are going to buy and do not, I have to hold up other people who want to purchase because I am waiting on that person. If worried about buying from someone you do not know remember, Paypal and western union are insured, I will also draft an invoice if Paypal is used stating what you bought and for how much just for added comfort on your end.This upper assembly is an amazing deal especially with the extras and the enhanced bolt carrier group as well as it being full mil-spec and identical in specs to a Colt 6920 but with a better barrel(hammer forged, thicker chrome lining vs Button rifled).

IWI TAVOR SAR 16.5"" Black right handed model. Chambered in 5.56 NATO/.223 REM. Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR¬Æ is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations‚Ä¶or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR¬Æ is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines ‚Äì but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

These rifles are known for their rugged reliability. The chamber is chrome plated and dimensioned for civilian and military ammo. The weapon system is proven. The trigger is appropriate for a battle rifle. It's interesting that this big honker fits in a regular sized carry case. You pull two pins and it disassembles into the upper and lower unit. If you have a scope mounted, it remains mounted on the upper receiver and the zero is maintained. It's thought out and designed for battlefield engagement of material targets to great distances. Perfect for third world soccer games! The assembled rifle is 57"" OAL and weighs nearly 31 pounds.  I've done my best. I will be glad to sell anywhere it's legal. Many of us shooters have dreamed of owning the Barrett 82A1. It's something like an ultimate icon. It isn't likely necessary for many of us in our day to day lives. Sometimes we wonder if it might not be useful in the days ahead. But we're absolutely sure that it would be too cool there on the coffee table and out at the range. It definitely comes with braggin' rights. thanks!"

 The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assemblies. 

 The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

 The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

 All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

Well here's your chance to get it back!!

This is my 1967 Remington 788 chambered in 22-250. The 788 is known for its accuracy and durability. 

I was told that i am the 3rd owner. The second owner said he put less than 2 boxes through this thing. The bore is extremely clean!

When i got the rifle it had a few spots of rust and the stock was a little beat up. So after a lot of effort, time, and money I took care of just about all rust. I refinished the stock in a nice glossy Tru Oil with a beautiful Walnut stain. I cleaned and reblued most marks, dings, or wear spots. and i gave the bolt a good reblueing too.

This Rifle truely is a part of reminton history as well as THE most accurate varmint rifle i have owned.

Sitting on top of this fine piece is a late 70's Tasco 6-18x40 Scope in almost new condition. Along with from what i can tell the Original Weaver Scope rings.

one of the beste features of this rifle is its ability to remove the scope and go with iron sights. Unfortunately now adays most 788s dont have the iron sights and have been sporterized. Lucky for you though the sights on this rifle are still attached and in great repair!!

 Detailed product specs:

 Up for sale is (1) brand new factory sealed VLTOR MUR-1A (Modular Upper Receiver) w/Forward Assist and Shell Deflector. This item is fully assembled with forward assist, ejection port dust cover, M4 feed ramps and weighs less than 10 ounces.

 The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assemblies. 

 The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

 The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

 All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

The mask is in good shape, with some wear marks from being worn and the lenses have some scuffs in them (I would eventually replace them, luckily they are cheap and easy to replace with your choice of tinted or clear lenses, lots of vendors for them online). The filter is a couple years old so it should be good for at least another 8-10 years (they recommend changing the filters out every 10 years). This is a top quality gas mask and not super easy to find, especially one that is not a small or medium size, and there are tons of parts and accessories available for them as this is current issue stuff, not some 1960s russian gas mask that the seals or filters are questionable and the visibility is poor when wearing it. The price is $75 for the mask and bag, this is a great deal as this mask easily brings 100-150 bucks online and while I might sell it online if I dont get replies, I want to sell it locally.

This fine rifle has an 18‚Äù blued barrel and comes in the plastic box with 1 30 round magazine. The integral picatinny rail on top makes it easy to mount a red dot or scope. There is an added quad rail on the foreend and I think I have the original Galcier Guard. I do not have extra magazines or other accessories. 6 position stock.

I am asking 625.00 in cash. I am willing to entertain trade offers but won‚Äôt hold this. I have had too many ‚ÄúI get paid in a couple of days‚Äù offers that never called back or changed their minds and I lost a sale to someone else. I am pretty firm on price but can trade better. I am only selling  this to fund another project and have had no feeding, ejecting or extraction problems.

If you don‚Äôt like my price, buy it somewhere else or make me a reasonable offer. This can be viewed/purchased in Wellington and I will not deliver it or ship it.

My wish list:
I am also possibly interested in a bolt action 30-06. No Mausers or rebarreled models please. Remington is my favorite but a Winchester, Ruger or Savage is not out of the question. I like Weatherby Vanguards also.
A .257 Weatherby. I prefer stainless but blued will work.
A nice stainless 6‚Äù .357.
A nice stainless .44 mag.
A .243 complete upper for a DPMS
Quality optics but am not interested in Leupolds.
I trade fair but will not pay new plus price for your item. Even if it shoots dime sized groups at 1000 yards, it is only worth the value of what any other one is."

Colt‚Äôs Government full size frame 1911 in 45ACP. This one is model 01070 AI CS, Series 70 and is 100% NIB. In a brushed STS finish complete with 2 mags and all the case candy you would expect, hard to go wrong with a weapon such as this one. Of note is this is a Custom Shop gun, I‚Äôm unsure of the length of production on these however I do not believe they are still manufactured

The serial number dates this very nice Colt Diamondback to 1977. It has a 4"" barrel, 6 round cylinder, wide target hammer, adjustable rear sight, and is chambered in .38 Special. The original factory blue finish is in excellent condition with a faint cylinder turn line, some thinning at the muzzle, and some of the usual small handling marks. The correct and original Colt factory walnut target stocks with nickel silver Colt medallions are in excellent condition as well. The photos accurately show the condition of the revolver.

Only 100 rounds shot. So far, it cycles everything. Even cycled most of my Winchester Low Recoil (980 fps) stuff that I used to shoot out of a pump...it failed to eject a couple, but cycled most of them. It cycles light birdshot 1oz 1280 fps shells without a problem.  

Really nice shotgun.

Lengthened forcing cones also prevent each pellet from becoming flattened or deformed. A deformed pellet will not fly straight and serious target shooters cannot afford any stray pellets.Back-boring a barrel increases bore diameter to its maximum specification, reducing friction between the shot cup and the barrel to propel the shot pellets to a higher velocity/ Back-boring also helps to reduce the recoil into your shoulder. Removable choke tubes are critical to any serious shooter. They can be flush or extended. Extended tubes allow the shot to focus, spread and center, prior to leaving the muzzle. Highly visible, light-gathering sights and beads along wide, flat ribs contribute to picking up the bird when split seconds count. Comes with hardcase."

Very lightly used AR-15 for sale. Approximately 3-4 boxes of ammo through it. The title pretty much sums it up and it has a 5.56 chamber so you can shoot both 5.56 and .223. It's a flat top with a quad rail and no iron sights on it currently as it was set up with a scope previously. I just moved to a 20"" match barreled rifle for distance shooting and can't justify keeping both rifles (at least to my wife anyways...).

I won't be able to meet with anyone until possibly Friday night but for sure Saturday. I will respond to requests on a first come first served basis and have no problem working something out for those who are seriously interested. 

$825 for rifle alone; however, I will sell it with the 30 rd mag and stock riser that it is pictured with for $850.  Heck, I'll even throw in a pack of 20 rds for you too.  I'm open to offers but please keep it realistic.  I'm just trying to recoup some of what I paid 6 months ago for this thing."

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2336989,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Friday, November 15, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222


Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines‚Äîthis is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms‚Äîtruly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950‚Äôs
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980‚Äôs
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940‚Äôs
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980‚Äôs
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition‚Äîno exceptions, no need to ‚Äúdouble check‚Äù with us."

IWI US TAVOR¬Æ SAR OVERVIEW
The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) R&D developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF; and the TAVOR¬Æ was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the ‚Äúfather of the TAVOR¬Æ,‚Äù spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities ‚Äì seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990‚Äôs through the early 2000‚Äôs, the TAVOR¬Æ underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR¬Æ began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR¬Æ then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR¬Æ was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR¬Æ rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR¬Æ rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.

IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR¬Æ SAR rifle.
