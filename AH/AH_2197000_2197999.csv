For people unfimiliar with Talo they customize guns for special purposes. This one in particular is there CCG (Concealed Carry Government). It is setup for carry/ self defense and is the best Colt offered for this purpose. It comes with the National Match barrel and bushing. It also comes with rosewood slim grips. These grips are beautiful and feel great. This Colt also came with a Novak-cut front and rear Trijicon HD night sight set that are not even a year old and carry a 12 year warranty. I have also had the Colt sent to Colt's custom shop for a trigger job (4.5 lbs), slide to frame fitting, barrel fitting, grip safety fitting. All of these were hand fitted for accuracy and then checked (see pic below which was shot by the custom shop). I have the paperwork for custom work and will include it and the target. The pistol comes with box, manual, and 2 factory Colt 8 round mags. This pistol is a tack driver but also 110% reliable. It was specifically made for carry. The absolute only reason I am selling this is to help fund a Wilson Combat (wife reasons). There has been exactly 850 rounds through it. Easiest and best way to reach me is by phone/ text as I rarely check email. Call or text (614) 440-one3one0. Serious offers/ inquiries only. I will not give this gun away as I am not desperate to sell it but not wanting an unfair price either. The only thing I would be interested in trading for would be a custom 1911(Springfield Pro, Baer, Wilson, Nighthawk, etc) and would add cash if needed. Thanks for looking."

If your not familiar with these guns, they are wildly known to be the smoothest shooting 1911's out of the box. I have owned and fired a ton of 1911's, and aside from some big buck custom shop builds, it is by far and large very true. This is a new pistol with just the test fire rounds through it. Also unlike some older or other make 1911's, Sig builds this in SA/DA. This is a sought after option not found on most 1911 pistols.
It was owned by a retired law enforcement officer prior to me. It has always stored in the Pelican case it was purchased in. The knife has only been out of the case once. This is the lighter colored model, not the black. Comes with all paperwork.

If your interested, I also have a few extra mags from a different 45 he traded me also, but I sold that to a friend. Also have some ammo, and a BNIB paddle holster. 

Feel free to make an offer, including trades or partial trades.

It has window shade covers all the way around. It has straight dual exhaust (has good/deep sound but not too loud) with nice stainless tips. It has factory cargo rails on the roof. It has Leather interior (driver's seat has a tear in it). Electric everything. Cold A/C and hot heat. The truck is used by me to travel dirt roads and on the hunting land, but has not been ""mudding"" or anything and is mechanically perfect. It has some cosmetic problems like the electric mirrors no longer work and the trunk has a dent from where a trailer has came undone and popped it. But it is a good truck with many new parts. New transmission was installed, A/C compressor, and others where installed right before I purchased it, and it has recently had a new alternator installed. Cranks perfectly, shifts smoothly, runs great (tuns of power). It has a nice rubber trunk mat to protect carpet, a 10 inch sub-woofer and amp installed (stereo sounds good and full, but not made to be ridiculous loud or annoying to other drivers, and mildly tinted windows. I also have the factory privacy cover for the trunk. It obviously has a tow package and the hitch will go with it. It has 15*,*** miles on it but runs like new. The Chevy truck I owned before this one with the same year and engine was retired with over 275,000 miles on it. These engines last forever. It will be a dependable, good truck for many years and miles to come. This truck is not in perfect cosmetic condition. The paint is wearing out, the leather is not perfect, it has a few dents. But I am not pricing it as perfect condition and it is in perfect working order and is comfortable to drive. It has expensive accessories to make it better suited for off-road use. The truck was not abused and it still has a lot of life left. I am just looking to buy the wife a new SUV and this truck is more of a toy than a necessity, but is perfect for what it is.

This is a gun that I took in on trade from a collector buying some guns from me.
Pure menacing Miami vice, Sons of Anarchy, style!
I have no particular interest in this style of gun, although its a cool looking gun on its own.
I don't expect it to last at this low price, someone will want this gun in the collection.
It is in good overall condition with a smooth working action on it.
It is a gun showing mostly a good finish with minor wear on the finish of the moving parts.
You can set up something with me tonight if you wish, I will be in St Charles from 8 on.
Shoot me an email, I check it often. Cant talk at work, email is fine.

We wanted to extend an enormous thank you to the armslist.com members for all your help and support last month. Because of all of you, or pre-launch was nearly triple what we had anticipated and that was a direct result of this group here that took a chance, went out on a limb and picked up one of our hand built, AR-15 High End Uppers (HEU's). Every review we've had has been awesome and it is our sincere hope to continue to provide you all with our high level of service and exceptional quality. 

A little bit about our product:

Our High End Uppers, or HEU's feature the incredibly hard to come by, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, or SAW Barrel direct from FN Manufacturing itself. It's chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 1/7 twist rate and blanks that are Certified CMV. No detail is overlooked in the entire package, barrel included, which has been HPT and MPI inspected. They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions and a Phosphate finish on the outside to protect it from whatever you want to throw at it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M249_light_machine_gun

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset. We've found that when building for a specific person, it increases the attention to detail significantly and therefore, the finished product is far superior than that of any mass produced brand out there. The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within a week and typically ship within 24 hours of purchase.

So if you have a decent used AR 15 or AK that you're willing to sell for cash at a reasonable price, please shoot me an e-mail.  Let me know what you have, what you're asking for it, and which city you live in.  I live near Milwaukee but I'm willing to travel for the right deal."

The FNS is the result of years of research incorporating the most precise
engineering and product development to bring the most highly-advanced
striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and personal defense
market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a pivoting hinged
trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short travel to reset.
The matte black polymer frame comes with four interchangeable backstraps to
customize grip fit and is designed with a low-bore axis for reduced felt
recoil and enhanced control. The fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for
easy access without snagging on holsters or clothing.The FNS offers a
hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear
cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed sights. The FN FNS
also is equipped with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.

This is known as the ""Escort"", why it was called that I'll leave to you to decide. Basically this was a very revolutionary design and change up for Smith as they were experimenting with semi autos. This particular model was designed with concealed carry in mind. Initially thought of for women but many men became interested in it as a potential back up gun. The pistol was designed to compete with the Colt Junior, and the idea was that it would be cheaper to shoot (.22lr) and maintain similar ballistics. The original model 61 suffered some reliability problems but by the last variation, 61-3, they were able to eliminate those issues. What that translates to is that there were not a lot of Model 61's produced period. They were only made for 3 years basically, this one being a 1973. This is the blued version, the finish is very nice with a little thinning occurring on the edges of the gun. The pistol has bakelite or plastic grip panels. They are in very good shape as well. There appears to be 2 minor scuffs on the left panel. The right is very nice. The pistol comes with one original magazine. The mags hold 5 rounds for these guns. From what I have read if you are planning to shoot the gun, just use high velocity ammo (mini mags, stingers, etc) and it should be flawless. These guns with the box go for about $500-600 because many Smith and Wesson collectors are grabbing them up. This is a great opportunity to get this one for a reasonable price as they are just beginning to rise! I test fired the pistol using cci mini mags and cci blazer standard velocity. i shot 50 rounds of each through the pistol with zero failures. pistol ran through everything without a hiccup."
