The gun has exactly 50rounds through it and is in perfect condition.  I used it as a bedside gun so it never saw a holster or was carried.  The trigger on this pistol is considered one of the best stock triggers on a polymer pistol available.  The ergonomics on this pistol are also outstanding.  It comes with everything it came with from the factory.  Walther sends a target that was shot at the factory to prove accuracy before sending the pistol out.  The target is in the picture along with the unused warranty card.  It must be legal for you to own a firearm.............NO FELONS.  I am also not accepting trades.....cash only.

Flat top stripped upper is not stamped by manufacturer but it came off a Olympic upper. It has a very light crack where the anodized finish is missing in the pic. Second pic shows how small the crack is (ends at my thumb). It is in the very bottom and it does not affect the structure. The factory had put 60 pounds of torque on the barrel nut and it cracked when I was breaking it loose for a friend of mine. Also included is a free-float forearm that clamps on your factory barrel nut. A barrel nut for a threaded free-float forearm. Low profile gas block. 5/8 inch threaded flash suppressor for .308 diameter and 2 crush washers. Fore-arm tactical grip for picatinny rail. My friend gave me these parts for assembling his AR. I had kept them for a while thinking about building a .22lr upper. Since the 10/22 bug has bitten me I am letting them go. Shipping in the CONUS is included. Asking 85.00 OBO.

This rifle has performed flawlessly so far.  I don't shoot it very often since I usually go to indoor ranges, so I have decided to go ahead and sell it.  Comes with hard case, (1) 30rd Troy Battlemag, user manual, and everything that accompanies the rifle when bought new.  I never registered this rifle with Delton, so whoever buys it could register to take advantage of the lifetime warranty.

Parts that I have added or upgraded are Magpul CTR buttstock with thicker buttpad, Magpul MOE+ Grip, Magpul AFG2, Magpul Aluminum Enhanced Trigger Guard for wearing gloves, and XS CSAT rear aperture with tritium front sight post.  All original parts that were replaced will come along with it as well.  I have some PMAG 30's that I can add in if the buyer needs some for $10/each.

Haven't decided if I want to replace it with a gun that I'm likely to shoot more often or take some advanced firearm classes at this point, so not really interested in random trades at this point.  I do want a Sig P226 TacOps in 9mm, which is similar in pricing to this AR-15 and would be considered a reasonable trade if in good condition.  Thanks!

This gun is very tight, those of you familiar with 1911s will be impressed with the slide /frame/barrel fit. Feels like it was hand fit. All internal parts are very nicely finished and would be right at home in a gun costing twice as much. 
Should be an awesome shooter.
The exterior is done in ""wonder finish"". Looks like satin nickel plate to me. 
I bought this one and a compact 10 mm at the same time, and just haven't taken this one out to shoot, so I figure someone else can enjoy it rather than sitting in my safe.

50 rounds of Winchester .45 Auto brass FMJ, target range use, Perfect condition.
40 rounds of CCI, FMJ, 9mm target range use, perfect condition. 10 rounds taken out of box and sold with another gun I had.
50 rounds of Winchester .45 Auto brass FMJ, target range, good condition.
50 rounds of Winchester .45 Auto brass FMJ, target range, with some tarnish, but great for plunking and forgetting, not reloading. I've inspected each and every round to ascertain quality and safety. I have removed and placed into a baggy, any rounds which I feel would be questionable by a buyer. Essentially, I have adjusted the price down to $90 to take into account this box of 50.  You can look at it as a so called ""free box"" if you will.


Bottom Line:  I'm asking a price of ONLY $90 firm for the lot of 290 rounds, no tax.
190 rounds of the 290 are PERFECT.  50 of the remaining 100 are in good contion with only some slight tarnish of some of the brass only, bullets are perfect.  The last box of 50 the brass casings are non-re-loadable from a safety standpoint, but will fire absolutely perfectly, any questionable rounds I have placed into a baggy for your inspection. Again, consider this last box of 50 Winchester free (included in the 290 round $90 price).  All in all, it is a good deal I'm sure you'll agree.  I present this because I want to be transparent and up front, and honest in every way.  I am located in Grove City.  As of Tuesday I have several interested buyers.  If interested please stay in touch.  I will remove this ad when sold.  Thank you everyone!

540,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2552540,For Sale/Trade:  homemade flamethrower,"olympa, Washington, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 11, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Have a home made flamethrower, yes it is legal to own one. It runs off a 20oz co2 tank to pressurize the larger 20lb tank that holds about 3.5 gallons of gas or whatever flammable liquid you want. Gives you a run time of about minute, minute and a half or so if you just hold the trigger down but trust me it gets hot so short bursts is best. You can buy a scuba tank back pack harness if you want a mobile unit but then you would need a shorter hose from the tank to the trigger/gun part which I can help you with. The 20lb tank for back pack use is very heavy but doable, thats why this build is meant for stationary use with a 8ft hose from the tank to the trigger assembly. Not pictured but a propane tank is attached to the barrel of the trigger/gun for flame. as long as your propane torch is good, this one comes with obviously. Its a little under 20$ to have the co2 tank filled and the gas necessary to run it. Every fitting was done with aircraft grade thread sealant meant for gas/diesel lines. This is defiantly one hell of a unique toy to have. If you have anymore questions just ask.

This is a bolt action rifle that uses AR style mags. I have inserted both GI and Pmags and they work flawlessly.

This rifle is chambered for 5.56/.223 thus you can shoot surplus/NATO ammo safely.

Twist rate is 1/9. This rifle shines with both 45/50 gr. Hornady bullets as well as the 69gr Sierra match kings. These rounds produced sub .5 MOA groups. Nonetheless all other ammo fired produced MOA or under groupings.

This rifle is in impeccable shape-it was religiously cleaned as to not interfere with my development. It's light, fast to point, accurate, and robust with the park finish and laminate stock. The cheek riser is a much needed addition.

The barrel threads are 1/2-28 and are appropriate for direct mount supressors.

She is a Kimber Ultra CDP II with Custom Kimber Crimson Trace Lasergrips.  I'm also including 2 additional Wilson Combat magazines, a Tucker Gunleather ""The Answer"" holster that has only been used a handful of times and includes the leather lined kydex for a silent draw.  I am also including a Remora Holster for the Kimber and I will leave the Wilson Combat magazines full of Federal Hydrashock rounds.  

I purchased the little girl less than a year ago and then cleaned it when it arrived.  I shot exactly 34 rounds (yes, a strange number, but there was a reason for it), through it with no FTF, FTE, or any problem whatsoever.  I then meticulously cleaned the Kimber, oiled it, and then it has been in my safe since that time.  

I do not hesitate to call this sweet little thing ""in like new condition.""  Although I purchased it to wear concealed, because of my dress for my job, I am forced to pocket carry and so this little girl sat alone in the safe for the last several months.

Current MSRP for everything included is:

Kimber Ultra CDP II with Laser Grip = $1,631 
Tucker Gunleather ""The Answer Holster"" = $140 + shipping
Remora Holster = $25 + shipping
Wilson Combat Holsters with Base Pad = $33 each x 2 = $66
14 Federal Hydrashock rounds = $15 - 20

To purchase these items new, it would cost approximately $1,880. I will be willing to sell everything here for $1500 + $30 for shipping"

This cartridge is a Russian bottle-necked pistol cartridge widely used in former Soviet Union.The cartridge is in principle an enhanced Russian version of the 7.63×25mm Mauser. This cartridge has excellent penetration and can easily defeat lighter ballistic vests (class I, IIA and II) as well as some kevlar helmets, such as the American PASGT helmet. Cartridge cases can be produced by resizing and trimming 9mm Winchester Magnum brass, or alternately by reforming 5.56×45mm NATO. The pistol bullet has various muzzle velocities around the range of 1300 to 1800 fps depending on what you buy. Some newly manufactured ammunition intended for commercial use has a velocity of approximately 1,560 feet per second (480 m/s). Wolf Gold FMJ tops out at 1,720 feet per second (520 m/s) with 570 foot-pounds force (770 J) as does PPU ammunition. Some of this ammunition, such as the Wolf Gold and Sellier & Bellot, uses boxer primed, brass cases that are reloadable.

There is one 15 round mag and one 30 round mag. 

****SALE PENDING ON THIS MAGAZINE****The 30 round magazine is what is commonly referred to as a ""hardback"" with the stamping of ""SEY"" on the back of the magazine, indicates manufactured by Seymour Products for Inland.  The groves in the magazine run the length of the magazine, not interrupted like the newer and reproduction 30 round magazine.  There is surface rust on the magazine, but I believe that a little TLC/CLP and light steel wool would remove that.  $50 plus $6 USPS Priority Mail.

The 15 round magazine is also GI surplus.  It has surface rust, but like the 30 rounder I believe you could remedy this or just leave it for history's sake.  The mag is marked ""SY-B"" for IBM by Stanley Works.  Price is $35 plus $6 USPS Priority Mail shipping.

There is also one more 15 round magazine marked ""SI.""  The condition is a little more rusty than the other but I think it'll clean up with some TLC/CLP.  $25 plus $6 USPS Priority Mail shipping.

Will put both in one box if you buy both, and combine shipping ($6 total).

Cash, personal checks (must clear first before shipping) or money orders.  Sorry I cannot do credit cards and I refuse PayPal.
