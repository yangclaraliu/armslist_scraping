One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is also one of MANY Colt Pythons we currently have in stock. Made in 1981, and finished in Colt’s beautiful Royal Blue, and with a pair of factory checkered wooden grips with Gold-plated Colt medallions, this is an 8” barreled .357 Colt Python that has been fitted with a great Redfield 4X scope with clear optics. The pistol also comes with a Top-Of-The-Line Bianchi #X2200 “COLT PYTHON HUNTER” leather shoulder holster. The pistol is not a “true” Python Hunter, but it certainly looks like one, and it still retains the red ramp front sight

Easy to use, safe, and reliable, the single shot Henry Mini Bolt .22LR Youth Rifle is an ideal first gun for young shooters and beginners. The Official Youth Rifle of the USA Olympic Shooting Team, the Mini Bolt is proportioned for small-framed shooters. Weighing in at a feather-light 3.25 lbs., kids won't mind toting it to the range or in the woods. This European-style bolt action rifle offers quality sights rarely found in youth rifles with the high visibility Williams Fire Sights—an illuminated two green dot adjustable rear sight and a contrasting red front sight—that allow for a simple, consistent sight picture. The great-looking 16.25'' stainless steel barrel and lever are matched with a tough one-piece synthetic stock, and the beavertail forearm ensures a comfortable and firm grip. To maximize safety, the manually operated thumb safety switch prevents the rifle from firing when set, even when cocked. Made in USA."

It's a regular 7.62 Mauser C96 that has been milled out to safely and accurately fire 9mm and the bore is crisp, clean and well rifled. Couldn't expect more.

It's a shooter grade gun so none of the numbers match and it's been reblued although the pitting damage is minimal; This is the c96 for men who want to shoot one and shoot it often!

These rifles have not been available for a long time. They are a must for the military rifle collector. Very few of these true M48 rifles are available.

GRADE:This rifle is in very good condition.  The bore looks great with deep rifling.

 The M48 Mauser is a post World War IIYugoslavian version of the Belgian Fabrique Nationale designed Mauser model 1924 short rifle. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's MauserKarabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well.

I am most interested in trading for other C&R firearms rifle/pistol/revolver.  I am very open to all offers.  Face to Face in San Antonio only.

The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well.

This is a lightly used 8 inch Colt Python. There's just the hint of wear around the front cylinder edges. This beautiful handgun hasn't been shot enough to wear the bluing out of the bore! The stock factory grips are in near perfect condition, with no nicks or gouges in the checkering. There is a scratch on one grip panel visible in pic 2. It would probably rub out with some paste wax!

This is a lightly used 8 inch Colt Python. There's just the hint of wear around the front cylinder edges. This beautiful handgun hasn't been shot enough to wear the bluing out of the bore! The stock factory grips are in near perfect condition, with no nicks or gouges in the checkering. There is a scratch on one grip panel visible in pic 2. It would probably rub out with some paste wax! This fine Colt has the adjustable rear sight and the red-ramp front sight. The Bianchi shoulder holster is in fine condition! Payment is via postal money order only...

Designed for quick tactical shooting, the Barska 1x30 M-16 electro sight riflescope is perfect for everything from targets to turkeys. The riflescope offers such features as a seven-position reticle illumination adjustment, 1/2-inch-click adjustable windage and elevation adjustments, and a removable magnification objective lens. As a result, you'll enjoy plenty of eye relief and increased shooting accuracy. The scope's multi-coated ruby lenses, meanwhile, produce sharp images with minimum glare--a must for precision aiming. And thanks to the scope's high impact rating, it's built strong to withstand high-caliber recoil shot after shot. Other features include a parallax-free image at 100 yards, a standard Weaver-style mount, a black matte finish, a tactical red illuminated cross reticle, and a five-position rheostat that allows you to make individual reticle brightness adjustments. Built to provide unlimited eye relief for such rifles as the AR-15, M-16, M-4, and SKS, the 1x30 scope carries Barska's one-year limited warranty.

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community. Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the SSA-E provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced 1st and 2nd stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light 1st stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like 2nd stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired.

655,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2209655,For Sale:  Handmade Leather Holsters!,"Maple Valley/Renton, Seattle, Washington",$ 20,"Listed On: Thursday, December 5, 2013",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey all,

I've got a bunch of holsters for sale. They were traded for from the owner of the now-defunct Holland Holster CO. He made these himself and they are of great quality, made right here in Renton, WA. He used to sell the pocket holsters alone for $40 a piece and the 1911 holsters for upwards of $55 a piece.

Here are the holsters:

*I have ONE leather OWB holster for a 5"" 1911. One thing about it is that it is VERY tight on my Ruger SR1911 due to the Novak sights and the fact that it is brand-new leather. If you have gov't sights, it'll probably work just fine after a night or two in the holster. I'll sell this one for $30.

*I have ONE OWB Holster for a full-size XD-type pistol. I am not sure whether or not it is for the 9/40 or the 45. But I will find out ASAP next time I am at the LGS. This one is also for sale for $30.



I have OWB, IWB, and In-the-pocket ""wallet"" styles for these pocket-guns:

*Ruger LCP
*Kahr P380
*Sig P238
*Keltec P3AT

Some holsters have an integral mag-pouch, some do not. Some are designed to fit with a crimson trace attachment, others not. Some of the wallet-style have a flap that goes over the top. Basically, if you need/want a holster for one of these guns, I probably have one.

The IWB and Pocket holsters I will sell for $20 ea. The OWB holsters required a bit more work and leather, so I am selling them for $25 ea.

Shipping is $5 anywhere in the USA. Paypal or USPS Money Order is preferred.

If you have any questions, email or a call/text to REDACTED is fastest.

Note: I have some of these up on eBay already, so if you'd like to check out what is ready-to-buy here is a link to my ebay page: http://www.ebay.com/usr/the_next_generation"

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. Model 99 in action The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.

ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR 98% CONDITION NICKEL PLATED SMITH & WESSON MODEL 29-2 .44 MAGNUM REVOLVER WITH ORIGINAL WOOD BOX, ALL PAPERS AND ACCESSORIES. 8 3/8 INCH BARREL. SERIAL NUMBER: N358519. MADE IN 1976. Considered by many to be the finest revolver Smith & Wesson ever manufactured, this Model 29 left the factory in 1976. The .44 magnum round was envisioned by the famous gun writer, Elmer Keith. He pioneered the efforts to design a super powerful cartridge that would kill dangerous game at short ranges. Smith & Wesson became part of the effort in the early 1950s. The first models were offered to the general public in 1957, with Remington making the ammunition. Our revolver is in just slightly short of mint condition with the lightest turn mark on the cylinder. Also, some of the edges of the cylinder flutes show a miniscule amount of flaking almost invisible to the human eye. These marks are extremely minor. I believe that they were caused by long years of sitting in the blue flocked box because that is where this beauty has spent 99% of its life. With its deep mirror-bright lustrous nickel plating, I’d call it a 98% piece. I can’t see any other wear at all. It doesn’t appear to have been carried at all and has been shot very, very little. The beautifully grained Goncalo Alves target grips have gold Smith & Wesson medallions and are in perfect condition. Other features are a pinned barrel, recessed chambers in the cylinder, wide target hammer and trigger (both of which retain most of their original case hardening colors), a red insert ramp mounted front sight and an adjustable white outline rear sight. The bore is absolutely perfect and lock-up and timing are like new. Included is the original wood box (I’ve seen hundreds of S&W factory wood boxes and this one has absolutely the most beautiful graining of any of them), a cleaning rod with mop, a screwdriver and all papers. If you’re looking for a super Model 29 powerhouse revolver in wonderful condition, you won’t find one nicer than this one"

Ruger Mini-14 Tactical 5.56 / .223 5 Round - NIB

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities.

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Ruger Mini-14 Centerfire Autoloading rifles provide reliable performance with the following features:

 ** Simple, rugged Garand-style breechbolt locking system, with a fixed-piston gas system and self- cleaning, moving gas cylinder

 ** Chambered in the 5.56 / .223 cartridge

 ** Integral sling mounting studs

The heart of Remington's law enforcement rifle is the legendary Model 700 action. This is the same action that is at the core of the M-24 Sniper Weapon System built for the U.S. Army. The foundation of this action is it's unique bolt design. The bolt face, barrel, and receiver surround and support the cartridge head with three overlapping rings of solid steel. The receiver is machined from a solid block of ordnance-grade steel, then is drilled and tapped for scope mounts.

The TWS package rifle is available in .308 Win. and features a heavy, free-floating 26 inch barrel crowned at the muzzle for accuracy and stability. Composite stocks reinforced with Du Pont Kevlar and fiberglass are empolyed. They stay dimensionally stable in any weather and under the worst tactical situations. The stock is laid up around an aircraft-grade aluminum bedding block that runs the full length of the receiver. It has a textured, black, non-reflective finish and comes with sling swivel studs. Included is a Leupold Vari-X III (3.5 x 10) scope with a Duplex reticle and flip-open lens covers. A Harris bipod, a Michaels 1 inch Quick-Adjust sling with swivels, a rugged Pelican hard case, and a sample of Remington gun care prouduct complete the package."

The SAM7R
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.
