The great majority of the Model 62 rifles were chambered for .22 Short, Long and Long Rifle A small fraction of the .22 Short only rifles were made for field use. These field guns are easily identified by the small rounded loading port (the gallery guns had a ""triangular"" loading port to be used with a speed loading device). Other than a handful of special order or experimental guns, the .22 Short Only Field rifles are the scarcest of all Model 62A's This rifle is in excellent, completely original condition. All components are original and correct including the pre-war high comb buttstock, large 17-groove pump handle, special short only carrier, etc. The original blue finish rates 99% with just enough aging to assure that it is 100% original. There is no significant rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition, never sanded or refinished, and are free if cracks, chips, gouges, or repairs. The rifle is in excellent mechanical condition and has a mirror bright bore. According to serial number information, this fantastic little rifle was manufactured in the summer of 1941, just months before the USA entered the Second World War. A great gun, don't let this rare little Winchester get away"

The new Mega Arms MATEN is the most versatile .308 black rifle ever. MEGA's extensive engineering and design has bridged the gaps where others have fallen short. The MATEN billet receiver set will accept any AR15 lower parts with the exception of the barrel nut, and magazine.  This set is compatible with both DPMS LR308 style and Armalite AR10 parts. Since a 308 bolt catch is installed along with front and rear take down pins, an expensive 308 parts kit is not needed. Build your ultimate hunting, tactical or target rifle without having to compromise. 

The MATEN set includes upper, ambidextrous lower, a charging handle, threaded bolt catch pin, take down pins, tensioning screw, ambi-bolt release and trap door. This was done to guarantee the best possible upper to lower fit and ease of assembly. Using the MATEN platform also allows you the most options on your next build.

At least that's what the manufacturer says. Never got the chance to find out for myself. For 650 bucks you can.

Pictures will not display, please email me for pics.

Also have a lower parts kit (30 bucks) and ALG trigger (60)

If I do not respond to your offer in a timely manner, it means I think you are an idiot.

Has matching numbers. Chromed bore. Has a very few minor scratches and handling marks. This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. The gun has a new Ironwood Design/made furniture set (upper and lower handguards, pistol grip). Wood furniture has an iodine red finish (like a red orange finish). Gun also has a like new Ace Ltd Galil style folding stock (locks up tight, and cost $135 for the whole assembly). Upper handguard latch tip is broken. But the latch itself is still functional (brand new handguard latch is included with the sale/trade). In addition, this gun comes with a dust cover mount and a brand new SIG CP1 Prismatic 3X Reticle scope (green and red light illuminated modes scope - pictured). This Hungarian SA-85M was imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90′s. Sorry about the pictures. I'm not a good photographer. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. You must be at least 18 years old or older to buy/trade this gun. Local sale/trade only. Kentucky residents with proper ID only. Thanks for looking.

 Gun comes with the following:
 2-30rd Tapco magazines (both new)
 1-30rd Polish polymer mag (new)
 1-30rd Chinese (used but in very good cond.)
 100 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (not pictured)
 - wood thumbhole stock and hand guards (pictured)
 - matching factory dust cover included (pictured)
 - miscellaneous parts (i.e., muzzle brake, stock screws/bolts, etc) - not pictured
 - other extras not pictured are included with the sale/deal

   ($900 without scope and mount, or $750 without  the folding stock, scope, scope mount, Ironwood furniture set, and ammo) -

- For $750 you'll get the gun, all the magazines, wood thumbhole stock, light finished wood upper & lower handguards, and the extra small parts -

* No lowballers and tirekickers please. This gun is worth what I'm asking for. I have at least $1,000 on the gun alone *

 Note: This gun has U.S. made parts (i.e., wood furniture, flash hider, firing pin, misc springs) in compliance with the AWD/922r. Need to include all that since the gun has a folding stock installed. Buyer can use the thumbhole stock and the extra handguards if he/she wish to do so.

 * Additional info: Forgot to mention that the Ace folding stock (folding stock mechanism), which is on the gun, can be made to fold either to the right or left hand side of the receiver by inverting the mechanism *"

It is a scale replica of a 17th-century Dutch East India Company ship. 

Please note this is not one of the cheap, mass-produced toys made in a sweatshop in the Philippines that you commonly see sold in home-decor stores or online. 

I've been building models for over 30 years. This model took me approximately one painstaking year to build. It is plank-on-frame construction; meaning that the hull, decks, and bulkheads were formed by laying down a miniature keel, building a frame skeleton, and applying separate planks one at a time via steam and pressure - just like the real thing (unlike the cheap models, which simply use a solid piece of wood.) The masts, shrouds, ratlines, rigging, tackle and blocks are all to scale and accurately portrayed (again, unlike models who's rigging is woefully thick, and not to scale.) 

This is a LARGE model, measuring a little over 25 inches tall (from shelf to the top of the main mast), 26 inches long, and 8 inches wide (from tips of the main yardarm) 

Unfortunately we've fallen on hard times and now I'm scrambling to make some extra cash.

This would serve as stunning showpiece for a fireplace mantle. Armslist only allows 3 images so please feel free to email me with questions or request additional images (there's plenty more). Pick-up only, as it's far to fragile to ship."

I bought this pistol with the thought of having another relatively inexpensive 9mm to carry in one of my vehicles and not have to worry about possibly losing a $1500 high dollar Kimber or the like.  I have had a P11 for quite a while now and it has never had a failure to fire so I bought this as a second one with intentions of using it as a 'stashed' pistol in another vehicle.  However, I've found that I really don't mind just carrying my other little Kel-Tec.  This is a very lightweight pistol that holds 10 +1 rounds of 9mm instead of other small pistols firing the .380 (9mm short).  I have a lot more confidence in the stopping power of a 9mm over a .380.  IMHO, you can't buy a more reliable yet inexpensive pistol than a Kel-Tec.  You can own this pistol that has only been out of the box for pictures today for $275!  Buyer must have valid IN identification and be legally able to purchase a firearm.  Contact me with any questions."

The rifle is in excellent condition.

Sale includes the rifle as pictured with a Weigand picatinny scope rail.

I'm not the original owner but when I bought the rifle it appeared barely used. I've run 50 rounds of .357 magnum jacketed soft points and about 200 rounds of .38 special reloads, all jacketed flat nose. The rifle functioned perfectly and is as accurate as one should expect from a handgun cartridge carbine. I would rate the recoil with .357 magnum as negligible.

I love this rifle but my first desire was for a Marlin 1894 .357, I finally found and bought the Marlin, really don't need two ways to sling 357/38 lead.

I will consider reasonable cash offers.

 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT
 Manufacturer: Kel-Tec
 Model #: P-3AT
 Finish: Matte Black
 Sights: Fiber Optics, Dovetailed Aluminum Front Sight
 Barrel Length: 2.76""
 Overall Length: 5.2""
 Overall Height: 3.5""

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

    A little surface rust, but can be cleaned up with a little TLC. I bought it through a surplus company years ago and I received it covered in cosmoline. I cleaned it up and I have put a few hundred rounds through it. This is not a cheap Norinco SKS. Recently shot it and had zero problems. I've moved onto an AR and have no need for this gun anymore.

- Hard Case

This guy will agree (in writing) to a  price and when you go to pick up the gun, he will raise the price and tell you he doesnt want to jerk you around????????????? Did I just miss something here? Go figure! He plays the old ""got a higher offer at the last minute and cant pass it up"" deal. I bet the ""higher offer"" never showed up, and you will see it listed next week again. He also lowered the price from two weeks ago, but claims he doesnt need to sell it. Seems like he talks out of both sides of his mouth. A real game player extraordinaire. He thinks he has some highly valuable collector piece when in reality, you can find them all day for $500. He thinks because he saw a few ads that are ASKING $600 for a Ruger gp 100, doesnt mean they are SELLING for that price. Check the auction RESULTS, and talk to others in the industry to find out what guns are worth........they are worth what they sell for, period. I also like how just about every used gun you see on here has ""never been fired"", yeah right. Bottom line is, lets try to work on the lost art of ""keeping your word"" when you make a deal with someone."

I have a Glock 23 Gen 3 in great shape with low round count for sale or trade with cash. It will come with everything it did new (Box / Papers / 2 Mags / Field Brush / ect)  The Glock was manufactured this year. I am looking to sale for $500 cash or trade for another compact/full size in 9mm or 40 cal. plus $100 cash due to me making a purchase with Christmas funds and I don't want to piss off momma. 

I would be interested in a

Obviously I'm not expecting a Glock in the same condition as mine with $100 unless it was missing items and what not. Ammo will be placed in exchange for mismatched value.

Hopkins & Allen was one of the names that Merwin Hulbert produced pistols.

According to the 2011 Standard Catalog of Firearms this is officially called the Double-Action Pocket Model, small frame with folding hammer.  The finish on this one will be 90+%.  I have found the serial number ""885"" on butt, the cylinder, the ejecting star, the frame under the grip and on the underside of the right grip panel handwritten in some sort of white marking medium.

Going back to the above mentioned book, this pistol in its condition would fall into the ""Very Good"" description valued at $800.  Before you start beating me up over value in books, let me put it to ya this way.  Not knowing this pistol, this is my starting point; the first $225 gets this gem.

Mags actually hold 24 rounds, not quite sure why they are always advertised as 22 round mags, but they certainly hold 24 rounds without a problem. This is a GREAT gun and I am sad to sell it, but I desire another shotgun. I ALWAYS clean my guns after the range, and this GSG has only seen the range two times. Possibly a total of 500 rounds down the tube, it has very little wear and tear, and is in perfect working order. It comes with a $150 Barska scope and 4 Hi-Cap 22 round mags (Gun comes with 1, so 3 at $25/each) and approximately 600 rounds quality 22LR ($50) DO NOT get tricked into paying $350-400 for the cheap ""Lightweight"" version of this gun! It is PLASTIC and of no comparison to this GSG-522 SD. Also comes with the bolt/screw upgrade kit ($20) but I have not taken the time to install it yet. However, I would highly recommend installing it because GSG used rather soft screws throughout the gun and they have been known (rarely) to sheer off under severe duress (never seen it happen but bought the upgraded screws anyways).
