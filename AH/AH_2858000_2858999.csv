These are pretty rare rifles as the only ones in this configuration were in port during the 1989 import ban on assault rifles.

This TV is in physical great shape and has good picture. It has an issue with the HDMI ports, the audio gets distorted and turns to static, but if you use a cable or any other input it works just fine. The infrared sensor doesn't work either, so unless you have a cable box you have to change channels using the side buttons.

USES Standard .223/5.56 AR 15 BCG and Magazines

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v7-300, new for 2013, is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

I fired a box of Winchester white box thru this gun after purchase, and it has been on standby in my safe every since.  Included are the XS Big Dot Tritium Night Sights already installed.  These are very intuitive rapid acquisition gun fighting sights.  Also installed is a Lone Wolf Ultimate Trigger Stop.  This housing has an adjustment screw for adjusting the over travel and reset on the trigger.  The internals have not been modified in any way, but have been polished for smooth operation.  

The finish on this gun is absolutely flawless, and no wear is visible at all.  Everything is included that it comes with new, including two Gen 4 Mags, lock, original box, etc.  It's all there.

Price is firm at $550 for all.  Text me for pics.  No trades at this time as I am reluctantly parting with this pistol for another project.  I will need to see an Indiana CCW as well as complete a basic bill of sale.

The Uzi Pistol is a semi-automatic, closed bolt, and blowback-operated pistol variant. Its muzzle velocity is 345 m/s. It is a Micro-Uzi with no shoulder stock or full-automatic firing capability. The intended users for the pistol were various security agencies in need of a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, or civilian shooters that wanted a gun with those qualities and the familiarity of the Uzi style. It was introduced in 1984 and produced until 1993.

A 32-round extended magazine is the standard and we have the two original metal magazines for this rare weapon. In MINT condition.
