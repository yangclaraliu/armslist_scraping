The balance is engraved with intertwined foliate arabesque patterns with dark stippled background.

Mr. Strolz is a grand master instructor who instructed this fall at the Grand Masters Program engraving school in Kansas where annually two of the world's best engravers teach aspiring engravers their techniques. He states that the silicon molds of these particular engravings have been donated to FEGA as instructional tools. This is the finest Blaser K77 firearm ever produced and is truely unique and magnificently beautiful.

Stock and forend are magnificent exibition grade Circassian walnut with schnable tip forearm, pistol grip stock and fluted European style cheekpeice. It has an oval ebony grip cap. The chamber end of the barrel has a special block with a square bridge at chamber end that is mounted with back side swinging, return to zero, mount & rings holding a Leupold VariX III 3.5-10x-50mm scope. As you can see from the photos this piece is in extremely fine condition and appears to be new and unfired."

In good condition and it shoots well enough, but Marlins in general are cheap and it sometimes shows.  Specifically, while firing eight magazines of cheap ammo, one casing was caught and crimped in the bolt, and after that shooting session the act of cleaning it, and thus bumping a rod repeatedly against the bolt, jammed the bolt in place so it had to be disassembled (a very easy job, two screws and one peg) and freed.  Very simple controls (side-plug style safety, bolt release, magazine release, and bolt handle are about it), and scope adjustment knobs have protective covers so you won't accidentally turn them once getting it zeroed to your preferred range and ammo type.

Approx 200 rounds of Federal Match Auto ammo included for practice, some in an old Stinger plastic box with a sliding lid that makes it easy to tip out exactly five rounds at a time for reloading, and a little under 100 rounds of Remington Thunderbolt for hunting.

Very nice and well maintained 12 gauge shotgun, great for home defense or just having fun at the range. $400 for the gun, cleaning kit, ammo, and the $100 stock replacement."

The rifle:
The Mum has been ground off, like 90%+ of Arisakas.
It is a Type 38, Series 24 from the Kukora Arsenal.

The wood on the stock is rougher, admittedally, but has never been sporterized, sanded, refinished, or repaired.  All original piece of WWII history.

The bluing on the rifle is in very good shape with no rust.  And the bore is surprisingly bright with 4 deep grooves.  It also has good headspace with no deformations in the brass.

The Bayonet:  It was made by Toyoda Automatic Loom.  The Toyoda Automatic Loom company would become Toyota.  The bluing on the blade is immaculate.  No rust or pitting.  The only marks on the blade are from where it is inserted into the scabbard, which comes with it.  It would be difficult to find another Arisaka bayonet in this condition, let alone another Toyoda in this shape.  Has the factory sharp, about half of the blade.

The Sling:  This sling is an ORIGINAL leather Arisaka Sling.  It is dark brown/black leather that has a good bit of wear.  There is a slight tear in one spot.  The kicker is the Japanese characters painted on the inside of the sling.  I do not know the meaning, but it looks like it was done be a Japanese soldier in the field.  You rarely find an original Arisaka Sling.

I also have 20 rounds of new manufactured 6.5 Jap ammo, sealed.

I am more looking to trade than sell, but make me a cash offer, I'll consider it.
I'd take $400 obo. Don't be afraid to offer.  All reasonable offers considered.

Just email me, and I'll respond to every offer. The worst I can say is ""No Thanks""
If the ad is still up, I still have, so please no ""Do you still have it"" emails. Just send your offer."

Ruger Model 10/22 Carbine .22 long rifle for sale.  This weapon is in near perfect condition as the pictures reveal.  There are 4-6 very light scratches/dents in the wooden stock.  The finish has not been penetrated so most of the marks on the stock should steam out just fine.  All blued metal is free of blemishes and/or scratches.  From what I understand, this model is one of the civilian versions of the Mini 14 Carbine.  The scope and rings are cheapos and the scope will not adjust magnification easily.  It is pretty much stuck in the 3x position and takes a lot of effort to adjust it.  The scope has no markings to indicate brand.  If you want to buy this gun, I would count on either removing the scope and using the factory sights or get a decent scope and rings.  Because of the condition of the rings and scope, I am not factoring them into the price.  The factory rear site folds down to accommodate a scope and also has adjustments for elevation and windage should you choose not to re-scope it.  This weapon includes qty 2 10 round magazines.  With this weapon, I am providing an additional 1,425 rounds.  Also included is the leather sling pictured.  The sling is in very good condition.  This weapon will not be a disappointment to any potential buyer."

SHortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
 Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
    Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
    Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
    Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
    The XPS2 is not Night Vision compatible, for Night Vision compatibility see the XPS3 sights."

The barrel is a 4-Groove and is marked ""R.A. 3-43"" with the flaming bomb.
The bore is IMMACULATE! It is the original barrel for this receiver. 
It is probably the most accurate rifle I have had the chance to shoot.

The top hand guard is original, but has been repaired. There are 8 small wood splices and a small crack. But I prefer the original part with repairs than a replacement.

The number stamped in the stock and the number on the bolt are both different than the receiver, meaning it has been re-arsenaled, but it is the original 4-Groove barrel in excellent shape!

I have a leather sling, 17 Rounds of 150-Grain Soft Point, and 17 Rounds of 180-Grain soft point 30-06 rounds.

I am looking for trades only, unless I am offered alot of cash.
Just e-mail me and I will respond to every offer. The worst I can say is ""No thanks.""
If the ad is up, I still have it, so please no ""Do you still have it?"" e-mails please."

I never used the hip holster and I would assume it would cause excessive wear but you can have it if you want it. there is normal wear on the parkerized finish from normal shooting use but there is no significant holster wear on the gun.

I am just ready for a change.  Normally it would go in the safe but I know that once I get something different this one will never get shot.  Always been more of a steel frame guy.

Anyway, here’s everything that has been done.
-Installed Warren Tactical Fiber Optic all steel sights
-3.5# Ghost Disconnector
-Full trigger job performed
-Feed ramp was highly polished to aid in feeding and reliability
-Molon Labe In Greek Lettering on the back of the Slide, (dont have original)
-Slide catch was cut and dehorned to reduce in accidental engagement
-Extended Low profile mag release
-Trigger guard was relieved to allow you’re strong and support hand to get a higher purchase
-Grip force adapter was added to give a beaver tail and feel more like a 1911.  Can be removed, I have the original pins.
-Finger grooves were removed and grip stippled.  Feels a little more aggressive than the sandpaper grips people add to their guns.  

Obviously this pistol is not for everyone but for those that like to run their guns the way I do will understand the reason behind all of these modifications.  I dig the Glocks totally just not their grip angle so I had it made to feel more like a Glorious 1911.

I have the box as well as one 17round mag, two 10 round communist mags, and two 33 round 2nd amendment mags.  Hopefully these will sweeten the pot a little."

Everything besides the storage container and 2 of the 4 mags are unused. I recently sold my AR15, and therefore no longer have a need for these items. 

The ammo is excellent for home defense and/or hunting. I shot approx. 1200 round of this stuff threw my Colt M4 rifle before I sold it, and it cycled perfectly and was very accurate and dependable. I can say the same for the TAPCO mags as well, although the 4 that are included area essentially brand new. 

The AR15 scope mount is made from a single piece of aircraft aluminum, therefore it is very light and strong. It fits a 1"" scope and has 4 picatinny mounts for additional equipment (such as flashlights, lasers, etc.). It is brand new, unused, factory sealed. I can send additional information if needed. I paid about $60 for it a few mouths back and never installed it. Also come with an Allen key and other accessories.

The price for the entire package is $300. This is pretty much the cost buying just the ammo and getting everything else (approx. $165) for free. I am really not looking to separate this package.

Upon investigation, I found that Hopkins & Allen was one of the names that Merwin Hulbert produced pistols.  According to the 2011 Standard Catalog of Firearms this is officially called the Double-Action Pocket Model, small frame with folding hammer.  The finish on this one will be 90+%.  I have found the serial number ""885"" on butt, the cylinder, the ejecting star, the frame under the grip and on the underside of the right grip panel handwritten in some sort of white marking medium.

This weapon was from the era of black gun powder, it would not be safe to fire modern ammo.

Paid close to $1200 for the gun alone, along with extra mags, holster, mag carrier it's a great price. Wiling to drive max 25-45 miles radius to make the deal. Only those legally able to own firearms. Low ball offers they will be ignored.  Trades would need to include some cash and would be $1000 in value, only firearms.  No hunting guns, be realistic about trades or offers.  Not desperate to sell, if it doesn't sell will it will just go back into the safe.  Thanks"

If you haven’t looked through a thermal sight before you are in for a treat.  There is no comparison between this thermal sight and Gen 3 autogate night vision.  The big differentiator is that you can see through objects which night vision technology will not all you to.  For example, I could see my buddy clear as day behind a bush the bush he was hiding under, while looking through my Gen 3 monocular, I had no idea anyone was there.

If your serious about doing it right, this is the game changer for your safe.  These are already regulated for export and I suspect they will be outlawed soon enough.

The ACOG is a 4x32 with Green BAC cross-hairs reticle with ,223/M4A1 BDC. The green illumination is nice because it is more visible to the eye with less light. The BDC crosshairs allow for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters. The mount is the standard Trijicon mount.

The RMR mounted on top is the 3.25MOA red dot. It auto adjusts its brightness based on lighting conditions, and works well both in bright and dim environments. The mount is a factory Trijicon mount. This reflex sight allows for is a faster, more instinctive sight for close range shooting.

Look no further. Selling this bad boy to fund a new dirt bike for my son. 

 Started out as a stock Glock 21SF, before I shot it, I handed it over to Mike @ Accurate Iron to work his magic. 

 It came back with a beveled mag well, crisp 3.5 lb trigger, grip stippled, undercut trigger guard, and I'm probably missing something else.

 I added a LoneWolf threaded barrel & Streamlight TLR-1s.

 Has original barrel, box/paperwork, and 4ea Factory 13rnd mags.

 I'd venture to guess it has less that 500 rnds thru it, can't be much I don't shoot very often.

 Why buy a FN TAC45 for over $1000, when you could have this bad boy for $850.
