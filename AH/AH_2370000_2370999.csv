A great tactical/security shotgun.  It has a rear ghost ring sight, front fiber optic sight, a pistol grip butt stock, and an ammo holder on the buttstock.  It's a lightweight shotgun with a smooth pump action and I've only put one box of ammo through it.  I upgraded to a semi-auto so I don't need this anymore.  This model runs about $285 in stores, plus taxes and fees, without the shell holder. $175 cash or $200 trade equivalent.

Note:  One of you on here decided to tell me how over priced this is and compared it to a site selling this for $293.69.  So, to enlighten the math geniuses out there:  $293.69 + $23.10 x 2 (that site's price on mags) +$20 for ammo (Walmart) + sales tax in Indiana = $385.08.  That doesn't factor in FFL transfer cost, which is usually around $25.  So, please learn 5th grade math before complaining about over pricing to simply compare to a worse deal."

Stock shows wear with some sort of thick finish on it. I believe this finish to have been done by the Polish and not stateside, it looks too rough to have been done recently. The stock also has a large crack on both sides with a arsenal repair on both sides. I'm told by the experts that because of the arsenal repair it should hold up just fine to being fired.

The bolt is a Polish bolt but it doesn't match, the floor plate matches via electro pencil. The butt plate does match.

The rifling is in great shape. It does show some sign of use but the ridges are very sharp, I don't really see any rounding on them. Purely speculation but I'm guessing this was used by the Polish military as a carry rifle. Maybe guard duty or basic training where it would have been carried and beat up but shot very little.

I accept cash or trade. I'm mainly interested in older stuff and am looking for 8mm mauser ammo.

*What is Near Infrared Textile Technology (NIR)? Used by the U.S. Department of Defense to prevent detection by NIR Image Converters. These photcathode devices to no detect temperatures, but rather infrared radiation variances. NIR-compliant uniforms use a special fabric that allows soldiers to appear at the same radiation level as the surrounding terrain, thus making them more difficult to detect. NIR technology also make uniforms less visible in low-light environments by reducing the reflection of light 


What is the ECWCS Generation III: The third generation of the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS-III) is a radical re-design of the cold weather clothing system for the U.S. Army. It is based on layering systems believed to be the most effective by mountaineering professionals and incorporates 7 layers of clothing. Each piece fits and functions either alone or together as a layering system to provide the most effective options in the lightest weight possible to soldiers. It is 33% more compressible, 25% lighter and is rated as significantly more comfortable. It is more versatile and includes functional features that allow the Soldier to adapt to varying mission requirements and environmental conditions ranging between -40 to +60 degrees Fahrenheit. The U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division field tested 18,000 of the ECWCS-III systems in Afghanistan in the fall of 2006 with great reviews, hence it is the most current ECWCS system in the US Army to date.

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:

I can include more ammo (5.56 or .223), Magpul PMags (gen 3, black, no window), and a laser/light combo with remote pressure switch for extra.

This entire package retails for over $1300, so you're already saving several hundred dollars (not counting taxes, fees, and paperwork hassles).  E-mails asking my lowest price or if this is still available will be ignored."

The cost to build this rifle today would be approximately $2,565.00. This upgraded rifle could be yours today for the low cost of $1700.00. That is a savings of almost $900.00. I only ran about 2000 rounds through this rifle. Since I need this money to fly my two dogs from Idaho to Oklahoma, you will save a considerable amount of money on me. No trades please.

Polymer Tip
The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.

Higher Ballistic Coefficient
Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.

Swaged Lead Core
The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.

Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs
Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting.

Shoot More, Pay Less With .22 LR Ammo For Practice

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
Durable Melonite QPQ Finish for increased wear resistance.

They can be clearly seen in the photos and in no way effect the performance. 


The MEC Grabber has everything you need for high speed, efficient operation and unbeatable precision. 
The twelve different operations at six individual stations speedily produce a finished shell with every stroke of the handle. 
The Grabber is remarkable in that it performs each of the basic reloading steps with a mere pull of the handle - depriming, resizing the metal base, priming, measuring the correct amount of powder, firmly seating the wad column, measuring the precise amount of shot and forming a tightly sealed crimp. The Grabber does all this and gives a finished shell with each stroke of the handle. 

Quality features make the Grabber the standard of the industry such as the Adjusta-Guide wad feed device, new one piece Spindex crimp starter, power ring collet resizer, automatic primer feed, auto-cycle charging and three stage crimp. With all of these features it is not difficult for an experienced operator to load 500 rounds per hour."

UPC: REDACTED37
The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a two-tone or Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

I still have the receipt where I purchased the lower and the Furniture kit for a little over $330 out the door from the Fernandina Rd store. Yes I'm aware you can get a Blemished for 160-170 from their website, so don't respond saying it I can get it for X amount of dollars. If that's what you want then by all means order it. Not trying to be a jerk just tired if the ignorant text/emails.

I'm willing to trade it for anything fire arm related, I'm really interested into another pistol, but I'm open to anything.  I can add cash for the right one.

Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride - Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface. The DE is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. Warranty papers are in each box, including safety cable and Bolt tool.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER - 100 ROUNDS OF 5.56 X 45 AMMO.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER - 100 ROUNDS OF 5.56 X 45 AMMO.

I had bought the rifle new at Gander mountain and shot about 30pellets through it. I am now in a modular home park and cannot shoot it here. I had the scope off and one thumb style screw used to tighten the scope to the gun is missing, also the wedge that the thumb screw tightens. I will hopefully find them before the salle/trade. This rifle has been able to shoot at 1200feet per second with certain ammo! I would be willing to trade for old repairable guns, parts guns etc.
