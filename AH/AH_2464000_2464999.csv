157,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2464157,For Sale:  FS/FT: Exceedingly Rare WW1 Colt 1911. 99% Original and Correct. 1918 Manufacture. US Property,"West College, State College, Pennsylvania","$ 4,700","Listed On: Wednesday, December 18, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale or trade I have a beautiful example of a WW1 Colt ""Black Army"" 1911 that is in near mint almost unissued condition. I have had this firearm examined by experts at the premiere auction house in the US and they all agree this is a 100% original and correct Black Army with the consensus being it is one of the finest they have ever seen. I have recent Email corospondence with this auction house putting the Pre-Auction estimate of this Firearm at $6500-$9500 and the head of the firearms division with whom I have been speaking believes it would top $10,000. Copies of Emails will be included I desired. If I do not receive any interest in either trades or a sale I will be cosigning this gun with said auction company for their March auction. As you can see my asking price is much lower than the low estimate given by the auction company. I would mainly like to trade or do a cash/trade for this firearm for other Pre WW1 US 1911s that are all correct, original, and in good condition. I would trade this 1911 straight up for a first year manufacture 1911 preferably under serial number 6500 but would consider any 1912 manufacture dates. I would also consider trading straight for a Navy marked 1911 or possibly multiple 1911s that are pre 1918 serial numbers. When the gun was inspected by the auction company here are some high points I would like to share. There is slight speckling around the patent date on the slide and that is what is called casting imperfections and is not pitting. Casting imperfections were inherent in many 1918 black armys as production was sped up to meet the US army's contracts. Their are also some stamping imperfections which can be seen from stamps beginning to wear out mainly visible on the Y in property and the top of the inspectors mark. I was told they have seen dozens of other examples very close to this serial number that exhibit all the same stamping imperfections so this as stated were just the stamps coming to the end of their usefulness. When the firearm was examined under bright lighting there is an overall even brown aging appearance that can be seen over the entire gun which is what you want to see in a gun that is almost 100 years old. I tried to capture this in the picture but it was near impossible. Overall there are only a handful of WW1 1911s in existence that are still in this high of condition and pictures do not do this gun justice as the stampings are much deeper in person so I urge anyone interested If able to come view this firearm in person. I'm sure if you are familiar with these pistols you know how rare black army gun are in this condition as the finish wasn't known to hold up very well. The only wear on the entire firearm is extremely minute holster wear at the front of the muzzle and a very small amount near the lanyard loop by the mainspring housing. The barrel has some pitting which I assume was from firing the gun with the coorosive ammo of the time and not cleaning it. I have many more pictures I can email or text upon request.

This bull pup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a
total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the
right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a
manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance
to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun
magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as
the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

This is a gorgeous gun with maticulous Italian engineering.  I bought it for my wife as a surprise months ago and I'm the one who got a surprise...  She isn't comfortable with a semi-auto and wants to stick to her 5-shot .357.  So, I stuck it in the gun safe until now.  I'm working on a project gun and need some coin, so I'm going to turn it loose.

Gun comes with everything pictured...  Hard Beretta case, 2 mags, cleaning brush and 125 rounds of ammo (75 rounds hollow point, 50 rounds fmj).

I might trade it for a nice Glock 17 or 19, but you'd have to add some cash...

A high percentage of the original blue finish remains on the barrel and the cylinder. I don’t have the book, but you will find this pistol pictured on page 166 of R.L. Wilson’s book, COLT AN AMERICAN LEGEND. It is also pictured on page 166 of COLT HERITAGE. There is no question this is the pistol. The Cloverleaf House Pistol is a .41 caliber short. It is a rimfire cartridge. It has a four shot cylinder which is in a cloverleaf pattern. Hence the name “Cloverleaf”. The bore in the three-inch barrel is bright and shiny and rates at least a six, maybe better. It does have very strong lands and grooves. The numbers match. You will find the action to be tight and smooth. The lockup is tight as well. Only about 7500 of these were manufactured from 1871-1876. The ivory grips are in excellent condition. Pistols In this condition are hard to find. This one is better than most. No FFL required."

For sale is a Ruger LCP in 380 with about 150rds through it. Condition is great. The only wear on the gun is on the top of the barrel that rubs against the slide (normal wear). I got some extras with it and I want to sell it as a package deal. The cost for all this to me was $515 so I'm trying to have this sell for $425. FTF transfer only. No shipping. I'm located in the west suburbs of Chicago. Buyer must present valid IL FOID card and DL.

I personally test a lot of firearms to see how they shoot.  I then do searches to see what others say about something and then form ""MY"" opinion.

Just for a little history here about Windham Weaponry.

A lot of people think that Windham Weaponry is a new company or they have never heard of them and it a new company as an entity goes, BUT.....the people that run Windham Weaponry are not new.  Several years ago, Bushmaster Firearms was bought out, and the previous owner of Bushmaster Firearms had to sign a not to compete agreement for five years. This meant that he couldn't make any AR-15 style rifles for five years.  I sold my Bushmaster Firearm because I didn't like the way it shot.  I had a hard time getting consistent and accurate groups with a lot of different types of ammo.

Enter back into the industry after being absent for five or so years, ""Windham Weaponry"". The new ""Windham Weaponry"" is is the old Bushmaster AR maker.  They are making the guns even better than they were originally made. These AR style rifles are even better than the old Bushmaster ARs were, ""in my opinion"".  A lot of the staff and people involved in the Windham Weaponry product are prior Bushmaster people including the owner, who used to own Bushmaster. Windham Weaponry are putting a lot of pride and detailed craftmanship in their new ARs. Their goal is to build the finest AR type rifle in the country and in my opinion they are getting close.  

Some ARs might cost an arm and a leg, but some are dirt cheap.  Paying an arm and a leg for an AR rifle doesn't always mean you are getting a lot more.  The Windham Weaponry AR I have, and the one I shoot is in my opinion one of the best built ARs out there for the consumer in what we refere to as the ""New Modern Firearm"".  My Windham Weaponry Firearm in the AR Platform is as close to the most accurate AR I've ever shot.  It is also the most consistently accurate AR I've shot with all types of ammo.

Will ship to your FFL via UPS or Fedex. I also have good reputation on calguns and you can check my history.

The Hogue Grip is AMAZING, you have to feel it to believe it. Feels more controllable then a fullsize standard grip because the Hogue is grippy and soft and has subtle swells in your hand plus the rubbery-ness absorbs recoil somewhat.

As others note, the trigger is also amazing, its long so its safe but its very smooth and medium-light pull weight. I had no problem hitting paper plates well past 50 yards from a rest.

I've carried both pocket and IWB and both work well. It REALLY feels like nothing IWB though (barely noticable), wheras pocket carry its like a wallet and more noticable.

Has original box, and has had roughly 40 rounds through it with no malfunctions (even though Kahr says there is a 200 round brake in period, still no problems even in the brake in period). For deep conceal CCW its unbeatable in my opinion, you get full power 9mm in a tiny package (I sometimes forgot I had it on me, no joke).

Its fired 115 grain Winchester white box and American Eagle 147 grain flat nose, both flawlessly. Recoil feels lighter with the 147 grain and noise seems less so 147's are my preferred load. 

I'm selling for financial issues, also I moved to an open-carry area so concealment isn't an issue anymore.

The retail for the Kahr ($420), extra mags ($70), grip ($9) and pinky extensions ($9) and fedex shipping (~$20) would come to $528 but I'm only asking $390 shipped. Discrete PP ok or let me know your payment preference.

Feel free to ask anything =)

They have been fired and still have the primers.  You will need to clean and deprime them yourself.  I try to pick out pieces that are Berdan primed or are bent to the point that they cannot be reloaded.  However, some of these may get into the bags.  I add an extra 10 pieces for every 500 to ensure you have quality pieces.  I hand count each bag and get rid of any aluminum or steel casings.  They are all brass or nickel coated brass! These are mixed headstamp and the .45s have not been sorted for primer size.  There are crimped, military rounds in .45s, 9mm and .223 mixed in.  These can be fixed with a cheap pocket reamer.   You will find a lot of Lake City and Remington in .223 as well as a 5.56 once in a while.  In the pistol cartridges, the majority are blazers, remingtons, winchesters, and federals.  There are also the military rounds, aguila, hornady, cor-bon, and speer to name a few.

You can meet me for the brass at M6 and 131 for Grand Rapids residents.  Or, I can ship the package nationally in flat rate boxes.  I will accept cash or paypal for all transactions.  I charge $7, $14, and $18 for 3 sizes of flat rate boxes.  A very small handling/paypal is included in those shipping prices to help cover my expenses or will be tacked on if meeting in person.  The $7 box can take very small packages while the $14 and $18 boxes will be more common for most orders.  

I will try to keep my inventory updated and add to it as I sort out new calibers.  I am trying to get my own small range brass business running and you can even come see me at the Grand Rapids gun show in January.  Email me to get a quote.  Let me know how many you want of the different calibers.  I will email my quote before sending an invoice for paypal.  Thanks for looking.

I can even show you how to break it down for cleaning and inspection. very simple straight forward gun.

  SKS NR, 1994 import.  Last SKS conversion imported before Clinton's ban.  Norinco Factory thumbhole sporter stock; nice finish.  Few marks from being moved and stored, firearm is nearly 20 years old.  Unsure if this rifle has ever been fired; it is in great shape.  16"" barrel, ""paratrooper"" style; and again, this takes AK mags, so no fumbling with stripper clips and no awkward duckbill magazines.  7.62x39 caliber, obviously, like any SKS.  This gun has not been bubba'd out in any way.

Includes factory sling and 5-round magazine; will also include a Tapco 30-rd mag I have no use for.

Gun must go to a legal buyer; face-to-face transaction preffered but will ship upon receipt of USPS money order to your FFL if necessary."

I bought it on impulse and loved it. Is it super practical? No. Can you use it for hunting? Hope your target is close. What it is, is super fun.

This is simply a black over under 12GA shotgun with two side rails, a top rail, jeweled block and a fiberoptic front post; It came like that to begin with. It's also pretty short with 20"" barrels and seems shorter in person. Throw a light on it and use it for home defense, show your friends, mall ninja the piss out of it, whatever. It's a fun gun to shoot, throws flames for days and attracts attention at the range. Disassembles real easy and fits into a small bag. (I've taken it on trips for sketchy hotels)


Gun is 90% condition, has a couple tiny imperfections. Bores are like mirrors. Round count is at ~40 3"" Magnum and ~25 2 3/4.


People sell these for $400-500 all day long, so I'm offering it for:

785,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2464785,For Sale/Trade:  PREBAN Olympic Arms AR-15 Excellent condition!!!  (pre ban with letter),"New Haven/Shoreline, New Haven, Connecticut","$ 2,050","Listed On: Wednesday, December 18, 2013",Rifles,Olympic Arms                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"This is indeed a preban, and I have a letter from Olympic Arms confirming the serial number date range of production. See the photo which proves thus.

I would like to sell this within the state of Connecticut, as I do not want to see AR15s leaving the state...rather, I would like them to stay within the state lines, in the hands of peaceful, proud Patriots.

This rifle has the old-school ""stop sign"" SGW stamp, and the entire rifle is in excellent condition.  Estimate of number of rounds through it is less than 500.  Full 20 inch barrel.

Some Olympic Arms get knocked, and if a firearm has constant issues, it should be knocked.  This rifle has never given me any issues, and it has fired both .223 and 5.56NATO rounds with no issues whatsoever.   (Some people also knock 1911s, and others knock Glocks.  You have to see a firearm and research it to know the quality, really.)

If you are in the market for a preban, and especially if you do not want to get involved with the banned-by-name/not-named preban issue in the state of Connecticut, then this could be the rifle for you.

I am not looking to make money on this, I bought two prebans, and I decided I would rather sell this one and be able to buy another handgun.  I paid $2050 (after taxes and transfer fees.)  I would like to not sell this at a loss.  I am also open to the possibility for trading the preban for a handgun + cash.  I am in the market for a new or VERY lightly used 9mm semi-auto (Glock, Sig Sauer) and/or a nickel or chrome .38 special revolver.

All CT laws will be followed, forms, etc.

This rifle is in very good to excellent condition!  Hardly any wear or scrape marks, the finish is practically flawless, and it overall is quite nice.

This AR-15 will NOT have to be registered!  This is something to consider!

In Connecticut right now, if you want to buy an AR, you have two choices:
1. Not buy anything at all (or buy something illegally, and risk having ALL your firearms taken-  not advisable at all!!!)
2. Purchase an authenticated pre-ban A R  15 rifle and NOT have to register it with the state of CT.

All other AR15s, which are not prebans, must be registered as Assault Weapons with the State of Connecticut by January 1st, 2014.

Email me if you want to meet and inspect the rifle before purchase.  I also have more photos (only permitted to upload three images per listing.)

I am not taking a major loss on this, I probably should just sit on this and wait until after January 1st, and list it at $2400.  But, I am not looking to gouge, as MANY stores and individuals are right now across the state of CT.
Go take a look in some of the places such as 33King, BMG in Newington, and the horde of other places selling preban ARs in really beat up condition, with thousands of rounds through them, for hundreds more than this preban is listed as.

Thank you!"

The gun is in very good condition. The bluing is 98% intact, the bore is shiny, the rifling is sharp, and the cylinder locks up nicely. The double-action trigger is very stiff and even in single action the trigger pull is fairly heavy. The gun does not seem to have been fired very much at all. The gun is in great shape as it is, and a simple at-home trigger job to alleviate the heavy trigger would turn this gun into a wonderful shooter.

The gun does not have the original wooden grips as they were replaced with ambidextrous ergonomic grips before I ever bought it."

Has matching numbers. Has threaded barrel. Chromed bore. Gun has a few minor scratches and handling marks. Comes with 3-30rd magazines (1-new Polish, 1-new Tapco, and 1-Chinese, used but in good condition). This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. It has new Ironwood Design/made upper and lower handguards. However, upper handguard has split in the middle (pictured) but glued back together. The wood furniture has an iodine red finish (like a red orange finish). In addition, I'll throw in a matching Ironwood pistol grip, including the hardware (metal ferrule and grip bolt) with it. Thumbhole stock is not original to the gun. I took this gun on a trade and had a regular buttstock on it, and decided to install a thumbhole stock for compliance with the AWB/922r. The gun also comes with an extra new set of handguards. Upper handguard latch tip is broken. But the latch itself is still functional, and won't affect the gun function wise. Brand new handguard latch is included with the sale. This Hungarian SA-85M was imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's. Sorry about the pictures. I’m not a good photographer. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy/trade this gun. Thanks for looking. Happy Holidays everyone.

- $950 obo, or trade -

* No tirekickers and lowballers please *

Note: I do not have the factory wood thumbhole stock and the matching wood handguards. As stated on my posting/ad, I took the gun on a trade without the factory thumbhole stock furniture set. I had the Ironwood Design furniture set lying around. And decided to install them on the gun. I just like the red orange finish wood better. Of course, the buyer can install the other wood furniture set if he/she choose to do so."

The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own"

Serial Number is K 1327XX - the revolver is serial numbered on the frame, barrel and cylinder. I blurred the last two digits on the cylinder in the last pic.  

This is a five-screw SW K-frame.  

The revolver is in perfect mechanical condition and has extremely minor finish blemishes, most noticeable is a turn ring from firing approximately 250 rounds as well as faint wear at the muzzle from being placed in a soft case.  As you would expect, it is amazingly accurate and has impeccable timing.
