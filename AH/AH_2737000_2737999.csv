Engine is original. Truck body and frame is original. Minimal rust on the edge of door corners. Has some custom work. Really clean for its age. 

Problems: it ran a month ago. Something with the starter. Spins like it should but isn't hitching on the gear. Ran fine when it did. A lot better than I expected. Guy I got it from drove from Chattanooga. I drove it back from Tennessee state line east of Huntsville all the way back to Florence. No hiccups until Killen when my dumbass friend downshifted from 3rd at a high rpm and blew the oil pan gasket. So that's the worst thing wrong with it, which I know is a pain in the ass. Last thing is the transmission. WORKS FINE. But it was originally a 3 in the tree. Guy I got it from took the assembly out and stuck it in the floor. So it's a funky shift. But a rod connected to 1st and reverse fell off on its delivery to me, which was 4 hours from home, so I settled with it. That's all of the problems. It's slammed. Which is uncomfortable on bumps. 

It's not as bad as it might sound, ran perfectly when it did. Only thing it won't do is start and it runs through oil due to the leak. If you're interested or have any more questions just email me or text me. Text is preferable. REDACTED. Any offer I'll listen to all the way."

""AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."""

""AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."""

---------------------------------
Manufactors Description:
The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

    Front sight is integrated with gas block;
    Rear sight includes “RPK” style windage adjustment;
    Features factory installed UTG Picatinny handguard rail;
    M+M Chaos billet flash hider / muzzle brake;
    Factory side rail mount;
    Tapco G-2 trigger and retaining plate;
    Hogue pistol grip.

This is a wonderful rifle, but I am downsizing a bit. Rifle has seen only seen 4 mags run through it. Iron sights are on, Hogue grip is extremely comfortable, quad rail is a nice feature for any Magpul furniture/optics/or light accessories. I borrowed the above from a great review about the M&M M10-762, at http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/10/joe-grine/gun-review-mm-m10-762-rifle/ (these guys do great work and is well worth checking out). This review is what sold me on the rifle. Mags fit perfectly, the upgrades are simple add-ons but add to the completeness of this rifle and the CNC machine work from the American importer - M&M out of Colorado - is really well done. I will toss in a nice, steel sight post tool made by Magna-Matic.

One thing this AK has over others is the Phoenix KickLite stock, which absorbs a significant amount of felt recoil.

It has the Max4 camo pattern and a 26 inch barrel.  The SuperNova will cycle 2.75, 3, and 3.5 inch shells.  It currently retails for $600 at Academy.  The magazine tube will hold 4 shells and a tube plug is included to make it migratory legal.  This gun does have the ComforTech stock, unlike the Nova version.  Gun is in excellent mechanical condition- no issues whatsoever.  There is some rubbing of the camo pattern on one side from carrying- you can see this in one of the photos.  This gun is a straight shooter and is equally at home blasting clays or gobblenecks.  It has never let me down, and I would expect that to continue for the next owner.  Gun will come with IC, M and F chokes, choke wrench, and magazine tube plug.  I am selling because I am looking to buy a semi-auto (either Benelli M2 or Franchi Affinity).  Sorry for the purple tint of the photos- my cell phone camera has a weird glitch."

Just for some clarification: this is a gen3. If you believe that a gen 4 is better in this size, let me tell you that you are wrong...
gen3 has already has the dual recoil spring, so no advantage on the gen 4 side...
texture on the gen 4 is rough, which is good on a tactical pistol, but not on this small concealed carry weapon. The texture will irritate your skin, and make all your clothes fluffy...
plus if you shoot a couple magazines with your gen4  just for fun the recoil and the rough texture will not be fun on your hands..."

Because there are hundreds of dollars of after-purchase extras included (including, among many other extras, shell-plates for 9mm, 40 S&W, and 45 ACP, and shell-feeder plates for small and large calibers), AND the press is assembled (it is mostly un-assembled when shipped new) and fully de-greased (every part is shipped in packing grease that must be carefully cleaned-off before assembly and use).

This is a tremendous high-volume press in perfect condition and fully tuned-up (I've made less than 1000 rounds with it). I am selling it because I am ""joining forces"" with a friend who has a different high-end progressive press and we will both use his set-up and invest out time and money in one press--his.

This is a SMOKING deal!

Transform your progressive press into a bench-mounted ammo factory with the Hornady 3-in-1 Lock-N-Load Ammo Plant. This Ammo Plant by Hornady is the ultimate in reloading setup for maximum imageproduction in shorter sessions.

 Im the second owner, This gun has seen very little use everything locks up supertight and still needs breaking in a little.
 Its been carried upland birdhunting a couple of times so there are a couple of dings on the stock. 

 The original owner broke two small chips out of the forend somehow and made a fairly poor repair with woodglue, So i replaced the forend with a brand new one, So unfortunatly it gives the gun a two-tone appearence, The wood could be refinished to match or the original forend could be repaired, I just never bothered as i just thought of it as a field gun not a showpiece.

 Im putting this nice shotgun up for trade as my interests have changed and due to work and family commitments i no longer get time to hunt and have very little interest in shooting sporting clays anymore so i would like to trade it for a firearms or firearms that more suit my interests.

The Bad; Really nothing to put here. 1 or 2 nicks on the fore end from, what I'm assuming is other guns in the safe. The last 2 or so inches of finish on the stock are a little lighter from a rubber butt pad that was on when I got it. When I mean a little, I mean like a shade or 2. It's barley noticeable."

The Ballester-Molina pistol, originally known as Ballester-Rigaud (so marked during first years of manufacture, circa 1938 to 1940), were made in Argentine by Hispano Argentina de Automotives SA (HAFDASA) company. Manufacture started in 1938 in attempt to provide Argentinean police and military with less expensive alternative to the Colt modelo 1927 pistol, domestically made licensed copy of the American Colt M1911A1 pistol. Production of the Ballester-Molina ceased in the early 1950s. While Ballester-Molina pistol is externally very similar to Colt, it has significant differences, especially in the safety and trigger unit arrangements. Actually, the only parts exchangeable between Ballester-Molina and M1911A1 are the barrel with link and the magazine. The trigger and safety arrangements were more or less copied from the Spanish Star pistols, with the pivoting trigger, single trigger to sear link, and no grip safety. Ballester-Molina pistols were used by Argentinean military and police, as well as supplied to the Britain during Second World war. Britain issued these pistols to their Special Operations Executives agents, which usually operated behind enemy lines.



The Ballester-Molina pistol is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. the locking system is similar to that of Colt M1911A1, with the swinging link used to unlock the barrel from the slide. The single action trigger is pivoted on the axis, the frame-mounted manual safety locks the slide and the hammer."

The Swedish government purchased additional guns with the specified modifications for a total of 10,000 guns. The Swedish government purchased a manufacturing license from FN for the manufacture of the 1903 model either during or after World War I. The Husqvarna company started production in 1917.

Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory (formerly known as Fegyver es Gazkeszuelekgyara NV). The P9R uses the modified P9 frame and action, but the classic FN GP-35 Single Action trigger system is replaced with Smith&Wesson-style Double Action system. The P9R-series pistols are now available in two basic forms, the full-size P9R and short-barreled P9RK. Over the time, FEG also produced a lightweight, aluminum-framed version of the P9R, called the P9RA, which apparently is no longer made. There is also a .45 caliber derivative of P9RK, which also have a single-stack magazine that holds only 8 rounds. The .45ACP version is designated as FEG ACK (export models of ACK were sometimes marked as GKK-45). In Europe the FEG P9R was also known as the Mauser 90DA, as it was imported and distributed through the famous German Mauser organization.
Makes for a great shooter to the Browning Hi Power Fans for quite a lower price.

Has been in the safe for years and shows little if any signs of wear.

Comes with Box and one 15 round magazine


The P9R is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and usually have blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a decocker when safety is engaged. The P9RK pistol differs from basic P9R by having a shorter barrel and slide, as well as finger grooves on the grip. The .45 caliber ACK pistol is slightly thinner, as it has a single stack magazine for rounds, instead of the double stack magazine for 14 rounds in P9R pistols. On all P9R series pistols the front sight is permanently fixed to the slide, while rear sight is dovetailed.

Great Duty Gun in 40 with 2 12 round magazines, tactical rale, polymer frame and steel slide.

Still in orginal box, with manual, lock and all paperwork.

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.


Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year.

Here is a review on the rifle. Serious inquiries only. Not interested in firearm trades.
What is this unheard of rifle? It was a far-from-popular assault rifle that was sold for a couple of years (in pistol grip form) in the early to mid-1980s in the United States. The AR-100 is the civilian version (semi-automatic) of the South Korean Daewoo K2 rifle. The K2 was designed after the Vietnam War. The South Koreans observed the main assault rifles being used in the conflict; the AK-47 and M16. They decided the 5.56x45mm used by the M16 was a good round as it was accurate and lightweight, but the AK had the best reliability and was easy to maintain. A few chalkboards later and you've got a rifle with barrels being made by Colt, an AR-15-like lower-receiver (no parts interchangeable), a piston return system like an AK-47, and a gas valve adjuster like an FN FAL. In short, you have a super-reliable rifle using the accurate 5.56x45mm round in Colt barrels; the accuracy of the M16 with the durability of an AK-47. Due to their construction, these rifles accept some M16 accessories. In my honest opinion, this is probably the best semi-automatic rifle I've handled. The accuracy is excellent, it's very reliable (manufactured before 1987 with zero malfunctions to this day), and the take-down is also pretty easy. If you're looking to get a new assault rifle and have about $1,300.00 you want to spend (the only real downside of the rifle; price), the Daewoo K2/AR-100 is, in my opinion, the best way to go. Though they won't match an AR-15 in how must customization can be done, quad-rails and many other useful accessories do exist for the Daewoo. I must mention, however, that the purple-tinted rail you see in the photographs above is an aftermarket product from the 1980s. If you're wanting a rifle that will perform very well in even stock formation, though, the Daewoo is a great way to go.

I bought it as a guilt free shooter and have very much enjoyed it.

You can do the same and just enjoy the single most successful 22 rifle of all time, or it is certainly a very worthwhile rifle to have professionally blued and brought back to perfect new condition.

This rifle and period correct scope would typically be priced in the $600-$750 range. I'm pricing it at $450 and it is a beautiful rifle, but that leaves room to have the bluing professionally done if you so choose.

$450 cash only and can meet off I-65 between Sellersburg & Jeffersonville in Indiana. Thank you."

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

 SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

 This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol.

 Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" -- 1.2"" in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

 Features
 - Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
 - ATF compliant*
 - Veteran designed
 - Made in USA
 - Quick and easy to install

 * ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control."

If you ant hole in hole accuracy at the range or want to blind zombies with only 2 shots (assuming both eyes are still in tact ) this is for you ! a question i was taught is if everyone goes for 16 inch battle rifle with the range around 400 to 600 yds  why not get a 20 inch precision rifle eliminate them at 1,200 yards and get their rifle, plus save ammo ? (shft scenario) . 

Adcor defense complete lower with Red X stainless 1/8 twist barrel so you can shoot all your loads with match grade accuracy ! trigger is super sweet  match grade , with adjustable  standard AR rifleman stock . Rifle is perfect looking for cash preferably but will trade . please do research both of these manufactures are considered ay better than other cheapy brands but you get it at a cheapy cost"
