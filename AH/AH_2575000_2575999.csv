It’s a blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm. Its operating spring is located within the tubular stock. The receiver is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. The front end houses a hinge block holding the barrel and the rear site. This block is securely locked in place by a swiveling trigger guard. The receiver rigidly attaches to the stock by multiple lugs. The bottom of the receiver forms the pistol grip, accepting GLOCK MAGS. The receiver also houses the firing mechanism.

The 4130 ordinance steel barrel has a spring loaded collar to ensure an accurate lock between the receiver and the polymer forend. The tubular steel stock contains the bolt and is terminated by the polymer butt stock. The heavy duty two-piece steel bolt holds the firing pin, the extractor and has the operating handle on the bottom. A captive guide recoil spring with buffer actuates the bolt.

The firing mechanism is a conventional single action. It has a positive disconnector: a push bolt safety that blocks the sear and disengages the trigger bar. The hardened steel ejector is internal. This design, with its long bolt travel, allows for smooth and simple operation and enhanced reliability.

The carbine’s main distinguishing characteristic: it folds in half. It’s an enormous advantage over other handgun-chambered carbines. In terms of storage, the Sub2K-40 doesn't require a full-size gun case or gun safe. It’ll tuck away within easy reach for HD owners. You never knew how bulky your rifles were to transport until you put a Sub2K in your car’s trunk. Concealable.....you betcha.

The weapon breaks apart and pivots at the center-line. To fold, you pull downwards on the trigger guard and swing the barrel assembly back over the top of the carbine. A latch in the buttstock secures to the front sight housing. For added safety, you can lock the gun in the folded position. The Sub2K cannot be fired when folded.

The 40-cal version of the Sub2K is an even more potent carbine, sending a 180-gr projectile downrange at over 1,200 fps. That gives the 40-cal Sub2K a huge knockdown punch, approaching .41-magnum ballistics. It's capable of taking medium size game. With that 16.1-inch barrel and extended sight radius, most shooters can continue to pour rounds accurately into whatever target they are aiming at time after time at distances ranging from five-to-50 yards with minimal practice."

You can unscrew the ones you want to direct the muzzle blast how you want with the included hex wrench. This would be perfect for competition, target or tactical shooting.

I put 100 rounds through the gun and it fired flawlessly. have not tested hollow points or reloads. I was told it functions best with full metal jacketed rounds. I have decided to see what trades i am offered and possibly get a handgun that is a bit more powerful. these model Ds where used by french military and law enforcement as well as in other countries and honestly it is the most accurate .32 i have shot with the highest muzzle velocity also. The gun does have some finish loss from age but is still 80% blue. zero rust or pitting and the bore is mirror bright with sharp riffling. These pistols served numerous countries for years after ww2 and are known for reliability and durability, comes with 33 rounds of full metal jacketed ammo (only if you also include ammo in trade) These pistols go for over $400 on gunbroker and similar websites. has century arms import markings under left grip. might be interested in a very lightly used hi point handgun and a decently large amount of ammo. also may take a few lower quality semi auto handguns (bryco, jiminez, lorcin, cobra) as a straight trade but only if the trade is for multiple pistols.

Vertical grip with quick-deploy bipod legs is an economical alternative for applications where the original GPS-02 Grip Pod’s function and benefits are desired, but the steel reinforcements in its legs are excess to requirements. The GPS-LE (Law Enforcement) locks to the bottom accessory rail of your tactical rifle’s forend, just like the GPS-02, to provide the same enhanced control during CQB and a stable bipod rest for precise long-range fire. The grip’s hand-filling contours and deep grooves provide a solid purchase even when your hands are wet. Hit the large, deeply grooved release button, and a powerful spring deploys the legs instantly. Conveniently placed for thumb activation, the button sits flush with the surrounding surface to prevent accidental deployment. Extended legs provide sufficient elevation for a standard 30-round magazine to clear the ground, and will not snag on brush, vehicle interior, or other gear when retracted. Legs and grip are made of tough, injection-molded polymer; steel cross-bolt with easy-grip thumbscrew locks directly to any MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail to ensure a rock-solid fit. Accepts GPRS1 and GPRS2 bolt-on accessory rails, available separately. May be used on many non-AR rifles and light machine guns with forend accessory rails."

I bought it with the intention of using it for hunting but I just haven't had the chance to go and probably won't in the foreseeable future. I hate to see it go as it is a beautiful rifle but I want a new handgun so that's why I am selling this. I'm asking $750 but I am open to negotiation."

It is a two piece drop in installation rail that is extremely light weight, durable, and looks great on any AR. These are very slim and comfortable rails, with an uninterrupted top rail. When I got this one it must have either been a factory blemish or clone because the shade of black was slightly different between the top and lower halves so I had the whole rail Cerakoted in graphite black, so it now has the best finish available and matches any AR. It is in great shape and all the installation screws are included. Normally you will find these rails for between $250 and $300  but I will accept any reasonable offer.

The Kel Tec P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge.  The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.

But often the first responder to an active shooter is the civilian that happened to be at the right place at the right time - with the will and skill to defend their fellow man.

You chose to activate your right to carry your weapon concealed for a reason... that reason is to potentially protect the lives of your family, others you know and yourself against a violent attack.  But going to a CCW class just teaches you the law of what you can and can't do -- it doesn't teach you HOW TO RESPOND...

With this DVD instruction class, you can learn tactics and techniques designed by highly experienced professional operators to effectively and quickly respond to an active shooter situation - as a legally armed citizen... the first and fastest line of defense against these critical crimes.

Being able to respond sooner to an active shooter can save lives. In this video Paul Howe will prepare you for that. 

Paul is a high-risk training instructor that served 20 years in the US Army, ten of those in Special Operations. He served as a Tactical Team Leader and Senior Instructor while assigned to Army Special Operations. During his tour in special operations he was involved in several combat actions. One of the most notable was the battle of Mogadishu that was later portrayed in the motion picture Black Hawk Down. 

In this video, Paul takes you step-by-step through the mindset of an active shooter situation. He reviews gear you need like bags, holsters, and lights. The best choices for a weapon platform and medical supplies. Then Paul takes you through exterior contact, room CQB, hallways, hallway intersections, linking up with others, shooting through glass, and more. 

Unfortunately, an active shooter event is a fact of life now... but you can be prepared to take that event (should it ever happen to you) and stop the violence before scores of your friends, family, co-workers or other citizens are killed or wounded.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models."

Truly hate to part with this gun – not only looks great, shoots great  - but also a Colt collectors piece. I  am looking to finance a custom pistol – so I need to part ways.

If you clicked on this from the title then you have a little knowledge about what your looking at. Serial number puts this shotgun in the first 10,000

More than just trading/selling this shotgun away. I am looking to find someone that will take care of it. Being such a low serial number I would like whoever gets it to really want it and see that it is passed on.

There is no rust on this shotgun but the bluing is very poor. Bore is clean and the bolt functions very strongly. The wood is solid but rough. I don't know what you will see in the pictures but I wanted a good description for those interested.

I will accept a good cash offer. But I am mostly looking to trade for something. If your giving up something it gives me more confidence it will be cared for.

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
High Capacity Magazine

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.
Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Designed specifically to exploit the full potential of the powerful 44 Magnum cartridge, its advanced design delivers reliable performance for big-game hunters. Packed with all of the features of the New Model Blackhawk, these revolvers boast the power of 44 Magnum chambering, yet accept the lower-recoiling 44 Special. They feature a ramp front sight and adjustable rear sight and a traditional Western style grip with smooth hardwood grips. Factor in the Ruger reliability and they are a great value.

This pistol ships in a hard case.

It is about as close to new as you will find in a 1976 rifle of any kind.  The only time I have shot it is to sight it in and make sure that everything functions fine.  It does.  It is very accurate and is super fun to shoot.  It has about 3 very minor imperfections in the stock from handling over the years, but none much larger than a BB.  It shoots 5.56 NATO.  I have the original manual, box, 1-20 round mag and the original GI style web sling.

It would make a great hunting rifle, self-defense rifle or just a fun rifle at the range.  The only reason that I am selling it is that I want to buy a later model Mini-14 to customize.  I don't want to customize this rifle, because I think it is somewhat of a collectable.

I would consider a trade for a later model Mini-14.

You can call me to discuss at 205-6one3-1981.  Please... only contact me if you are serious about the rifle.  If this ad is up it is still for sale.  I will take down the ad when it sells, so don't email me and ask if it is still for sale.  Thanks for your interest and your consideration."

But after it arrived she decided against the sub compact version so I never took ownership. Seeing how I never took ownership a background check will need to be run before it can be released from my dealer. The price of $590.00 includes all the fees and is out pricing the door price. This is a great concealed carry firearm that comes with the complete kit of holster, mag carrier and a total of 3 magazines.   Thanks for looking!"

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

Yes , it has a 6 pos. Buffer tube. No it is not illegal. This does mean that you must not have a extra buttstock unless you also have a 16"" upper with it. I know there is a lot of misinformation on the web , just go to the ATFs website and get the facts. A pistol can become a rifle/carbine (16"" min.length) with a butstock , then go back to a pistol. Its no different than the Thompson Contender. This is the whole beauty in having a pistol ! Because a rifle can not become a pistol , its just a SBR and is class 3.

6-shot / .38Spl /  Blue /  98%+ condition / no box

A classic Colt ""Snake"" gun not made since the mid-80's. 

The Colt Diamondback snubby is a surprisingly compact revolver.  It's a beautiful combination
of all-steel manufacture and a full six-shot capacity. It's a carry gun without peer. Colt gave this
one compellingly beautiful lines – and especially so in its snub-nose variant.

Whether you'll put this one into action, or just sit back and just let it rise in value, this one will not
disappoint.  We probably won’t see these levels of quality (and beauty) from Colt ever again.

Will follow all F.O.I.D. rules.

I've had it a little over 2 years, only put about 40 rounds through it total. It's been well taken care of. I don't shoot as well as some people but I was able to get fairly consistent sub-MOA groups out of this gun with match ammo. It likes the heavier (175-180gr) ammo. I bought the rifle new and have taken good care of it. Everything is like new condition.

Firm on $1100 for the package, but I'll shave off $320 if you don't want the scope, $150 if you don't want the ammo, and $20 if you don't want the sling. That's $610 for the gun, DNZ rings/mount, and cheek piece, if that's all you want.


EDIT: The site will only let me upload 3 pictures, and made them all low quality. I took several more better quality ones. I can email them upon request, or I can meet you anywhere between Ozark and Branson if you'd like to see the gun in person. Must see to appreciate."
