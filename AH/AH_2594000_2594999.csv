I have shot around 200 rounds through it. It is a great shooter, very accurate and small enough to be used for as a CCW weapon. The person I bought it from installed a full length spring guide. I think the gun is in good condition. It has been carried, but not abused.

Thanks for looking.
Please, Face to Face only.

Summary: I made this gun around 1979-80 from a Thompson Center Kit. 

Thompson Center Hawken 50 Cal Rifle

This Thompson Center .50 caliber Hawken muzzleloading rifle is in excellent condition. The bore is excellent. The brass hardware has a nice patina finish, that if desired, could easily be returned to a bright finish. Thompson Center produced this high quality rifle for several decades until 2012, with a MSRP of $869.99l. This Hawken is dead accurate and has taken three deer, each with an instant kill shop ranging from about 25 yds out to over 80 yrds. With the set trigger it is capable of hitting a coffee can every time from 200 yds but I have never shot at game I didn't know was a dead shot with it. I haven't hunted or shot the rifle since the mid-80's.

MSRP of $789-$869.
Specifications:
BARREL: Length 28"", octagon, polished and blued. 15/16"" across the flats. 
BREECH: Hooked breech system.
LOCK: Internal springs are heavy duty coil type.
TRIGGERS: Fully adjustable for a light, crisp pull. Triggers function either as double set or single stage.
SIGHTS: Fully adjustable open hunting style rear sights with bead front sight.
TRIM: Solid brass trigger guard, patch box, butt plate and forend cap.
STOCK: Select American Walnut. Tastefully contoured cheek piece on left hand side.
WEIGHT: Approximately 8-1/2 pounds.

The endurance package was created in response to silhouette shooters who were using heavy bullets loaded as fast as possible. S&W simply beefed up these revolvers to last a lot longer and to be able to take more of a beating. It entails as follows: strengthened hand & bolt, strengthened retention system on the yoke/cylinder crane, hardened yoke and frame, radius-ed internal studs, and elongated bolt cuts on the cylinder.

‚ÄúI am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.‚Äù

Lori B.  (Full last name omitted by Foremost Defensive Solutions, LLC for this persons protection of privacy) 



‚ÄúI have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class.  The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough.  His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole.  His own experience as an officer was tremendous.  Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part.  I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake.  I highly recommend the training he provides.

Thank you again for the class.‚Äù

I want a 9mm so I can shoot more.  This gun is great and a work horse (fan boys Sig makes an amazing gun, hence secret service, Coast Guard, Navy,and my old firm choosing Sig).  I will entertain other 9mm for trade, but will need more than just a gun (lights, holster, or ammo is what I mean).  I would perfer another Sig in 9mm, but don't want to limit myself.  Or you can buy it flat out.  3 mags are x1 12rnds and x2 10rns (fucking CA laws!).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  This gun made me a believer in .40 (have owned glock 23 and XDM .40 and hated them both); the design makes it feel like a 9mm just not with the 9mm cost lol.

The endurance package was created in response to silhouette shooters who were using heavy bullets loaded as fast as possible. S&W simply beefed up these revolvers to last a lot longer and to be able to take more of a beating.

By no means I am in no hurry to sell it.  I just don't use these rifles very much and looking to see if someone could make better use of it.  The price is already a very fair price for this outfit and am not looking to come down on the price.

So here is what you get.

3 hex receiver mosin nagants (one has a REAL scope set up which attaches to the rear sight base, so there is no permanent modification done.  Not the scout mount stuff).  The scope is a Bushnell 3x9 40mm. I got all three rifles at Gander mountain.

1 unopened can of surplus ammo (440 rounds).

11 paper wrapped surplus ammo from a spam can (220 rounds).

9 boxes of commercial non -corrosive ammo (180 rounds).

3 sets of cleaning kit & tools.

Not pictured, but 3 bayonets.

All three rifles shoot pretty well and are in typical retail store condition.

The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. 

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you‚Äôve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC‚Äôs first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1‚Äù overall length and an 18.5‚Äù cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3‚Äù rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The Taurus PT 845 is derived from the Taurus OSS pistol, which Taurus designed for the U.S. Armed Forces. The PT 845 adds an external hammer and is now ready with Strike Two capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the Taurus PT 845 senses this and automatically gives you instant Strike Two capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the PT 845 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

NO TRADES at this time.

Cash in person, must have CPL & be ready to fill out transfer paperwork, that means I will need to take a look at your CPL & driver lic. No Exceptions!"

It has  3 13-round magazines. 2 of the 3 magazines are still in the packaging never used. Mine came with 2-10 round mags. I didn't know at the time they also come with 13 round mags. Before I ever shot it I sold the 10 rounders and bought 3- 13 rounders and I only used one of the magazines. the holster is leather treated and still in the original packaging as well. $750 for everything or $650 for just the gun with two magazines, the way it comes new.

I started by ordering a COLT lower receiver and upper receiver

Then I had the Colt upper sent out and the MK12 built into the COLT.

Here is a list of what it took:
-Premium air-gauged ‚Äúcontract‚Äù stainless barrel 1/7 twist; contoured and chambered by the same individual that does the work for Crane.
-Crane style low profile gas block
-M4 extended feed ramps
-Rifle length gas tube
-Auto bolt carrier and MPI inspected bolt
-PRI gas buster charging handle
-Ops Inc. muzzle brake and collar
-KAC free float long RAS hand guard
-Come with an Operator‚Äôs Manual too

This rifle is built to shoot 77gr Black Hills OTM ammo and the break is set up for a Opsinc 12th model suppressor. Just buy the ""Can "" and you can throw it right on.

Since completing the build there have been absolutely 0 rds put through it. I deployed within a week of finishing it and didn't have time to even test it. This rifle is 100% brand new. Even the Colt upper and lower (6920) came off of a brand new rifle.

currently I do not have access to the rifle itself so I posted 2 pictures of the parts. 

This is how I want the deal to happen. If you decide you want to see or buy the item I will have a friend of mine (who is watching my house while I am deployed) go in to my safe and take the rifle to ""Stop, Drop and Shop Pawn on Academy."" The transfer paperwork will be done on the spot and you can leave with the rifle at that point. I have worked with this shop many times for both selling and buying firearms. 

For this reason they will only accept Cash. Or you can pay me directly through paypal online and I will have them deliver the rifle to the shop. You will be responsible for all fees at the shop. And if you choose paypal to pay it is an extra 3% since that is what they charge me. If you choose paypal you can use a CC!!

Any questions please feel free to ask via email and I will respond as accurately as I can to save you time and money.


-Side Note: for an extra fee of $600 I can switch out the lower receiver for a restricted LEO stamped lower if you would prefer. I know they are in high demand and becomming harder to find as we speak. ""Restricted Military Government Law Enforement Export Use Only"""

Minimal Signs of Age or Wear. Includes optional 5lb mainspring.

It was the first polymer-framed pistol and predates the Glock 17 by 12 years. The weapon weighed 820 g (28.9 oz) unloaded, lighter than most other metal framed pistols of the time. 

One unique feature of this weapon involved the combination stock/holster for the martial version of the VP70. The stock incorporates a selector switch that, when mounted, allows selective fire. Cyclic rate of fire for the three-round burst is 2200 rounds per minute. When not mounted, the stock acts as a holster. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post."

I purchased a box of .32 ACP or 7.65mm as printed on the gun and test fired it for what must have been its first shot in approx. 65 yrs.

This shotgun has a choke in each barrel one is labeled III (3)and the other labeled IIII (4). Any dad would be happy to pass this gun down to his son.  The website labels this as AA grade walnut stock.  This shotgun is designed to look like the real expensive custom shotguns you have to order from England for thousands of dollars at a fraction of the price. I'm not interested in hunting small game or shooting skeet but I am currently more interested in a long range rifle (.308) or perhaps a pistol or even tactical shotgun, just let me know if you want trade and how much you'd expect either way. The highest I could find this gun for on gunbroker was $479 plus tax at time ad was written, this gun isn't NIB so that's why I'm only asking $350 but I would hear out other offers and trades. Of course, buying through a private seller excludes YOU the buyer from paying state and federal tax, and who wants to pay those guys. Buying from me also means we don't have to alert the federal government to who owns what gun and this could prove to be more positive than anyone knows down the line.

The 16.5"" overall length, 6.5"" barrel and spring-locked foregrip, which pivots out of the way when not in use, make for a very compact package. As far as we know, this is the shortest 12-gauge pump shotgun available. All parts for the SUPER-SHORTY are made in-house on our own CNC machinery using materials ideally suited to the task. All welds are done by the TIG process, and the manganese phosphate finish is MIL-spec. The SUPER-SHORTY is currently being used by various law enforcement agencies and military units worldwide. If you like the idea of concealed carry with a 12-gauge, or like a lot of ""bang"" in a small package, or just want the most compact breaching weapon available, then this is the gun for you. You won't find a better made AOW pump shotgun than the SUPER-SHORTY! ~ looking to sell or trade otherwise make a cash offer, must show CPL and License and also fill out a bill of sale.

Shoot More, Pay Less With .22 LR Ammo For Practice

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.
