This is a very nice shotgun!  The American Rifleman reviewer in Feb 2012 said ""There are shotguns you like and then there are shotguns you can’t put down, guns that make you want to take to the fields and the hills and wherever birds fly. Price has surprisingly little to do with this reaction. When someone comes up with a classic—the Model 12, the Superposed, the 101—sometimes it costs a lot and sometimes it doesn’t, but the feeling is there from the first time you hold it. When Franchi sent me a prototype Instinct SL a few days before we left for the gun’s inaugural field test in Kenya, I pulled the gun out of the box, raised an eyebrow at the fine walnut stock, tried a few practice swings and found myself wandering around the house 20 minutes later with the gun still in my hands. This is not my normal reaction to new shotguns.""  Item G-35936-1.

It is a very powerful weight/caliber handgun. Probably the smallest/lightest .40 out here.  Because of it's size, it is an outstanding CCW.  

The P40 is no longer manufactured and is slowly becoming a hard gun to find. I have not had a problem with the rounds I have put through it (approx100) and it feeds the Golden Sabers and Hydrashocks just fine. On the range I use the Ga. Arms reloads and they work great.

Smith and Wesson 6900 series magazines work as well as long as they are factory mags.

I shot in the high 90's last qualification that I went through with it . Would of been higher but have left shoulder problem and I had to shoot 5 rounds weak hand only and threw one out.

If your scared of recoil you should not get this gun. Get a 9mm or smaller. As a lot of DAO pistols do, it has  a long trigger pull.  I like this feature myself as a CCW safety. Trust me , if your in a SHTF situation, that trigger pull will be insignificant.

This should be considered a CCW / personal protection weapon and not as a range gun.  Even though I group pretty good at 10 yards, I know that if I need to use this gun it's going to be closer to 10 feet or less and this is perfect for the P40.

It comes with 2 extra magazines and a Fobus holster.  This is a steal at this price."

Vet- Made is owned and operated by Veterans in a small town outside of Nashville Tennessee. Vet-made ammunition was initially started to create jobs for local Veterans in need of work, but progressed into a major local manufacturer after quickly building a reputation in the firearms community as a reliable source for ammunition.  Each round is hand inspected before packaging to ensure every box of every case contains nothing but the highest quality of ammunition.     

Take part in supporting these Veterans by purchasing their quality ammo. The price may not always be the lowest out there, but quality is an endless price tag and your supporting a Veteran owned company thus supporting Veterans and this country.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
I have one Woodland Camouflage Point Blank vest included with the 2 Armor plates for our ""Mil-Spec 46100"" for $200 the size is Medium.

I have only one Multicam Front/Back/Side Carrier manufactured by
""Tactical Tailor"" for sale the complete set plate carrier including the plates would be $300

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I use it as my carry pistol but I am going to upgrade to the 9mm version Sig has. The size of this 238 makes it an ideal carry pistol whether it is inside the pants at the small of your back or even in a purse or pocket, it is a great size.

Pre Note: the price listed is for the whole set - plate carrier, soft armor and plates.
OR you can buy just the carrier with soft armor for list price minus cost of plates, which is about $300 for a set of 2 plates.
     This means you can pick up the carrier with soft armor for $300.

Manufacturer: KDH Defense Systems Inc.
Model: IOTV III - Improved Outer Tactical Vest (Gen. III) [This newest version replacing the older Interceptor type body armor.]
Size: Medium Long [I am 6 feet tall and 175 lbs. and it fits me perfectly with plenty of adjustment room if I weighed more or even less which is great since I am somewhat skinny torsoed anyways.]
     -Note: The 2 Plate sizes are also medium.

Armor type: Level 4 stand alone strike plates front and back/rated to take a armor piercing .308 caliber round - Level 3A soft armors front and back.

Camo: Woodland Camo (See Pictures) [I like this camo the best here in Tennessee.][Also note they only make this in Universal camo and Woodland camo]
Date of Manufacture: 11 / 2012 [Good year...I like newer manufacture dates since less of a chance for anything to happen over time.]
Features that are noteworthy: Rip cord designed to be a quick detach system. for use while plate carrier is on your body, pull cord and the plate carrier will slide off you front to back and side to side. Very cool feature in my opinion.
Comes with: Plate carrier, side plate pouches, 2 soft armor front/back, 2 plate armor front/back. Basically everything for waist and up (no crotch carrier or leg carrier).

Details:
Barely used - No rips or tears."

Vet- Made is owned and operated by Veterans in a small town outside of Nashville Tennessee. Vet-made ammunition was initially started to create jobs for local Veterans in need of work, but progressed into a major local manufacturer after quickly building a reputation in the firearms community as a reliable source for ammunition. Each round is hand inspected before packaging to ensure every box of every case contains nothing but the highest quality of ammunition.

Take part in supporting these Veterans by purchasing their quality ammo. The price may not always be the lowest out there, but quality is an endless price tag and your supporting a Veteran owned company thus supporting Veterans and this country.

Vet- Made is owned and operated by Veterans in a small town outside of Nashville Tennessee. Vet-made ammunition was initially started to create jobs for local Veterans in need of work, but progressed into a major local manufacturer after quickly building a reputation in the firearms community as a reliable source for ammunition. Each round is hand inspected before packaging to ensure every box of every case contains nothing but the highest quality of ammunition.

Take part in supporting these Veterans by purchasing their quality ammo. The price may not always be the lowest out there, but quality is an endless price tag and your supporting a Veteran owned company thus supporting Veterans and this country.

This gun factory WAS ALL Black (besides the hammer)Everything Shiny you see, I did. I've completely disassembled this gun, De-Blued the Slide, Trigger, Safety's, Barrel, magazine release, beavertail, and lower the part of rear grip. Cleaned and sanded every part with up too 1500 grit. (Which is so NOT Fun!) Then I Polished the crap out of every part. Lol. All in all I probably have like 30+ hours in this gun. This gun isn't a perfect 10 but id say its a solid 7-8. I am not a gunsmith, but it sure is pretty and works like a charm!

I recently bought a new red dot green dot scope with several adjustment and put on it so i havent sighted it in yet but with irons at 75 yards is very accurate. For a brush gun, four wheeler gun, or truck gun this is really hard to beat and obviously with the 9mm recoil it is very soft shooting and easy for follow up shots. $300 is bottom dollar"

Thirdly, don't send me an email if your email address is something shady like 420Gangster or Stoner-something, I won't respond. 
Lastly, all sales go through an FFL. 

This rifle started life as a Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC. I still have the original box, papers, and stock (no stock screws though). I then threw an Accuracy International AICS chasis on it, Griffin muzzle brake, and a Blackhawk 20 MOA rail. I finally added a Whidden Gun Works rear monopod into the buttplate and a Caldwell bipod. Between the heavy AICS chasis and the Griffin brake, I can easily call my own shots, no spotter necessary.

A little background on some of the components:

The Remington 700 AAC SPS Tactical uses a 1:10 twist heavy barrel at 20'' threaded. According to a TTAG article, this rifle was used as their ""affordable 1,000 yard gun"", not sure about that as the 20'' is short. The farthest I've shot it out to is 700 yards. The AICS speaks for itself, it is a fantastic chassis and adds quite a bit of weight for benchrest and uses the best mags out there. There are some slight scratches on the stock, please consult the pictures.

The Griffin muzzle brake is a lot like a Battlecomp or a KAC Triple Tap. Extremely effective and no annoying blast to the sides. They went with holes instead of slots though. One huge benefit versus the Battlecomp is hardness, the Griffin is significantly harder.

Blackhawk 20 MOA scope rail will ""add"" elevation adjustment to your scope for longer range shooting. Caldwell bipod has held up to the recoil of lots of .308. I don't care much for the monopod honestly, so I don't use it much.

Discounts: Will subtract $20 to keep the bipod. Will subtract $50 to keep the mag."

Item # FTK-PB (Original)

Fort Knox has designed this pistol box with strength and reliability in mind. They placed the heavy duty tamper-resistant hinge under the door to protect it from attack. A gas strut makes it easy to lift the heavy door, and then holds it open for easy access. The Simplex push-button mechanical lock is fast and easy to use, and that's where user sets his combination (there are 1,081 possible combinations). Pre-drilled holes in the bottom of the case make it super easy to bolt down onto a solid surface to prevent the box from being carried away.

This pistol safe has an antique silver powder coat finish that is just as durable as it is attractive. The interior of the box is lined with ""egg crate"" style foam to protect the interior contents. Depending on the size of your guns, you could store two or more handguns in this safe.

Just like their full-sized gun safes, this pistol box is high quality and carries the same lifetime warranty from Fort Knox. PB4
Features:

    10 gauge steel uni-body construction with a massive 3/16"" tamper-resistant wraparound door
    Gas-strut-assisted heavyweight door

    Dimensions: 4-1/4""h x 12-1/2""w x 10-3/8""d

NOTICE: Fort Knox has recently changed the manufacturer of the lock on this pistol box. It still works the exact same as the original that you will see in photos all over the internet. This new design is evident in the shape of the knob and buttons. Again, it works exactly the same way as the original look. The original look is being phased out and all ""brand new"" Fort Knox Pistol pistol boxes will incorporate this new lock design. You will receive one or the other (based on stock) as we have the older original locks as well as the new. We guarantee that this is an ORIGINAL and NOT a Knock off. Please feel free to contact Fort Knox to confirm. We offer only the best and that is what you will get. Price does not include Tax if you are a resident of OK or $25 shipping to anywhere in the continental United States."

The Sword of Veracity is a weapon of immense power. Created by Hestia, the sword forces anyone in its presence to speak only the truth. Seeking the sword's power for his fight against evil, Hercules sought help from his patron, Athena. The goddess approved of Hercules' goal and agreed to help him find the sword. She led him to the Hill of One Hundred Caves, but the caves were guarded by a minotaur sent by Hera. Determined to obtain the sword, Hercules fought the minotaur. After a terrible battle Hercules defeated the monster and with Athena's help found Hestia's shrine. On the shrine, hidden among one hundred other swords was the Sword of Veracity.

This is an AK-74 clone, made in Russia at the Izhmash plant out of all milled parts. Imported by FIME Group in Las Vegas; has the requisite six US-made parts to make it legal. This rifle has an original Russian barrel! (The US TAPCO barrels are less than desirable). It has a Soviet scope mount on the left side and a fully folding stock. Standard AK sights; polymer handguards. 

I purchased this rifle brand new six months ago and have only put 400 rounds through it. I am selling it very reluctantly; I am having financial difficulties and must get rid of some things that I love dearly.

The rifle will come with all of my 5.45mm ammo; one sealed crate of 2,160 rounds, another spam can of 1,080 rounds, and a fifty cal can with about 800 rounds. All but 300 rounds is mil surplus 7N6 53-grain FMJ; the 300 rounds portion is WPA 60-grain FMJ (I had that for my SHTF ammo). Also comes with 7 original Bulgarian 30-round mags, and a plastic rifle case.

Between the rifle, mags, and ammo, I have about two grand tied up in it; I'm looking for $1500. With the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, no one knows the status of future firearm imports.

I will only sell in person, and am willing to drive two hours. This puts me in Kansas City, Mountain Grove, Nevada, Columbia, and anywhere in that circle.

Any questions, just email me. Thanks for looking."
