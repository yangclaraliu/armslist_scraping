The ATF wasnt sure on what to do with them so they added a 7 before and after the 56s and tack welded a thread protector on the muzzle. It still has the cleaning rod and is a squared back receiver. These are pretty rare rifles as the only ones in this configuration were in port during the 1989 import ban on assault rifles. I have owned many AKMs and place the Chinese as top quality as they come with chrome lined barrels and are incredibly reliable. This would make a great SHTF weapon.

A True Collectors piece. This rifle is in EXTREMELY good condition! 
     Model 1863 Rifle manufactured by the Remington Arms Co. in 1863. The Model 1863 Contract Rifle was an improved version of the U.S. Model 1855 Percussion Rifle and was referred to by the Ordnance Department as the ""Harpers Ferry Pattern Rifle"". The Model 1863 Rifle was the last percussion rifle adopted by the Ordnance Department and is generally considered to be the best designed and highest quality percussion military longarm. The rifle has a heavy 33 inch round barrel with a lug for a sword bayonet on the right side, a dovetail mounted wide base front sight and a folding leaf rear sight graduated 500, 300 and 100 yards. The rifle is fitted with a steel straight shank tulip head ramrod.
     The side lock plate retains almost all its original luster and is patina'd out around the hammer. Manufactured circa 1862 - 1865. The lock is dated 1863 behind the hammer, has the eagle/shield over ""U.S."" and ""REMINGTON'S / ILION, N.Y."" in front of the hammer and there is a Sub-Inspectors ""L"" stamped at the front. The top of the barrel at the breech is dated ""1863"" followed by ""US"" over the ""V/ P"" proofs with the eagle head proof just to the left. The left barrel flat near the breech is stamped STEEL and the inspector's initials H.S.L. The initials are that of of Homer S. Lathe who worked as an armory sub- inspector, inspecting the barrels of Remington M-1863 rifles.  The barrel is blue, casehardened lock and hammer with all brass mountings. Mounted with a full one-piece straight grip walnut stock with a brass carbine style buttplate and patch box. The patch box is stamped with a ""L"" and the buttplate tang is stamped with ""US"" and an ""J"". The left stock flat is marked with crisp cartouches. Script initials ""HDJ"" (Henry D. Jennings) a Springfield Armory inspector who inspected Remington  M-1863 rifles in a rectangle, and the lower mark has the initials ""BH"" (Benjamin Hannis) who inspected revolvers as well as Remington rifles, with a rectangular border. The patch box contains an extra percussion nipple. The brass barrel rings are each stamped, one is stamped ""P"" and the other ""U"". This Rifle appears unissued and unfired.

IF anyone buys it Monday or Tuesday, I'll add a nice practice target and SIX brand new tri-blade arrowheads (Grizzly Broadhead Triple-blades 125 gr.). That's an extra $70 of stuff from Academy I bought myself after my son got the bow for Christmas. I don't know the brand of the bow, it was a gift and I see no label. It's in MINT condition and used once and only once. It was too powerful for my teen son so I'm going to replace it with something else. 

You get the camo crossbow + red laser + scope (scope & laser aren't even mounted yet) + (approx 10) arrows with default heads + target ($45) + arrowheads ($25). I'm dropping the price from 195 to 150 AND adding another $70 worth of stuff...but ONLY if it's bought by Tuesday at the latest.

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

Magpul single or double point, quick detach sling (not shown)

Comes with the factory 30-round aluminum GI mag and one  30-round Magpul PMAG and original hard case and manual.  I will also throw in about 70 rounds of quality, brass-cased range ammo. 

These Windham Weaponry ARs are good to go. Mil spec, chrome-lined barrel. Mil-spec bolt and carrier. Proper aluminum for receiver, etc. Windham Weaponry is run by the same people that used to run Bushmaster before Remington Freedom Group bought them out. They reopened using the same Bushmaster plant in 2011. These are very high quality guns and get very high praise in the shooting community. Google them to your hearts content. This rifle has been super reliable and very accurate. I shot a 5"" group at 500 yards, and that is with a red dot, the mils-spec trigger and non-match ammo. 

I have about $2200 into this rifle. But I need the money to fund another project. 

My asking price is $1450. I will entertain reasonable offers. Unreasonable offers will be ignored. 

I will drive about 40 miles to meet halfway with someone, or further if you pay for my gas. Cash only. Wisconsin residents only with driver's license. You must be able to legally own a firearm or don't even contact me.

This is a Winchester Model 1886 Lightweight chambered in .45-70! This handy carbine sized weapon wears a 22"" tapered round barrel with iron sights. As was typical of the lightweight variation, it is fitted with a half-magazine and hard rubber shotgun buttplate. Overall condition is very good. The receiver is silver and was probably cleaned at some point in the past with only traces of the original blue finish in the nooks and crannies. The receiver metal is smooth and free of any pitting. The barrel retains about 90% of the original blue finish with some fading in a few spots and some scattered minor handling marks. The forend cap and magazine plug are both worn to silver. The screw heads are sharp, not buggered, but the forend cap screws are not sitting flush and may be cross-threaded. The stocks are in good shape, free of cracks, chips, or repairs. The stocks appear fo have been carefully refinished at some time in the past but were not over-sanded and wood to metal fit is still good. This 1886 is in excellent mechanical condition with a smooth, crisp action. The bore is also in very good shape, bright and showing sharp rifling with only traces of frost in the grooves. Weight is just under 7-pounds, 1-ounce. According to available serial number information, this Winchester was manufactured in about 1911. A fast handling weapon with a good measure of stopping power...this '86 compares favorably with the modern ""guide guns""!"

No cracks or repairs. Metal surfaces are free of rust or corrosion. The action is tight and works perfectly. The walnut stock and handguard are in very good condition and have small handling marks and minor blemishes in the original oil finish, as well as a crisp cartouche on the left side of the wrist. The top of the receiver is clearly marked MODEL 1898 SPRINGFIELD ARMORY. It has a 30"" barrel, a side loading 5 round box magazine, a long range folding ladder rear sight, 2 barrel bands, 3 sling swivels and a bayonet lug. The Springfield Model 1892-99 Krag-Jorgensen rifle is a Norwegian-design bolt action rifle that was adopted in 1892 as the standard United States Army military longarm, chambered in U.S. caliber .30-40 Krag. All versions and variants were manufactured under license by the Springfield Armory between 1892 and 1903. The U.S. Krag was replaced beginning in 1903 with the introduction of the M1903 Springfield rifle. The rifle is at our shop on consignment, so we are unable to consider trades. Shipping to your local FFL dealer is available for an additional charge."

The gun is in brand new condition, I have literally only shot 50 rounds of American Eagle 165gr. FMJ's through it with no problems what so-ever. Trigger and sights are extremely nice for such a small pistol.

It comes with both the 7 and 8 round magazines, full retail box (instructions, fired shell casing, lock, etc.). as well as three brand new boxes of 50, TulAmmo 180gr. FMJ's and a brand new box of 20, 155gr. Speer Gold Dot HP's.

This is a pretty sweet packaged deal get it while you can. The rifle functions great, I haven't had any problems with it. It shoots just about any standard velocity 22lr ammo even the dreaded remington golden bullets. Over $650 invested in the rifle with all of the accessories.  No scratches or dings on it, I have 2 of these rifles and decided to get rid of one and get something different. Email me with questions and offers.
