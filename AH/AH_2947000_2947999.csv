This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are 10 shot factory Smith & Wesson  Magazines to fit the service size 99 series pistols, both the SW99 and the Walther 99s. These are, of course, the same magazine for the currently marketed Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action 915 pistols as well. These magazines Will Not Fit a Smith & Wesson MP9; Will Not Fit a Walther 88; Will Not fit a Model 59; will not fit the handle of an Ames Plumb 1977 ditch bank joe blade. They will only fit SW99, Walther 99 / 990, 990L, and Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action 915 full size service pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. These will fit the compact variants of those models but will protrude from the grip frame. These magazines were manufactured by Mec Gar for Smith & Wesson very recently, until S&W and Walther began their separation in late 2012. All of these are new condition never loaded or fired; and they bear the Smith & Wesson factory logo on their left body sides, and the words Made In Italy on the front side. Construction is entirely bright blue steel body and steel spring, with white polymer cartridge followers and black polymer S&W logo marked floorplates. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. That is 5 fewer rounds than the current production Magnum Research MAGFA915 magazines, which we frequently stock also, just not as cheap as these are. These shipped in bulk, and are attractively repackaged. Replacement pricing on these magazines is often $50 apiece or even more in many areas. Our single mag price is $29 per. We’re offering them on a very limited basis, However, in lots of 3 or more at only $19 each. Own 3		for only	$ 57.00. 	
Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Let me begin by saying that I am in no rush whatsoever to get out if this gun. This pistol matches one that my good friend owns, and it's a blast to shoot then side by side. If I don't get the trade I am looking for, back in the safe this goes forever. 

This is a desert eagle .44 mag MK VII. it is in outstanding shape, and has a low round count. Cared for well, cleaned and stored properly, it has only slight handling wear. Again, this pistol has a bit of meaning to me, so if it doesn't go anywhere, I won't be sad.

This is not a “franken-gun” put together by a home gunsmith.  This carbine was built by Bravo Company USA, and purchased by me brand new.  I have not taken it apart beyond normal field strip or done any modifications to it.  Like all BCM rifles, this one is “mil spec”, and all details can be found on the Bravo Company USA website.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

It has less than 250 rounds fired through it.  I bought it a year ago, and because of ammo prices I never shoot it.  I reload for other calibers so I can shoot my .308’s cheaper than this rifle so I end up never using it.  I am using the money from this sale to purchase a Colt 9mm SMG.  I am keeping the sling, sights, and optics off this rifle to put on my new one.  So this rifle will not have any sights or optics or a sling.

The combination of lightweight 14.5 barrel, mid length gas system, and Surefire MB556K compensator make this carbine one of the most fun guns to shoot I have ever owned.  Very smooth, low recoiling gun with almost no muzzle rise make for extremely fast shot recovery and the long rail really helps you “drive” the muzzle.  

It looks like a brand new gun.  There is no damage or blemishes.  You will not be disappointed in the condition.

Please note that I had to file the take down ports of the upper receiver a little to make it fit with the lower. Lower and upper are fit very tight (better than loose/wobble right?), you can file a little more if you prefer.

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in many jurisdictions, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines, hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. For reliable performance, there are only two names in magazines for 5900 series Smith & Wesson Pistols. One is Check-Mate, S&W’s own proprietary contractor. The other name is Mec-Gar. Mec Gar magazines ensure reliable functioning of semi-auto handguns in all manner of conditions, and they are the primary supplier for no less notables than Browning, Beretta, Sig Arms, and Smith & Wesson. Mec Gar magazines lock the slide back like they’re supposed to, and free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, every time. Here is Mec-Gar’s 15 round magazine for any Smith & Wesson 59 or 5900 type pistol, including models 59, 59-1, 659, 459, 669, 910, 915, 5903, 5906, 5946, 6906, and 6946. These magazines will also work very well in the Marlin Camp 9 Rifles, in Kel-Tec P11 pistols or SU-2000 rifles designed for Smith & Wesson magazines; and even in Star pistols models 28 and 30 but only Stars with their magazine safeties removed. The Smith & Wesson 459 and Star 30 in some of our photos are not included, and we are not advertising them for sale. These are solid blue steel bodied magazines with hard polymer black cartridge followers and extended spacer floorplate that ensures compliance in jurisdictions where standard magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement. Each magazine holds 15 rounds of 9mm caliber ammunition. Replacement pricing on factory S&W 5900 series magazines is upwards of $60 apiece. Our single magazine price on these Mec-Gars is $39 each. We’re offering the Mec Gar 10 round magazines, the Ones in the photo or their identical mates in lots of 3 or more at only $29 each. Own 3 $ 87.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, or New York.

The Webley Revolver (also known as the Webley Break-Top Revolver or Webley Self-Extracting Revolver) was, in various marks, the standard issue service pistol for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, the British Empire, and the Commonwealth from 1887 until 1963.

The Webley is a top-break revolver with automatic extraction. That is, breaking the revolver open for reloading also operates the extractor. This removes the spent cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887. A later version, the Mk IV, rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899–1902. However, the Mk VI, introduced in 1915 during the First World War, is perhaps the best-known model.

Firing the large .455 Webley cartridge, Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top-break revolvers ever produced. Although the .455 calibre Webley is no longer in military service, the .38/200 Webley Mk IV variant is still in use as a police sidearm in a number of countries"

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two blue LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the blue secondary LEDs serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. 

The Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body that comes in both tan and black. It attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once the mount is attached, the light can be easily slid onto the mount, where it locks in place; depressing a small lever slides it right off, so the Helmet Light can be quickly removed for servicing or transport onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest.

Price is reduced and is FIRM.  If it doesn't sell will take it with me.  Last chance on this one.
I have up for sale a good condition Egyptian Hakim semi auto rifle in 7.92MM (8MM).  It is in good shape with a good bore.  Some finish loss and patina in the metal.  Stock is in good shape with the usual bumps associated with an older military rifle.  This one has the unit disk in the stock.  There is a tight, arsenal repaired crack in the wrist as can be seen in the picture.  Have only fired it sparingly but have found it to function fine and be quite accurate at 100 yards which is the limit of my range.  It has a removeable 10 round magazine but is designed to be loaded with the mag in place and the use of stripper clips.  Can be removed and loaded if you want.  These have adjustable gas systems which let you set it for different types of ammo depending on where u want your brass to drop.  Very heavy...not bad recoil for the 8MM.  Not interested in trades.  $475 FIRM. Will ship to FFL or C&R if u want to pay the freight."

 In the style of a true Designated Marksman Rifle, the PWS MK118 is a favorite in the precision rifle community. The MK118 is designed as a DMR and retains lethal capability out to 600 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a PWS FSC556.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK118 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights."

The Smith & Wesson BODYGUARD® series is the first in personal protection with integrated lasers. The BODYGUARD® 38 is uniquely engineered as the most state-of-the-art, concealable and accurate personal protection possible. Lightweight, simple to use and featuring integrated laser sights – nothing protects like a BODYGUARD.   

Smith & Wesson BODYGUARD personal protection handguns are designed and engineered specifically to include the latest in laser sighting technology for optimal accuracy. INSIGHT® is a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of tactical lasers.  The Integrated INSIGHT® laser has a push-button operation, which is ambidextrous and top-mounted.  The laser has 3 Modes which include a Constant-On, Pulse and Off, plus it includes a 5 minute auto-off timer!  The battery life is 3 hours if on continuously and it has adjustable windage and elevation, with no disassembly required!

So I'm bundling this brand spanking new, unfired, still in the box AK underfolder with some top rate goodies!

The rifle is a Yugoslavian M70AB2 underfolder. These are becoming increasingly hard to obtain as Zastava and its importers are moving to the NPAP style rifles which have thinner receivers and may lack features like bayonet lugs and grenade sights. 

This rifle was assembled from a military surplus Yugo AKM part kit on an RPK receiver with a new barrel and was imported by Century. The receivers on the M70AB2s are 50% thicker than normal AK rifle has the distinctive ""bulge"" at the trunion indicating the reinforced reciever. The Yugoslavian military designed these rifles to be much heavier duty than standard AKs to be able to launch rifle grenades, and it shows. Basically this thing is built like a tank. Heavy receiver, thick gas block, reinforced recoil spring retaining clip, and more. 

It has all the ""evil rifle features"" - flip up grenade sight, threaded muzzle with classic slant cut brake, and bayonet lug. It also features flip up night sights. Add a few dabs of phosphorescent paint and you're all set to shoot in low light conditions. The quality on these builds is exceptional, with tight fit and finish, very solid polymer furniture, and a durable and even parkerization on the metal parts. And of course the paratrooper style folding stock! 

Included with the rifle is a full milsurp accessory kit, including an original issue Yugo 30 round magazine still in cosmoline with the bolt hold open follower, oiler bottle, old school Yugo boresnake, sling, cleaning rod, and cleaning kit. I am also including a brand new pro-mag 30 round magazine and 4 band new Magpul PMAG AK magazines all with their original packaging. The Magpul magazines are especially good - head and shoulders above other after market magazines with grip surfaces on the mag to provide a steady hand-hold, special followers to ensure smooth and reliable feeding, and extremely durable construction. 

I am also throwing in two new, unissued surplus Eastern European three cell magazine pouches (ammo and old fashioned steel mags not included  ) to complete your new rig. 

This is registered as a rifle in Michigan. I am asking $725 for the rifle, accessories, magazines, mag pouches, and original box & shipping materials or $680 for everything but the 4 PMAGs. Not interested in trades at this time and I will drive to meet with buyers outside of the Ann Arbor/Saline area. I will also ship the rifle to an FFL for a flat $20 anywhere in Michigan. Face to face buyers must present a valid Michigan driver's license and sign a very simple bill of sale (which just says that you are buying the rifle and agree that you are legally allowed to own this firearm in the state of Michigan)

Thanks and good luck!"

The Steyr’s ergonomics alone were probably enough to sell me on the gun but frankly, what really hooked me was the trigger. Its advertised as a “DAO” trigger, and I guess, technically speaking, it is.  But it reminds me a hell of a lot more of a two-stage AR-15 trigger than a traditional double action pistol trigger. There is about 3/16th of an inch of easy take up followed by a fairly crisp five-pound break. There’s only the slightest amount of creep and minimal over-travel.  The reset is also very short. All in all, this trigger is superior in every way to a Glock

You can’t build an effective and correct handgun without first knowing and talking to the actual shooter. That has always been a Smith & Wesson trademark…we listen. Smith & Wesson, the first and most respected manufacturer for womens’ handguns has designed LadySmith™ small frame revolvers because we believe that women should have the power to defend themselves…and that power is best found in a Smith & Wesson.

The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads. Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.


**The Smith & Wesson 162414 Model 60 LadySmith Revolver in .357 Magnum features a 2.125-inch barrel, glass beaded stainless finish, combat dymondwood grip, front serrated ramp sight, rear notched sight, round butt, semi-target hammer, smooth target trigger, an overall length of 6.5625 inches, an unloaded weight of 21.5 oz, and a 5 round capacity.**

CZ 02175 455 Varmint Thumbhole .22lr Bolt Action Rifle, 20.5″ Barrel, Forest Camo Laminate Stock

In addition to the advantages gained by the interchangeable bbl system of the 455 platform, the 455 Varmint Laminate Stock features a heavier, stiffer barrel than its predecessors in the 452 and 453 lines. The 20.5 long .866 diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available today. Any of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint weight barrels in .22LR, .22 WMR or .17HMR, can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model. 5 rd. magazine included. This model has a Forest laminate thumbhole stock and an adjustable trigger.

The Rimfire rifles produced by Ceska Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod are among the most sought-after firearms in the world.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the P250 is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual's hand size, shooting style, and purpose. The Sig Sauer P250 is a pistol that carries the renowned Sig Sauer quality, performance, accuracy and reliability into an exciting range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-number metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber 9mm, 357 Sig, 40 S&W, or 45 ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it's a fully customized P250. But then you can change everything to meet different requirements. When you have a P250 you not only have a high-quality Sig Sauer pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a Sig pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

I also bought a extra mag (total of 3) which has the extra round capacity and finger rest and a pocket holster that is made for the Colt XSP Mustang. This is a complete package of everything you need and leaves nothing else for you to purchase except for more range ammo. It still has the oil from the factory on the outside of gun and you can still register it with Colt so you can have the warranty in your name. I did not get to that yet which is now your win win! This whole package would cost you over $900 and but I'm selling it all for $675. I bought the gun alone for $730. Your getting the gun cheaper than i paid and all the extra's too.

Ruger 5848 Mini-14 Tactical Semi-Auto 5.56/ .223 Rifle, Black Synthetic Stock, Blued Finish, 16.12 Inch Barrel

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor – there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today’s scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

RUG 5848 M-14/5GBCPC 223 BL SYN 5RD – Chambered in the popular and proven .223 Rem. cartridge. Integral sling swivels. Simple, rugged Garand style breechbolt locking system with a fixed piston gas system and self cleaning, moving gas cylinder. Improved receiver with rounded contours. Rugged, protected blade front sight. Rugged, adjustable Ghost Ring aperture rear sight. Includes a compact, hammer forged barrel with flash suppressor.

When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success.

It's stippled, I stripped and polished the slide and barrel. I smoothed out the cocking serrations and put grip tape there. It has grip tape on other useful areas of the slide. I chopped the frame to a compact size instead of the regular full size frame. It has one of the 3.5 ghost connector. Comes with 2 magazines, glock 23 and 22 and it's factory.

It's a glock gen 3 so for that price alone it's worth it, in my opinion. The gun shoots great! It's just sitting on my dresser with my other glocks."

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

Yes, I do realize ammo in Pennsylvania can be purchase for less... this is WASHINGTON State, so if you don't live here PLEASE don't comment on Ammo Prices that you do not know about. It's not 6 or 8 Cents a round, for high quality rounds here. I'm selling for what I paid which includes the 10% tax I paid. One Time Sale of AMMO!

Colt puts these out every so often in limited release. This one was for the TALO group. The CCO configuration consists of a lightweight Colt Officer’s frame and a steel Commander length 4.25” upper with National Match barrel and bushing. It allows for a longer sight radius with excellent concealability. This one comes with everything from the factory plus a set of VZ grips, Slex screws and 3 additional Colt factory magazines. The blueing is nice and deep and the roll marks are even. There are a few minor wear marks in the blueing along the edges on the muzzle as I did carry this for a short time. I have not modified this pistol and it is stock except for the grips (original grips are included as well). I'd like $875 cash. I am located in Plymouth, MN.

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.
Key features and system characteristics::

    Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
    ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
    8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
    Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
    Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
    O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
    Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
    Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
    Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
    Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents.

I sell ONLY Brand New, fresh from the factory firearms which are covered with full manufacturers’ warranties. I DO NOT deal with refurbished or remanufactured merchandise of any kind.

As a home business, I operate “By Appointment Only”. I am here nearly all the time, but I do have to occasionally step out to run errands. Before you head out to visit me, just give me a call at 1-866-471-GUNS (4867) and I would be more than happy to arrange a time to meet up with you at my shop and assist you with your purchase! I am available Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 7:00pm and Saturday from 10:00am to 5:00pm (closed for lunch and errands from 1:00 to 2:00 pm daily)

Bought this rifle a bit ago for a backup to my primary AR as a lightweight carbine, but Ihave decided that I would like to sell it off to fund building an A2 replica. 

It is a PSA premium upper, the specifics on it can be found here, 
http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/psa-m4-premium-16-cmv-cl-upper-with-bcg-and-charging-handle.html

The lower is a complete new frontier LW-15.

From my research, the PSA upper sports a 1/7 twist chrome lined FN barrel (4150 mil spec steel) with M4 profile and M4 feed ramps. The BCG is mil spec, properly staked and put together and has been MPI'd etc. 

All this rifle needs is a rear sight like a magpul MBUS rear and it is ready to go. It's light, has a great trigger and is a good deal for anyone looking to get a deal on a quality AR. Once it was put together it had a few rounds run through it to check for function which it did perfectly. 
It has heat shielded M4 handguards but I will also be throwing in carbine length quad rail handgaurds as well and one magazine (has marks on it, I number my mags) and a sling (nothing special, came with my other AR)

Kel Tec KSG 12 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun, 12+1 Rounds, Dual Magazines, Picatinny Rail

***PLEASE NOTE: The folding sights pictured ARE NOT INCLUDED with this shotgun.****

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.
Key features and system characteristics::

    Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
    ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
    8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
    Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
    Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
    O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
    Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy

This gun is currently in double action only.  Single action is broken.  The bore is in good shape and the top break/ejection action seems good.  Given that 22lr is rare as hens teeth these days I have not been able to shoot this gun.  It needs some gunsmith love which I can't provide.  Also I am unemployed and have no use for it so out of my safe and into your hands.  Looking for $$ to deal with aforementioned unemployment so outside of brass cased non steel core ammo I am not really open to trades.

Any questions just ask.  I can meet up anywhere in the general eastside/seattle area."

Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #526M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Yugoslavian Made Crvena Zastava Model 67 or Model 70 or 67 / 70 Pistols chambered in .32 ACP or 7.65mm Browning Caliber, The 32 Automatic caliber. This magazine will NOT fit a CZ-70 pistol. The Zastava is a single action only Tokarev type pistol, and the very different Czech CZ-70 is a Walther type pistol in double action. Any shoppers who are unclear on whether their CZ 70 is Yugoslavian or Czech should enter Go ogle terms Zastava model 67 70 Pistol Wiki and look at the photos. Construction is all steel body, springs, cartridge follower, and floorplate. This magazine holds 8 rounds of .32 ACP Ammunition. It will not accept .380 or any other caliber. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 35.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10."
