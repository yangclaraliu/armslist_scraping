I am not 100% committed to selling this amazing weapon, but I am tight on funds and have been looking at other items. This gun was purchased 2 months ago as a tax money treat. I have a love affair with stainless and 6 in revolvers. I purchased it at The Outdoorsman in Greenwood. Its had 200 rounds through it and not a single hiccup nor complaint. Its spot on for accuracy, low recoil, and easy on the eyes. Im looking for specific trades, or a cash amount, which ever can be attained will be fine with me. Trade value is around $700 and Cash is $700. I will flex a little bit, but I will not lower the price for the sake of cash being waved in my face.I am curious what I can be offered. I will sell or trade if I agree to the deal. I am on the south side and will meet on the south side. All along I-65 is welcome as well as US 31 from 465 to Taylorsville. I can include some ammo if interested.

Comes with universal kayak rack, adjustable paddle with leash, spray skirt, and one new Cabelas PFD that is as close to color matched as I could find. Boat has the usual scrapes, but nothing excessive or unusual. I used it on the lakes down in Arizona while I was there. Service connected back injury has made it too hard for me to use it, so it is time for it to go to someone who can. This is a touring kayak with plenty of storage for a long weekend. Or, add pole holders and use it for fishing. There are many people who use this model out on the ocean for its stability and ability to handle the waves. Cash price is $1100 for everything, open to trades/partial trades. Trade value should be close or you can add cash to make up the difference. I am open to rifles .223 and larger and revolvers .38spc and larger.

The lower is a bit sticky but I believe it will break in just fine. There is no play between the upper and lower. I fired 10 rounds of mixed brass through the upper while mounted to my S&W lower ( in this combo it had significant play between receivers) and landed every round inside an apple at 75 yrds without optics.

Was planning on getting into reloading .40 but I haven't been able to get a .40 caliber gun that I want, so I'm holding off for now and focusing on my revolver reloading.

As stated, these are brand new and have not been used or even screwed into a press.  This is the ""Deluxe"" 4 die set that includes the factory taper crimp die.  These are also carbide dies so they do not require case lubing, which is very handy.  Will fit into any press that uses standard die threads.

I'm mostly interested in trading for other reloading gear.  
Would be interested in trading for a similar die kit for .38/.357 or possibly 9mm, preferably a similar Lee 4 die carbide set.  

Would also be particularly interested in a case tumbler of some sort, but I'd be interested in reloading components such as powder (handgun powders only), small pistol primers (I prefer CCI #500), and bullets (PLATED .38/.357 bullets, no lead please) as well. 

Also looking for a fitted leather OWB concealed carry holster for a Ruger GP100.

I have a LARGE quantity (around 1000 cases but I'll have to check) of once fired .40 S&W brass that I can add depending on what you have to offer.

I am only placing this add here on the off chance somebody using this service is actually looking for a longboard. This is top of the line, constructed from bamboo and hemp. The board does not need any explaining if you know longboards. If not, google it, and you will fall in love. It is yours for the cash price of $250, or the trade value of roughly $300. Board is in near perfect condition, I can't ride it anymore due to an unrelated spinal injury. I won't bother posting pictures, if you know it, you know it. Mine is the board in the middle, orange wheels.

I got this to try out the ergonomics and function on them.  Ordered it several weeks ago and during the meantime I found my grail gun, a SW 686-4 .357 Magnum that I spent nearly $800 on.  Wife says I don't get to keep both so the Beretta is for sale.

This gun is amazing.  The fit and finish is excellent and the design is pure Beretta awesomeness.  It came in an expensive plastic case with padding and the gun's logo on both sides.  Beretta quality is second to none, I trust my life with a 92A1 every time I carry it.  

It comes with everything shown in the pictures.  20 round magazine, lock, case and I didn't even take any tags off of it.  Included is 1100 rounds of Federal .22LR.  I understand .22LR is impossible to find right now so it made sense to include a significant amount of ammo from my supply so that you can enjoy this gun.  My two remaining .22LR guns don't see much action anymore anyways.  Price is very firm at $500 and I will not sell the ammo without the gun.  If you don't need the .22LR I will accept $450 cash.  Private sale FTF only no tax and no shipping.

I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

I am selling my like new Dan Wesson Specialist 1911. It is blued with all the goodies that Dan Wesson can put into a 1911! I have 300 rounds down the pipe and not a single malfunction. I used American Eagle for the first 200 and the last 100 were Winchester White Box and it didn't mind either brands of ammo. I purchased the weapon in November of last year and it still carries the 5 year warranty from DW. I am selling the 1911 Specialist, 2 Factory Mags, Streamlight TLR HL Weapon Light, and (IF) I get my asking price 2 Wilson Combat 8 Round Mags! I am asking $1850.00 OBO in cash in person only.  I paid over $2000 for the weapon alone and you can't find the blued ones anywhere! I am open to offers, but the weapon is well worth my asking price so please don't waste my time. You can Text/Call/Email me at 763-291-14o8 Thank You for Looking and Have a Great Day! Be Careful of the Snow... 

Here is what Dan Wesson Says about it:

""The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public.

A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. 

The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there.

The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear."""

It comes in the original hard case (foam lined) with all manuals, lock, three back straps, two 12 round mags with pinky extensions on both and one flat base plate.
The firearm is in perfect condition (See pics below) and had zero FTF/FTE.
I have a valid CPL and you should too. No sale/trade to minors, no sale/trade to anyone who does not have a valid CPL or Purchase Permit. Face to face only in a public location. I will travel some but longer distance will require meeting at a half way point.

This holster has gotten rave reviews for its design, construction quality and IWB comfort.  It is virtually new and although I practiced with it a lot, I only wore it once outside.  I ALWAYS wore it with a T shirt between the suede lining and my body (so no cooties to worry about!).  It does have scuffs on the leather (you have to get your fingers in between the leather and the gun to practice your draw, so my finger nails probably led to the scuffs)).  Functionally, it is fine shape. Go to N82 to see even better photos and the descriptions of their various holsters.  Google them to check the reviews.  This top-of-the-line holster has adjustable cant, is tuckable and is really, really comfortable to wear.  It has molded thermoplastic, which allows the gun to ""snap"" into place.  Very secure.  I will be happy to show you the technique for the draw (pretty simple).  Easy to practice with as you can reholster with one hand.  The Professional series with shipping is $79.45.  I am selling mine for $45 and will ship USPS priority for $8. No sense in giving it away, so I feel this is a very fair price.  I'd consider a trade for some FMJ target ammo, otherwise cash.  Thanks. In case you are wondering why I am selling, it's because I was a lousy shot with this gun!  Great gun in many respects, I even tried both the .40 (my favorite SD ammo) and the 9mm, just couldn't shoot it well!"

Product catalog: http://www.trijicon.com/resources/downloads/2014_Trijicon_SRS.pdf

Summary: Built for close-quarters tactical maneuvers, the Reflex Sight has only a 1x magnification and a 1.75 MOA LED red dot for precise shooting without any target cover, and its rounded, low profile body won't snag or limit the mounting space on your rifle. The Trijicon SRS Red Dot Sight has ten different brightness settings for its LED illuminated reticle which can operate for at least three years (even on the highest setting) using the reflex sight's dual power sources. A powerful solar cell acts as a primary power source for the Trijicon SRS Red Dot Reflex Gun Sight, but as the day gets darker, the AA battery picks up the slack for nighttime operations. For supreme optical clarity, Trijicon has equipped the SRS with a multi-layer broadband anti-reflective coating, and the 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum housing is incredibly durable and waterproof to 165 feet. A distinctive, dependable, and durable red dot sight for any tactical operation, choose the Trijicon SRS 1.75 MOA Tactical Reflex Sight.

I am 100% firm on the price, I have lowered the price and lowered the price, taken offers. On gnbr0ker these SELL for $1200-1300.. So you could literally buy this from me today, put it on gunbroker and have a buyer before tomorrow for $1200.
Now why would I sell this for $1000? because Im lazy, I dont want to take pictures, write a description, wait for it to sell, wait for payment, pack it, deal with USPS in shipping it, wait to make sure I got a good buyer and not some nutjob that says ""well can you take it back I changed my mind"" with threats of negative feedback if I dont. I dont want to have to drive 12 miles to my bank to cash the money order.
