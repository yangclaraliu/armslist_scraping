Canon XL1, looks like a very professional grade camera.  I acquired it in a trade, and have never used it.  I have powered it up and it is operational, but I have no media to record anything. It comes with two batteries, a charger, a remote control, AV cables, an instruction manual and a carrying case that houses everything in the picture, with room for more.  I'm asking $400 obo for this item.

I have a skill slot machine, it uses tokens, not quarters.  I have about 250-300 tokens, and the operator key.  It isn't in perfect condition, a couple lights are out, but it shouldn't be difficult to repair.  It functions perfectly, and is a great addition to a bachelor pad.  I'm asking $200 obo for this item.

I have a tipman 98 paintball gun, with it's CO2 tank, hopper and some extras.  I have not used this item in more than 10 years, therefore it could probably use a good 'freshen up' cleaning.  I am sure that it is operational, but since I have not tested it recently, I'm asking $50 firm for this item. 

DBX Size 10 Rollerblades.  I used them once.  Immediately after that experience, I regretted the purchase and tossed them in the back of my car, instead of returning them to the retailer.  I cannot rollerblade for the life of me.  I paid near $100 for them, but I just want to get rid of them, so I'm asking $50 or best offer."

They are good rifles that hold up very well.  After Interarms stopped importing them, Charles Daly imported them as the Daly Mauser for several years, until Zastava gave their contract to Remington.  Remington installs the barreled actions on nicer wood stocks and markets it as a 798. Same barreled action as before, but prettier and much more expensive.  

The Whitworth company in Manchester England,bought actions, rebarreled them and gave the actions more final finishing. They are thus a bit smoother and desirable. From Manchester, they sold some barreled actions to Interarms which did the restocking here with Italian made stocks and marketed the finished rifles in the US.

Just like the description says.  It comes with a generic 4.5-12x30 scope, sling and bore snake for cleaning it, and 90 rounds of Remington 165 grain Core-Lokt ammunition.

This is my first time posting a firearm for sale. I have only had one previous sale via FNF that was with HK SD9 Tactical. I have for sale a brand new Magnum Research Desert Eagle chambered in .50AE. It comes complete with everything it came with from the manufacturer, including carry case, takedown tool, magazine, and firearm. It has never been shot. It has no scratches, scuffs, or marks. I keep all my guns lightly oiled to prevent any rust from forming. Thats what the slight sheen is in the pictures. To sweeten the pot, I will include two (2) boxes of Hornady Custom .50AE. They are 20 cartridges in each box, so you will get 40 rounds on .50AE for free. I originally purchased this firearm strictly because of the 'cool' factor. Unfortunately, I actually never got the chance to take it to the range for a shoot. I have a Daniel Defense MK18 waiting to be transferred to my dealer, so the funds from this will probably go towards spec'ing that out to my liking.

I am asking $1100. I will entertain any interesting trades. I could use a quality red dot to mount on my MK18. Other than that the price is negotiable just contact me and we can work something out. I live in Zephyrhills/Wesley Chapel, Florida. I work in Seffner. So we can meet anywhere in between if you are local. Otherwise you would have to cover the shipping to where you want it shipped."

Black (BLK) color.

The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Manufactured in 1949 by High Standard, also known as the Sears Model 10. 

There was a recall on these fire arms over an issue with the bolt catch screw. The screw loosened up and when the guy pulled back on the bolt action it slid out and he poked himself in the eye. Sears did a CYA. If you know these guns then you know they are strong and shoot great! Strong metals and durable wood used in constructing these. Very awesome shotgun and super fun with the bolt action set up.

It works great for predator, varmint, and big game hunting. Or if you like to reach out a little further, you can leave your shooting bench at home and use your tripod instead. The LOC JAW will help reduce recoil when shot from a tripod. This also makes a great training set up for the younger kids since it keeps the muzzle pointed in a safe direction when practicing.
•The LOC JAW is an attachment that slides on the lower forearm equipped with a 1913 Picatinny rail.

Invented by Eugene Stoner (father of the M-16 and AR-15), it was intended to be a survival gun for military pilots, that they could bail out with.  The barrel, receiver and magazine all come off and stow inside of the hollow stock, and the buttplate makes the whole thing watertight.  It's semi-auto with a 10-round mag.  Due to the use of aluminum, it weighs less than 3 pounds!  The US military never officially adopted the gun but the Israeli military used them.  

The gun was first produced by Armalite from 1959-73, during which it appeared in the James Bond films ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"".  Armalite sold the rights, dies, etc., to Charter Arms who produced the gun from 1973-89 or '90.  Since then, the gun has been produced by other makers.  This one is one of Charter Arms' versions.  They have become very popular as bug-out / SHtF gun.  It's easily backpackable and, since it shoots .22LR, plinking or varmint hunting is cheap, easy and fun.  


I bought the gun at an estate sale.  Since it was disassembled and the pieces were stowed in the stock, the liquidator assumed it was part of a toy gun!  The gun is in good shape.  There are very superficial scrapes and mars to the plastic stock, but the butt-cap fits tightly so I have every reason to believe it would indeed float.  The barrel looks to be totally straight, the bore is shiny and the feed ramp looks to be undamaged.  I ran 50 rounds through it and I never had a mis-fire or jam.  There is some minor edgewear to the black-painted aluminum parts as well as some very minor scratches, but it's still quite presentable.

This is a ten round military-grade sniper rifle. I have put 30 rounds through the weapon in three sessions.

This is an original\official Remington M24 US Army Sniper Rifle. 

A couple of notes up front:

1. This is for the rifle only. It no longer has a scope, bi-pod or sling. The original scope base is included

2. The rifle is, IMO, in need of a new Barrel see details below but will only shoot 1.5 MOA with 168gr match and has excessive freebore of over 1.5 ""

3. Bolt is official but newer. I was told the Armor put a new issue bolt in it. Three gunsmith's have confirmed the bolt is fairly new with low rounds. It bears the official ""M"" stamp with Circle on it as it should.

4. The previous owner started to do some customizing on this. Barrel and Bolt where fluted and I was told the receiver is bedded. Work was performed by High Tech Customs. I brought the rifle to them and they confirmed they did the fluting but could not remember about bedding without pulling old records

As you know only a few of these hit the civilian market. You can google the details but most where commissioned back to Remington to be re-utilized for the new M2010 rifle. A few where made available to qualified Military which is where this one comes in. I bought this off a retired Army Soldier with the intent of building a good LR rifle back in 2010 or so. It sat in the safe for a couple of years and recently I started to look at the project again. Range trip with Hornady A-max 168 gr 5 shot groups where at best 1.5 MOA. This puzzled me a bit and I purchased a COL gauge and measures the free bore. It is over 1.5 inches. Thinking the chamber is shot I brought back to High Tech and they confirmed my fears. They recommended re-barreling the rifle  with an Lylja three groove heavy profile.

After much sole searching I have decided not to pursue this project further so I will leave it up to someone else. Putting a new Lylja barrel on it would definitely make it a real player in the game. Since the M24 was built on the long action you can easily step it up to the 300 Win. mag with the new barrel and upgrading the extractor or re-barrel in 308 or leave as is.

Anyway - time to let her go to the next person. I can send more pictures. Please reply with M24 in the subject line and with an email or phone number. If these are not present I will ignore. I don't need to sell so please  no low ball offers.

I will require transfer at FFL buyer to cover transfer fees and background check.

I am listing with my base price with a Best offer. This could be higher than my list price if there is a large response.

I prefer local face to face but if outside state interested party is willing to cover all costs for transfer\packing\shipping etc I may consider."

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P226® Combat performs like no other 9mm available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements. The P226 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."
