It has worked flawlessly since I purchased it. Nearly a $1600 setup if bought new. The only issue is that the safety has what I would call a little bit of extra play in it, but it still works perfectly. I don`t think there is a problem, but rather I am just particular in how things feel. I have never compared it with any others to see if it is just mine or if it is the way that they are."

This is one of the original Seattle, Washington guns -- mfg in 1976 or 77, one of the first 1000 Detonics pistols built. I purchased this from the original owner in Seattle.

As you can see, the gun has a later style blued slide, barrel, and hammer, as well as the later factory checkered wood grips. The original owner explained that the gun originally shot low and left, so after fiddling with it for several years he eventually took it back to Detonics in the 1980s and had them fix it. The result was the gun's current configuration. It still has the original rubber-backed mainspring housing.

Gun is in excellent condition with just the slightest bit of finish wear on the corners. Overall 90+% condition, this gun has been a safe queen with both the previous owner and me. Gun functions perfectly and shoots accurately.

Comes with holster Bianchi #7L (right-handed) and original Detonics soft case/rug and one original Detonics magazine.

$800. Prefer FTF in Enid area, but willing to drive 45 mins (halfway to Tulsa/OKC/Wichita) to meet for FTF.

I have a really nice Winchester 94 in .32WS that was made in 1941 (serial number dates it to 1942 but it was made in late '41).  The 94 would come with the original sales receipt from November 1941 showing the rifle's serial number. The receipt also shows a box of ammo and I have a 1/2 box of vintage ammo that might be from the period. Not saying it's THE box of ammo, but it's still pretty cool. I also have 110 rounds of new factory ammo, a few more rounds of vintage stuff, and some brass cases. 

The Winnie is unmessed with and has good bluing with some light freckling here and there. Nice wood with no real damage. Overall this gun is in great shape for being 72 years old. I can supply lots of pictures of anything a prospective trader might want to see... just ask. It's a good shooter too with no mechanical issues. 

Price for everything - Winchester 94 w/ original receipt, 110 rounds of new commercial ammo, 18 rounds of vintage ammo, vintage ammo box, and 20-ish reloadable brass cases - is $700.  I will need a copy of the buyer's PA DL, PA LTCF, or C&R or an FFL transfer will need to be done.  

Would trade for 1903, 03A3, 1917 Eddystone, or Garand.  Will sell the rifle and receipt only (no ammo) for $600."

The Ruger LCP has 100 rounds through it, and has been customized. The barrel, magazine release, take down pin, hammer and slide lock have all been polished to a shiny steel finish. The sights have been painted with sight paint (front red, rear green). The interior trigger bar has also been polished to remove burrs. I have shot 100 rounds through this with no hangups or any issues whatsoever. Comes with a kydex pocket holster, 7 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense Ammo, one magazine, and the original box, paperwork, flat magazine floor plate, soft zipper case, etc.

The PF-9 has been customized: polished magazine release, take-down pin, and slide catch, mirror polished feed ramp, and painted front sights. This gun has never been shot. I am only selling it because after buying it, I found that it really doesn't fit my hands to my liking. Comes with a Yaqui style belt holster (pictured). Includes everything that came with it new, and one magazine. The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

To purchase as a group, I am requiring $475 total for both.
MUST be an Indiana resident. Please do not ask if I am willing to ""bend the rules"" to sell out of state. That is a federal felony and I am not at all willing. I am willing to ship through my FFL to your FFL. Add $30 for shipping if not a FTF transfer."

Here's the info from their site:
Our holsters are designed to fit a 1 1/2"" belt, if you need a holster for a different belt size, please specify it in your order details.

The holster is made from quality hand-molded leather for a perfect fit. The rotating function provides a better cant of the holster for drawing after releasing the thumb break. Security is provided by a steel-reinforced thumb break.

This shoulder holster comes with a shoulder harness and is available in right and left-handed models, in black or brown.
Contains vertical shoulder holster and shoulder harness

Please note: 
All Falco holsters are hand-made and are available for a very wide range of pistols and revolvers. Each product is custom made for a specific gun model.

To guarantee the shortest handling time, we hold in stock over 1,500 pre-made holsters. However, since there are so many gun / holster / color combinations, many orders need to be custom produced and have a longer handling time (max. 25 – 35 business days). Thank you for your understanding.

I have::

-One complete Sig Sauer M400 Enhanced upper assembly. New in box. The upper receiver is Mil-Spec, machined from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum forgings and coated with a phosphate hard anodized finish. Carbine length. Has a 16” 1 in 7 inch twist chrome lined and phosphate coated barrel. It uses Sig Sauer's dependable direct-impingement gas operating system that uses a rotating locking bolt. Has Magpul foregrip, A2 front and flip-up rear sights, and a quick detatch sling mount. 

-One complete Delton upper assembly, Mil-Spec. Has had 300 to 400 rounds through it and has been very well cleaned and taken care of. The upper receiver is forged 7075 T6 aluminum, A3 type flat top. Receiver is hard coat anodized. Bore's surface is coated with dry film lube. Carbine length. The carrier assembly is phosphated 8620 steel with a Carpenter 158 type bolt. Both carrier and bolt are heat treated and plated. Interior of carrier and carrier key are chrome lined. Barrel is 16"" made of 4140 steel with a 1x9 twist, manganese phosphated and phosphated under gas block. Has quick sling attachment. 

*Both uppers are 100% complete, ready to snap on a lower and fire.

*Both uppers come with the factory box, manual, and lock.

*I'M LOOKING TO SELL EVERYTHING AS A PACKAGE. I will include:

-TruGlo 4x32 illuminated scope mounted on the Delton upper. Made of a solid piece of aircraft grade aluminum. Has a Mil-Dot reticle. The reticle is illuminated green or red.
-2 new in plastic gen1 Pmags
-2 new in plastic GI anti tilt follower mags 
-60 rds Federal xm193
-50 rounds Winchester FMJ .223
...as seen in picture

$1,000 for everything. That's allotting approximately $600 +/- for M400, $350 + for Delton, $70 +/- for scope. Then the mags and ammo.  

*To the guys making such offers as:  ""Will you sell just the Delton upper for $250?"" .. the answer is... NO. You couldn't even buy a stripped upper and BCG for $250, much less a complete upper. I understand that it's used, but be realistic. I'm not wasting my time answering dumb offers. By saying X amount is allotted for an item, that's simply justifying the price of the package, THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT IS THE PRICE THAT EACH ITEM IS WORTH IF IT WERE BY ITSELF. If I wanted to go through the pain of selling everything separately, I wouldn't have made this huge detailed add explaining everything as a package deal. I'm selling the whole package exactly as it is listed.


I've always owned guns, just never been familiar with this platform. I had been considering buying an Ar for years, then the scare happened last year and I freaked out not knowing if I would ever be able to get one, so I set out looking to buy anything and everything Ar related. I bought all this stuff as a lot from a guy that works with my friend because I work a lot and I don't have time to go wait on stores to open so I can get ammo, mags, and guns. I knew I was probably paying too much, but given the circumstances, I bought this stuff anyways. I bought this lot of exactly as I'm selling it, except for putting approximately 200 rounds through the Delton using a friends lower and throwing in some ammo. I'm in over my head trying to pay for it with accumulating bills and Christmas approaching, so I'm selling in hopes that once I pay everything off, I can buy a complete rifle that I can afford."

The upper receiver is Mil-Spec, machined from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum forgings and coated with a phosphate hard anodized finish. Carbine length. Has a 16” 1 in 7 inch twist chrome lined and phosphate coated barrel. It uses Sig Sauer's dependable direct-impingement gas operating system that uses a rotating locking bolt. Has Magpul foregrip, A2 front and flip-up rear sights, and a quick detatch sling mount. 

-One complete Delton upper assembly, Mil-Spec. Has had 300 to 400 rounds through it and has been very well cleaned and taken care of. The upper receiver is forged 7075 T6 aluminum, A3 type flat top. Receiver is hard coat anodized. Bore's surface is coated with dry film lube. Carbine length. The carrier assembly is phosphated 8620 steel with a Carpenter 158 type bolt. Both carrier and bolt are heat treated and plated. Interior of carrier and carrier key are chrome lined. Barrel is 16"" made of 4140 steel with a 1x9 twist, manganese phosphated and phosphated under gas block. Has quick sling attachment. 

*Both uppers come with the factory box, manual, and lock.

*I'm really looking to sell everything as a package. I will include:

-TruGlo 4x32 illuminated scope mounted on the Delton upper. Made of a solid piece of aircraft grade aluminum. Has a Mil-Dot reticle. The reticle is illuminated green or red.

$1,000 for everything. That's allotting $600 +/- for M400, $300 +/- for Delton, $70 +/- for scope. Then the mags and ammo.


I've always owned guns, just never been familiar with this platform. I had been considering buying an Ar for years, then the scare happened last year and I freaked out not knowing if I would ever be able to get one, so I set out looking to buy anything and everything Ar related. I bought all this stuff as a lot from a guy that works with my friend because I work a lot and I don't have time to go wait on stores to open so I can get ammo, mags, and guns. I knew I was probably paying too much, but given the circumstances, I bought this stuff anyways. I bought this lot of exactly as I'm selling it, except for putting approximately 200 rounds through the Delton using a friends lower and throwing in some ammo. I'm in over my head trying to pay for it with accumulating bills and Christmas approaching, so I'm selling in hopes that once I pay everything off, I can buy a complete rifle that I can afford."

There is a scam going around that everyone needs to be made aware of. People are sending payments for goods via ""certified bank cheque"" then they email before the cheque arrives stating that they will have a ""mover"" to come pick the item up from you. It's usually some excuse of ""I'm too busy with work"" or some crap. Then they say that there was a mistake and that the money for you and their ""mover "" was ""accidentally"" put all on one cheque and they need you to wire transfer the left over money to their ""mover"". The cheques are FAKE!! A guy was wanting to buy a target from me. The target was only $350.00. The cheque I got in the mail was for $1,980.24! Who the freakin crap pays that much for a $350 item. My bank spotted the cheque as a fake instantly. I know some of you will read this and will have known this for a while. This is for people who are still clueless to this type of scam. If I had cashed the check succuessfully, it would have bounced in a few days and I would owe the money back to the bank! Beware folks, these scumbags are literally everywhere. This all transpired on Craigslist but I figure its only a matter of time before these S.O.B's find out about armslist. Sellers beware! Stay vigilant!"

617,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2356617,For Sale:  Two compete uppers. 1 new 1 used,"Near downtown, Tuscaloosa, Alabama","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, November 20, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling my small collection of Ar15 stuff. I have::

-One complete Sig Sauer M400 Enhanced upper assembly. New in box. The upper receiver is Mil-Spec, machined from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum forgings and coated with a phosphate hard anodized finish. Carbine length. Has a 16” 1 in 7 inch twist chrome lined and phosphate coated barrel. It uses Sig Sauer's dependable direct-impingement gas operating system that uses a rotating locking bolt. Has Magpul foregrip, A2 front and flip-up rear sights, and a quick detatch sling mount. 

-One complete Delton upper assembly, Mil-Spec. Has had 300 to 400 rounds through it and has been very well cleaned and taken care of. The upper receiver is forged 7075 T6 aluminum, A3 type flat top. Receiver is hard coat anodized. Bore's surface is coated with dry film lube. Carbine length. The carrier assembly is phosphated 8620 steel with a Carpenter 158 type bolt. Both carrier and bolt are heat treated and plated. Interior of carrier and carrier key are chrome lined. Barrel is 16"" made of 4140 steel with a 1x9 twist, manganese phosphated and phosphated under gas block. Has quick sling attachment. 

*Both uppers come with the factory box, manual, and lock.

*I'M LOOKING TO SELL EVERYTHING AS A PACKAGE. I will include:

-TruGlo 4x32 illuminated scope mounted on the Delton upper. Made of a solid piece of aircraft grade aluminum. Has a Mil-Dot reticle. The reticle is illuminated green or red.
-2 new in plastic gen1 pmags
-2 new in plastic GI anti tilt follower mags 
-60 rds Federal xm193
-50 rounds Winchester FMJ .223
...as seen in picture


$1,000 for everything. That's allotting $600 +/- for M400, $350 +/- for Delton, $70 +/- for scope. Then the mags and ammo.

**To the guys making such offers as:  ""Will you sell just the Delton upper for $250?"" .. the answer is... NO. You couldn't even buy a stripped upper and BCG for $250, much less a complete upper. I understand that it's used, but be realistic. I'm not wasting my time answering dumb offers. By saying X amount is allotted for an item, that's simply justifying the price of the package, THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT IS THE PRICE THAT EACH ITEM IS WORTH IF IT WERE BY ITSELF. If I wanted to go through the pain of selling everything separately, I wouldn't have made this huge detailed add explaining everything as a package deal. I'm selling the whole package exactly as it is listed.

I've always owned guns, just never been familiar with this platform. I had been considering buying an Ar for years, then the scare happened last year and I freaked out not knowing if I would ever be able to get one, so I set out looking to buy anything and everything Ar related. I bought all this stuff as a lot from a guy that works with my friend because I work a lot and I don't have time to go wait on stores to open so I can get ammo, mags, and guns. I knew I was probably paying too much, but given the circumstances, I bought this stuff anyways. I bought this lot of exactly as I'm selling it, except for putting approximately 200 rounds through the Delton using a friends lower and throwing in some ammo. I'm in over my head trying to pay for it with accumulating bills and Christmas approaching, so I'm selling in hopes that once I pay everything off, I can buy a complete rifle that I can afford."

The P11 is a perfect piece for carry in that it is the smallest double stack 9 on the market (smaller than a pf9 + restrike capability if a round doesnt ingnite).  10 + 1 in a small package.

The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) R&D developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF; and the TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR®,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR® underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR® began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR® then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR® was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR® rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR® rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.

 IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR® SAR rifle.

Sightmark now features a Circle Dot Duplex reticle that adds to the line of award winning Sightmark Triple Duty riflescopes. Sightmark's Circle Dot Duplex reticle is based on the World War II German Sniper Rifle, designed for moving targets and quick target acquisition.

The fully multi-coated optics transmit a bright and crisp picture that makes tracking and shooting targets quick and easy. The 2.5-10x32 features a one-piece 30mm tube that increases light transmission and field of view. O-ring sealed and nitrogen purged, the 2.5-10x32 is both fog proof and water resistant. This precision scope features a parallax adjustment knob and oversized, locking windage and elevation turrets with ¼” MOA clicks, providing an additional level of accuracy and ensures that the scope stays zeroed. The Triple Duty series of riflescopes are complimentary to any shooter’s arsenal.

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The rifle design borrowed heavily from the AK-47 and had a modified gas diversion system similar to the AK-47 to reduce the recoil of the rifle making it easier to fire especially in automatic mode.[2] The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries."
