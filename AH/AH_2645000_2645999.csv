(I have limited space)  It is set up to load 40 S&W and has the 9mm, 38/357 and 45 ACP dies and shell plates (Dillon charges $85 for each caliber of these).  It has the front mount (up-grade) empty case holder that makes it faster to load, the tools and tool holder and extra parts and maintenance items for the machine are pictured.  This is a progressive loader and with a little practice/experience you can load 300 to 400 rounds per hour.  (Dillon claims 400 to 500 rounds per hour, but I am old fat and slow)  All Dillon machines have a no-BS life time warrantee, if something breaks Dillon sends a replacement, free.

Initial load development has several groups under ½” @ 100 yards using Varget and Sierra 52gr MK’s . Comes with weaver base.
Also included is a Remingtom 4-12x scope.
Prefer to do a face to face but can ship this if need be.
No trades considered at this time, I have several items to sell to fund other projects.
Can call or text also at 270-791-zero, six, one, one
Thanks for looking.

 Very simple to use, Do not have to slide back a slide like most semi-autos. You fill the mag with 8 rounds and install mag. Then, you flip the lever and the back of the barrel tips up. You install 1 round in the barrel and put on the saftey. Then close the barrel. When the first round is fired the pistol starts to feed ammo from the magazine..

  Never fired - In the box. Retail is $279-$299..muy price is $240.00 and no tax...

Designed to perform, the Silver Pigeon II is also as beautiful to the eye as it is to the touch. The oil-f inished stock is select walnut with a traditional Schnabel fore-end; bold game-scene engraving separates it from other shotguns. This over-under also enjoys the Beretta’s legendary pointability, thanks to the 680 series low-profile receiver. Furthermore, the absolute strength of the unique locking system provides for years of trouble-free use."

The hammer pins have been replaced with H pins from cajun gun works as well. I was hopping to keep this for range shooting as the all steel frame and slide would make for a real soft 9mm.

pre-owned

S.V.I. INFINITY 1911 or 2011s and other high-end full custom 1911-2011 style pistols
prices have to be reasonable and based in reality. fair market value from $1300-$2000

if you have a morris,harrison,nighthawk or any highend 1911 just email me with what your bottom line cash price is.

no B.S.,no unrealistic prices, you cannot sell your pistol private party for what you bought it for retail. just as you would buy even an SS CAMERO your going to have to take a % loss on your investment. however I pay more than gunshop trade in values and pawnshops. I have an A+ rating with gunbroker and I do have an FFL to ship to.
I can have funds paid within 1-day using paypal or 3 days with a postal money order.
if you want to sell your 1911 or 2011 send me pics and a detailed breakdown of what aftermarket parts you have used,trigger pull weight,sight brand,grip material,etc"

580 serial number (thicker barrel) Mini 14 ranch rifle with less then 500 rounds down the tube. Inside the action shows a little wear in bluing, but that's just because it was on display and taken to a couple gun shows earlier in the year before I bought it new in Dec 2010. Comes with two stocks -original walnut stock- has couple dings from being my truck gun,  also comes with a pro mag Archangel Sparta stock I picked up in 2012, has sat in safe since.

I installed a magpul rail on the bottom of stock, as well as swivel nut for a bi pod. But holes are in the right place, if you just want to replace with bigger rail instead. Both stocks have heat shields, wooden has original, and I put a replacement in the Sparta stock so switching- stocks takes maybe a couple minutes. Here is a video of me switching out the stocks -

It comes with the original Kimber magazine, an extra Kimber magazine, and a Wilson Combat magazine. It comes with the original Crimson Trace laser grip, a Kimber carbon fiber grip, and a Hogue rubber grip. I have around $1750.00 invested in this gun and the extras.

I guess most do not know what these are... but I can tell you if you drink fine spirits then this is one you need to truly think about...
I can pass you links showing what just a few of these are worth! they range from from $9.00 to $88.00 per mini bottle full....
there are 38 FULL mini bottles

Celebrate The SeaHawks Supper Bowl Win with the rarest mini bottles around!!!! once in a lifetime chance to taste these!!!!

ok I have some very very very Rare and very old mini bottle collection!!!
they start in the 1940's to the 1960's so all are 70 to 50yrs old no matter what!
THEY SAY ALOCHOL DOSEN'T AGE AFTER IT LEAVES THE CASK!!! WRONG!
I have personally drank about 20 of these over the last 13yrs and they are smooth and have a taste that is way way better then store bought bottles!!!
now there are some real rare bottles because the companys went out of business in the 50s even though they made real good alcohol, this means if you drink or use them in making food dishes they can never be duplicated, now a days by the time you get a good brand mini bottle out the door it is about $5++ after taxes
for the bottles empty alone they book from $7-$52.00 for a empty mini bottle!
they had no price value of them full because most don't exist!!!!
I put a flat $10 each trade value for the bottles, the liquid inside is free and at your own risk if you drink it. but I know for a fact it is ALL still good... so of course even though I am trading for the bottles alone you still need to be 21 with proper ID
some of the Tax stamps on the bottles date to 1944 there are all types including Corn whiskey moonshine, tea, brandy and more to many to list all about 38
so will trade at $400 is worth $500/700 for the bottles alone!
have more pics. just make an offer
for the right offer I have some rare wines 
I would do it all, would make for that one of a kind Man Cave Bar, that no one has seen these liquors, great for the Chief who cooks with these, 1 of a kind food dishes!!!!!

SO MANY WAYS TO KEEP, STORE, DISPLAY, OR USE, BUT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
PS. I WILL DRINK ANYONE OF THE WHISKEYS YOU PICK TO PROVE THEY ARE JUST FINE IF WE HAVE A TRADE, SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE WORTH MORE THEN JUST THE RARE BOTTLES I'M TRADING OFF!!!!! but you will be 1 less then and I get a treat lol

Need the money for another pistol worth $700, so that's the only reason I'm selling them. H&K 416 is near brand new and looks perfect. I got it new and I've only shot maybe 300rds through it. Sig bought used but is in great shape.  Price is low with the extras included! Text for more pics.

“I am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.”

“I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class. The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.

 Thank you again for the class.”

I don't think it needs to be said, but Sig Sauer is the one of the most trusted and top performing manufacturers of handguns and is used by several government agencies including Navy Seals, DOD, and many others. Once you shoot one, you instantly understand why. I will take $750 for the gun (has two 15-round magazines). I say this because it is still practically new with not a single blemish on it, there are no taxes, background checks, or other hassles. I have the TAC-PAC accessories if wanted for an additional $200, this includes the Stage 2 hip holster and the Sig laser/flashlight combo that mounts on the rail. I don't need to get rid of the TAC-PAC because I plan on purchasing another SIG that will work with the Holster. Everything is in Mint condition. The picture I have shown is just a stock photo.

Up for sale/trade is a beautiful Beretta 92F Italian Made 9mm with 2, 15-Round magazines, box, paperwork, cleaning rod and lock cable. This firearm is in near MINT condition and is a nail driver. At 7-10 yards (21-30 feet) this is an absolute nail driver. And, you don't feel any recoil while shooting. Absolutely excellent trooper. I have a couple of these and 1 I shoot all the time. This one, not so much. So, don't want it to just sit and not get usage so maybe someone else is out there looking for a great Beretta and would want to buy/trade into this one.

The Sauer K98k S/147 by J.P. Sauer & Sohn was one of the oldest gun makers in Germany. Sauer had made Gew. 98 rifles for Imperial Germany in WW I. Their line of' pocket pistols were well known throughout the world and had been widely used by the German military and police forces of the 20th century.
 After the end of the First World War Sauer continued in the firearms business, and thus was ideally suited to be one of the prime contractors for the new German K98k rifle. When German re-armament began in 1933, Sauer was assigned the manufacturer's code “S/147 only 10,000 s/147 rifles were made in 1933.  Many were lost or destroyed during the war.

Also bought the RTK Short stroke to install along with the kit which is 50 dollars. So i have about 700 dollars in it total. Shoots like a dream and you won't find another like it anywhere.

I bought this gun BRAND NEW as a Christmas present for myself less than a month ago. I have gone out to shoot it twice and have shot about 100 rounds through it. I absolutely love this gun and so not want to get rid of it, however, I need cash for auto repair a for my vehicle ASAP. It has NEVER jammed no matter what bullet type I have put through it. FMJ, hollow points, etc... which is why military and policeman use it. willing to go to range to test **for serious buyers only** The 4 1/4 barrel allows shooters to shoot very accurately. It is a PERFECT home defense weapon. The gun has very good feel (fit) in hand and is easy to shoot , as kick is good balance. My mother and sister who have never shot a pistol were comfortable shooting it.

The guns barrel is 4 1/4 which allows for concealed weapons permit and extremely good accuracy. The gun includes: (2) 15 round clips, 3 different size hand grips, (unopened) trigger lock and keys, original lockable case, plug and bulldog (belt or clip on) holster (which holds extra clip as well). Asking $525 OBO. Also have plenty of ammo. 

Serious buyers only please call or text Brock at REDACTED.
no one with criminal records please.
**note: as I posted above the only reason I am selling this is because of a very costly auto repair and have to have vehicle for work. I would be willing to buy back within a month with interest. I have well over $100 in ammo that can be used as interest or is for sale."
