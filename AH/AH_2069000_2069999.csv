You've been asking for a couple heavy 45 AUTO RIM standard pressure loads, so by popular demand, here they are. Both of these loads utilize high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the ballistic equivalent of +P 45 ACP loads, yet they operate at standard 45 ACP pressures. These loads are safe to use in ANY 45 ACP revolver that is in normal operating condition, including ANY model 1917 Colt or S&W revolver.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch MT Gun gives velocities almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch barrels. This is not a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel.

Item # 31A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 869 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 795 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 880 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 875 FPS

 Item # 31A was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot through stick frame and dry wall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 27 inches of penetration through live flesh and bone."

Its hunting season.  If interested send an offer as I will be listing on ebay  soon (I just hate their anti everything I stand for rules and fees)

I put this together and fired it a few times, never took into the woods or anything yet.  The scope isn't sighted in yet, I only test fired it.  At the time I bought it I had my heart set on another bow, the Horton Fury, but it was out of stock.  I ended up picking up the one I wanted in time for hunting season so now I don't have a need for this one.  This is a really nice compact bow.  Truthfully it won't break my heart if I don't get a decent offer and end up keeping 2 bows, so please make realistic offers as I will not give it away.  I can email you all the pictures you want.  I will ship it, buyer pays actual shipping.  If shipped we need to use a secure payment method for the actual purchase to protect both parties, I believe paypal can be used for crossbows.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

This can be a perfect home defense weapon or a great small game hunting weapon.  It could also make a perfect birthday or Christmas present for a youth for a 1st gun.  I still own my original single shot 12 ga from 1954 and it was a great gun to own.  This gun is in just like new condition so it would be perfect to give as a present.  The 410 is a great gun for small game or it can be used for home defense.  I killed an alligator with one shot with a 3 shot bolt action shotgun with a slug in it.  It made a hold big enough to put a coke can in.  One of the benefits of a 410 is very little kick to them and for a youth, it prepares them to move up to something larger.  They may decide they like the 410 better as they get up in years.  Let's remember also not to leave the small female out.

Reason for selling is because I rarely use it and I'm building a few AR-15's right now. If you have read any reviews online about this gun almost all of them are positive! From what I was told, this carries a 1 year warranty from Mossberg and I can provide the original sales receipt. 

I'm willing to travel within an hour or so from my home. 

The gun comes with everything as if you were purchasing it new (lock, manual, box, etc). I'm asking $530 cash or best offer. As far as trades...I like the following brands, FN, HK, Colt, Springfield (XD), Beretta, S&W (revolver only). I also like AR-15 uppers and lowers as I'm building a few right now (Rock River, CMMG, Colt, S&W, Daniel Defense. If you have something and I didn't list it, send me a message any way to let me know what you have. No Subcompact pistols please.

PRODUCED  1956 - 1959
In 1956 Ruger introduced a “Lightweight” version of its Single-Six revolver.  The first Lightweights had an alloy cylinder frame, alloy cylinder, alloy grip frame, and steel barrel.  All Lightweights had a  standard 4-5/8 inch barrel. The first guns weighed 23 ounces versus the 35 ounce weight of the standard 5-1/2 inch barrel Single-Six.  The guns are roll-marked on the cylinder frame just like the standard Single-Six model, the word Lightweight does not appear in the roll-mark.  The first production guns had a silver/gray anodized cylinder frame, black anodized grip frame, flat cartridge loading gate, blued barrel, and Black checkered hard rubber grips.  They also had a coating on the alloy cylinder, the coating was known as “Martin Hard Coat”.  It was a brown or dark golden color (sometimes appears greenish or another color).  These first guns became known to collectors as the “Tri-color” Lightweight.

The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances where most altercations occur, or for longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sight, fiber optic front sight and Taurus Ribber Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

This is a very modular pistol, being that you can shoot .40SW with only a barrel that will drop right in. You can also buy a 9mm conversion barrel to shoot 9mm as well.

I don't need to sell it, but would consider a trade for another quality pistol chambered in either 9mm or 45 acp. (I like XD's & XDm's but am open to other quality pistols.) I like S&W revolvers as well. If you have something you'd like to trade, feel free to send me an email and I'll respond promptly.

Raven Phantom LC Glock 30 with Viridian C5L,"Berks County, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 80,"Listed On: Sunday, October 20, 2013",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Like New, Little bit of use. Raven Concealment Systems- Phantom LC Holster for Glock 30 with Viridian C5L. Working on Glock G30 Gen3, G30SF, G30 Gen4 and G29. No working on G30s. 

The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians.

The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.

We construct the body of the holster from thin, high-strength Kydex-T. We chose to use a pancake-style design in order to minimize bulk and distribute the weight of the firearm over a wider area on the belt. The “outside” portion of the holster body fully enshrouds the weapon from ejection port to muzzle. The “inside” or “body-side” portion of the holster incorporates a full-length body shield. This enhances comfort and aids in re-holstering, while simultaneously protecting the controls of the pistol."

This gun is functionally sound and has displayed no mechanical deficiencies after 250 rounds of modern production ammo.

This pistol is chambered in 7.62x25 tokarev and was manufactured in 1954 as evidenced by the stampings on the frame. It does not have the markings stamped into the frame indicating it was ever rearsenaled in the 1970's, so it is in as close to original condition and configuration as they come. Most examples of these pistols were monkeyed around with in the rearsenaling programs in the 70's, i.e. having the original powdered phosphate finish stripped and a hot blued finish applied, original internal components replaced with newer parts, etc. If you look at most examples of this pistol being sold locally through backpage and armslist they have a blued finish indicating that they are rearsenals.

The changes to the gun are as follows:
- Modern production synthetic grips (they came with the gun when I got it).
- Modern Harrington Products hardened steel replacement firing pin (the original was broken when I got it).

This pistol will come with two 8-round magazines, a modern production manual thumb-actuated slide release lever, the original (broken) firing pin and firing pin retaining plunger. I do not have the original leather flap holster.

The price is $350 but this amount is negotiable to a degree. Don't hesitate to make me a reasonable offer. AZ driver's license required, CCW holder preferred.

If you want to buy it, it will cost you $1450 firm.

-5.56 or .223
-Comes with (2) Sig 30 round mags
-Comes with original factory carry case
-Comes with original factory manual
-Double Diamond buffer tube adapter installed and operational.  For those of you who are unaware of the DDLES buffer tube adapter, the original Sig 556 SWAT came with a folding stock that was proprietary to the Sig rifle.  This meant that you could not change out the stock for something else.  Double Diamond made a limited amount of buffer tube adapters that allowed for a buffer tube to be installed in place of the factory stock, so that you could put any stock you want on the rifle.  This piece is rare and it cost me a pretty penny once I found it.
-UTG buffer tube kit (Mil-spec) installed
-Smith and Wesson factory AR-15 adjustable stock installed.
-H&K style factory sights
-Adjustable gas block
-Factory quad rail installed.
-Coast flashlight installed on the quad rail with push button switch

Here's what I'm looking for:

A QUALITY AR-15/M-4 for a SOPMOD build that I'm doing.  I prefer Colt, specifically a LE6920, but will entertain other offers similar but not limited to:

-Daniel Defense
-Higher end Rock River Arms
-Higher end Bushmasters
-Noveske

-LWRC

Examples of what I'm NOT interested in:
-DPMS
-CORE
-New Frontier Arms
-Entry level Bushmaster, RRA's, etc.


If the fair market value of your rifle is less than mine, you will be expected to add cash on your side.  For example, LE6920's are now going for as low as $1000 online.  So, I will not do an even trade for a stock LE6920.  Be fair and be reasonable with your offers.  Your rifle is not made of gold."

It features an 18"" Heavy Match Stainless barrel with a versatile 1:8"" twist rate. A twist rate of 1:8"" offers excellent stabilization of the longer, heavier bullets preferred by the military and long range shooters, as well as the shorter, lighter, more readily available bullets preferred by varminters and plinkers.

The muzzle is threaded and has a RRA Tactical Muzzle Brake installed.

This rifle features a high performance .223 Wylde chamber, designed as a match chamber for semi-automatic rifles. It accomodates both .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO, and offers a shorter throat for improved accuracy and a relieved case body for more reliable extraction.

A Chrome Bolt Carrier Group is installed, offering excellent corrosion resistance and improved performance. The lower receiver is Forged Aluminum and has a bevelled magazine well for quicker, easier reloads, and features RRA's Star Safety Selector and Winter Trigger Guard.

For those who aren't familiar with the M2, it uses an inertia system with no gas tubes or seals.  It is all metal, with just one moving part to pull out.  Cleaning and disassembly is a breeze, and Benneli claims these things will go more than 500,000 rounds without any repairs."

The G&L Comanche® is Leo's final word on the traditional double-cutaway bolt-on axe. Fact is, the first thing you'll notice about the Comanche is the distinctive shape of the Magnetic Field Design™ Z-Coil™ pickups designed by Leo Fender† himself. These pickups deliver a bright and sparkly top end while offering a robust bottom end, all without any 60-cycle hum.

You'll find plenty of power in the Z-coil pickups, but what's surprising is how glassy and detailed they become as you roll back the volume and bass controls, the latter a part of the Comanche's PTB™ (Passive Treble and Bass) system. What's more, the Comanche includes a mini-toggle expander switch to allow neck+bridge or all three pickups together. In a pinch, the neck+bridge combo does a convincing faux ASAT® Special. Talk about versatile!

Making the most of this delicious combo is Leo's Dual-Fulcrum vibrato, a work of engineering art which allows bending up or down with unsurpassed stability, while offering a silky feel through its beefy aluminum vibrato arm.

The Comanche was the very last double-cutaway bolt-on guitar designed by Leo Fender, the culmination of everything he had learned during his amazing lifetime. Founded by Leo Fender in 1980, the Comanche and all G&L USA instruments continue to be made in the historic G&L facility on Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California, the Birthplace of Bolt-on™.

Due to the offset pickup design, the Comanche is available in Right-Hand only.
