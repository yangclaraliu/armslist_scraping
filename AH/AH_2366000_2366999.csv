http://youtu.be/ej39umHaB08
This is the modern heavy-barrel version of the Mini-14 for greater accuracy, not the older pencil-barrel. I've fired only 36 rounds of American Eagle AR 5.56 from this rifle, the first 20 being the proper break-in procedure (shoot, clean, shoot, clean, etc.) for long-term accuracy. Although it is a beautiful classic rifle design with modern accoutrements and functions flawlessly, after a year I figured that I just don't shoot it often enough to warrant keeping it. In any rate, Christmas is coming up...

This mini-14 will come with the original Ruger 5 round hunting magazine, the original box with all the paperwork and accessories.

Also available separately are three new factory Ruger 20-round magazines, unused and never inserted in the magwell.

I acquired this firearm last summer and it wasn't in the best of shape. My plan was to make it a project then give it to my younger brothers up north so they could have something to use during muzzleloader season. 

I did my best cleaning the barrel and the rest of it, but it's still not pretty. However, it does function and pretty darn good. I'm deciding to sell it now because I'm not going to be able to make it up north to give it to them this year, so I'd give someone a chance to pick up a muzzleloader on the cheap. 

As I said, this thing isn't in the best condition by any means, but the price reflects that. However, it's not a dud. I have it sighted in right now and the group you see below are about 2"" apart at 80 yards. I use 300 gr. powershock with 150g of Triple 7 pyrodex pellets and it's on. Not as accurate as something a bit more expensive, but keep in mind I'm not the best shot either, so your groups may very well be tighter. 

Bottom line is that if you want to muzzleload hunt this year, but don't have the coin for a $300+ set up, this is for you. It will put venison in the freezer for sure. 


I'm pretty firm on the price, but not unreasonable by any means. I will also trade: 

- Firearms of any other type.
- Ammo.
- Cord of seasoned firewood. 
- Tools.
- Hunting/fishing stuff.

Not sure of year of manufacture. Many arsenal marks and cartouches on barrel and receiver and underbarrel bottom of receiver. Original sights removed and hunter/aftermarket sights placed on barrel. Drift front sight is loose and can be easily replaced/repaired.  Fold down small rear sight. Rifle is in a sporterized, montecarlo style wooden stock. Has the bi-pod/sling swivel stud on forward stock and on the rear. Stock has some scratches and can easily be refinished. Bluing on receiver is lightly worn. NO RUST OR PITTING.
Bolt has been jeweled, is smooth as ice and locks as tight as new. Rifling is mint. Lands and grooves are strong and again no signs of rust or pitting. Also has a Timney adjustable trigger installed. Clean crisp glass rod like trigger break.
Aside from the cosmetic this is a great hunting rifle. I carried it in Alaska as my Elk, browny gun. receiver wear is from leather back pack saddle i had at the time.
The action and trigger work made this old war horse a wonderful companion.
I am selling as i have not used this rifle since i left alaska 10 years ago. Its time to find a home as i no longer hunt anything that large.

The receiver is tapped and i am sure there are better mounts out there than the Weaver company base included with the rifle.

Boy, do I hate to sell this guy, but I just never get to shoot it anymore!  The first time I saw this I laughed because the barrel is SO DAMN BIG....It's like a CANNON!

I bought this last year because I was hunting deer on private property and the owner stipulated that I needed to hunt with a shotgun.  I needed to be able to shoot from 100+ yards, so a slug gun was an ideal choice.  I killed 3 deer with this last year (just moved from North Carolina, where you're allowed 6 white tail per year with one $50 license).

Remember the old cartoons when Yosemite Sam or the Coyote would get shot with a cannon and you could see clear through him?  Yeah, well that's what happens to deer that get shot with a sabot slug shot through this beast.  This is a take-down MACHINE.

The scope is TOP NOTCH -- a Leupold L-250 Shotgun/Muzzleloader VX-1 3-9 x 40mm.  

Below is a link to a web page with info and pricing on the scope (LR Duplex, matte finish).  It's clean and in great condition.
http://www.leupold.com/hunting-shooting/scopes/vx-1-riflescopes/vx-1-3-9x40mm-includes-shotgunmuzzleloader

This piece is bulky, but a ton of fun to shoot.  It's nice and clean with one very minor, shallow scratch in the bluing.  The best rounds to shoot out of this are Sabot Slugs, which are unrifled (you don't need rifled slugs because the barrel is rifled).  They're expensive ($18 for a box of 5) , but I'll throw in a few boxes that I have.

The 915 is basically the very same, rock solid, dead nuts reliable pistol w/ the same milled steel internal parts as the 5904 in a more 'utilitarian' form & was an iconic gun with many law enforcement agencies during the 1990's... sort of like what the Model 28 Highway Patrolman .357 magnum was to the shinier Model 27 revolver in previous decades.
 Read the reviews if you are unfamiliar with this pistol; but if you want accuracy, function, and high capacity in a great all-around 9mm for not a lot of cash- you'll never go wrong with a 915. 
 This gun is mechanically excellent, very smooth action (double & single), and very tight & light due to it's quality alloy frame. It does have some slight carry wear on the edges, and a few tiny nicks in the finish, but still looks great & always shoot like a champ with any ammo.
 It comes in a S&W case that fits it great- (but was originally for an M&P), & has (3) 15 rnd. factory mags, & a Pachmayer finger-groove slip-on grip. I'm asking $400 for the pkg. but will add a very nice hand boned brown Don Hume shoulder holster rig with mag pouches for an additional $100. I think the holster was made for a SIG 9mm, but it fits this gun just as well.
 This is a very high quality pistol that many LE officers, (as well as many other folks), have bet their lives on in the past, and will continue to be a great bet for a long, long time. Nothin' fancy- just a great little 9mm workhorse.  S&W got it right with these older autos and they have earned their excellent reputation among the shooting community. Let me know if you need more info.                                                        Thanks"

This rifle is very nice and fun to shoot, it has a graphite wrapped barrel which makes it super light. It has a blackhawk knoxx adjustable stock on it as well. Magnum Research used Ruger's 10/22 design for this so the receiver and load system are somewhat identical other than quality.

Standard military issue 5.5"" barrel, blade sights, lanyard ring, and has all the military hallmarks and govt. property stamps. 

The m1917 revolver is in great shape.  It is a real US Army issue piece from WWI -- not one of the less valuable Brazilian issue guns.  These guys go from $1000-$2500 on gunbroker, and are a good investment or collector piece as well as being fun to shoot.

This gun is wearing a set of valuable and sought after ""diamond"" grips with inset brass S&W escutcheons.  These grips may or may not be original to the gun (official sources disagree on this point), but they are period correct for the teens and 20s, and look really sharp. 

Comes with a bunch of full and half moonclips.

Historical Details: 
Smith & Wesson produced approximately 169,595 U.S. Army Model 1917 Revolvers between 1917 and 1919. The first contract WAR-ORD-14451-R31 was dated August 8th, 1917 for 100,000 revolvers at $14.75 each.  This was the first of two contracts to provide Model 1917s to the U.S. Army. 

This example has the ordnance acceptance mark of GHS (Col. Gilbert H. Stewart) which is only seen on approximately the first 40,000 revolvers produced -- less then 25% of the S&W M1917 revolvers have the GHS stamp.  The butt is marked “US Army Model 1917- No 35XXX”. This very early production has the better commercial style finish from earlier in production when they were still taking their time and making 'em right."

I have owned it about 1 month (can show receipt for proof if you so desire).

I have shot it a grand total of 4 times. Why am I selling it? Because I am terrible at using a bow. I have found I much prefer pulling a trigger, so these fund will go towards building another AR. SO there you have it.

Anyways, the bow is hard to find cause they are currently out of stock for the holiday season and when they are in stock they dont last long. Took me about 1 1/2 month to get mine. 

This package includes Bow, 3 feather Arrows with field tips, 2 strings, string silencer (never installed), arm guard, and a UTV 6 Can pack that has been converted into a Bow holder and quiver. Price for all was well over $250. And as stated above, like brand new. All items were purchased from the Primal Website except the holder/quiver. So it is everything recommended specifically for this bow. Same bow Dave Canterbury (from Dual Survival) used to take down an Elk.

The limbs can be removed to convert bow from right to left hand, replace limbs, or interchange with different draw weight limbs.Fold the limbs into the side of the handle for transport and it forms its own compact and durable carrying case. It is 23 inches long x 1.5 x 1.5 inches when closed and opened is a total 59"" in length. This traditional bow is a long bow, but it is anything but traditional. The folding bow design, with its aluminum riser and fiberglass bow limbs is built to survive the apocalypse, put food on the table, and defend you when you need a silent and powerful self defense weapon. It is a must have for a prepper who wants to maximize their space. Weighing in at 2.25 lbs., it is lightweight and can be carried in or strapped to just about any pack or bug out bag.

This Colt Sistema is a unique piece of history with unique markings and modifications for custom carry, simply one of a kind. The serial number from 24xxx indicates that it was one of 6000 made in the first year of Argentine production, many of which were destroyed. The modifications include a 4lb trigger, upgraded sights, and polished hammer for the lightest and smoothest pull that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing on any 1911, also the barrel and firing pin have been replaced. Included are several sets of grips, two 7rd magazine, and one 8rd magazine. I will obviously run the required background check. I am open to trade for pistols.

Genuine Nokia Lumia 820/920 Wireless Charging Plate DT-900
Effortless Charging 
No more fumbling with messy cables. No more breaking delicate connectors. No more hassle. Just plug the station into a wall outlet, forget about it and the next time the battery runs low, drop it to charge. Form follows function, and that can be seen in our unobtrusive charging plate, elegant stand, attention-grabbing sound speaker or surprising headset design. 
The first of our wireless charging accessory range is the Nokia Wireless Charging Plate DT-900. This thin slate will become the new “home” for your Smartphones – at home, at the office, wherever there’s a stable and flat surface waiting – so they can relieve themselves of the worry of drained batteries. 
Its design matches not only the award-winning Lumia device range, but looks (and works) with other Smartphones lying on top of it. 
The DT-900 comes in a variety of colors intended to either blend into its surroundings or boldly stand out. Once plugged into a nearby outlet, the DT-900 charges on contact with Qi-enabled wireless charging products, whether produced by Nokia or other manufacturers. 
Our range of wireless charging accessories comes with a large charging surface which means there is no need for precise alignment between phone and charger. 
Wire coils found inside compatible products receive power when they come near charging stations, recharging batteries with efficiency rates rivaling the average wired charger (in fact, it’s over 80% as efficient). Even though the coils and station never actually come into physical contact (as the back cover remains between them), energy flows and recharging happens when the two are in close proximity (typical range of 3mm). This technology is called “inductive” or “closely coupled” charging. 
All of our wireless charging products also feature the latest advances in Foreign Object Detection, which means they don’t become active if someone accidentally drops keys, paper clips or any object that’s not specifically designed to be charged wirelessly.

It's a 'Colt 1911/Series 80/ Mark IV/ Gold Cup National Match/ Stainless Steel/ 'Enhanced Version'/ in .45 ACP'. 
Whew!
 In spite of; (or maybe BECAUSE?) of all that- it's a great Colt 1911.
The 'Enhanced' version of the Cold Cup Nat'l. Match guns were only produced for a short span back in the 1990s, & are kind of scarce. They have the ribbed barrel, an undercut frame, & some other features that make them unique among 1911s....I'm no 1911 expert, but I really like the feel & function this gun. It's a target pistol, so it's very accurate (duh) too. One thing I did change was the flat main spring housing, (original is polymer), with an Ed Brown arched type. I also took off the wrubberwrapawround Colt grips & slapped on a pr. of Big Harry Ralph's scale patterned micarta/wood type grips because, personally- I just think it looks better thataway. NOT to worry; the original eqpt. will come w/ the gun & can be replaced in moments by a gunsmith ( or in minutes by the average dude). I also made SURE that the gun had the correct recoil spring for 230 gr. ammo before shooting some, so I put in one of Ed B's extra power recoil springs too. The one that was originally in the gun will also be included with purchase.
 This .45 has been babied & is in really wonderful condition, (NO worries!)- & will come w/ it's original stainless mag, PLUS 4 extra mags ( [3] Stainless Chip McCormick Power Mags, & another quality blued mag).
 It has no original box or papers; but I will throw in a plastic aftermarket case (wow) all for $1250.... CASH. If that works for you too, just let me know & I can send any pics or additional info that you need. 
I really hate to let this one go; it's LITERALLY like pullin' teeth...- but I (seriously) need to have some teeth pulled & have you priced a good dentist lately? OUCH!                                Cheers"

The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.
All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in our state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with our heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating. They are all MP tested on-site and are available in multiple configurations which includes barrel only (stripped); barrel with front sight base; barrel with Low Profile Gas Block; and barrel with front sight base, gas tube, and delta ring assembly (Complete). These barrels will prove themselves to be more accurate and last longer than a barrel that has cut or button rifling."

The gun is worth $200 at the low end.  Magazines are going for $35-$75 on gunbroker - these are in good shape so worth $50 each = $150.  I haven't seen these rounds selling for under $0.60 which is $240.  Metal ammo can included.  Basic red dot scope $30.

I want to sell it as a package deal.  Asking $400.  Not a bad little package for ""crap hits the fan"" situation either.

If interested, text me      904-nine9three- 6two3nine."

That is impressive for 22LR! It was ALWAYS cleaned properly after a range session. It comes with the factory iron sights and a Bushnell red dot. There is a total of 3 25 round magazines that will come loaded and ready to fire. I have the original box, paperwork and lock.  Also included in the sale are two boxes of 22LR (1,050 rounds).

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

Check them out here. It's the T3:

ThunderÂ® T3

Headband

Thunder series earmuffs are designed with all-day comfort in mind. Thunder headband earmuffs feature a unique dual headband for better positioning and breathability, and a non-deforming outer headband that minimizes pressure on the head. Plus, its dielectric construction withstands use and abuse, while protecting workers in electrical environments. The Thunder series features patented Air Flow Controlâ„¢ technology for optimal attenuation across all frequencies and also snap-in ear cushions for easy maintenance.

FEATURES

AIR FLOW CONTROLâ„¢ TECHNOLOGY

Howard Leight's patented Air Flow Control delivers optimal attenuation across all frequencies, without increasing earcup size or weight. A patented baseplate chamber and high-tech non-woven layer manage the flow of air inside the earmuff to control how sound reaches the ear. The result is better, more consistent overall attenuation for virtually all industrial noise environments. Air Flow Control is a standard feature on all Thunder series earmuffs.

- Dielectric construction suitable for all workplaces, especially electrical environments
- Uniform headband pressure for all head sizes, providing better comfort for long-term wear
- Non-deforming outer headband withstands rough treatment in the toughest workplaces
- Quick-Click height adjustment remains fixed during wear
- Snap-in ear cushions make replacement quick and easy"

I am a collector looking to trade my prized rifle for an equally valuable collector-grade Luger Pistol. I am specifically seeking a pre- 1939 pistol with all matching numbers. I prefer the looks of the 8"" barrel LP08 artillery luger but will consider very nice 4"" standard models or 6"" navy models. No modern production pistols. Extra long Commercial lengths may be considered. Commercial or Military issue are both welcomed. 9mm only. (Sorry 7.65 fans) I will consider refinished pistols if they were done extremely well and appear in 98%+ condition. A gun with nickel finish may be considered in perfect condition with matching #'s. No rust, minimal pitting, and 100% functionality are a must. No Russian captures or import markings- must be a WWI or WWII vet bring-back. The ideal pistol I am looking for would be a 1916-1918 DWM P08 or LP08 in 85%+ condition. A pistol that grandpa brought back from the war and was kept in a trunk for 70 years and rarely took out of the holster. Maybe you inherited one and want something with a bit more firepower and just as much cool factor and range appeal. 

To trade, I have a 1985 Ruger Mini-14 with the factory original walnut side-folding paratrooper stock. It is simply awesome. The original owner purchased the gun new from a dealer in California in 1985, fired 20 rounds through it in 1986, cleaned it meticulously and stored it in his closet. I purchased it and have fired 70 rounds through it just last month, cleaned it meticulously and stored it as well. So total round count is guaranteed at under 100. It is in 99%+ condition. Perfect bluing with matching blued stock (much rarer than the stainless model), perfect wood, perfect screws, mirror bore, and the lightest marks from racking the action and folding and latching the stock. It could easily be passed for brand new never fired condition. It is an absolute dream to shoot and makes pretty 2"" groups at 100 yards shooting PMC 55gr .223. Marked .223 caliber, but manual says it can fire 5.56 as well. It would make a great Christmas present for yourself.

The stock alone normally sells for $650 if you can find one in brand new condition. The gun itself is valued at at least $950 in the current market. I am also including a new synthetic side folding stock valued at $120 and a vintage 80's mossy oak camo hunting stock valued at $40. Also included is a new green nylon sling, one police surplus 20 round magazine, one new 30 round magazine, and two new 40 round magazines valued at $30-$40 each. In a retail setting, this is close to a $2,000 package. The gun itself with original stock books at over $1400. I am looking to trade for a very nice Luger pistol only, which would itself is valued at between $1,300 and $2,000. This would ideally be a straight across trade, gun for gun. Cash on your end if your Luger isn't in very good shape. I will be willing to flex on overall condition for especially collectable models (like artillery models or very early dates or with holster and extra magazines) If you think you may have a pistol I would be interested in, please send detailed pictures in an Email. The worst I can say is: ""No, thank you. Have a nice day.""

Cash offer on the package of $1,800. Lowball cash offers will not receive a response. A plethora of high resolution pictures of the Mini are available for serious buyers. Viewing can be arranged in early mornings Monday-Friday and Weekends. Cash or Luger trade only face to face, here in Arlington, Washington State. Meeting only at the Norpoint shooting range. I will not travel unless to trade. No shipping; no FFL transfers. This gun is not for sale anywhere else and has never been offered for sale before.

I respond to Emails promptly. Please, for the sake of continuity and clarity, no phone communications until pickup is arranged.

Thanks for looking!"

It's a long shot, but if anyone is in the same situation but reversed--has their Sig backed up by a Colt Mustang--and wants to swap, let me know. The Colt appears to cost a bit more so I will make up the difference with cash."
