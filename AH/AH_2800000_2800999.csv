Any how my plans have changed, and im selling it to you guys brand new unmolested and well cared for (left in the box most of the time except for the pics and occasionally to think about what to do with it). Anyways, I just don't really care for it anymore and figured id take a loss and just sell it to someone who could use it. The tax alone was stupidly expensive... I bought everything at the same time. I ended up paying $2,700 out the door with tax's and everything. The serial # to give you an idea is 0025xx.

I am open to any reasonable offer, but don't expect me to go very low on price since its new. Everything is brand new and still in the wrap. My loss is your gain.

You get the gun and the 6 extra mags. 7 mags total of 7.62x51 nato goodness :cool:


p.s: It would make a great Dmr/sbr gun since you can swap the uppers out and have a sbr upper in 5.56 or whatever caliber and still be able to switch back to the 7.62x51 nato upper. Just do it legally. Just a couple more months and we can all file for a Sbr :). I have never done it. All nfa rules apply...

203,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2800203,For Sale:  New SB47 AK Pistol Stabilizing Brace,"Central Business District - Downtown, Wichita, Kansas",$ 129,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 28, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"No Tax Stamp Required! Innovation & Added Functionality!

The SB47 stabilizing brace is an awesome invention that secures AK style pistols to the forearm of the shooter and assists in firing the pistol the way it is intended, with one hand. Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm, so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use! BATF approved for everybody, the SB47 does not require any special permits, doctors notes or SBR tax stamp! Will fit PAP M92 PV, PAP M85 PV, Draco and C39 Pistols.

The gun is DEFINITELY a shooter. I have personally put around 200 rounds through it; It's more accurate than you are, I absolutely love this gun, but I'm going to part with it. I honestly have something else that I need to buy, and I just don't need the gun, so it has to go. I can send pictures to you, it comes with a Sig box, 4 magazines (two 13 rounders and two 15 rounders; they fit flush) a blackhawk holster, and the book. The 228 is a relatively rare gun and is a little smaller in dimensions than the 226; Sig re-released it recently, but it isn't the same as this older one; and this one was made in West Germany, and has Sig night sights. They are dim, but if you send the gun off to Sig (they do a TON of mods; get it to them around holidays and they usually have sales going on for SUPER cheap work) they WILL replace them for you!

Comes with the original box and all its contents. I will take no less than what I have it listed for, it's worth every dollar and retails for over $300. It feels great in the hand, better than guns like the Ruger LCP. Not interested in trades.

""All stainless"" refers to the controls on the gun also being stainless ( ie mag release, slide release, takedown lever,safety,hammer,trigger) .Beretta forum members spend $200 in parts alone to make theirs all stainless and this one came this way from the factory . A few other things make this 92fs highly collectible . The first is that it has the straight dustcover like the m9 ,all newer 92fs models are slanted dustcover which doesn't look as nice and these are hard to find in black much less stainless. The second thing is that it has the radius cut backstrap(allows for better purchase or grip on the pistol and shorter reach to trigger )which is rarely seen combined with the straight dustcover and also in stainless. Gun comes with nice wooden grips w/beretta medallions($60 grips), two brand new 17rd  factory mags(new production flush fit) , case and is in excellent condition. Factory black grips in 3rd pic are also included. Gun was made in 1999 and it appears to have been shot a few times and put away for years. You don't see them like this often. One thing I forgot to mention is that this even has a stainless locking block and stainless guide rod(new models have plastic guide rods)These new sell for around $700 with the cheap black plastic controls and slanted dustcover so I am asking $725 but will entertain reasonable offers. I know what these sell for on auction websites so please dont throw out silly offers.These dont come up for sale very often. No low ballers, must sign bill of sale and have valid VA ID.  

Note: The second picture shows the dustcover differences, if you notice the slanted dustcover model has the radius cut backstrap which is the common model, usually the straight dustcover isnt paired with the radius backstrap but it is the holy grail of the 92fs in my opinion as its the best of both worlds, better looking and better feel in the hand."

I know my father-in-law, who passed, was heavily invested (several thousands in equipment and supplies) and everything is 100% there. 

I will attach as many photos as possible. I would consider certain trades for gold, possible silver, cash, some guns may work as well. These could be partial or whole trades. I am always in the market for guns and gold. Let me know what your thoughts are, shoot me an offer, the listed price is a package price, and is slightly flexible.

Please see all the specs below:

This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5."

About three years old, very little use.  Comes with 100 fiocchi hollow points in reusable box and 50 pmc 38 fmjs. Bought at Elk Grove Gun Room.  Also included are original box, manual, receipt, speed loader, keys for locking mechanism, galco holster and packing material.  If you are looking at this you have internet access and can do your own research but I'll offer this--it is has very manageable recoil for a woman with 38s.  With 357 plus P ammo yea it kicks like hell but its a little gun so I suppose that is expected.  Accuracy is pretty good for a 2 inch barrel as well. Mechanically it is 100%, cosmetically 99%. I'm selling because I want to buy another gun but I cannot financially justify buying another without selling one as I have several and like most of us I have other bills to pay. 

Lets make a deal.  I will trade this toward a glock 26 or other small 9.  You need to know you are eligible to legally buy a firearm, I will not be your test case.  If the background check comes back no bueno I will keep the money and the gun then call the police.  Deal will be done at FFL in Sacramento or surrounding areas, no shipping.  I think the price and what I am including is fair so unless you want to do a trade no other offers.  Thanks and have a good one."

It will come with a genuine Korean war Web sling, and 50 rounds or .30/06, and about 50 empty re-loadable brass.

Up for grabs is my ""made in America"" M1 Garand!

My serial number was produced in April 1939. Overwhelming odds are that this rifle saw active duty in WWII due to the high demand in those early years. Think about it... my serial number is 10**0 and troops were not fully issued until serial number 400,000+


Here is the reason it is stamped CAI:


1. America left a lot of firearms in foreign countries after WWII.

2. The gun control act of 1968 gave the ATF power to regulate imports.

3. ATF then started requiring all firearms entering America to be stamped by the importer. This included American arms ""returning' to our country.

4. So the serial number and ""CAI"" stamp simply means that the rifle left the country prior to 1968 and returned after that. A virtual guarantee that it saw active duty in at least one and possibly several wars."

Its in great shape and has a chromed and polished slide and barrel.  Been fired very little, comes with one Mec Gar magazine and its box.  These guns can not be beat in size and weight, they weigh only 11 oz's loaded and is one of those guns that you WILL forget you're carrying in your pocket.  Say what you will about Kel Tec's but the trigger is far superior to a Ruger LCP's, smooth and consistent all the way through.

I picked it up as a summer time pocket carry gun which I've had no problems doing with it, but I'd like to consolidate my caliber's and get something similar in 9mm.   I'd like to trade for a Kel Tec PF-9, Gen 2 SCCY CPX-2, Beretta Nano, or possibly a Kel Tec P-11 or Ruger LC9.  May add some cash for the right trade.

We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon

We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon 

Thanks and keep your head down. Ghost Munitions team"
