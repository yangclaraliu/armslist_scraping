The Model 597 is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with Remington's proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, the 597 incorporates a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot ""hold open"" magazine feature and Remington's patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine. The 597 is coupled with a 4x32MM scope."

This particular cal. makes this gun the rarest of the rare! The .30-1903 was adopted by the Army in 1903 to replace the aging .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) which had been adopted in 1892. Winchester first offered the model 1895 in the .30-03 cartridge in 1905. Unfortunately, the '03 cartridge became all but obsolete only a year later with the adoption by the Army of the .30-06 in 1906. (Commercial ammo for the '03 was made up until WWI.)  This pictured gun was born in 1912. Bright bore with great rifling, 50+% bluing, wood has no cracks and has great wood to metal fit.

New in Box LWRC 8.5” PSD complete AR-15 gas piston 6.8. The revolutionary LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle offers incredible fire power in a tiny package! Smashing the paradigm that small close protection weapons be relegated to pistol-caliber sub-machine guns, the PSD brings the awesomely hard-hitting 6.8mm SPC round to bear on threats out to 300 meters! This means that personal security teams can reach farther and hit harder while maintaining the concealability and portability of the current, leading SMG. Capable of penetrating soft armor and hard barriers, such as cinder block walls, the incredible 6.8mm round gives the operator unparalleled capabilities in facing today’s threats. The LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle is outfitted with our patent-pending ARM-R™ rail system, featuring a removable top platform and return-to-zero re-installation with no tools required. The carbine-length rail over a low profile gas block gives the operator their choice in rail-mounted BUIS and is ideal for optics.
The PSD™ rifle combines sub-machine gun size with a battle rifle cartridge and our ultra reliable gas-piston operating system, offering the professional shooter never-before realized capabilities in one sweet little package. No Trades. Ships to FFL. Thanks"

The Comfortech system significantly reduces recoil on firing and allows a rapid return to target. Barrels and chokes are cryogenically treated for excellent accuracy. The trigger guard, with its aggressive design and personality, allows rapid access to the trigger and ensures a solid and safe grip. Power, comfort, accuracy, stability, shooting speed and reliable operation: the Super Black Eagle is all of this.

Its faster, smoother and less likely to affect your aim for the next shot. Less obvious but equally remarkable is the Blaser's Radial Locking System (see details below). It's built around a radial bolt that expands 360º to make full, rigid contact right inside the barrel for a solid lock-up. Also contributing to the Blaser's performance are its patented sear-free trigger mechanism and completely free-floated barrel. Altogether, these design innovations result in a level of accuracy that no conventional bolt-action rifle can match. Dedicated to any single caliber, the Blaser R93 would rank among the best bolt-action rifles in the world. But the Blaser R93 rifles were engineered to allow for barrel and caliber interchangeability. Quick take-down and a replacement barrel and bolt head are all that's needed to provide maximum versatility in the Blaser R93. The technologically advanced Blaser Radial Locking System gives you five distinct benefits: 1) The bolt locks directly into the barrel, not into a receiver, so you get a full-length barrel in a rifle that's 4"" shorter overall, 2) The frame receives minimum stress because the bolt locks directly into the barrel, making the Blaser lighter and easier to handle, 3) Radial lockup means that stress is distributed through a full 360° of contact, for greater system strength and durability, 4) Head space is precisely controlled because the bolt head locks directly into the barrel, and 5) The bolt head is free-floating, so it self-trues into a concentric position in the bore, relieving stress and assuring a higher degree of accuracy. There is no other rifle system with the versatility or pure shooting ability of the R93. Seventeen different standard and magnum calibers, including the new .300 Ultra Mag., ensure that there's a perfect choice for any hunting challenge. Due to its revolutionary straight-pull bolt and radial lock-up, the bolt mates directly to the barrel with full 360° locking contact for superior strength and rigidity. Because the R93's bolt locks directly into the barrel, the R93's frame receives minimum stress which allows the rifle to be both lighter and shorter, so it's easy to carry and quicker handling. The trigger is sear-free, and designed so the ""creep"" is eliminated. Let-off is crisp and precise. Scope mounts directly to the barrel, so that rifles can be easily broken down and reassembled without changing point-of-impact. Barrels are cold hammer forged and are machined to accept detachable scope mounts. They are free-floated, so that atmospheric changes won't affect your point-of-aim. The R93's straight-pull bolt is an engineering marvel and includes a safety which actually cocks/decocks the firing mechanism. There's even a rubber bumper built into the magazine well to protect bullet tips from recoil damage. The list is endless."

I received this rifle as partial trade for an old boat of mine. It's in perfect condition, the wood stock has a beautiful original finish on it with little to no wear marks and scuffs, and all metal parts are bright and have no discolorations or scuffs. I have tested this rifle to ensure it is in 100% working order and it comes with a single small capacity clip. 

I'm interested in trades for other fire arms, most modern stuff, tactical types, handguns, etc. I don't hunt, so hunting rifles are not of much interest for me. All trades must be of equal or greater value - I WILL NOT TRADE DOWN.

I'll also take trades on other non-firearm its such as electronics, gold bulleun, silver bars, boats/fishing/camping items, or anything of value. 

Again, I know what this rifle is worth and I will not trade down. I don't need to get rid of this rifle and have no problem waiting for the right deal.

This is an AK47  Yugoslavian Underfolder, with aluminum quad rail, Magpul foregrip, a polished and bored professionally installed gas tube in place of the original swivel ""grenade launcher"" gas tube.  This eliminates the use of any moving parts, as found in the original swivel gas tube.

As reliable as a semi auto rifle can ever be made to perform.

This rifle has only a couple boxes of rounds through it. It is one of my backup rifles and barely got any use.  It has some little blemishes from being in trunk as backup gun for different shooting classes. I don't baby my guns, so I'm sure its got some little blems.

Includes TWO factory 7 round mags, one flush fit one finger rest. Includes owners manual and plastic hard case. Includes IWB CCW holster.

I have personally fired about fifty rounds through this pistol without a problem, a mix of Remington hardball and Golden Sabers. This pistol has never jammed or experienced any issues. 

It has been immaculately cared for, always cleaned after firing. It came with a small scratch beside the mag release button. This is the only flaw, a superficial one that could be buffed out.

I have a Pennsylvania Carry Permit. I have carried this pistol as my CCW when I am in other states with reciprocity. I can give no greater recommendation to a firearm then that I have staked me and my family's life and protection to this gun. 

Asking 600, or best offer. 

Note- several years ago, SW did a recall on their PPKs. I believe there was some question about the safety of the decocker on a live round. As a precaution, almost all the pistols were brought back to be checked out. A move that should be applauded. This pistol was sent in, again, as precaution, plus, it never hurts to have the professionals give your weapon a look over. All pistols sent in were marked with a tiny dimple in the space behind the hammer, on the extended beavertail. This pistol has that mark and so has had any recall work done. Buy with confidence!

Please note, I am only selling this firearm because with the advent of CCW in Illinois, I would like to purchase my wife a Sig P238 (so I will be keeping the 380 ammo). Additionally, I have had an injury, and the blow back design of the PPK aggravates this condition."

This is a super powerful 45-70+P loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on to them) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese Mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 300gr. TSX long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as they typical 350+gr. lead core expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and gives flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 2200+ fps is screaming and is powerful and for those that understand the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit to many shooters, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

    2215 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22 inch barrel
    2201 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18 inch barrel

Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

Legendary for rugged, reliable service. Utilized by law enforcement for many years before the trend towards polymer pistols.

Includes: original manual, plastic hard case, TWO fourteen round stainless factory mags, TWO ten round stainless factory mags, and TWO SEVENTEEN ROUND Mec Gar mags!! That is a shooter's package total of SIX mags, folks.

This pistol is in impeccable condition, sirs and ladies. No rust, pitting, easily close to 100% . It has been well cared for and maintained. 

Features ambi safety, raised style sights, and the superior flared/squared trigger guard. Black plastic textured grips. This is a real gun.

ALL STEEL! No aluminum, no plastics. This is a gun made to truly weather the centuries! Thus, it handles recoil very well. The use of a barrel bushing on this model makes it a tack driver. It is much like a stainless 1911, but without all the jamming issues and with more than double the capacity. Handles FMJ and JHP with ease. You will be handing this weapon down to your children's children's children.

Asking 600, or best offer.

I am only selling this firearm because the ammo is difficult to find and expensive now. With six mags, I burn through my supply too quickly. However, this is a great home defense package, and offers a great deal of firepower in a package superior, in my opinion, to any polymer Glocks, or aluminum Berettas with known locking block issues.

I don't have access to a camera right now, but I would be more than willing to take some pictures on my cell phone and send them to your phone."

Since even if I have shot the gun I can't attest to the strength or suitability of the gun for modern ammo, this is being sold primarily as a collector's item. This in no way relates as to the safety of the gun, but just means that you should have it checked by a competent gunsmith before firing and that shooting is at your own risk. It is too bad that in today's society that a disclaimer must be stated for something that should be obvious. Shipping will be $25 to the lower 48 and include insurance to $300.

Includes case, two magazines, one with extended grip, concealed carry holster.  F2F with CPL or will ship to FFL.  

Additional info:

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.
