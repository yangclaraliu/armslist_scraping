Type 53 carbine, a clone of the M44 carbine, all parts will interchange. 

Non-matching numbers, rifle has been headspaced and passed the No-Go gauge. Rifle is complete although this picture does not have the cleaning rod in it. Bore is good, rifling is crisp and sharp, a very good shooter. Stock is the usual condition for these, dents and dings but no cracks. 

I've decided to clear out some Mosin's and focus more on the SKS's, buyer will have to show ID and fill out bill of sale for my records.

Possible trade up with another Mosin for Norinco Sks's, no Yugos or Russians."

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 M4 Carbine is a unique hybrid of traditional AR15
design and space age Carbon 15 materials. The upper and lower receivers of
the C15M4 Type are molded of Carbon 15 composite which offers a weight
savings of 3/4 of a pound compared to the standard forged aluminum
receivers. In addition, these molded receivers are completely impervious to
moisture, rust or corrosion and offer a 40% increase in strength over
aluminum. The Carbon 15 material is the same throughout, so there is no
surface finish to wear off or require maintenance.

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 M4 Carbine is a unique hybrid of traditional AR15
design and space age Carbon 15 materials. The upper and lower receivers of
the C15M4 Type are molded of Carbon 15 composite which offers a weight
savings of 3/4 of a pound compared to the standard forged aluminum
receivers. In addition, these molded receivers are completely impervious to
moisture, rust or corrosion and offer a 40% increase in strength over
aluminum. The Carbon 15 material is the same throughout, so there is no
surface finish to wear off or require maintenance.

Specifications:  Barrel, Forged, Hammer (BFH)
Professional Grade Weaponry,  by BCM®

 Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups, charging handles or handguards.

As a note:  BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

 Cold Hammer Forged Barrels  
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

 M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension  
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver  
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver  
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)  
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures. 

Chrome Bore and Chamber  
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

 Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish  
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

 5.56 NATO Chambers  
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

 Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles  
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 



HPT / MP Inspected Barrels  
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

The .300 Norma Magnum is a cartridge that has begun to gain popularity in the long range shooting community. The .300 Norma Magnum is a .338 Norma Magnum case necked down to .308 caliber.[1] This cartridge was named .300 Norma Magnum to differentiate it from the .308 Norma Magnum, designed in 1960, which used the .338 Winchester Magnum as a parent case.

Norma products are known worldwide for high quality. Cartridge cases are an important factor in this reputation. Superior quality ensures a long life  and many reloads. Norma cases are made of the best possible raw materials with the narrowest tolerances, and they deliver accuracy round after round.

 The case neck is annealed to become softer. This prevents gas leaks and enables the case to hold the bullet firmly for at least 10 years without cracking as a result of aging material.

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.

As a note:  BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HTP/ MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

I haven't fired any of them.
I put a nice set of wood combat grips on it as you can see.
The rubber grips that came on the gun when I bought are included.
In the interest of full disclosure--you can see how the previous owner tried to ""fix"" the stripped out mount in those grips.
Some information about that gun I have learned since posting the original ad--
It does NOT appear to have been made as a ""bright"" stainless, but a previous owner polished the finished to a high gloss.
So I changed the listing to a ""polished"" stainless finish.
It looks great, but not necessarily an investment piece.
So I additionally lowered the price and this is less than I have invested in it (newbie mistake on my part)
I can't take less, I'll turn it into a shooter first.
The gun appears to be in excellent condition and fired a little before my purchase.
I prefer a local sale, but all sales through an FFL and only where legal.
Any additional fees are buyers responsibility.
Cash only, no trades."

Here are the specs on it:

Built to military specifications, M3x Lights are compact, easy to handle and lightweight tactical flashlights, powered by super-long-lasting lithium batteries. M3x series Flashlights are designed to attach in less than two seconds. The Shock Suppression System built into the Tactical Lights protects the xenon-filled incandescent lamp from the abuse of recoil and impact. The enhanced MIL-SPEC design allows the airtight M3x Series to be exposed to the world's harshest environments, be it a blinding desert sand storm or swimming to a depth of 66 feet in salt water. The patented Slide-Lock interface allows instant, tool-free mounting and removal from any tactical pistol or shoulder fired weapon equipped with rails or a rail adapter. Rail-Grabber interface provides an even higher level of accuracy and reliability.

SLIDE LOCK
Insight's Patented Slide-Lock mounting system allows the tactical illuminators to be mounted and removed instantly without tools. Most commonly used on handguns, the Slide-Lock mounting system is a great advantage to operators who transition between multiple handguns and shoulder-fired weapons.

I have here for sale a Glock 27 (subcompact .40 caliber) semi-automatic handgun. It includes everything it originally came with, including the case, lock, loader, holster, mag holster, paperwork, etc.

It's in excellent condition. Always well maintained. Cleaned properly with Ballistol, and a teeny tiny drop of Tetra gun grease on the metal-on-metal contact points, as recommended by the manufacturer, and experts like Hickok45. It includes the 2 original magazines, which I modded with Pearce pinky grip extenders. Looks and feels MUCH better. 

I never actually carried it, so it has absolutely no holster wear, or any kind of wear. The barrel looks brand new inside and out, and all internal components are like new. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. It's got exactly 150 rounds through it, all flawless. 

Take a look at the pics, and text me if you're interested or have any questions.

Asking only $525. Not in the pictures, but I will also include an extended 40rnd clip with the handgun.

Face to face sale only. Proper Florida ID required (must be atleast 21 and legally able to own a firearm). Not interested in any trades.

I have here for sale a Springfield XD SC 9mm (subcompact model, with the 3"" barrel) semi-automatic handgun. It's one of the very best conceal carry weapons you can own. Springfield reliability, cheap & easy to find ammo, super accurate, and all small and lightweight.

It includes everything it originally came with, including the case, lock, loader, holster, mag holster, paperwork, etc.

It's in excellent condition. Always well maintained. Cleaned properly with Ballistol, and a teeny tiny drop of Tetra gun grease on the metal-on-metal contact points, as recommended by the manufacturer, and experts like Hickok45. It includes the original 16 and 13 round magazines, plus three (3) additional 16rnd magazines, all in brand new condition.

I never actually carried it, so it has absolutely no holster wear, or any kind of wear. The barrel looks brand new inside and out, and all internal components are like new. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. It has approximately 300 rounds through it, all flawless. 

Take a look at the pics, and text me if you're interested or have any questions. Only selling because I'm trying to fund a new build.

Asking only $525. I will also include 1 nice quality IWB holsters and a cleaning kit with the handgun.

Face to face sale only. Proper Florida ID required (must be atleast 21 and legally able to own a firearm). Not interested in any trades.

Has single black-colored body I've kept clean and lubed all these years, and professionally maintained, to boot. The flash units/filters/tripod, etc alone are still usable and well worth over $850...

* A pair of fairly rare Pioneer HPM-100 (200w models) speakers - one missing a woofer (blown), both need refinishing and new grilles, but sound great otherwise;

* If it'll help get me either rifle (and hopefully a Phase Linear PL4000 MKl preamp as well), I'll be happy to add in both my Carver C-1 preamp (needs recapping) and my MacIntosh MC2205 power amp (works, but needs new faceplate).

*Finally, if I have to, I'll throw in a 1969 Gilbarco gas pump. Only needs glass pieces. VGC.

Here's the deal: I need to get rid of stuff to make room to turn around, and I'd rather it went for a reason. I'll trade some combination of the stuff above for the rifle I want  Heck, a Springfield M1A or the Ruger SR762 and an SKS would get the whole 'shooting match', as an honest -if general and slightly low- valuation is approximately $5,000.00 +/- !

Given my disabilities, you'd need to come here with both a trailer and several extra healthy backs to load up all this stuff. Trust me, you'll be doing us BOTH a favor, and make a long-held dream for me come true."

It runs off a 20oz co2 tank to pressurize the larger 20lb tank that holds about 3.5 gallons of gas or whatever flammable liquid you want. Gives you a run time of about minute, minute and a half or so if you just hold the trigger down but trust me it gets hot so short bursts is best. You can buy a scuba tank back pack harness if you want a mobile unit but then you would need a shorter hose from the tank to the trigger/gun part which I can help you with. The 20lb tank for back pack use is very heavy but doable, thats why this build is meant for stationary use with a 8ft hose from the tank to the trigger assembly. Not pictured but a propane tank is attached to the barrel of the trigger/gun for flame. as long as your propane torch is good, this one comes with obviously. Its a little under 20$ to have the co2 tank filled and the gas necessary to run it. Every fitting was done with aircraft grade thread sealant meant for gas/diesel lines.

The next-generation PMAG 40 GEN M3 is a 40-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. 

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. 

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

I had the gun out once and put 90 rounds through it, works perfectly and in mint condition. I'm moving to a 308 so no reason to keep the ammo or accessories. It currently has a Tactical Intenet TI7 stock and Magpul handguard & grip in OD green. I'm also including the original Magpul stock, handguard & grip in black if you want to switch out the color. Also included is an ITAC-CP1 3x rifle scope still new in box. The rifle has a Magpul flip up rear site installed right now. 

The package comes with a Bulldog AR-15 case and 11 Magpul 30 round magazines with 1300 rounds of ammo, the bag has around 650 rounds in it, all brass, and then I have 650 rounds still in the box, about 200 rounds are 223 and the rest is 5.56. You can find a lot of reviews on the net about the rifle, it's one of the top ARs available. If you want to make an offer for less I may consider that but I would need to take away some of the ammo & magazines for the difference, thanks for looking. 

Sig M400 Series Enhanced rifle, is designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, the sporting field, as well as competitive shooting. The Sig M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle with unparalleled accuracy. A 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel provides superior corrosion resistance, and a 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability that users come to expect from Sig Sauer. This version comes with polymer Magpul MOE forend, grip, magazine and collapsible stock.

Engraved on the top of the barrel rib is a “Pigeon” and a gold bar-line in the rib. The rib has “MADE TO ORDER BY THE FULTON ARMS CO., FULTON, NH” on top. The bottom of the breech is marked “3 INCH CHAMBERS” with proof marks. The receiver is factory scroll engraved and has the original case-hardened finish…….that has thinned to silver (no rust or abuse). The walnut buttstock is solid….no cracks or chips, and has a generic buttplate. The forend matches the buttstock with course factory checkering.  But it does not fit the hardware perfectly (see pics). This is a miss-matched shotgun….the butt stock, forend and lockplates have the s/n 340210 on them. The barrels and receiver are matching……s/n 4745. The mechanics work fine, with crisp trigger pulls. This would be a good shooter….or a restoration project. The bores are bright….with just a few dull spots. Only 1395 Pigeon Grades were produced.
