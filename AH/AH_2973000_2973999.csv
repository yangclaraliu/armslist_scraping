I believe it's cambered for .43 Egyptian but don't have any way of finding out for sure. Bore measures .426 at the muzzle. Barrel is about 35"" long. It has not been sportorized. Looks all original. It has a bayonet lug, and comes with the cleaning rod. The receiver and barrel are plum. The only markings on it are in Arabic from the best I can tell. Previous owner claims it has not been fired in 45+ years. You can see rifling in the barrel. It has sling loops. Action seems to work fine. I'm interested in trading it, value is around $450.

This stippling is fairly aggressive and prevents slipping when firing. The stainless slide and tree bark stippling on the grip were done by a gunsmith and the pinpoint stippling was done by a friend. I felt like the stippling was a little too aggressive for carrying so I put rubber Talon grips over the stippling which you can easily take off if you want. The interior is a 9/10 due to the fact that it has had less than 200 rounds put down the pipe. The exterior is a 7/10 condition wise due to some light surface scratches (you can barely see them) on the slide due to holster wear, but these could very easily be buffed out. Also, the stippling isn't perfect which for some people I understand can detract from the value. Fit and function of this gun is 100% and I have zero complaints on how it handles.

THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES:

* The firearm in it's original box with documentation
* 2 flush mags that are custom stippled
* 1 extended mag with the x-grip spacer to make it flush with the grip so there's no gap. This is also stippled.
* 1 ROG custom IWB leather holster

I don't think this gun has been shot much at all. This gun also has the rare 4 screw but plate. You won't find a nicer gun than this one. It only has a few small handling marks in the wood.

The first owner of this rifle bought it to hunt with.  He soon realized that a Battle Rifle is not necessarily an ideal deer rifle.  :-)  That is when he sold it to me.  He had very few rounds through it.   I have had this rifle for almost 7 years.  I have put approximately 800 rounds through it.  I added the GI extractor, mag pouch, and cleaning kit. I also painted in the numbers on dials of the rear sight so you can read the elevation and windage markings clearly.

Someone asked me how far out I have shot it.
I have shot it out to 500 yards.  When I am doing my part, it shoots 2-3 moa with NATO mil-surp ammo.  There is a range out in Ramseur, NC where the Appleseed clinics are held.  So after qualifying, I was able to go up to their full-length range which has targets at 200, 300, 400, and 500.  With South African Nato 7.62x51 ammo, the rifle is dead-balls-on at 200, 300, 400, and 500 yards.  You just gotta dial it in and do your part... and it hits where it should.  

The elevation knob does go to 1000 as I recall. It would be really cool to take it up to Camp Butner and see what she does out to 1000 yards.  It might be a lot to ask of a 147 grain mil-spec projectile... but the 168 Federal Gold Match round was made with the M1A in mind and it will do it."

Its like new inside now.  The barrel and receiver are nickel plated. The barrel had rubber plugs in it to prevent plating from getting in barrel and chamber. The screws that hold on the handles are 24 kt gold plated for accent. I haven't shot it since the plating was done. I just oiled it, put it back together and cycled a mag of ammo through it.

This rifle is in great shape (considering having been through a war) with an untouched patina and a FULLY IN TACT MUM stamp which is extremely rare. Those that know the history of these rifles can appreciate this. If you dont know what having a mum on the barrel of an Arisaka rifle means, google it. The rifle has its original leather sling (normal wear, slight cracking), aircraft sights, bolt release and follower/spring. All components are in good/ great condition however the rifle does need a replacement bolt. These are relatively inexpensive. I am asking $850 obo. Price is flexible, its hard to value this gun considering the rarity of the unshaven mum, sling and sights while factoring in the cost of a replacement bolt. Email - REDACTED for questions/ offers. The rifle is located in downtown Seattle however I might deliver for the right offer I AM willing to ship to the lower 48 states upon cleared payment. Thank you! Note: I couldnt take pictures of my rifle yet, but the pictures attached qith this ad closely represent my rifle. However mine also has the aircraft sights and original strap."

Diamondback Firearms Model DB380 Semi Automatic Handgun .380 ACP. The DB380 differs from most small modern pocket autos. Most have a hammer action, but the DB380 is striker-fired. It has a positive mechanical firing pin block for safety, and the twin action bars and striker action result in a very smooth and relatively light trigger pull. The square profile slide and disassembly system give the DB380 a Glock-like appearance. (It looks like a baby Glock.) The DB380 has a locked-breech action, and a striker that is set by the retraction of the slide. The trigger is made of steel, and has a smooth face for comfortable operation. The magazine holds six rounds for a total loaded capacity of seven, and the magazine catch is made of stainless steel. Another nice feature of the DB380 are the sights: I can actually see the sights on this pistol well enough for them to be useful."" -- Jeff at Gunblast

Been wanting to try one out for a long time and finally picked this one up new last week, its only had 150 rounds through it.  Functions fine but I'd prefer to stick with revolvers.

This is the CPX-2 without the manual safety, comes in its box with all the paperwork, lock, and two 10 round magazines.  Also comes with flat and extended baseplates for both magazines.  Has a VERY smooth and consistent all the way through double action trigger pull.
If you aren't familiar with SCCY and the CPX they are very similar to the Kel Tec P11 but with a much better build quality.  SCCY also has a lifetime no questions asked warranty on the CPX that follows the gun, not the owner.  

I'd prefer to trade, particularly for a Taurus M85 revolver, but would consider other snub nosed .38 special revolvers.  Prefer a revolver but might also consider other 9mm or .40 pocket or subcomapct sized guns, particularly a Taurus Pro G2 9mm.  Not interested in rifles or shotguns or none firearm related trades. No Kel Tecs.
I also have a .22 revolver listed here that I can add for a higher value trade:

It is a single action army clone, chambered in .22 LR.  Its an older gun and is not perfect cosmetically with scuffs and dings throughout but is rust free and the barrel is pristine.  Works fine, just not real pretty.  The Model 66 was considered the best handgun that Rohm made.  Has had trigger work done on it at some point, has an incredibly light trigger, I'd say 1-2lbs.  Shoots well and is a fun plinking gun, I just don't use it much.  Would make a great plinking gun or trainer for kids or people just getting into shooting.  This gun is also built for .22 magnum, but I only have the .22 LR cylinder for it, they can be found around online if you look.
Will also come with 170 rounds of .22 LR.

Would prefer to trade for a different .22 firearm, would like a bolt action magazine fed .22 rifle or a semi auto .22 pistol, but I'm not real particular, so let me know.
If not interested in trading I'll sell it for $120 firm.

Less than 50¢ A PIECE! Cheap enough for a good day at the range or your neighborhood coyote. I went to the range several times trying to find which round shot best in my 700 varmint rifle. So that is how I ended up with the partial quantities/brands. This is all  HQ premium brand name ammo, not that Chinese or Russian crap and priced to sell quickly! Collectively, I have ran box after box of these ammo brands/types through my 700 and have never had a misfire with any of them. My preference was the Federal 55 gr. based on availability and price. What I have here is the remainder of a 500 rd case I purchased. They are dependable.

$90 takes it all now. I dropped the price!!!

193 rounds are polymer ballistic tipped.

163 rds Federal 55 grain polymer ballistic tip ($100 value alone the rest are freebees)

20 rds Win SuperX 55 grain Silver-tip polymer ballistic tip (complete box 20 rds)
70 rds Rem-Win 55 grain Jacketed Hollow point

The reason for selling is that I sold my 700 Remington so I have no further need for the ammo, so my loss is your gain. I'm not parting it out so don’t bother asking. All I want is $90 for the lot. A lot cheaper than retail I can assure you, so there you go. That is at least half off or more of what it retails for. Heck of a deal!

I have a Kimber that I got in a trade a while back but I'm simply happier with my Springfield that I already owned prior to the trade.  I don't need two 1911's so it's time to let this one go.  I'm unsure of the round count from the previous owner but I've put 200rds of FMJ through it myself without any issues.  

It has a minor scratch near the slide lock (just like every other 1911 hah) from the previous owner, and some minor superficial discoloration at the muzzle end of the barrel.  Otherwise this is a very nice looking handgun with a great finish.

I would be more than happy to send any detailed pictures that you desire.

Includes one Kimber magazine, and all original materials/case shown in the middle picture.  I will include the Hogue grips that are on it as well as the factory Kimber ones.  No ammunition included.

I swapped out the original stock for an ATI stock with adjustable length of pull, it's a slightly heavier stock and seemed to balance out the gun nicely, and the cheek rest is comfortable. I still have the original stock and the pistol grip that came with it.

I bought it new about 6 months ago, and haven't had the chance to shoot it yet.  But, my girlfriend just got on supervised probation so the law won't let me keep my gun and my girl in the same house.

I've also got an assortment of ammo, 20 rounds of bird shot, 10 rounds of 00 buck, and 10 slugs.

Unless you want to pay more for ammo than you would at a store, I'm not interested in selling just the ammo.

I will accept cash or I will trade for restoring 2 mopeds I have that aren't currently running."
