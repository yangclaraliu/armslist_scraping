VA residents need to add sales tax.CMC's single-stage trigger group is a completely self-contained, 100% drop-in, fire control group upgrade for the AR-15 and AR-10 family of rifles. Trigger pull is factory pre-set and is not user-adjustable. It has an ultra-crisp 3.5 lb trigger weight with no feel of creep prior to hammer release. Trigger has a glass-smooth break with no feel of grittiness. Trigger components are fabricated from 8620 alloy steel and S7 tool steel, machined to exacting tolerances and finished for the longest service life possible. Minimal lock-time is designed into the assembly using controlled hammer weight and balance and activated using a rocket wire hammer spring. This assures repeatable function, with either commercial or military grade ammunition. Positive trigger reset allows a quick follow up shot on target. Trigger is easy to install following the included instructions.CMC's innovative, self-contained, and easy-to-install AR-15 trigger groups have been completely re-tooled to maximize production capacities, incorporate new design enhancements and reduce cost. CMC's AR-15 trigger groups have always yielded exceptional trigger pull dynamics. CMC is confident the new production tooling and setup, incorporating the most advanced methods available, will not only yield the highest quality, but will also keep the supply lines full so every AR-15 shooter who places the highest demands on quality, function and reliability, will no longer have extensive lead times for obtaining these innovative trigger groups. And thanks to our multi-patented designs, a fine match grade trigger pull is now an extremely simple upgrade to implement. Install the fully self-contained, ready-to-go trigger group, safety check, and it's done.Specifications:      Single-stage drop-in trigger for AR15 and AR10     Flat trigger bow     3.5 lb trigger weight     Law enforcement, military, hunting applications     Clean hammer release with positive and fast reset     Match quality trigger action and hammer fall     For standard lower receivers using small pins of 0.154 inch diameter"

Also open to high end backpacking gear (tents, 25 degree and below sleeping bags, and packs) - any trade you would need to overvalue your stuff a bit (not willing to trade my gun for the equal in gear - would need to be above MSRP on your side and a sweet deal for me) only because I can take cash and buy at am employee discount, new, from Columbia (and its affiliates) or even Moosejaw."

Single action with safety, so you can carry it ""Cocked and locked"". This is not a stock Springfield Range Officer. Although they are great ""out of the box"", This one has been upgraded with TRP options (barell, trigger, hammer and fitment) so it is now the most accurate 9mm I've ever shot. Revolver accurate! It has adjustable rear sight and the trigger is now AMAZING!Comes with two magazines, box, lock, holster, etc, etc. that is came with.Between the gun purchase and the upgrades, there is over $1,000 into it. I will sell it outright for $750 or trade (Bring used gun value and cash for $900 total value if trading) for a lower cost 9mm WITH CASH. Some of the 9mm's I like are Springfield, S&W M&P or SD9VE. Or Sig P2022. Sorry, but I'm not interested in any rifles, shotguns or pistols that are not 9mm and not wanting to do straight trades. Trades must be with cash and your trade must be discounted as this one is too. Please be fair with your trade offers as there is over $1,000 in this one when new and it's still like new. Thanks!Face to face sale/trade in Winter Park only. You must be legal to own a gun. Thanks!"

I have a lot of NEW items that go with it. It comes with 2 modular subcompact frames, both the small and very hard to find medium (it all goes together so don't contact me wanting to buy an item). Basically this compact 15rd pistol can be swapped into a subcompact 12rd within 30 seconds. It really is the best of both worlds. It comes with a 12rd subcompact magazine and both of it's original 15rd compact magazines. As well the pistol also comes with a hard to find 17rd full size magazine. There is a magazine slip on grip extension that makes it a full grip. Google gripzone I believe for sig P320. Also comes with a IWB holster. The trigger on the pistol is absolutely fantastic and it is very accurate. Only reason I'm selling is because my other pistols are Glocks and I would just rather keep them all Glocks really. So I'm selling this to get a new Glock 19, 23, or 32. Really not sure yet. I would be willing to trade for a equal condition Glock Gen4 (LNIB). I have shot this pistol at PSA's indoor range but it has only 50 rounds through it and I cleaned it right after with CLP. I'm very anal and you can be assured this pistol is like new.

(pardon the photo, it does need cleaning)   It shoots great and is ready to give years more of service.  I'm estimating I put less than 500 rounds through it during my time owning it from 1996 to today.Included are two factory 15 round magazines.  One of these has been retrofitted with an extended floor plate making it a 17 round magazine.  I will also throw in the Glock polymer belt slide and a crappy after-market magazine I bought back during the '94 ban when factory mags were almost impossible to find.  It's a cheap knock off that lacks the metal insert...but oddly enough it actually feeds fine.My asking price is 350$.  This is a good deal for a Gen 2, which are highly regarded by Glock enthusiasts.  As I am financing another purchase, I am not overly interested in trades...with two exceptions.  I would take a partial trade of a complete and function AR15 lower with cash making up the remainder.  I would also take a straight trade for an AR15 pistol in .223.I prefer to hand off the pistol locally if possible and will do so in a public place.  By repling to my ad you are afirming that you are legally able to possess a handgun in the State of Texas.  I reserve the right to refuse to complete the sale for any reason.  In other words, if I don't like the look of you I walk away.  Email me if you are interested or text me at REDACTED"
