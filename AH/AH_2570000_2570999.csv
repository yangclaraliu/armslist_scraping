Brand new. These are made in the USA. This newly patented item is very unique to the hunter that is wanting to sight his scope in before that last minute hunt. Perfect for people who are handicapped or confined to a wheelchair. This lightweight and compact product can be taken anywhere. It weighs less than a pound. This system takes anywhere from 60-75% of the recoil. No more being sore or bruised. Your firearm simply sits in the harness and clamps to a table, bench, wrap it around a tree or use your own tie downs with it. Once ready to take the shot just put all the tension on the sling. It works great!!! This system works the same as the heavier rests, but does not require weights. These come in various colors such as: black, brown, green, camo, orange, pink and pink camo. Please specify which color you would like when ordering. ""Get your Group on Paper and Lose the Bruise."" Rifle and ammo are not included."

You could buy this same setup brand new online for about $555: $338 for the Kahr; $172 for the Crimson Trace Laserguard LG-437, includes shipping; and about $25.06 for the second magazine (does not include shipping) and the FFL fee, about $20. Does not include any sales tax.  OR you could buy this one for $450.  Please look at each photo carefully and you will know this is a good deal and I am not making any profit.  If you pay the asking price, I will throw in a box of hollow points or 100 rounds of FMJ.  Buyer will also have an option to buy plenty of 9mm FMJ at less than online or Walmart prices."

Rifle is in good shape, all metal including chamber and bore look great. Marks in the wood but nothing significant. I recently took it completely apart and did a thorough cleaning. I got this gun from an elderly gentleman who said it had not been out of his gunsafe in many years. Says he hunted with it a few times 20+ years ago, he said it shot better than other guns he had that cost 4x as much.  From all the reviews I have read these guns were known as great shooters. 
This Herter's is not associated with the current herter's brand ammo. This gun was manufactured in England in the 1960's by I believe BSA on a mauser action.
A little history I found online: 
Herters sold barreled actions, or complete rifles from 1965 thru 1968 through their mail order catalogue. All Herter's high powered rifles were M98 clones and some were made by companies such as FN or BSA. The gun control act of '68 stopped most sales of firearms via mail order and Herter's retailers with FFLs continued to sell these rifles through about 1970.

 There was an opportunity to buy a barreled action and then a stock made to your taste (type, wood, etc) so as to have at least a semi-custom type rifle. Most of these actions are considered quality types today, so A Herter's rifle in good shape might be a very good to excellent purchase as a shooter. I'd doubt that they would hold any true collector value.

 By the way, George Herter was quite a charactar, selling sporting goods with the best of them through the 50s, 60s and 70s. His typical descriptions of the goods he sold were somewhat over the top, but much of what the company sold was of at least decent quality. He also authored several books, with little to do with his sporting goods business. 

Ok if your not into history, sorry to bore you.  If your looking for a cheap good quality hunting rifle here you go. I would like to get $300 cash firm or $350 trade value. 
Any other firearms would be considered. I could trade up or down, I have cash/ammo/guns for the right trade. You may come to me or a meeting may be arranged in the Olympia/Lacey area."

These guns are made in the USA from USA made receivers (either NDS or Elk river from what I read) and use a Polish Circle 11 parts kit (nonmatching).  The barrels are supposed to be Green Mtn chrome lined. They are considered better than Romanian guns and a mid level AK. 

This gun has an excellent parkerized finish and the wood is very nice as well. Shows very little use. Comes with 2 magazines (1 plastic and 1 metal) and 40 rounds of ammo to get you started.  Looking to get $675 from it.

May consider some trades for tactical weapons (no hunting guns, bows, or black powder)."

A perfect candidate for SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) *, the SLR-104UR rifle is a brand new Bulgarian stamped receiver rifle that is built from all original brand new factory parts and premium quality US made components, from its hammer forged chrome lined barrel to the original Bulgarian Arsenal mil-spec. stamped receiver. 

The SLR-104UR comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s already famous left-side folding solid polymer buttstock and ribbed handguards.

The lower handguard comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s stainless steel heat shield, which helps keep your hand cooler when shooting. 

Throw an optical scope on this baby and the SLR-104UR, equipped with a double-stage trigger group, becomes an accurate sharpshooting rifle. Or, cut down the barrel and get a mean looking Krink for yourself *.

It’s 100% mechanically sound, with a solid action, perfect timing/carry-up/lock-up, bright bore & chambers and no rust or serious scratches/gouges. 

Extremely well-suited to CC – no hammer to snag on the draw, no place for lint to accumulate, no worry about putting the gun into SA at the wrong time. Just a smooth, consistent, crisp and safe DAO trigger pull every time. And for anyone that thinks the .38 Special can’t still hold its own, I’d recommend checking out Buffalo Bore’s website to see what the .38 Special can do when loaded to its true potential. In the pocket, in the waistband, in the glove box, on the ankle, on the nightstand…anywhere you’d want to keep a CC gun, these little 640’s are excellent.

It looks like it’s been carried at least a little in its life, but not shot much and definitely not abused. There are some light handling marks throughout the finish of the gun and on the stocks. The stocks are the ones that originally came on this gun back in 1989/1990 and would do fine for CC as they are or could be refinished into looking brand new again…no chips or cracks. This is a 4-digit “CEN” prefix S/N (CEN6xxx), so it was likely about the 6,000th-ish made. Also, as only featured in the first year or so of production; the inside of the frame is marked ""TESTED FOR +P+"" (S&W's lawyers had this removed early in this model's life). Definitely harder to come by than regular .38 Special 640’s (which aren't all that common to begin with). 

I’m looking to sell this Model 640 for $525, preferably FTF in Everett. Not terribly interested in trades, but would consider offers of S&W revolvers chambered in .22, .38 Special or .357 Magnum made between 1930 & 1996. Will want to see good guy cards.

A semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .50 AE. Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride - Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface. The DE is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. Warranty papers are in each box, including safety cable and Bolt tool. This gun includes an extra MR magazine [7 rounds] and 20 boxes [20 rds ea.] - 400 total rounds of factory 300 ammo. [worth $660.00], The Gun(s) and the ammo are very hard to find on the open market, NIB [New in the box], as these are. This gun has the fancy hand inlaid engraved grips [Silver, Brass and Gold], as seen in the pictures. They cost me $325.00 ea. [my cost from < www.Handmadegrips.com > in Istanbul, Turkey] See See pictures of this gun with custom grips below:

These are not your grandpa's pellet guns. The X50 shoots 1500 fps (faster than some .22's). The X50 was fired twice to see how hard it would shoot and the X10 with scope has never been fired. I took these in on trade back last year and they were new box. I kept them due to the fact that I was running out of .22 shells at the time and kept them for back-ups. The cheapest I could find the X50 was around $200 online and the X10 around $100 online (both of these prices came from Airgundepot. Every place else had the X50 at $250 to $300 and the X10 at $150. I would sell both of them for $200 firm.

Less than 200 rds through it. Comes with case, lock and extra mag. 
From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The Commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. This M9's distinctive military-style markings on various components closely resemble those of the M9 pistols used by the U.S. Armed Forces, and its ""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the military M9. These two features as well as the unique M9-prefixed serial number set this Commercial M9 apart from the Beretta 92 FS pistol.

From the manufacturer:

The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry
firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless
appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. PPK/S is the 1968
""Sport"" version, with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931 design. The
top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

Everything functions but the cylinder advance is worn and is a little loose. The right side grip has a piece broken off.
