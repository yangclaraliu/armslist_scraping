This is a 1st generation Walther P99 9mm with Meprolight night sights.  It is 100% German manufactured and proofmarked, was imported by Interarms, and has a date code on the frame of ""KI"", which is 1998 manufacture.  The slide has a factory finish called ""QPQ"", which stands for ""quench, polish, quench"".  It is basically a hard, highly corrosion-resistant Tenifer finish (similar to Glock) that is not phosphated over, which gives it an appearance similar to a matte-finish hard chrome.  Not many Walthers were made with this finish and if you do some research, you'll see that it's quite desirable among Walther enthusiasts.  I purchased this pistol secondhand in 2005, added the night sights, and function-tested it with a couple hundred rounds of various FMJ and hollowpoints.  It was extremely accurate and 100% reliable, just as all of my other P99 pistols were.  I thoroughly cleaned the pistol, lubed it, and stored it.  As you can see, it is in exceptional condition and is very close to new.  The pistol comes with (2) 16rd factory mags, the original case, factory test target, original sights, extra back straps, and owner's manual.  FYI, the 16rd Walther P99 mags are very difficult to find and were what the pistol was originally designed for...however at some point and for some reason, Walther changed the standard mags to 15rds.

Please....no requests to buy at a lower price. I'm foolish to sell these at this price but I no longer have a 9mm and these boxes are space in the safe that could be used for something else.

Transfer will be thru a FFL Dealer only, with buyer responsible for any and all charges on the receiving end of the transaction (which will be $10 or $20) for a background check per the new DUMB Colorado gun laws. I hate to have to sell firearms this way now but it is not worth getting a ticket or going to jail for. If you can find an FFL dealer I will meet to sell the gun. If not I might have one in Arvada but the dealer I know prefers to not do private transaction background checks because its just not worth it. They pay more to do the check than you do! Most of them will tell you that.

Rifle comes complete with original MAS rubber bad dated 1962, 10 round detachable box magazine, iron sights adjustable for 1,200 meters plus flip up grenade launcher sights. The weapon is a G series rifle dating the receiver between 1958-1960 rifle has two armory refurbishment marks one from 1971 and one from 1981.  Barrel is dated 1976 meaning it was replaced the second time it was refurbished making it very likely that a round has never been fired through it.  All numbers match except the bolt which is also matching G series.  Comes with black steel replacement cocking knob plus the original French military white plastic cocking knob completly intact which is quite rare.  Only 275,000 of these rifles were ever built, most of which were simply destroyed after the French deemed them too worn out to serve.  Out of the few of these rifles that made it in to the U.S. before reserves of these rifles ran dry forever, most of them were converted to .308 by Century who did such a bad job converting the rifles most of the converted rifles are considered unsafe to fire.  This is a rare example of a rifle that was left in the original caliber therefore retaining the immaculate factory machining quality.  The metal finish is 95% and no damage at all except for a few marks on the stock most likely from combat most likely the stock is original to the rifle where as the hand guard is most likely factory new.  I am asking $650 but am open to firearm trades only.  Local pick up only I will not ship it.  Thank you for looking!"

Additional information from MFG of TCP:

The Taurus (TCP) Taurus Compact Pistol, which is one of the newest Taurus pistols aimed at the concealed carry market. Like the other popular 380 pistols, the Taurus is made from polymers, and features a remarkably low profile, and designed to be double action only. The Taurus PT 738 is made to be a pocket pistol, so it features a heavier than normal trigger pull, which prevent accidental discharge. Standard safety features for the TCP include a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator and the unique Taurus Security System® that allows users to securely lock the gun using an inconspicuous key-lock.

Taurus TCP pistols are made in the USA and the sleek design make these pistols stand apart from the competition.

3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, conceal ability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equaling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy.

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves
ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its 16"" chrome-lined,
phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas

improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail forend and barrel, and

Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol grip. As with all
SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the Sig Sauer innovative short-stroke gas
pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle
to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the Sig Sauer
proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the
only rifles to pass NATO's Over the Beach test. It has a free-floating
M1913 quad rail, and the the top rail is optic-ready with Sig Sauer flip-up
iron sights.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.

NOT NEW, BUT NICE SHOOTING SHAPE, LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE ? SEND PX OR TEXT ME AT REDACTED........................................................................................................................... A living tribute to the genius of Browning. Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. The SA-22 is one of the first autoloading rimfire rifles ever made, and one the most desirable. One John M. Browning’s final designs, his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. An object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Though nice to look at, these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms.
If one word were to describe the Semi-Auto 22 it would be ""CLASSIC."" Like the famous Automatic 5 shotgun or a Hi-Power pistol, the Semi-Auto 22 gives you a real sense of the incredible design skills and genius of John Moses Browning. And the quality of wood and steel will exceed your expectations. People sometimes say ""they don't make 'em like they used to."" With the Browning Semi-Auto 22, they still do! The Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, also known as the Semi Automatic 22 or SA-22, is a takedown rifle produced by FN Herstal based on a John Browning patent. The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1974 in Belgium and production continued in 1976 in Japan by Miroku.[1] It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956.The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic .22 rifle] and is regarded as a classic firearm.The Semi-auto .22 is a made from blued steel and walnut, and ejects spent cases downward. This feature was intended by the designer to keep the user's face ""protected from gasses and flying particles while firing"", at which it succeeds, but also allows the sizzling hot empty case to eject down one's left shirt sleeve, which is memorable, to say the least. The lack of a side-mounted ejection port also leaves a large ""canvas"" for engraving.[2] Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal, and is done by laser engraving with hand finishing at Miroku."

One of the original Seattle, Wa guns -- mfg in 1976 or 77, one of the first 1000 built.  I purchased this from the original owner in Seattle.

As you can see, the gun has a later style blued slide, barrel, and hammer, as well as the later factory checkered wood grips.  The original owner explained that the gun originally shot low and left, so after fiddling with it for several years he eventually took it back to Detonics in the 1980s and had them fix it.  The result was the gun's current configuration.  Still has the original rubber-backed mainspring housing.

Gun is in excellent condition with just the slightest bit of finish wear on the corners.  Overall 90+% condition, this gun has been a safe queen with both the previous owner and me.

Gun functions perfectly and shoots accurately.

Comes with holster Bianchi #7L right and original Detonics soft case/rug and one original Detonics magazine.

This is a great buy on a very nice weapon that lets you afford a 1911 handgun.  When you hold it then you will know why it was selected by the military as a weapon.  The smooth action of the slide, the easy hammer pull, the rear safety, the perfect hand grips and all at a reasonable weight.

This gun is used but in very good condition with a little holster ware.

The quote below is not about this particular gun, just about the type.
A Qoute from a review on Guns.com 
The Citadel 1911
The Citadel 1911 is manufactured in the Philippines by Armscor and distributed in the states by Legacy. It’s based on the time tested Browning design, single-action recoil operated semi auto, and, same as the original, built to withstand dang near anything.

The barrel, frame and slide are forged steel, and it has a Parkerized, matte black finish. The slide has deep grooves on both the front and rear, and it’s equipped with a skeletonized trigger, hammer, an ambidextrous safety and Walnut grips.
The Citadel 1911 is equipped with Novak style sights and although the sights are not white dot, they are plenty good for my 65 year old eyes.

The barrel has six grooves with a 1 in 16 inch right hand twist and a full length guide rod.

A lowered and flared ejection port helps chunk the empties smoothly.
Performance
After stripping it down and giving a good cleaning I headed for the range. With me, I brought along a selection of ball and hollow point ammo — even some rather old Blazer HP’s I forgot I had.

The first hundred or so rounds I wasn’t even trying for any kind of grouping, I just wanted to check for reliability. Everything fed, and functioned perfectly even the old Blazer rounds.

Next, I set up standard B24 silhouette targets, again at the 7-, 10-, 15- and 25-yard marks and used standard carry rounds, meaning 185 grain JHP’s.

Suffice it to say, this pistol will just chew the center completely out of a B24 target at all four of the yardages mentioned, whether slow or rapid fire. And not once did I have any failure-to-feed or failures-to-eject with any type off ammo.
Final thoughts
It’s now seven months since I purchased this pistol, and I’ve put approximately 3,000 rounds through it. The only things I’ve done are clean it and put a set of Harrison design carry grips on it. It continues to shoot and function perfectly.

I’ve owned a lot of pistols over the years, but only a very select few did I have complete faith and trust in as a carry weapon. The Citadel M1911 is one of them, and I do not make that statement lightly. For the money, I think the Citadel M1911 is hard to beat.

Other Information: I a 99% NIB Springfield XDM 5.25 in 9mm with the black slide and white color fill accents. The pistol comes with all the factory standard stuff and I have done some work to it as well. I installed a Springer Precision trigger kit in it (Which includes the sear, trigger bar, trigger spring, striker spring, and striker safety spring). I also have installed a competition mag release, and added Canyon Creek Competition springs set. Once that was installed, I tuned the entire pistol (now throwing brass consistently at 10 feet to the right of the shooter). The pistol is literally ready to roll with. The competition adjustable rear sight and Dawson fiber optic front sight make this idea for anyone looking to take that next step in Poly pistols. This XDm comes with 3 19rd mags, all the paperwork, red, green, and yellow fiber optic replacement bars, gun lock, holster, mag holster, and extra back straps. I also have the springs, trigger bar, sear, mag release, and all factory I replaced. 

I've only fired this pistol a total of 25 rounds to make sure the added trigger, spring kit, and tuning was all 100% perfect... It is! The trigger is exceptionally nice and I'm sure will exceed your expectations (as it exceeded mine and I am half crazy with my firearms. The pistol has been safe kept, cleaned and oiled...

I have fired only 3 rounds through it(1 flare, 1 starburst and 1 bird banger). it is a great adult toy and I have enjoyed it, but because of some financial issues my old lady is making me get rid of it. this is a legal to own flare launcher. it is not a destructive device, but could be made into one very easily given the proper licensing. when purchased I will throw in 2 green flares, 2 silver starburst rounds and 8 bird banger rounds, also I will give you the kit to build smoke and flare rounds (2 cans of FFF black powder for deploying charge included). 100% legal to own as a civilian and with no license required. flare and starburst rounds were purchased for $12.50 each, and the bird banger rounds were $15 each. so the $400 will actually get you a purchase of over $600 worth of launcher and ammo. I do have more pictures available, just text/call me at REDACTED or email me if interested. the weapons shown are NOT for sale, I just put them up here to give a visual of what the launcher looks like on a mount. pick up in Chesapeake/ Virginia beach is preferred considering I cant ship anything with explosives, and 37mm rounds are considered explosives."

434,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2350434,For Sale:  Daisy Red Ryder Carbine No. 111 Model 40 - Circa 1947 - 1951,"Plainfield, Chicago, Illinois",$ 160,"Listed On: Monday, November 18, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Daisy Red Ryder Carbine No. 111 Model 40.  I date this bb gun from 1947 - 1951.  It has a black painted aluminum cocking lever which means it was made after 1946.  The wooden handgrip dates it before 1952. 

Included in the listing is a Red Ryder lucky coin and Daisy BBs. 

I purchased this gun earlier this year to be used as a painting still life reference. I am a fine artist who works with oil paint in hyperrealism manner.  The painting of the gun can be seen here http://www.kylesurges.com/paintings.html .  Since I have complete the painting I no longer need the gun.       

This Red Ryder is in Good - Fair Condition.  There is a decent amount of wear throughout the gun but overall it doesn't appear to have been abused.  The bluing on the barrel is very apparent and pleasing.  I tried my best to capture all the details in the photos.  There may be a couple nuts missing on the back side but everything is tight and functioning.  At some point, someone added some lock washers to the screws as well.  Another things to mention is the crease or dent in the barrel, the hair line crack on the handgrip, and 3 BB dents on the backside on the stock.   

The gun does shoot very well.  It pretty accurate too.  However, I found that it does seem to shoot a bit to the left.  The cocking lever on this old gun does require some muscle to cock it unlike the new models.  Overall it's a fun gun to shoot a will make a good addition to your collection.  

I also have many more high quality photos of the gun I can email if interested. Please feel free to ask questions.

I prefer a money order from the post office as payment."

Shipping: Yes on your dime to your FFL
Price: $900 or best offer
Other Information: Hey gang, I am selling another pistol that is near and dear to my heart. This is from my personal collection and the only reason I am even considering selling this is because I have two of them. This High Standard is in amazing condition and I would say I would rate it close to 96%. You will be hard pressed to find a nicer ""The Victor"" that is this old. It is a very early Victor as shown by the roll markings ""The Victor"" on the barrel (this was only around for a very short amount of time. From talking to the original owner he told me that he only knew of the pistol being fired around 100 total times. I shot it another 150. Literally 200 honest rounds through this pistol.

Additionally, This The Victor is a late steel rib Victor from March 1973. As you can see from the serial number, this is a true original pistol and has all the correct markings and hardware!

To add to that, the yellow fill in the barrel that reads ""The Victor"" still looks great and all the Gold accents that typically corrode us all still in tact (The mag release is case colored which is original). The function on this pistol is flawless and it is capable of shooting 10X scores at 50 meters. I can not come close to out shooting this pistol! Along with that, this pistol has a steel rib, not aluminum... I comes with 1 original magazine and any collector/shooter would be proud to call this their own."

I bought it brand new for right around $1000 without the ammo or extra grips, and put exactly 50 rounds of factory ammo (not reloads) through it at the range. I purchased 3 extra sets of grips for it at a cost of between $40-75 each. NOTE: The ""mother of pearl"" grips in the 1st pic are NOT included, but I AM including 2 other sets of pearl grips, along with a set of checkered reconstituted ivory grips.

There is a few VERY light scratches at the front of the slide which can be easily buffed out, and aren't even noticable beyond a few inches away.

I'm only asking $800 for the entire package, so I expect this to sell rather quickly. This is a VERY clean and well taken care of firearm, and will certainly be a wonderful addition to someone's collection!

The model 3906 is perhaps the most often overlooked 3rd generation pistol extant. If you do a Google search on it there is precious little information on the net. Even a search here returns fairly little, in comparison to the more talked about models.

Perhaps it is because the 3906 was only produced for around two years. Or the fact that the 3906 is a single stack pistol, containing hardly enough ammunition for a run to the stop & rob to buy milk. Or maybe its because of the 3906's chambering in 9mm which the internet experts tell us is practically insufficient to kill paper targets at the range with. Or perhaps it is because the 3906's all steel construction makes it a little heavy. I understand that lots of folks consider ""heavy"" pistols negatively these days. Maybe they should lift weights more often.

Yet the 3906 does have a following......small though it may be.

I've often read that one reason for the short production life of the 3906 was the rise in popularity of the high capacity wonder nines. If true, add one more thing to the list of problems those wonder nines caused. I've also read that the 3906 production numbers were alleged to be as low as 2600 pistols. That may account for the scarcity of these guns.

I found out about the existence of the 3906 some years ago. I was intrigued by the prospect of a flat single stack 9mm, like my beloved 3913, with all steel construction. What a great platform for shooting hot 9mm rounds through. Might be the ""perfect"" do everything well pistol, for me.

It took me quite some time to track one down. The first one I came across was at a gunshow back around 2005.....or 2006. It had adjustable sights. Those looked out of place, to me, on a flat carry/combat pistol. The price was $475 IIRC with only one mag. I thought that was a bit much and passed. I didn't see another 3906 for almost five years. I jumped on that one!

Anyways, the 3906 really is a fine pistol. For just about every purpose. any other fans here?  Hurry, this one will go quick!

I bought this gun new 2 1/2 months ago. I took it to the range and shot one box of ammo through it. It comes with a 8 round mag and the paper work. Its has a fiber optic front sight and a adjustable rear sight. The VZ grips stock are nice also. I love the gun, but I bought it to carry as a sidearm when hog hunting. I took it with me for the first time last Sunday and a 1911 is just to heavy to cary when hiking all day. Id love to keep it but I need something I can carry all day along with all my other gear.

This is a great gun seems to be a hard to find size of 1911.  3.3 in barrel, slightly shorter grip compared to a full size 1911.  The trigger is adjustable to take some play out of it.  But the trigger is awesome very very crisp and light. Sig lists it as 5lbs but it is a very light 5lbs. Comes with two holsters and three 7 rd mags. original Sig box.  SigLITE night sights. Gun fits and feels great in my hand."

This pistol is in great condition, purchased within the last six months, with probably 50-100 rounds fired through it.  The original box and all materials are included.

This pistol includes a total of four magazines and a Kusiac Leather inside the waistband tuckable holster, and a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster.   It's a great concealed carry package; the size and weight are minimal.  The pistol has a Galloway Precision stainless steel guide rod.

I'm selling for various reasons.  First and foremost, I'm getting married soon (whoo-hooo!).  Also, the LC9s seem to have an issue when loading the first round of our issued hollow-point ammo from a full magazine.  It cycles hollow points fine, but will sometimes hang up when chambering the first round.  This chambering issue hasn't happened at all with round nosed ammo.  Perhaps it just needs broken in, but I don't like the issue.

The Kusiac holster is great.  It has a spare magazine carrier on the front so it's a nice drop-in-the-pants package.  The tan material on the back of the holster is adhesive mole skin that I stuck on for comfort.  It can be removed, though I don't know if it will pull the black finish from the leather.

I'm not interested in trades, sorry.

I'll ship from my FFL to yours at your expense.  I'll also do a face to face meeting if you have a concealed weapons permit and are willing to provide a copy and sign a receipt."

The barrel is the heavy tapered version, 6.875"" in length; adjustable target sights.  The gun is solid, very accurate and shoots well.  Its great for the beginner or for the more experienced shooter, and is a lot of fun as a plinker or for serious target shooting.  The price includes two spare magazines, a magazine loading assist, 100 rounds of ammunition just to get you started, and a soft carry case.

One minor issue does exist with this gun:  The rear sight lacks a ""positive"" detent (they were made this way) and will move out of alignment as the gun is fired multiple times.  Although this issue is easily fixed with a tiny dab of Loctite on the adjustment screw, I nevertheless took dollars off my asking price, as I consider it a defect.  Once the Loctite is applied, the problem disappears, however.

Although I am not especially interested in trades, I will always listen if someone wants to make an offer.  I will trade only for another handgun, preferably revolvers, or autos if they are .32acp, or smaller, in caliber.  The revolver I had listed as a ""set"" with this pistol has been sold separately.

I have an excellent little Colt Mustang for sale, chambered in .380 auto and with original Colt mag.  The Bianchi holster is like new and also included (rh).  This was given to me recently and just isn't my thing.  I've fired 20 rds through it and it functions perfectly.  These are extremely rare and well made.   I would rate the blueing at 90-95%...very little wear. 

I will ship to your FFL as long as they do not require that I am also an FFL.  Shipping should be @ $20 via insured FedEx.   Discrete Gift Paypal preferred.  Or cash FTF in Ventura Co or in LA area.  I have half a box of ammo I'll throw in if the price is right.  Price is OBO, but please no lowballs or trades."
