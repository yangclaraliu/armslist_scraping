The SR-15 E3 is one of the most complete package rifles that require almost no user modification or tweaking.
And by doing so is an incredibly reliable and lightweight rifle with a plethora of features. The hammer forged barrel groups very well, and in combination with the very lightweight URXII rail (including integrated front sight, and included match grade rear sight), gives the gun an extremely svelte appearance and light overall weight.
The SR-15 is equipped with a match grade trigger assembly and offers completely ambidextrous controls. This is already a comprehensive package on its own and does not require excessive modular accessories for performance enhancement. The KAC SR-15 is the first rifle model with an Integral Weapons System (IWS) that combines both built-in and modular features."

Modeled after a glock looks, handles, and shoots nice. Comes with a mixed batch of bbs and pellets. Asking for less than half value. The pistol sells for around 100, the daisy for 50 then with the cases, ammo, air cartridges, and scope it all adds up quick. Trade for something else.

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel."

    Features: The PM9 is the only Government size Dan Wesson model chambered in 9mm Luger. We have offered this model in limited quantities in the past and always have demand greater than production capacity allows. This gun features our Clark style rib on top of the forged slide with an adjustable target sight in the rear and a popular fiber-optic sight in the front. The slide also features front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering. We have polished the flats to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounds for a nice contrast. We have installed Double Diamond cocobolo grips to finish it off. With the low cost of 9mm ammunition and lack of recoil, this is the perfect model for getting acquainted with the 1911. This model shines both at the range and in competition. (9+1 capacity)

Model A1041. Competition grade rifle.
Only selling because I have decided to get a good quality 22lr semi-auto target style handgun. It is very accurate, dependable and these are very rare and hard to find because people keep them. Never had a ftf, fte, jams or any issues.
High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, used in the Olympics and for all around shooting. Longer barrel, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and reduces malfunctions and keeps the receiver cleaner. Another unique feature is the receiver doesn't feed another round until you release the trigger.
This rifle is in excellent condition and will shoot 22longs, shorts and 22long rifle, any brand. It has been kept clean inside and out.
Sell for $350.00 comes with case, or might consider good quality 22lr semi-auto target handgun. Please, I am not looking for offers, this price is firm and well worth it.

To see pic. Click on other listing.


Mine is new in box, unfired.  No issues with it.  Comes with all normal stuff and 2 mags.


I prefer the Glock OD or FDE color.......the one I really want is like the desert sand color GEN 4, but I am open to any Gen 4.  Might possibly consider a Gen 3 if the right deal.


Mine is stock so does not need to have Night Sights but if it has a trigger job done by gunsmith, that would be great.  If yours has extras like trigger job, extra mags, extended slide release, pinky extensions, we should be able to work something out to make up difference if price is realistic.





Must be FL Resident and legal age, no felons......prefer cwp and FTF only near Clermont............please look it up b4 emailing me.  I will only drive 10-15 minutes to do this which would be the edge of Clermont.





I prefer New with box gun, but possibly open to a very lightly used one.  





I would also consider trading toward an inexpensive AR. By inexpensive I mean under $1200 based on walmart pricing. I have a few other guns I could trade and a bunch of ammo I can trade to even up the deal.  Mostly 9mm ammo and 22lr.  I cant add cash!   

Upper and lower must be same manufacturer please.

 I was told that this gun fired off one mag about 25 years ago-And after seeing this gun I believe it, this could pass as never fired. After slowly, carefully stripping it down I've found most of the springs were just hardened stiff-and there was very little powder residue on the feed ramp. I cleaned it all out lubed it up and replaced all the springs with a set of Wilson Combat springs-a standard set-not competition springs. And that's it-everything else is original. As you can see the gun is flawless- If you didn't know better you would think it was never fired. Forget the fact that its not only a collectible gun-with a cool box-Its a mint Colt 1911 built in 1970-that feels and looks like a new one-and you can run it at the range-along with your other guns.

____________________________________________________
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

This rifle is extremely accurate and I have taken lots of deer with it.
It has a 4X scope on it that's very clear.
I have the iron sights for it as well.
Has brass ram rod and it has the dual triggers.  You can set the rear trigger and then
the front is a hair trigger for target shooting or you can just use the front one by itself 
and it's a regular pull.
This rifle is in great shape.  I have always cleaned it right after shooting.
I use Triple Seven powder and with sabots and 250gr bullet it will hold 1"" groups at 50yds.   There are some small marks on the stock and barrel from being in the woods but there is no rust.  You are welcome to shoot it before buying if you would like to try it out.     $225

The criteria for the gun: Fired 12 (2 mags) HP 9mm, like new, little much for this 77yrs old. No one knows you are carrying.
 To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.

State of the Art:
 Our firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
