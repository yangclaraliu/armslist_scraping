Received two for Christmas, so this one can go. I had already purchased a drop in stainless trigger and hammer, with all new inner components to set the trigger pull at a nice 3.5 lbs... . I have used these before, and they are a great improvement over stock. . Also has a new Pacymyer grip. The fit on this gun is really nice, tighter than I recall most RIA's being. The only thing I did was remove all the excess oil, and add the grip. I am including the original grips as well.

Update..... I have been getting some real low ball offers, don't need to sell this at all.... here is what I have in the gun, not including any transfer fees, etc

The gun was 419 from Buds, The hammer and sear kit was 134 from Cylinder and Slide..... Trigger to match was 45..... Installation and additional smoothing of the frame is 100.... finally, the grip was 60.....and the compensator 60 plus had to install a new grip safety to work with the combat hammer which was another 40.... almost 860 dollars total...... so asking price is more than fair, I realize not everyone wants a 200 dollar trigger job on a RIA, but for those who appreciate what this is, you are getting a very nice deal.....   

The box and everything that came with the gun is included, along with the original grips, and the orginal trigger, hammer, safety, etc"

113,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2607113,For Sale:  Powder: 16 lbs (or less) sealed jugs of WC-857 (tested right at H870 and MR8700),"Hartford. KS (hour south ot Topeka), Topeka, Kansas",$ 80,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 9, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This ball powder is quite consistent and has proven itself to be a good, diverse go-to for several great loads in several calibers this last year since I got it in May 2013.  I'm ONLY selling what I know I won't shoot in a lifetime here and I've proven the burn rate in many guns so this lot is tested and very stable in all loads I used it in.

Ball powder does typically burn a bit more dirty than stick powders on average, BUT it ALSO burns cooler than IMR4831, IMR4850 and a few other ""popular"" stick powders.  So barrel life is extended using ball powders like this one.  I've shot a lot of Mil-spec ball powder (in standard NATO military loads for 5.56mm) rounds out of my .223 and the same ball powder does leave a bit of ""ash"" in SOME rifles-- which needs cleaning about every 80-100 rounds.  But many stick powders ALSO have this issue (totally depending on the load), so if it's good enough for the military in the desert with AR-15s going all week long-- ball powder is good enough for me ;)

63 grains (a full case in my brass) in my Ruger M-77, 25-06 hits abut 3100 FPS and burns as clean as any other ball power (like Winchester powders at over twice the price).

My 7MM/Mag likes 80 grains (about a full case) at 3100 fps on a 139 gr. bullet.  Again, the burn is slower than some popular powders, but for this caliber a full case (vs. 85-90% case of IMR4831) gets the same velocity as other popular powders; and in my gun-- the same accuracy.  My 800 lb elk shot at 400 yards (in the neck with a Hornady SST 139 gr) this last Dec. went down like they all do when I shoot them with any other powder ;)

My buddy's 300 Weatherby Mag LOVES this stuff and he's slowly replacing his IMR and Hogden powders with this stuff too.  Yet another reloading buddy has used it in his Laupa .338 and is getting good results after some time on his 500 yrd. range!

I bought SIX jugs (8 lbs each) to offset the $30 Hazmat fee and was going to give 1/2 of it to some buddies on a fishing trip, but they couldn't wait and they went and bought theirs already.  So I was just going to keep it, but I realized after a while that I will NEVER use it all.  So I'm keeping three jugs and I have THREE left-- for exactly what I have in them.

SO here's the deal.. I paid $72 a jug plus $50 in shipping (for six) so about $8 a jug for shipping and there is my gas to meet a buyer also.  So $90 a jug (which comes to $11 a lb, BTW) and I have ONE jug left to sell.

I've shot about 2 lbs the last 8 months in five calibers (both reduced loads and full power loads) and have friends in TX and NM who have shot a few rounds this last year-- we all love this stuff.  I have a great ""duplex"" load for my .223 (I really love, 1"" groups at 200 yards through a bold Savage Axis!!), but you have to KNOW (and prove it to me) that you know what you are doing before I give you this load data/method.  

Anyway, at $32 a lb at my local store for the ONE lb. ""canister"" of IMR, Hodgden or Alliant powers (which I can't find these days!)--- this stuff shoots as good (and better in more and more cases as I figure it out) for 1/3dr the cost.  

It is dead on with H870 in my 7mm/Mag and my buddy's Weatherby 300 Mag. in Sierra's and Speer's books (older 1990 editions).  It also lines up with loads for MR8700 (in my Speer #11 book) too.  If you want a textbook load for these rifles, this powder (I have tested well) fits the books (in the lot I have) like a glove for these two powders.  And I'm happy to share my pet loads with any buyers after the sale.

Now... any buyer should know that EACH gun has a different chamber and velocity than others and just like the book says... you should start out a bit under the max load and ""work it up"" from there.  Also note that the books rarely have a load for a powder that didn't really fit the gun they were testing.  For example: a 30/06 is a larger bore caliber than say a .270 or an (even smaller) 25/06 has-- even thought they ALL USE the Springfield 30/06 case size for ALL these calibers.  And so THIS powder isn't a good go-to for smaller calibers (under say a .243) OR larger caliber guns with small weigh, larger diameter bullets (like the 30/06 again where this powder would shoot well, but be closer to the bottom on speed compared to other hotter powders).  BUT when you step up to a ANY Weatherby, a 25/06, 270, 280 Rem Mag, 7mm Mag, 300 Win mag-- and anything up from there (with higher velocity smaller bore bullets), this stuff works very, very well.  It would NOT be a good powder for a .308 or lighter bullets in a 30/06 or say a 30-30 because the bores are too large and the cases too small for this powder to build the pressure those calibers need.  This powder REALLY shines on the medium to heavy bullet weight range in ALL loads in larger caliber, small bore guns (as listed above and a few others too such as the 22-250, a very ""tight"" bore caliber, that might run great with this too but I haven't tested that caliber).

I can't say enough good things about this powder (obviously), but I don't go to a range every month, I don't target shoot much and the three jugs I'm keeping are basically a lifetime supply to me as a hunter.  So I thought I'd share a ""tested"" lot I confirmed to hit right at H870 and MR8700 burn rates with someone looking for a larger caliber. Mag powder they can afford and they could save their money and help me get a bit back myself too.

Read your books, look at loads for you rifle for these two common canister powers and if the book lists it, this will load the same and have the same burn rate and velocities as H870 and MR 8700 (it's basically the same size, shape, and cut ball powder as these two famous canister powders that have been around for 50 years are/were).  Remember also... the ONLY difference between a ""canister"" labeled powder Vs. a mil-surp powder is YOU have to prove it's burn rate (Vs. trusting it's label).  They ALL come from the same manufacturers folks!  And now that I HAVE proven this lot's burn rate, any buyer can safely take it (like a canister powder costing 3 times what this stuff costs) and use his/her books to work up accurate, consistent loads.  And if you are a well seasoned reloader, there are some great kicker and duplex loads I've shot MOST of this powder through and the performance has been nothing short of great.  I own a LOT of IMR, Alliant and Hogden powders on my bench and I respect them all.   This WC-857 is as consistent and accurate as any of the old favorites, it meters very nicely, and it's a SAFE powder to work with as it's a slow burner (hard to over-load) which makes it such a great fit to the larger calibers when loaded to the books.

Your name and number is required for a reply (please).  All else is spam.  Sincere, seasoned buyers over 18 years old only please.  If you don't know what you are talking about over email or at a face-to-face meeting; it is my civic and moral duty to deny you the purchase of this powder.

From what I can tell it was made between the mid 50's and early 60's by the proof marks. The stock is in good condition, it was cracked near the butt, but someone fixed it before we got it and did a pretty good job. The barrel and butt plate were painted black so we took them down to bare metal and re blued them. The bolt was cleaned and polished. The rifle shoots very nice and the bore is good, the only problem is there is some slight expansion of the casing when it is fired and makes it a little tough to eject the shell.  Overall it is in pretty nice condition. Price is firm and includes shipping. Must be shipped to FFL. For more info please call, text or email Lenny.

Now that I'm getting back into things I've noticed that most places I shoot require me to buy their ammo. I also don't really have the time nor the room to pursue reloading anymore so there's little sense in completing my setup much less keeping it around. 

So here's what I got (with links for reference purposes):

I'm also throwing in an shellholder (Redding Reloading Equipment P/N 11006) that was for another die set I sold a few months ago and a bag once fired .223 Rem brass, over 100 ct...don't make me count them let's just say there's quite a bit in there. 

I'm asking for $100 for the entire lot. Everything still in box and unused. I'm not going to piece it out because I want it all gone and I don't want the headache of posting more ads.


This is a pretty decent deal for the right person. 

Trades: I'm interested in a new or used Glock 19. I also have a tricked out Ruger 10/22 and some cash so if you're willing to negotiate then I'm positive we can work something out."

The action is tight and times properly, with nil rotational and fore-aft cylinder play. There is no cylinder turn line, not even a hint of tracks in the leads to the notches. There are no scratches, no dings, and no pits. The hard rubber grips fit perfectly and show minute storage marks along the bottom edges, but no cracks, chips, or repairs; they are original to the gun and properly numbered. The mechanics are in perfect working order; the bore is is mirror bright and like new; and the recoil shield and forcing cone indicate a negligible round count. This revolver appears to be unfired. It comes in an original pre-war Colt box with its label missing. The box is crisp with only the slightest wear. A mint condition Colt instruction pamphlet is included.shipping cost $50"

I got it for carry use but I picked up an XDS so I wont be using it.

Has been carried and has seem some use but is in overall good shape and in excellent mechanical condition. Say what you will about Taurus but these are known to run well and has the same capacity as a Glock 30 but with a shorter overall length and height. This one will come with its box and two 10 round mags.

The frame is steel, as is the trigger guard.  The butt plate and grip cap are horn, I believe. There is a cartridge trap nicely engraved with a wood sprite, some ducks and leaves. The barrels are approximately 25 Â½ inches long. LOP is 14 inches to the front set trigger, 13 to the rear trigger. Weight is approximately 7 Â¼ pounds.   The pop up sight works when the rifle is selected.  The Greener safety is raised so it is much easier to use than the standard flush Greener.  This gun has the separate extractor for the rifle barrel and the fore end is slim. These nice features were dropped in later models. There is a slight cast to the stock.  The finish on this gun shows use. There are some scratches and marks on the stock and wear and marks in the bluing.  There is a crack in the forend that has been there since I bought this gun. The tip of the hook of the Deeley latch was broken at some point. The fore end stays on, but if I were keeping the gun, I would eventually have that repaired.  I had the shotgun chambers lengthened to 2 Â¾, the trigger guard repaired, firing pins repaired, and fitted for a 22 mag insert by PISCO Gunsmithing. Shot patterns are a tight modified. Iâve shot 1.5-2 inch groups with the open sights off the sticks at fifty yards with the rifle with Norma ammo.  Thatâs as good as I can do with open sights. This is a great go anywhere shoot anything gun.  Although this is a war era gun, there are no Nazi marks on this gun that I can see.  Price for the gun is $3100. The 22 magnum adapter is available with the gun for an additional $250.  I've had some great days in the woods with this gun, but need the time has come to let this German girl find a new friend.

I've hunted deer and small game here in PA and in VA with this gun. The frame and trigger guard are steel. Barrels are approximately 27 inches long. This gun has a Greener crossbolt and safety. The LOP is 14 Â½ inches to the front set trigger and 13 3/8 inches to the rear trigger. The rifle sight pops up when the rifle barrel is selected. This gun has the separate extractor for the rifle barrel and the fore end is slim. These nice features were dropped after the war until the mid fifties.  I had Champlin Arms go over the gun,  fit it with a swing mount to mount the Leupold 1.5-5X scope, lengthen the shotgun chambers to 2 Â¾ inches,and set up the right shotgun barrel to receive a 22 mag insert.  Insert is not included.  The butt plate and grip cap are plastic. A previous owner shortened the rifle barrel about 3/8 of an inch.  This does not seem to have affected its accuracy.  I shoot this rifle at my fifty yard range and get 5/8â inch groups for three slow fired shots. I will include reloading dies and brass for 7x65R with the sale.  Price of rifle, scope, dies and brass is $3350."

AI stocked it with a Super Fancy piece of Walnut that was 1000$ just for the blank. It has amazing figure and fiddle rumming complety thru the blank. A lady who is a master engraver with Colt Firearms did the beautiful wrap around checkering and thumb strap. She also hand engraved the floor plate. This rifle will out shoot the 338 Lapua 10 to 1 and look beautiful doing it. Comes with the weatherby 3by9 scope that's crystal clear. Also comes with a one of only 200 made NRA limited edition slings. I have been getting a lot of screwball and goofball offers for trades and questions. Do your research first on this caliber and the company who built the rifle before you ask stupid questions. Ill be happy to talk with you all you want once you know what your talking about.

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter. Highly Accurate The accuracy and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m. Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing. High Capacity Magazine The FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine. Extremely Light and Ergonomic. The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns. Well-balanced, with smooth contours,  the FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.

I have for sale or trade a rare little old pistol. It is a 25 acp ""MAB"" French made pistol. It is one of the more rare ones that came with the nickel finish instead of regular blued. It also comes with the original Leather holster for it and one factory 6 rd mag. The gun has definitely seen better days and has a large amount of wear but shoots great. she might not be the prettiest example of these but it shot fine for me with no hitches (except the one dud round i had haha). This pistol more specifically is a Model A, 2nd variant. Dating these is really difficult due to a lack of any real records, but this is one of the older models because it is a variant 2 and a model A. This appears to be all original except one screw on the grips looks to have been replaced. Because the value for these is all over the board I think my asking price is fair. I would also trade for a bunch of different kinds of guns, primarily pistols though. Please dont lowball or try and waste our times with needless comments. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). Please message with any offers or questions and I will try and respond as soon as I can! I can get more pictures as well if you desire. 
Thanks and have a great day!"

I have a dozen ARs so a few need to go.

This is a really nice rifle.  It's a shooter & not a safe queen so there will be some light wear marks.  Not a beater by any means & I'd rate it 95%+ overall.  Overall condition is what you'd expect for an AR with about 1,000 rds that has been taken of.  It's very accurate and very reliable with zero issues.  Comes with one USGI 30 rd magazine.

Lower was built with RRA parts & Wolff reduced power trigger/hammer springs.  Has a very nice trigger pull but still ignites hard military primers with no issue.
