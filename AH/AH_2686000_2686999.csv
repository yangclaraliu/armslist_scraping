(*All NFA rules apply).

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*
 Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

The reason I am selling it is because the slide lock notch has been worked on. Meaning, the notch that the slide lock lever locks into to lock the slide back has been filed to actuate an easier release if you use the slide lock lever to drop the slide. It is a small alteration, and does not impede function, however it is a modification that I didn't want as I literally wanted a 100% original, unaltered gen2 G19 for collecting purposes. See picture below.

I am looking for $550, which includes one 15rd mag. I also have a Crimson Trace lasergrip (# LG619) that I am looking to sell separately for $175 which is in likewise excellent condition. If the buyer is interested in both I would do a package for $700 total.

Buyer must hold a current/valid NH drivers license and P&R permit, as well as agreeing to a bill of sale."

The 522 has the same size and feel of Sig's larger center fire rifles and is fun to shoot as well as being a good training tool that shoots much cheaper ammo.  The rifle came from the factory with no sights so I have installed a 4 X 14 power scope.  If a person wanted iron sights, they are readily available and fairly cheap at any gun store.  The rifle comes with the original hard case, a 25 round magazine and I will include a brick (525 rounds) of .22 long rifle ammo.  These retail for almost $600 so I'm not exactly getting rich from it when you add in the scope and ammo.  Please no trades, I don't want your broken down car, your nasty used waffle iron or the uniforms you wore in Afghanistan.  Please don't ask me to hold it for you, I've been burned twice in the last three weeks doing that.  Need to see WA DL or ID. Asking $500 cash firm.

I purchased but never fired this rifle but it appears to be in perfect working condition. Rifle is missing bayonet and rear left escutcheon (if you don't know what this is, google it) but is otherwise complete. Has lost some bluing. I would call bluing similar in appearance to the Chinese T-53's that are the recent rage. Bolt face appears clean and bolt rides smooth. Stock is in decent condition, not heavily shellacked. 

In my opinion, judging from the stock and condition of the bluing, this does not appear to be a post-war refurb. There are NO import marks on this rifle and the serial number is all matching throughout. NO forced match. All serial number stampings appear in identical font. Bore appears decent and it is NOT counter-bored. No cleaning rod or other accessories included.

The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

These have an interesting history. Prior to WWII Warlord General Yen Hsi-Shan controlled Shansi Province where he commissioned the opening of the Shansi Military Technology Practice Factory. Weapons of any type could be reverse engineered by his craftsmen, the first was the Chinese copy of .45 ACP Thompson submachine gun. The Mauser Broomhandle had always been considered a first rate military handgun in China and Yen decided that a copy chambered in .45 ACP should be produced to compliment his Thompsons. Designated the Type 17, production on the .45 caliber pistol began in 1929. They are inscribed (in Chinese) ""Type 17"" on the left hand side of the gun, and ""Republic Year Eighteen, Made in Shansi"" on the right hand side. The Shansi .45 pistols are noticeably larger than their 7.63mm counterparts, with the 10-round magazine extending below the trigger guard. Approximately 8,500 Shansi .45 caliber Broomhandle pistols are believed to have been produced but most were destroyed after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. A few were supplied as military aid to Vietnam in the 1960’s and some offered overseas for sale on the commercial market. This pistol is in very good condition with most of the original finish remaining. There is general fading/thinning but no significant rust or deep pitting. The serial number of this example is ""911"" and all serial numbered parts are matching. The pistol is import marked. The mechanics appear to be in good working order and the bore is excellent with bright sharp rifling! It comes in a special fitted leather and canvas case and includes a cleaning rod and a stripper clip. These are hard to find and this pistol is far better than most examples that you will encounter."

for full working rifles i will pay $135 as that is what it will take me to get one shipped to a dealer and out the door (proof: http://www.classicfirearms.com/long-guns/originalmolotm9130wbayob   cost is 100 for complete rifle plus 18 for shipping and local shops charge 15-20 for a transfer)

for a barreled action with bolt i will pay up to 90 depending on how complete it is and what the cosmetic condition is. (trigger assembly, front/rear sight optional but i do require the ejector/interrupter assembly on the left side of the receiver and the magazine to be intact)

i will not leave terre haute for this. sorry
i will not entertain offers to ship the rifle or action to me, i do not want a free membership to the federal country club.
i will pay with cash.
if you are in vigo county i can get to you if you are set on selling and are coming from outside the county and are selling the barreled action i could give a little gas money for your trouble depending on the distance you must travel.

 The Story: I have owned this gun for 46 years. I bought it from a US Navy shipmate while serving in Viet Nam. Our Destroyer was assigned to Gun Fire Support missions off  the coast  between 1966 and 1968. We would be out to sea for months at a time only to make port for a few days in Yokosuka Japan, Hong Kong or Subic Bay Philippines, then back out to sea. Young Sailors with little liberty would go through money like water. A shipmate of mine desperate for some ""R &R Money"" offered to sell me this gun. I bought and owned it ever since.
The Deal: In Person sale in or near North Carolina or I will ship  My FFL dealer to Your FFL dealer with a full payment in advance. You pay for shipping and one FFL fee, I will pay the FFL fee on my end. Scammers beware, I will be check out potential buyers and Gun shops.

I have close to $1600 in this set up, scope mount alone was $75.00, has a sniper barrel mount bipod was another $60, so when you look at this package the rifle would be $500 or less, and comes with extras you need and want and at the package price, is still over 1/3 what you would go out and pay just to get it to this point
so today only if we meet close I will do $900 cash, there is $300+ alone in ammo that goes with the rifle, which would put the rifle at $470 that is a steal for this set up!!!!
I Live 30 miles out of Aberdeen so looking to meet close at this price, I will be coming to Seattle tomorrow if I can sell this today, I'm disabled and dying and actually for the first time in 6 yrs as of tomorrow I might walk again, lost my left leg 6 yrs ago, and they just finished my prosthetic leg, and if I can get the money to drive the 350 mile rd trip tomorrow I have a chance again to walk before I pass on from a rare genetic blood disorder I have. so that is truly the only reason I would ever let this go this cheap. 
I have to go up on the 3rd of next month and was going to just pick it up then, but you have to understand I thought after 68 surgery's in 5 1/2 yrs that I would never walk again before I died, so I really want to go up there and get it.

But please do the math, if your looking for a Fal style rifle, these are very accurate and are hard as hell to just find, compared to like the millions of Glocks and AR10s out there, get a 5 rd mag and go hunting!!!!!
ok so please leave me your # and lets hook up, I really want to go up to Seattle tomorrow!!!

This gun comes with all factory equipment and paperwork. Manufacturer description follows:

New from Nighthawk Custom, a 9mm 1911 designed for Concealed Carry that contains some of the newest features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a shorter 9mm platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began mid-summer of 2012. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like the company’s popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and cut flush with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has new cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by the company. Grips are like the T3, but are thinned for less bulk.
The new T4 will make its premier at the 2013 Shot Show.
More to come after new photos and specs are finished.
Barrel length is 3.8”. Available in Steel or Aluminum frame upgrade.
MSRP is $3,350.00"

Chrome lined barrel, and chamber.  Shots up to 3 inch magnum shells.  Makes a great pheasant and duck gun but I don't hunt anymore.  I do not want to part with it, but it's never going to leave my safe."
