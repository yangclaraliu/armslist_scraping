So it has no brand name like sig, secondly the lower is a POLYMER LOWER so if you have an agenda with it not being metal im sorry this isnt for you. Thirdly, I will not seperate the two . 

I have a basic Ar15 that needs either a new extractor or a whole new bolt carrier group. Unfortunately for me, I need the money right now so I have to let this beauty go. I am asking $550 for her but I am willing to go down a tad bit but not much.

Think black preservation paint on the metal, cosmolene everywhere else. And lots of it. The rifle has excellent bore and function. We spent quite a bit of time first heat-soaking the cosmolene out and the cleaning the remainder out with simple green and elbow grease and time. The stock took a lot of work to get it all out but once it was done and cleaned she began rubbing it down daily for a 7 day treatment with linseed oil. Then weekly. It's now where it would be done monthly. The stock really started glowing after the first week. While the rifle is not perfect, it is in the condition it would have been as it left the field and entered the arsenal for storage. It's unit-marked and also is post-India Independence, and is so marked. These rifles are the same as an Enfield Mark 1 No 3 or SMLE but were only used for service in India. It's in very good condition for it's age and definitely a shooter and collectable rifle, capable of firing both 7.62x51 NATO and also commercial .308 Winchester ammo safely.  The rifle has recently had 15 rounds run through it and is REALLY fun to shoot.  The extractor is a bit marginal, this is a known issue with the design as the .308 is a rimless cartridge and the original .303 Enfield was rimmed.  I'm told there are modifications that can be one to correct this."

I'd say it's had a tad over 1000 rounds through it. It runs flawless. Just enough rounds to break it in and prove reliability. It has a USGI fiberglass stock and hand guard that SAI replaced the buttpad on and fitted for the scout mount. The muzzle break has been replaced with a USGI flash hider. I attached Magpul MOE rail so an AFG or vertical grip can be used. The second piece of MOE rail is installed at the 9 o'clock position for your choice of light. This kept the weight down while allowing som 21st century practicality. It keeps the ""rifle"" feel and ergonomics while allowing a few accessories without adding a heavy EBR system. The pattern is woodland krylon sprayed over the SAI krinkle coat. There is three light coats of tan as a base for excellent wear. Included is the M14 web sling, 10x military contract CMI mags, 1x SAI mag, and one reliable no-name training mag. That's about $300 in mags. The CMI mags are all new in vapor barrier. 

The way I break down the value is this:
Rifle (with SAI mag and no-name mag) - $1400
CMI Mags - $250
Flash hider - $80
MOE rails and labor - $ I dunno, wasn't too tough
AFG - $35"

Cut for the standard Rem #3 Varmint / Tactical barrel;
Easily modified for 5R mil. spec. and most other heavy contours;
Includes the 700 SPS, XCR, VTR Varmint and Tactical type rifles.

""The Hook"" is designed as a “drop-in” for the heavy barrel Remington Model 700 BDL or DBM (short action). It has an extended grip and a fairly wide forend with dual front sling studs to allow for both bipod and sling attachment. The hooked cutout underside is designed as a steady-holding feature - simply jam your off-hand into the recess for an isometrically-solidified rest, ideal for varmint, target or tactical field applications!
The stock has no checkering and like all in the “Medalist” line, it has the integral aluminum bedding system that is computer designed and CNC machined out of aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum. The aluminum block extends through the forearm to add strength and stiffness and incorporates the attachment of the front sling swivel for additional security. An aluminum “tail piece” also extends from the bedding block through the grip area to add rigidity and to strengthen the stock. The stock is designed to be “free-floated” and it comes with a standard length of pull of 13 3/4” with a Pachmayr Decellerator pad

This stock is essentially new I only fired 20 rounds from the bench with it. Never bedded. Asking $250 FTF. Will ship if you cover shipping cost."

569,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2874569,For Sale:  460 ROWLAND 230 gr. HC-FN 1350fps / 931ft. lbs.,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=230

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

Note my real world velocities (below) from real world pistols, not laboratory test barrels.

Glass is clean and clear.

All lenses are glass and multicoated for enhanced light transmission, image clarity and freedom from aberration. Each scope is waterproof, shockproof and fogproof. Prolonged exposure to sub-freezing cold followed by immediate and prolonged immersion in hot water failed to cause any leakage or problems. Plus, they have been extensively torture-tested on hard-recoiling rifles without ever having an element shake loose. 1"" tubes are rigid, precisely machined aluminum. Windage and elevation adjustments are 1/4-MOA clicks.

From the Glock website:

""The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.""
