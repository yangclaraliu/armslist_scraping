THROWBOT XT,"ALL, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, September 23, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Throwbot® XT is, pound-for-pound, the most versatile, robust, stealthy and easy-to-deploy tactical robot system in the world.

Inherently water and dust resistant, the Throwbot XT is a personal sensor system for tactical operators. It weighs just 1.2lbs (540g) and can be thrown up to 120 feet (36m). The sensor is also exceptionally quiet (operating at just 22 decibels) and is equipped with an infrared optical system that activates automatically when the ambient light is low, enabling the operator to see in complete darkness.

Once deployed, the micro-robot can be directed by the operator to quietly move through a structure and transmit video and audio to the handheld Operator Control Unit II (OCU II). These stealth capabilities can be utilized to locate armed subjects, confirm the presence of hostages or innocent civilians, listen in on conversations, and reveal the layout of rooms – information that can save lives and increase the success of high-risk operations.

THROWBOT XT,"all, Dallas, Texas",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, September 23, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Throwbot® XT is, pound-for-pound, the most versatile, robust, stealthy and easy-to-deploy tactical robot system in the world.

Inherently water and dust resistant, the Throwbot XT is a personal sensor system for tactical operators. It weighs just 1.2lbs (540g) and can be thrown up to 120 feet (36m). The sensor is also exceptionally quiet (operating at just 22 decibels) and is equipped with an infrared optical system that activates automatically when the ambient light is low, enabling the operator to see in complete darkness.

Once deployed, the micro-robot can be directed by the operator to quietly move through a structure and transmit video and audio to the handheld Operator Control Unit II (OCU II). These stealth capabilities can be utilized to locate armed subjects, confirm the presence of hostages or innocent civilians, listen in on conversations, and reveal the layout of rooms – information that can save lives and increase the success of high-risk operations. 

The robot may be purchased with or without audio (listening) capabilities, or upgraded to listening-enabled at a later date. The Throwbot XT may also be specified in any of three predetermined transmitting frequencies, enabling operators to use up to three robots in the same environment at the same time."

These models are a bit rarer than the standard blued/parkerized/hard chrome versions. I have seen very few of the factory cerakoted versions. As a plus, it's rust proof and looks sharp - always a good combination. Also, the stainless pocket clip from kel tec makes it very handy as a pocket gun. 

Only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I prefer snub nose revolvers as my CCW and I just don't carry it as much as my .357 LCR.

"" My favorite gun is my Henry 22 pump! 


Thanks for making such a family-friendly collection of great rifles. You have a much better understanding of what people enjoy about shooting than do other firearm companies. Our Henry lever action is high quality, easy to use, accurate, and an absolute pleasure to handle. You have no competitors in value for the price.

Here is a photo of my wife at the range with the Henry I gave her for Christmas. As an immigrant from China, where individuals aren't allowed to own firearms, she has a special appreciation of our second amendment rights.





The Henry Pump Action  .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom's apple pie, a restored '57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump , available in calibers .22LR, is one gun that is built for the ages.

 I was told that this gun fired off one mag about 25 years ago-And after seeing this gun I believe it, this could pass as never fired. After slowly, carefully stripping it down I've found most of the springs were just hardened stiff-and there was very little powder residue on the feed ramp. I cleaned it all out lubed it up and replaced all the springs with a set of Wilson Combat springs-a standard set-not competition springs. And that's it-everything else is original. As you can see the gun is flawless- If you didn't know better you would think it was never fired. Forget the fact that its not only a collectible gun-with a cool box-Its a mint Colt 1911 built in 1970-that feels and looks like a new one-and you can run it at the range-along with your other guns.

This is a stainless steel barrel finished in flat black. It is 18"" length with the midlength gas system. The barrel end is finished with a nice crown and threaded 1/2x28 for muzzle devices. The barrel extension is cut with M4 feed ramps.

This barrel was installed on a rifle and fired less than 100 rounds through it before being replaced. There is nothing wrong with the barrel, it is very nice cosmetically and operationally. Only sign that it is used is some typical heat scoring where the gas block mounts. This is covered by your gas block.

This revolver is well balanced and offers more power per ounce than practically any other handgun. While the .357 Magnum may be considered a bit light for hunting the game we all like to take, the fact remains that the original Magnum has taken every game animal in North America.  The history of the Combat Magnum begins in 1899 with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Military and Police revolver. This medium frame revolver is among the best handling and smoothest revolvers ever produced. The Military and Police gained wide acceptance due to its excellent handling qualities. The inherent accuracy of the type was recognized early on and a number of adjustable sight versions were introduced."

These guns are still hard to find and I’ve done a gentle, thorough test of this gun so you’ll pretty much know what ammo you can shoot with it.  No Plus P ammo was used in this gun and no reloads, though it is rated for Plus P for self defense.  It’s just not recommended that that be used much otherwise.   And though it may shoot reloads just fine, I have not tried any.   I only used standardized factory loads - so I could accurately predict what it would shoot the best.

It’s had a total of around 250 rounds through it.   

Included with this fine gun is the original magazine.   Also included is the Original Box with matching Serial Numbers, the soft zippered pouch and all of the original papers, the lock, etc.

Yours for $735 Cash

Also, buy this now, and you can get more magazines before I up them to Ebay.   
$30 for another regular magazine or 
$35 for an extended magazine.   
I also have extra wood grips that might be an option.
I did not believe I’d ever sell this gun.


Of this gun, Kimber says,    ""USE ONLY RECOMMENDED AMMUNITION
Solo is designed to function optimally using premium hollow-point self-defense factory ammunition with bullet weights of 124 or 147 grains.

EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

• Federal® Hydra-Shok® JHP
• Remington® Golden Saber™ HPJ
• Hornady TAP® JHP

While other ammunition may perform well, lighter bullets and inconsistent pressures that can be found in lower-quality ammunition may lead to decreased slide cycle time and compromise function."" 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, since I’ve not been ready to go to the self-defense ammo yet, but have still been shooting practice ammo with my guns, I set out to see which ammo,of the ammo available to me, this gun shot the best.   I assumed that most 124 grain and 147 grain would shoot the best.

I’ve shot the following rounds with NO PROBLEMS whatsoever:

1.  Federal 147gr JHP 9ms 10 rounds
2.  American Eagle 147gr FMJ 10 rounds
3.  PMC Bronze 124GR FMJ 9mm 50 rounds
4.  Remington 124 Gr Metal Case R9MM2 25 rounds
5.  Remington 115 Gr JHP R9mm1 (20 year old ammo) 30 rounds
6.  Remington-Peters JHP (Older Ammo) - 17 rounds -no problem
7.  Hirtenberger 100gr Soft Pt Fl (lead fill) Law Enforcement Grade J =P+   5 rounds

I later shot some more of these with the gun dirty and again had no problems with them.

I  also shot:

1.  Blazer 124 Grain FMJ Aluminum (type 3578)  Shot 10 Rounds - later 20 rounds -no problem
2.  American Eagle 115 Grain - Shot 15 rounds - no problem
3.  Remington UMC 115 Grain FMG - I shot 14 rounds - no problem

However, later with the gun dirtier - I did have a problem or two with these three ammos.


With the following I had serious continued problems - I would not put these in the Solo again for any reason:

1.  Remington 147 Grain UMC 23732 L9MM9   The gun was dirty - but the 15th shell stuck in the barrel, and then 3 shots later stuck again Like the shell expanded too much.   Not a feeding problem but an ejection one.
2.  Aguila FMJ 124Gr - 9 rounds - last one a double feed.  Note, this is actually a FTE quickly enough.  When one shell fails to eject in time and the next shell tries to load - both are sitting there together - called a double feed.    Shot more later - even more problems with gun dirty.
3.  Blazer Bronze 124 Gr   Terrible - tried many times - Round would not eject right -So second round would be blocked by it.  Gun dirty, but still not an OK round for this.
4.  Speer Lawman 115Gr FMJ 53615 - Nothing but problems - every second shot.   Gun dirty, but still not an OK round for this.

So, in summary - In addition to what Kimber recommends for self defense, this gun fires great with most 147 Grain ammo, and the better 124 grain ammo I’ve tested.  Clearly, because of its short stroke slide (the gun is only 5 ½ inches long) it needs more powerful ammo to push its powerful spring all the way back quickly so the next round can load.)   Like a lot of people, I was curious enough to try all of my ammo (no reloads though) to see how well it operated.   The gun shoots great, is the most accurate of the small 9mm for me, and is a pleasure to shoot.  I cannot fault the gun for not liking underpowered and lower quality ammo.   It is actually my favorite CC sized gun to shoot, but is just too easy for me to shoot (see more of this at end of article)

I have also owned the Kahr MK9, the Ruger LC9, the Sig P938, the Colt Mustang (380), and have also shot the Kahr CM9, CW45, the Beretta Nano, the Micro Eagle (380), and a Bersa 380.

In addition to the thumb safety and an inertia firing pin, “The Kimber system also utilizes a firing pin safety that prevents the gun from being fired unless the trigger is fully depressed.”

Wondering why I'm selling? Only one reason - and that's with great regret! This gun shoots too easy (as did my MK9 and as do all of the striker fired guns). The trigger is smooth as butter. And it has adequate pull before it fires.  It's right on track for a great striker fired gun.  But, as I'm finding out - I'm a safety nut and am selling all guns that do not have redundant safeties. This does have a thumb safety and an inertia firing pin.   But it’s still a little too easy for ME to shoot.

I want to carry a 1911 style gun with the chamber loaded and the hammer down, and have only single action to where it can only be fired by cocking my hammer first - and that only when I need it.  So this is leading me to the Colt Mustang or Sig P238 or Sig P938.   These have all of the above.   But some will say - “Well, what if you are cocking those in your pocket and the hammer slips?”     No big deal - I can cock it again.   If your hammer slips while you’re cocking it on these guns - (with you finger off of the trigger now), it falls into a half-cock safety position - it does not hit the firing pin.   Just about fool-proof.	

(On a non 1911 style gun, then, I’d want a Thumb safety, a Magazine safety or de-cocker and long hard action pulls - like the Ruger LC9, old S&W Gen 3 guns, and the Bersa 380's.)    

And, yes, I'm more afraid of me - not the gun. Most new guns are drop safety safe and will not accidentally fire. I've just become afraid of all striker fired guns at this point - because I like to shoot them a little bit too much and find my finger on that active trigger too soon. 

None of these other guns are as nice to hold as the Solo - the P938 actually feels a little bit
strange and unbalanced, and it’s not as accurate for me,  and it’s rougher to shoot.  After 50 rounds its safety wore through the skin on my thumb’s lower joint and the trigger’s serrations are way too rough (though I filed them down).  But still, I'd rather get shot than be too quick on the shoot. But, on the other hand, in a crisis, I'm cool enough that the extra split second to pull the hammer is not something I'm worried about."

U.S.M.C. logo and inscription have been laser engraved in the rear of the stock. Cleaning kit is brand new and never been installed in the gun. The scope mount is a Gen 4 Springfield Aluminum mount that is also brand new never installed. This gun has had the bolt locking lugs professionally lapped to the receiver to ensure full bearing on both lugs. This is a process of lapping the lugs while spring pressure dives the bolt back, and ensuring proper headspace is maintained. I have shot it out as far as 500 yards open sight with precision you would expect from this gun. Also included will be the manuals, the lock, the padded travel case, the military standard marksman sling, 2 original 10 round magazines from Springfield Armory, as well as the scope mount with Leupold rings, and the cleaning kit.

They are probably funded by our demi-god, Bloomberg.  They use a hidden (in black glasses) camera to go in to Arizona gun stores to see if the sales personnel will allow them to make a straw purchase or sell them all the AK47s they have.  The female also chats with the sales people, trying to get comments about why gun shows, where dealers don't get big markups and fees, are bad.   She chats with some goofy (probably horny) males at gun shows and gets them to make reckless statements. One female goes on Armslist, soliciting illegal transactions by phone.  No transactions occur but they leave the impression with viewers that reckless talk is the same as reckless behavior, although we don't know if all those big talkers would have finalized the deal without more questions to the buyer.  They have a dramatized meet in a parking lot with a young idiot and his wife in a cavalier selling ARs accompanied by sinister music.   I almost always get responses to Armslist ads asking me to violate the law.  The Bloombergistas are everywhere so that I cannot list 20 rounds of .32 auto without getting an inquiry asking me to break the law in some manner.  In one transaction with a .50, the guy says 'you have enough ammo to start your own war.'  They get him to repeat it.  Da da ta da!!  Thanks numbnuts.  Bloombergistas are a bunch of uptight women and girly-men who have nothing to do but try to undermine our gun rights all day and all night.   All real men love their guns.  The lesson is, YOUR OFF-HAND REMARKS AND RECKLESS BEHAVIOR MAY BE REPORTED TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GUNS, MAKING THEM BELIEVE THAT GUN LAWS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT CHAOS.  Bloombergistas collect all these remarks and offers to make their anti-gun case.  They discard most of the sensible informed sellers’ refusals.  When you hear gun-grabbing newscasters or politicians say that gun owners agree with them, this is where they get that information.  Know who you are talking to by assessing their gun handling and knowledge.  People who are clumsy with guns are probably reporters.  Know the law.  For the sake of all gun owners, don't let momentary greed or other temptations cause you to engage in illegal behavior or make outrageous remarks that trivialize violence.  If you are conducting an unlicensed (illegal) business through Armslist, know that Bloomberistas are recording your transactions to build a case in the media.  If you are buying and selling, as most of us do, to improve your collection, be careful."

First is a Yugo AK47. This one is brand new except that I refinished the rough stocks these usually come with by sanding it smooth and re-applying some stain to it. It comes with a couple of surplus mags loaded and ready to go. These sell locally for $699 + tax. You can buy this one for $650. Second is a Kimber Eclipse Ultra II. This gun is lightly used and shows some signs of holster wear on the top of the slide but runs like you would expect from a Kimber. Comes with 2 holsters, 1 leather in the pants made by Don Hume and 1 Kydex made by Garret USA. Also comes with 1 box of Hornady Zombie 185gr. The MSRP on these guns is right about $1250 with no holsters or ammo. Also comes with the Kimber hard case. I am asking $950 for it with all the extras. Last, I have an RWS Model 52 in 22 caliber. This gun is the pinnacle of adult air rifles. They are insanely accurate and hit very hard in 22 cal. It has the RWS scope mount already and a Brand New in the Box Leapers 4-16x40 Scope that I just purchased for $150. This combo together should be deadly accurate on varmints at ranges out to about 60 yards. Very good from an airgun. I am selling the entire combo together for $400. This an absolute steal for this gun. Not really looking for any trades at this time unless it is heavily in my favor. Thank you and have a great day."

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

ArmaLite is proud to announce its AR-10 Law Enforcement Carbine. ArmaLite has long been known for its LE carbines chambered in .223/5.56X45mm NATO. Now comes an LE firearm with the added stopping power of the .308 cartridge. ArmaLite already manufactures well-known, dependable AR-10A2 carbines. They are based on the traditional A2 front sight, A2 upper receiver and permanent carry handle. The AR-10 LE Carbine combines an innovative A2 style front sight with the A4 flat-top upper receiver so popular for its ability to accommodate sights, scopes, lights and other LE accessories. The new A2 style front sight was designed by ArmaLite’s engineers and is manufactured from forgings here in our factory. The front sight is taller than traditional A2 front sights to account for differences in AR-15 and AR-10 receiver heights. This eliminates any issues of being able to zero your sights when a carry handle or flip up rear sight is used in combination with an A2 style front sight, on your .308 platform. Included with Rifle: One 20 Round Magazine, Sling, Black Case, Owner's Manual, Limited Lifetime Warranty. Contact me for shipping and payment details."
