You asked and we listened. The Daniel Defense M4 URG, v4 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs.

 The Daniel Defense M4 URG, v4 comes in two different configurations: no sights, fixed front/rear sights.

Daniel Defense was always apprehensive about releasing a factory made firearm with a set or clap style gas block. Therefore the Daniel Defense M4 URG, v4 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

This rifle has never been fired and includes factory box. 

This is the very desirable, nearly impossible to find new, very limited edition Remington Model 700 200 year anniversary of Eliphalet Remington in 30-06 with a 22"" barrel made in 1993 and carefully vault stored ever since. To celebrate the 200th Anniversary, Remington pulled out all the stops and fitted a collectors grade stock on this rifle in truly spectacular, ultra highly figured fiddleback maple finished in unstained natural maple high gloss finish with a Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, generous skip line cut checkering both on the pistol grip and for end, black caps on the for end, pistol grip and on the butt stock which wears the Remington logo. 

The pictures simply can't show the true beauty of the wood. The stock has a 3D, holographic effect to the exquisite fiddleback grain as you look at it from different angles. The rifle includes a Leupold Vari X II 3-9x40 scope. Being a Model 700 BDL it has the factory Remington open sights installed with the front having a removable hood and the rear being adjustable for windage and elevation. The magazine has a hinged floor plate that has a gold filled etching paying homage the 200th anniversary of the company's founder and the metal work has a rich, deep blue gloss finish which looks superb with the gorgeous maple stock. Also, note that this rifle does NOT have the silly locking bolt shroud as some later 700's do. As you would expect on a NIB rifle there is no wear on the bolt face."

While significantly more powerful than the .25-20 Winchester, the .25-35 WCF can be used to hunt small deer at 200 yards and medium sized deer at 100 yards, though some consider it better suited to small predators such as coyotes instead. It was a popular round used in the Winchester Model 1885 High Wall single shot rifle. No production rifles had been made in .25-35 WCF since the 1940s until 2005 when Winchester resumed chambering their Model 94 rifles in this cartridge. Winchester ammunition has kept the cartridge in production in the U.S.A.

.35 Rem. 14 rd., no box
Over the years, the .35 Remington has been chambered in a variety of rifles by most firearms manufacturers, and continues in popularity today in the Marlin Model 336 lever-action. It is also a popular cartridge for single-shot hunting pistols like the TC Contender and the XP-100. For hunters looking for a good woods gun, (i.e., a medium power rifle with moderate recoil, for short to medium ranges) the .35 Remington is popular, taking second place to the .30-30 Winchester. It has a small but loyal following in the northeast and areas of the southern United States.

.351 Win. self-loading  31 rd., box in poor condition
The .351 Winchester Self-Loading (also called .351SL or .351WSL) is an American rifle cartridge. Winchester introduced the .351SL in the Winchester Model 1907 self-loading rifle as a replacement for the Winchester Model 1905 and the .35SL. The .351SL proved popular with police and security forces as the only chambering available in the model 1907, and was used by France in both World Wars.  An experimental Thompson submachine gun was also made to fire .351SL in 1919, but was never produced commercially. The .351SL is considered inadequate by modern firearm experts as a deer round, but is generally suitable for mountain lion, coyote, or similar medium-sized game, while being over-powerful and insufficiently accurate for varmints. It has had some popularity in the jungle, where its lack of long-range power or accuracy are less important. When first introduced however, many found the .351SL to be a good deer cartridge at ranges under 200 yards, at least in comparison to the many low-pressure cartridges of the black powder era.

.35 Win. SLR 102 rd., two boxes in poor condition
The .35 Winchester Self-Loading (also called .35SL, .35SLR, or .35WSL) is an American rifle cartridge. Winchester introduced the .32SL and .35SL in the Winchester '05 self-loading rifle as a center-fire cartridge version of the Winchester '03. The .35SL proved popular at first with the general public as a short-range deer and black bear hunting cartridge, but was soon superseded by the introduction of the more powerful .351SL in the Winchester '07.
Many now consider the .35SL inadequate as a deer round, but it may still be suitable for coyote or similar medium-sized game at close ranges. When first introduced however, the notable firearm expert Townsend Whelen noted the .35SL cartridge as displaying similar ballistics as the .38-40 black powder, low-pressure cartridge.

.30 Rem. Gamble's 170 gr. 20 rd., box in fair condition
The .30 Remington cartridge was created in 1906 by Remington Arms. It was Remington's rimless answer to the popular .30-30 Winchester cartridge. Factory ammunition was produced up until the late 1980s, but now it is a prospect for handloaders. Load data for the .30-30 Winchester can be used safely for the .30 Remington.
Although the cartridge has dwindled into obscurity to hunters, it lives on by being the parent case of the 10mm Auto and the 6.8 mm Remington SPC cartridge. Unlike the .30-30, the .30 Remington can utilize standard pointed bullets rather than round nosed ones when used in rifles with box magazines (Remington Model 8) and ones with special tubular magazines (Remington Model 14). This gives it a possible advantage over the .30-30 cartridge which is most often chambered in lever-action rifles with standard tubular magazines (in which using a conventional pointed bullet could lead to cartridges being ignited by in the magazine tube by recoil into a primer).
While the .30 Remington is ballistically equivalent to the .30-30 Winchester cartridge, the cartridges are dimensionally different and are not interchangeable.

The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry
firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless
appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. PPK/S is the 1968
""Sport"" version, with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931 design. The
top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

The No. 2 Mk 1 was born when British authorities began searching for a double-action revolver with less weight and recoil than the Webley they'd been using, that could be quickly mastered by a minimally-trained soldier and gave him a good probability of hitting an enemy with the first shot at extremely close ranges. The .38-200 round was created by combining a .38 S&W catridge with a 200 grain bullet. By using such a long, heavy, round-nosed lead bullet in a .38 caliber cartridge, it was found that the bullet, being minimally stabilized for its weight and caliber, tended to tumble longitudinally when striking an object, theoretically increasing wounding and stopping ability of human targets at short ranges. This double-action-only revolver features a fixed blade front sight with a rear groove, and a saddle ring. Its metal is in fair condition and its bore is in good condition.

Includes: 2 boxes of 38S&W (50 each) and a very nice basket weave leather holster.
Asking $325 Similar pistols have been listed for sale on GM & Cabela's for $500-$600 (have copies of ads) for just the pistol.

If you ever watched Lawrence of Arabia, he carried a gun similar to this.  He was a British Officer.  No collection is complete without an Enfield.  Or shoot for fun.

I've had it for a couple of years, but it is just a safe queen and might have as few as 200 rounds through it I'd guess.  Very nice gun.  This is the SA/DA variant. 

I bought an extra mag at some point, so it has a total of 3.  Comes with what's seen in the first picture (manual, spent case, back straps, HK lock).  

One of the buckles on the case doesn't lock well anymore, but that's the only thing wrong with the entire package.  

Would prefer to meet in South Denver area at FFL to do transfer.  I know a great guy down here if you don't have one yourself.  He'll do it for $20 I believe.  

Looking for 699 obo.  Will also trade for Glock 19 gen 4 or Walther PPQ in 9mm, but needs to be about equal value to what these go for (so maybe a little extra cash or night sights or extra mags, pay my transfer fee... something like that is what I'm thinking)  Please don't contact me with an offer that we can't transfer through a FFL, read mags greater than 15 rounds. (M&P, XDm, etc.) I'd love to, but rules are rules I guess.  

Again, this is in pristine condition.  I'm not sure why I'm really selling it, but mostly just want to try something new and have kind of been preferring striker platforms lately.

Asking $275 (MSRP is $344, lowest price at the Gun show is $315, trust me I have looked) with all that is pictured.  Get before Christmas and I will throw in a 525 round box of remington ammo.  Trade is a possibility - may consider some of the following (trade plus cash if not valued at $275):"

Only one box of ammo through this 'as new' pistol. No scratches, marks, nicks, etc. This was to be my wife's CCW . . .  she has now decided to carry a Ruger LCR revolver . . .  so this is up for grabs! 

This has a MUCH smoother, far superior trigger compared to my S&W BodyGuard 380 sold here recently! Check out the reviews on this pistol, they are great!

Comes with everything included when I bought this for my wife at Gander Mtn a few weeks ago:

2 Taurus OEM factory mags (6-rnd & 8-rnd with extension)
PDA style case for concealed carry
2 keys (for internal frame lock)
manuals for pistol and laser
laser adjustment tools
laser cleaning tools

Comes with certificate for lifetime free batteries from Crimson Trace!

We paid $406 (after tax) for this at Gander Mtn a couple of weeks ago. So this is a $60 savings (or a little more maybe?) for the right buyer. I'm not hurting to sell this, asking a FAIR price for someone interested in this item. 

Great gun, 'as new' condition, fair price! 

Don't bother wasting your time or mine with crazy low ball offers . . .  I won't even bother to respond!

Buyer MUST present NC permit or CCW, ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. All laws will be followed, No Exceptions ! Cary NC sales only, thanks!"

This is a neat pistol because it is compact enough for concealed carry but still offers the benefits of a high capacity pistol.  The second magazine was extremely difficult to come across because they are only made by Bersa and it's a fairly popular gun.  I have never experienced any sort of issues with this gun.  It is a very accurate and reliable gun due to the fixed barrel blowback design of the gun (similar to the ppk and makarov pistol).  Overall this is a very dependable firearm that is very fun to shoot and a good carry gun.  I really would prefer cash but I will consider trade offers as well.  Buyers must show a valid NH drivers license or a NH pistol permit.

First things first, Happy New Year to you and yours.

For sale or trade I present to you my Smith & Wesson 3913.  There are different versions out there and personally this is the one I prefer.  Classic good looks with hard hitting performance.  Sellers easily move these (when they can even be found) anywhere from $475 to the mid $500's.  At those rates usually only two magazines are offered and in some cases only one magazine.  I know I own a sought after quality piece but I'm also willing to be a bit fairer than some.  This lady comes with 4 factory magazines and two of those are brand spankin' new (and I have the receipt to prove it).

This piece is great for carry due to the sleek build.  Both men and women love to shoot with it but I have found the ladies are particularly fond of how it feels in their hands.

The weapon and 4 factory magazines are a firm $550.

Must have FL Drivers License and Bill Of Sale required.  CWP preferred but not mandatory (I'm an American so I know our 2nd Amendment IS our carry permit).

Be safe out there ladies and gentlemen.  That means be armed."

It's been having FTF's that I believe can be fixed by a simple feed ramp polishing. Or it might simply be an issue of choosing the right ammo. Worst case scenario, you can send it to Kel-Tec and have it serviced for $40. You are welcome to meet and diagnose it before you purchase anything. 

Mechanically, the SU-22 is in excellent shape inside and out, minus the aforementioned exception. Comes with the factory 25-round magazine and a Black Dog Machine 15-round magazine that can fit inside the stock for convenience. The factory-threaded barrel, picatinny rails, 4 lbs. weight, and ability to fold in half give this weapon the advantage over the Ruger 10/22. SU-22's are impossible to find in-stores and are equally rare online, so don't pass on this deal.
