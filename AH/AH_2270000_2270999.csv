On and on...... Also awesone tactical case. Over 100 bucks new for this alone. It does have a blemish on the back due to my idiotic father misfiring his revolver putting a small hole thro it.... But it's sto damn near brand new andbit still is fully functional and the blemish is on the back side and doesn't interfere in the case at all. !!!! This is just a deal not to pass up. I added everything up what was laid for the merchandise and allof it comes to the 700 price range........ I would like offers ... But I will say I'm letting it go down right cheap! We are talking less then swap meet style...,!!! Lol We are talking 700 value... So a guy can save hundred of dollars on ammo and gun stuff... Sounds good to me....Cssh or trade. let me know. Also not pictured in the photos is a Laser/tac light combo which sells online for between 225 and 250 .... I found it as high as 265 but with some searching 225 was the lowest I found. That's in the deal too! I mean half off or something for that... It is brand new almost! So check the pics out and see what there is. Even if you don't need some of the stuff the deal is so good that yoh can get it anyway and then sell the stuff you don't want..... It's just one of those deals you don't see come up often. Why would you do you sell the stuff so low and lose money you may ask....??? Well I know I'm going to take a big hit on it but I just want to get rid of it out of my room and collect.some cash. I'm pricing the items to sell ffast! That is why it's a package deal. I could piece it out and make way moresselling each item individually but that takes too long I would rather make a 150 less and give it all away in one shot. So please go ahead an fire me your offers ..... Trade welcomesas well. Trade plus cash.... Lets make a deal ..... ! I will piece stuff out but would really prefere one nice chunk of change. Thanks a lot guys.

It comes with the original hard case and paperwork.When things go bump in the night nothing settles your nerves more than having a shotgun nearby that you know tips the odds in your favor. Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers. More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, you will need this."

 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT
 Manufacturer: Kel-Tec
 Model #: P-3AT
 Finish: Matte Black
 Sights: Fiber Optics, Dovetailed Aluminum Front Sight
 Barrel Length: 2.76""
 Overall Length: 5.2""
 Overall Height: 3.5""

 Action: Double Action Only
 Stock: Black Polymer Checkered Grip Area

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

435,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2270435,For Trade:  Heavy Duty 7x16 tandem axle trailer,"Narrows, VA, Roanoke, Virginia",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, October 28, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a trailer that I have been building for quite some time and have decided to part ways. The main frame was salvaged from a old mobile home and then braced with 6 very heavy walled square crossbeams. The deck is made of true 2"" thick rough sawed pine and treated with many coats of Thompsons to ward off rot. Overall deck length is 16 foot, with 12 foot being full width, and the overall width is 7 foot, with 6 1/2 foot between the inside rail lips. This trailer has dual 6600 lb axles, front axle has 12"" electric brakes, all new brake parts, new 2800 lb rated 6 lug hubs and brake drums (cost me over $400 about two months ago), good 2800 lb rated 225/75-15 trailer tires (not car tires) and each of the 4 springs are rated at 3000 pounds. I have personally been witness to this trailer hauling 10,000 pounds from Christiansburg to Elliston VA, we had 100 100lbs bales of hay loaded. This trailer has also been used to haul numerous vehicles ranging from compact cars to full size pickups, trucks are a tight fit but most will barely go. Also included is one pair of heavy duty homemade ramps that hook to the rear lip on the deck, ramps are made from the same mobile home steel with deck boards carriage bolted to them. The trailer comes with a 2 5/16"" coupler and a pair of magnetic towing lights that require a 4 wire flat plug. The hitch height sits at 22-24"" for a level deck when unloaded, so your tow ball should be around that same height. In July I towed this trailer 100 miles from Rocky Mount to Narrows without a trouble in the world, though I had to use a 6"" riser hitch to get my tow ball up to where it needed to be.

This trailer is not just some slap together hack job. I actually took the time to make sure the frame was completely square, the center point of the axles is exactly where it should be and perfectly matched from side to side. The hitch is perfectly centered and level with the frame. When on level ground the trailer will sit level without the jack, that way when properly loaded your tongue weight is acceptable and your vehicle just has to pull the trailer and leave all the hauling to the trailer's suspension.

What the trailer needs:
Permanent lighting
Lights and brakes wired
Fenders if you desire them (standard 66"" long tandem fenders will do it)
Titled (I have always used it with a ""FARM USE"" tag)

Titling a homemade trailer is very easy in the State of VA. You go to the DMV, fill out a form and pay them $5. DMV gives you the form back with a Vin tag and instructions on where to mount it. You go home, mount the Vin tag and call the State Police. The Police come out to only verify the Vin tag location and sign off on your form, no type of safety inspection is done by the Police and the whole deal can be done in a matter of minutes. Take the form back to DMV, pay them another $10 and you walk out with your title in hand. After that it is just like owning a car. If desired you can register, tag and have it inspected at a local garage. Any garage that inspects cars can inspect a trailer."

The Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.

If you don't know how a LaserMax works, this is how.. the field strip lever pushes INTO the frame, from either side, to turn it on. You DO NOT have to hold it in. Push it in, it's on- Push it from the opposite side, it turns off. NO pressure switches, grip switches or any other crap to get in the way- NO Wires at all. Laser and On switch are in the guide rod. It's all internal and is an amazing system. Gun Looks completely stock on the outside. You don't have to change holsters or any of your other gear... if it holds a stock Glock- it will hold a LaserMax'd Glock.

It pulses ""on"" red- not static on.  Your eye finds a pulsing light faster than a static light.

I was consistantly hitting the target at 100 yards with my Eotech and a box of rifled slugs! 
There's alot more to this shoutgun than meets the eye...This Saiga Legion 12 is a model IZ-433 and is a 030-type semi-automatic shotgun professionally converted by experts. It features US made parts and is 922 compliant, such as SAW pistol grip, Kick-lite 5 position stock (this feels like a 410 when shooting it), Tapco advanced trigger group, upgraded gas piston puck (Self Regulating), Picatinny rails up front for lasers or lights, muzzle flash hider and cap, Magwell...No more rock and lock, JTE performance guide rod assembly and an automatic last round bolt hold open to help facilitate easy reloads and insertion of the magazine. It also has a self regulating gas system, which is unique from all other Saiga-12 shotguns. The top cover features a Picatinny rail mounted on top and is also hinged to the rear sight block in order to provide the top-mounted Picatinny rail with the ability to hold zero. 
I have well over $1,800 in this shotgun and I am including (4) 10 round SMG Mags (3 of which are still in the plastic)  and a 5 round mag as well as the original stock and Promag verticle grip and a sightmark 4 reticle red dot to go with it (not pictured). 
Just a note... You can remove the mag well and use the drum mags... I just find them to be a little cumbersome and mainly in the way all of the time. 
Do not try to low ball me as I know what this shotgun is worth and I am selling this at a steal as it is, but it's time to move on to the next project."

The gun is full of extras. It is chambered in 5.45x39 and not in .223/556. The round has the same ballistics and is a fraction of the cost. The only reason I am selling is because I have two of the exact same gun and don't shoot enough to keep both of them. 

The upper is a piston system. The piston system and barrel have been treated with salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The bolt and bolt carrier have also been protected by using an ion bond finish. All this done from the Adams Arms factory. The way this upper is made allows for very little recoil when shooting. Makes for a very accurate shot. This has the magpul heat shields and magpul foregrip in FDE.

The Lower is a Rguns lower with a upgraded LPK for a real crisp pull. Butt stock is a magpul adjustable in FDE color. Also has FDE magpul hand grip, magpul b.a.d. lever, and fab defense mag well grip installed. 

The gun will come with a carrying case, 1 magazine, and roughly 500 rounds of ammo. I have shot this gun maybe a total of 100 rounds and shoots flawlessly. These uppers are very hard to come by and offer a great way to shoot a cheaper round since they will fit on any mil-spec AR lower. Asking $1700 obo. Email me for more info or pics"

The slide is factory engraved and blued with a Black Hard Anodized frame. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

FMJ-FN (1350FPS / M.E.931 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Monday, October 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=230

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels. This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six. The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber. It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too."

I took it off of my brand new Acog and replaced it with a dual illuminated RMR.  It is brand new and will come with all the trijicon goodies warranty card, pelican box, stickers and what not.  You will be able to register it with trijicon for warranty with the card included.   As I said it is Brand new.  There will not be a sticker for this optic on the pelican box like other trijicon because the sticker belonging to the dual illuminated RMR was removed.  This came with an ACOG and as such was to be included in the warranty card on the ACOG.  I didn't put this optic on there, I put the dual illuminated serial number on there to register it with Trijicon.  This one hasn't been registered with Trijicon yet.   

Now Trijicon's blah blah blah on it. 
Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM01 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. The new Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

This is a 750.00 set up. I'm just trying to get back what I have in the dual illuminated RMR.  BTW I bought the dual illuminated RMR with a mount on it not thinking it had a mount which is where the -33 mount came from.  515 obo.

Do not under estimate the effectiveness of OC Pepper.  As a police officer (now retired) and a chemical munitions instructor, I have had the pleasure to take the hit twice; not the way you want to spent your day.

Much better than the old tear gas and Mace which had to chemically burn the eye surface and airways, OC Pepper is a natural irritant that inflames the membranes with no permanent damage.  First is involuntary eye closure, extreme burnings of the eyes and airways, and about a gallon of snot running freely.  Usually, in about 45 minutes the bad guy is recovered.  Also this OC spray has invisible UV dye in it, so the bad guy can be identified even days later.

Police OC-17 Magnum unit, about 3/4 "" in diameter, 3"" in length & a 1"" key ring attached to the base.  The sprayer has a positive locking safety on top and a clearly visible expiration date on the cap.  Watch for the expiration dates on OC units, it will not work effectively when expired.  Never buy any OC unit that does not bear a legible expiration date.

Utilizing the key ring and the locking safety, the spray can easily be carried in your weak hand and rapidly deployed, with practice.

Pistol caliber carbines are just plain fun to shoot and 9mm ammo is still reasonably cheap & available.  This gun is very accurate -- 2"" groups at 100yds using iron sights.  

Hi Points are known for being virtually indestructible and I can say with around 500 rounds through this I've never had a FTF or FTE using all kinds of ammo.  It's also +P and +P+ rated, although I've never personally shot +P.  I'm anal about my weapon's maintenance & this gun is squeaky clean (& I always use Frog Lube).

I'm firm on price (and it's a fair price to start with) as I'm torn on selling it and really don't have to -- I purchased a left handed 9mm carbine & I shoot that mostly now so this gun rarely gets used.

 I say finish instead of paint because properly applied Cerakote does not look like a painted surface like a lot of these other gun paints. It It also goes on so thin it wilk not interfere with fit or tolerences. 

We can do just about any color or combination of colors. Whether is a restoration or a brand new gun that you want to stand out in the crowd. A good Cerakote finish may be just what your looking for. 

Dont try it yourself without proper equipment. I couldn't tell you how many items I have redone after an attempted DIY try. Then you are talking more money because once applied Cerakote is tough to remove. 

Email and Texts are the best way to reach me followed by my phone as a last resort. Feel free to contact 24/7 for a price quote. Our work is guaranteed to satisfy.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

IMO just about the ultimate do-it-all deer rifle, that can also still knock an elk down when need be. The semi-auto gas operation takes a lot of the bite out of the recoil, feels about like a .308. It’s in great shape, a few very minor wear marks on bluing, but overall it’s excellent. Bore is very good. Very accurate as well. With high quality ammo this is can be a 1 MOA semi-auto rifle. Smooth operating rifle, in fact I don’t think it’s ever jammed on me.

It’s scoped with a made in the USA Redfield Wideview Lo-Pro 3-9 power scope. Excellent high quality scope, very clear. The wideview provides a great view and also help keep the scope low. This rifle and scope combo is a deer slayer.  Comes with 10 rounds of Federal Ammunition Deer Thug 160gr
