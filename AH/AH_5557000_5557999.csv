With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability. The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.

My loss is your gain. $600 firm. That's a steal. I can text pictures. REDACTEDThe Trijicon SRS (Sealed Reflex Sight) represents the highest level of performance from a sealed reflex-style sight. Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed.

This is a handsome rifle that has retained 80-85% of the original blue finish that has become streaked with plum-brown freckling along the barrel and developed some pale, mottled gray along the underside of the receiver. The frame itself is engraved with a delicate, floral vine pattern along the side walls, as well as an oval panel on the left side with the owner's name engraved in flowing script: “C.B. Ives/Bristol/Conn.” Bright original color case-hardening is still present on the lever which blends into a freckled gray patina along the edges of the lever loop, and the original front sight blade and semi-buckhorn rear sight are still in place. The walnut forend and straight-wrist stock have scattered light handling marks and minor blemishes throughout with no cracks and some spots of dark pinprick pitting on the crescent-shaped buttplate. C.B. Ives was the owner of C.B. Ives & Co., a meat and vegetable company which is illustrated in the Norris map of Bristol from 1889 (the business is No. 43 in the key list). This is a really nice example of an early Savage 1899, engraved with the name of a prominent Connecticut businessman, and would make a terrific addition to any collection.

Original box with papers/lock is included.This is a beautiful rifle, from the mirror polished brass receiver and butt plate to the rich wood grained stock, to the deep blue barrel.

It's hard to find a lever gun of this quality under $1,000 - and only Henry does it. Note: in the photos, you might notice the receiver looks to be textured, it's not - it's highly polished and you're seeing the reflection of the texture in the ceiling above.Price is $675 cash only, no trades.

For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight. Switching between the brake and the weight will not change the bullet's point of impact for a particular load. The included thread protector may be used if neither the brake nor the weight is desired."

This rifle was taken from it's factory box and placed in my safe. It has never had a scope mounted on it. The condition of this rifle is 100% mint, brand new. These rifles typically sell for $2,000, but I'm starting this one WELL below the going price and what I paid for it. If you are in the market for a finely built hunting rifle, this one would be a great addition! And .375H&H is a great dangerous caliber, too. Thanks for looking!"
