Springfield Armory XDS93345B XDS Slim 45 ACP 3.3"" 5+1 Poly Grip Black

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

I'm asking $30 each (firm), and I'm willing to ship for a little extra. You must meet me in Brookfield or have these mailed - I won't travel."

35% Shorter Stroke Trigger Bar for Ruger LC9
SN 320-321 Trigger Bar and required Reduced Power Firing Pin Return Spring

The much awaited LC9 and LC380, NOT LCP, trigger bar is here, no more machining your hammer and bar we do it all now with our custom trigger bar. This new drop in bar is the design the gun magazines, CCW school instructors and customers have asked for in addition to our wildly popular 50% short stroke trigger system upgrade to CUSTOMER SUPPLIED STOCK PARTS. This bar is ready to drop in no fitting required, we have eliminated the possibility of reset or disconnect issues that sometimes came with the old conversion when factory component tolerances stacked up on the high side. 
-This bar WILL WORK WITH THE SHORT STROKE II trigger from RTK making for the most impressive setup out there.
-This bar is not compatible with the RTK Slim trigger. 
-The 35% bar allows the use of a reduced power hammer spring, add it to your trigger bar order below, includes the lighter firing pin return spring.
-Drop in design, made of high alloy tool steel and heat treated for long life and rigid quality control from step one on.
-Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%, add a Short Stroke II for even more reduction.
-It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected.
-After the early break it will stop about 10mm from the back and break about 14mm from the back, it will still reset only at the front like normal though. 

Reduced Power Spring Kit for Ruger LC9
These are the reduced power springs that have been asked for to help eliminate the stacking at the end of your LC9  trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring.

Reduced Power Hammer Spring for Ruger LC9
This spring will pull about 1.5 pounds out of your trigger pull weight and provide full ignition on standard primers."

This package cost about $900 plus taxes, fees, background check, etc.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes

I have these 6 boxes for sale at $45/each. That's under $1/round and there is nowhere to buy it for less. For someone who wants all 6 boxes, I'll sell them at a total of $260. Please....no requests to buy at a lower price. I'm foolish to sell these at this price but I no longer have a 9mm and these boxes are space in the safe that could be used for something else. No trades. Cash only. I can meet you anywhere inside I-465 or within 5 miles outside of it. First come, first served."

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

Several year old used glocks for 500+? People can get guns like these cheaper NEW than what you're asking. And then when we try to work with you on price, you're unmovable?

NOW, the disclaimer. 
This is a project gun. It needs a bit of work suck as refinishing and gas port re jetting. Also, in order to fit the Troup Systems hand guard, the retainer ring on the gas tube needs to be removed. 

Other than all that, it functions just fine with brass cased light ball. Has not fired corrosive ammo and the bore is very bright and shiny. No rust what so ever inside the receiver or on the bore. 

Not interested in parting out the kit. Unless the right offer is made.

Great home defense shotgun. It's got an 18"" barrel, which is the shortest barrel you can have on it legally unless you have a FFL. It makes for a more mobile shotgun, so its easier to move around with (especially thru doorways) in your home. As far as shotguns go, this is a very inexpensive shotgun & great for keeping in the closet / under the bed just in case there comes a time when you need to protect your family &/or property. Or, at the very least, get it just so you aren't THAT person out there without a means to protect themselves or their own when the s**t hits the fan! You never know dude...

Comes with:
- the original box, plastic VCI bag, & manual that came with it (sorry, paperwork is being kept for my proof of sale records) 
- an assortment of 10 shotgun shells for home defense (00 Buckshot- law enforcement favorite AND my favorite, an Italian specialty called the Centurion - consist of (1) .65"" round ball followed by (5) .38"" round balls"

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.” 

Gas Operation System with Exhaust Valve. The unique gas operation system, patented by Beretta, with self-cleaning gas cylinder and piston, is provided with a self cleaning exhaust valve that automatically vents the excess gases of the most powerful cartridges.The result is that the shotgun, without any adjustment, fires everything from the weakest 28g (1 ounce, 3 ¾ dram equivalent) game load to the heaviest 64g (2 ¼ ounce) Super Magnum cartridge. The exhaust valve remains attached to the barrel, ensuring easy and quick assembly and disassembly of the shotgun. Using accelerated salt-spray testing, the unprotected steel barrel section (top) shows corrosive effects, whereas the Aqua Technology–protected barrel (bottom) looks brand new. In fact, the Xtrema2 is the only gun to have passed a 150-hour salt-spray test with no signs of corrosion. Also, all steel par ts are now manufactured from stainless steel or are plated with either: nickel, Bruniton, PVD, Aqua Film (receiver & barrel) or chrome (barrel, bore and bolt), making the Xtrema2 a match for even the most extreme environments"

The SW9VE is a 9mm semi-automatic pistol with a black polymer frame and stainless steel barrel and slide. 
First of all, the SW9VE pistol is very simple. It has only three external controls. One button drops the clip from the pistols grip. Once you've loaded the clip, depressing a lever along the slide, closes the pistol's breech and loads a round into the firing chamber. At this point, the pistol is ready to fire. There is no manual safety. A safety built into the trigger ensures that the pistol fires only when the trigger is pulled. In addition, the trigger has a long and fairly heavy pull to ensure that a round is fired only intentionally. Bullets are fired when an internal striker hits the round. There is no hammer to cock or to inadvertently snag on clothing. 
Also, the pistol is reliable, accurate & easy to handle."

If you have an AR15 pistol, or have wanted to build a short barreled AR but were discouraged by the hassle and expense of going the SBR route, this is the solution right here - and it is 100% BATF approved. These are somewhat hard to come by right now as most every place is sold out due to overwhelming popularity. This brace is completely legal to add to any pistol length AR15, and it DOES NOT change the classification of the firearm, no matter how you choose to use it. No tax stamp is required for a firearm utilizing this brace and here is the best part - you are still free hold and support your gun in any manner in which you prefer. The BATF has ruled that this is not a stock, PERIOD. In other words, if you install this onto your pistol barreled AR15, it is still just that - a pistol, and is not subject to any NFA registration or tax stamp (as a Short Barreled Rifle would be), regardless of whether you strap it to your forearm or not. If you are not familiar with this amazing device and its benefits, take a look at the videos of it in action at the links provided below to see how well they work (in various methods of use).  Comes new in box, with a BATF letter of approval. Get one of these while you can, as there is no guarantee that the BATF will not decide to change their mind on this type of device and halt the production of them. Price is $200 cash, or possible trade. Shipping is available.
