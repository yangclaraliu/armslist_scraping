Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

The lower receiver states that it shoots 5.56, however I have found no markings on the upper receiver that shows it is a High Standard upper or chambers 5.56, thus standing on the side of caution I've only shot .223 cartridges. I've shot about 250 rounds through this rifle. The rifle is in good condition and has never given me an issue. However, someone recently did his own headspace check on it, and the bolt closed on both the GO and NO GO gauge, but there was no field gauge used. Again, rifle has given me zero flaws.

The forward rail system is a Midwest Industries two piece handguard that I installed after purchase. I also installed a one point sling attachment at the rear base plate. Rifle includes the mil spec rear sight seen in the photos, front handguard grip, and a rail mounted flashlight.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® MR556A1 and FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S as well as AR15 mag wells with tighter tolerances. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit.

These have been in production since about 1999 but it still seems few Glock owners even know about them. 

This model works with Glock models G19, G23, G32, G38 and their variations (Gen1 - 4) and converts any of them into a 9mm carbine.  There are no modifications to your pistol.  Just remove the slide and put the frame onto the conversion.  

These are completely legal and no ""Tax Stamp"" is needed.  BATF considers them an accessory.  Glock magazines interchange between these models and you must use 9mm Glock magazines.

Accessories include: Muzzle Decoration.  The Glock frame is not included however I have a new Glock 19 frame for sale separately for $209.  

This unit has been reconditioned.  It looks and performs like new.  Comes with the Glock feed ramp adapter and original owners manual.

If you live local and want to try it out, we can meet at Shooters of Maumee for a test run.  Be sure to bring your Glock compact frame to use.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

This is a package deal that comes with a lot of stuff. You get 3 thirty round mags, hard case, cleaning rod/brushes, manual, lock, Tapco stock/grip, and original stock and grip. I am getting rid of this at a clearance price because the front sight is slightly tilted to the right when looking down the sights. However, it is an easy fix by buying a scope mount and putting a scope on yourself or a red dot sight. You can also choose to return it to Century Arms if you wish to get a replacement or get it fixed. I don't have the time, nor do I want to bother with it. Just looking to get my money back. This is still an awesome buy! Gun functions great! It's been test fired.

Custom .260 Rem Benchrest Rifle
Built on an FN-made 1935 Peruvian Mauser action that's been rebarreled to 260 Rem (6.5-08). The receiver has been drilled and tapped for glass, and the stock is bedded. It also has an adjustable trigger set to ~2.5 pounds, with zero creep or overtravel. I have a few loaded rounds (~10), the load data (pushes the 140gr bullets north of 3000 fps), and ~140 bullets for reloading (~100 140gr Sierra Match King hollowpoints, and ~40 140gr Centrix soft points). It'll put 5 rounds through a 6.5mm hole at 100 yds.

In MD you cannot purchase this after Oct 1, 2013. You cant even buy one now since Doug Gansler has announced that any purchases not received by Oct 1st will not be permitted and for handguns not received you'll have to have your HQL.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

This Holo-Sight uses state-of-the-art digital electronics design. Equipped with 20 brightness levels to ensure proper brightness control from low light to very bright sunlight. All electronics are fully encapsulated in shock absorbing resin compound.

The holographic patterns have been designed to be instantly visible in any light, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle, and to remain in view while sweeping the engagement zone. Reticles are designed as large, see-through patterns to achieve quick target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim.

A true Heads-Up Display that eliminates blind spots, constricted vision, or the tunnel vision associated with tubed sights. Instant threat identification is achieved by maximizing the operator's peripheral vision and ultimately gaining greater control of the engagement zone.

I have a like new remington 700 sps tactical in 223.

This rifle has a heavy barrel and comes with a mounted vortex viper 6.5-20 as seen here http://swfa.com/Vortex-65-20x44-Viper-30mm-Rifle-Scope-P13285.aspx

The scope is mounted on a one peice peice mount with heavy duty 30 millimeter rings. The scope was mounted and dialed in by a professional gunsmith. I have only fired 3 boxes of ammo through this gun since I bought it last year. This thing is about as ready to go as a rifle can get. Altogether my asking price is almost 300.00 less than my total cost (not including tax) so my loss is a huge gain.

I have the original box for the gun and the scope. price includes the bipod.
