Conceal-ability of a G23, with accuracy of a G22.
This is a very nice glock 22 in 40s&w.

Fiber optics have been installed in the front (green) and rear (orange) sights
The barrel, extractor, slide stop, and rear plate have been Cerakoted in Micro Slick
The frame has been chopped (to receive glock 23 mags) and had a reduction to the grip size for more ergonomic grip and shooting, the trigger guard and beavertail were reduced to allow for higher and more comfortable hand placement allowing for more accurate and ergonomic shooting
Then the frame was Cerakoted in Graphite Black

Includes one factory G23 mag (flush with frame), one factory G22 mag (extend past frame)

Glock tupperware case, cleaning brush

Action appears to have a broken spring in it, some surface rust, and tarnish but nothing drastic. If it is a kit going by what I can find online the rifle as a kit is about $400, looking for $200. 

Also have another muzzle loader, one that I also believe to be a kit, though this one has sem some use judging by the wear, less known about this one, appears to be a smooth bore, action works on it, and other than tarnish and wear in the stock it appears to be functional. Would be $75 got it. 

Will do both for $250.

For those that are not familiar with this weapon it was comprised of all new parts and these came out in 2010 with this type of platform. Imported by M+M Inc. directly from Romania. The M10 AK-type Rifles is entirely manufactured from NEW parts. Not your average AK or SKS that has been in circulation the last 50+ years. Do your research on this weapon you will be amazed. In some eyes this was supposed to become the alternative to the Arsenal and is way better then your Wasr10.

It chambers 3"" shells and anything smaller. It is the accuchoke system which means they are interchangable chokes..you can screw any choke into the end of the barrel that you like. Right now it is dressed with a Modified (do-all) choke. This choke will shoot rifled slugs, accurately, to 120 yards...and will keep a shot pattern tight. The barrel is a smoothbore, clean as new 22"". As with all Mossbergs, you can change the barrel with the turn of a thumbscrew...no tools arequired. It is beautiful. It is a 20 gauge so it doesn't kick as hard as a 12g, but still has the power to put down deer and intruders equally well. I used to carry a 12g, the 20g has become my shotgun of choice. Would likely trade for a Henry Golden Boy/  a nice 30-30 / a Walther P22 / or a quality conceal firearm for my wife (no pinks, she wants a gun that looks like a gun and she shoots as straight as me, sometimes straighter). PRICE IS: $250.00 for the shotgun.  $270.00 for the shotgun and 100 rounds of 20gauge ammo...OR....$340.00 for the shotgun with scope and quality Weaver brand rings and the ammo."

It comes with 4 AI magazines, a Near scope base and NightForce ATACR 5-25x56mm Mil/Mil scope (over 120 MOA adjustment) and NF 34 mm rings. A Harris BRM-S bipod with LaRue mount. It comes with a Pelican 1720 case, almost 15 lbs of H1000 powder, almost 2000 Federal Magnum Match 215 primers. Around 500 projectiles( mostly 220 gr SMK), 100 primed new Federal brass, and 2 boxes of Army Sniper issue Mk248 mod1 ammo. Plus other boxed and loaded ammo. Redding 300WM dies with case trimmer and drill adapter. This rifle has around 80-100 rounds through it. It shoots 1/3 MOA with handload a and still around 1/3 MOA with factory HSM match loads. There was no expense spared on this rifle. I am asking $5500 for the rifle but would trade for an HK 416 14.5"" upper.  Or possible trade for an MR762 and cash or me trade scopes and put a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50. If you are in the area you are more than welcome to shoot it and try it out. It is impressive. I have never shot another 300WM this accurate.  I have way more than that in this as the stock is over $1000 as the complete chassis, plus almost $100 a magazine, the scope is over $2300, the barrel, action, muzzle brake and gunsmithing work is around $2000, plus the scope base(over$200) the scope rings ($196) and the bipod $213.99.  Then you get into the extras like the dies,powder which is around $200 per 8 lbs., primers, a few boxes of  loaded ammo and the extra new primed brass. The Pelican case was just over $220. The Army Sniper ammo is almost un obtainable and sells around a hundred a box. I will even give you the exact clone information for the Mk248 mod1.  The middle photo is a three round group at 300 yards. It measured just under 1"" , which is impressive by any scale.

""Gras""Sword Bayonet

Frequently used for spearing frogs for dinner in the French swamps after long days of retreating from battles. Also, this sword has a long and distinguished French history used to display and wave white surrender flags.

This bayonet was the last of the French ""sword-type"" bayonets. It was manufactured to fit the French Model 1879 ""Gras"" Infantry Rifle, basically a refinement of the Model 1866 Chassepot Infantry Rifle. The ""Gras"" was manufactured from 1874 to about 1885. This bayonet has a solid brass pommel with integral latching mechanism (push-button/spring-steel). Grips are wood. Crossguard is steel, usually ""blued,"" with upper guard being the muzzle-ring, lower guard forming a hooked ""blade-breaker"" quillon.Blades are steel - well made - and triangular (3-edge) in form (very sturdy as a thrusting weapon). The blades are usually marked on the back-edge (opposite the bottom cutting edge) with the arsenal, month, and year of manufacture; this is done in engraved cursive fashion and will appear something like, ""Mre d' Armes de St. Etienne Janvier 1879"" or perhaps ""Mre d' Armes de Chatellerault Juin 1882"". Contrary to novice speculation, this is not the name of a lieutenant or major, nor is it a presentation date; in reality - as previously stated - it is the the exact month, year, and location of manufacture.French arsenal locations I have observed are: Chatellerault, L'Deny Paris, Paris-Oudry, St. Etienne, and Tulle. There is also an arsenal located in Austria and these are marked Steyr.The scabbards are usually blued sheet-rolled steel, semi-oval, tubular, with a ball finial. These bayonets replaced the Model 1866 ""Chassepot"" bayonet (and corresponding infantry rifle), and were replaced by the French Model 1886 Lebel Bayonet (aka ""Rosalie"") (and corresponding infantry rifle). Several other countries used this bayonet, including Greece (these are marked ""Waffenfabrik Steyr"" or ""Usine de Steyr""), Germany (many modified variants), Ireland, and others; Portugal also used a variant for their Portuguese Kropatschek Navy Rifle, but their bayonet has a straight back-edge on the grip (no hump). The French Model 1879 ""Gras"" Bayonet has a colorful history was used by the French Foreign Legion on more than one occasion.

The inscription on the back of this blade, translated to English, reads, ""Manufactured at the Armory at St. Etienne, May 1879""
Scabbard is included."

he R.P.D. was the first machine gun designed to fire the 7.62x39mm cartridge. The R.P.D. platform has been issued by many countries including the Soviet Union, China, Egypt and former Eastern Bloc countries. The R.P.D. was also used by the U.S. SOF in Vietnam. DSA has modernized this battlefield benchmark with features such as a newly designed 7075T6 alloy lower and proprietary rail handguard. With these new features you can outfit your R.P.D.system with any M16 style adjustable stock, giving the end user greater versatility. The rail handguard allows the mounting of a variety of accessories, including optics, lasers, flashlights and foregrips. Compared to the old wooden handguards, a foregrip added to the new DSA rail handguard is extremely helpful in heat dispersion and improving overall effective operation. In addition, the DSA barrel is fluted and shortened. This reduces weight and helps keep the barrel cool. A very effective, proven design flashhider has also been added. These features have reduced the R.P.D. weight by almost 2 pounds.

Spikes Tactical lower receiver that is factory marked as an AR-15 ""Pistol"" with the Spider logo. This lower is serial numbered under 1000 and it has Color-filled (red and white) selector markings on both sides of the lower receiver and has a complete Spikes lower parts kit factory installed. The foam-wrapped pistol buffer tube on this weapon is the same length as a standard AR-15 rifle buffer tube so it takes the same buffer and spring as a standard AR-15 and, of course, this weapon comes with the buffer spring and buffer so it's ready to shoot the moment you pick it up from me. The rear sling adapter plate is an ambi sling plate and it looks and functions great with any type of sling (even the newer Magpul MS3 clips). The Magpul enhanced trigger guard and a MagPul pistol grip have been professionally installed on this weapon also.

The upper receiver is also Spikes and has the Spikes spider logo laser etched on the top of the rail (hidden under the rear sight) and the rail has white t-markings. The barrel is a Spikes marked 10.5"" govt. profile barrel NATO 1/7 twist rate MP marked and chrome-lined barrel with a ""F"" marked front sight / gas block with a the bayonet lug and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. The barrel has seen MAYBE 400 rounds through it and, of course, this weapon comes with the complete BCG and has the upgraded BCM extractor. The rail is a LaRue Tactical 7.0 free float quad rail that is ROCK SOLID, has white T-markings and looks great. The rear sight is an authentic LMT fixed BUIS and the red dot optic is a Vortex SPARC that has a LONG battery life and holds zero like a champ.

This weapon is 100% rock solid and works flawlessly on any ammo I feed it. The trigger is smooth and has a crisp reset. Because this weapon is so short and lightweight it ends up being a PERFECT truck gun (if you don't mind having a high-end truck gun) because you can get it in and out of the vehicle quickly and easily. Also, I store it in a standard tennis racquet case and keep it in the front passenger area and nobody knows that there's a BEAST of a weapon there. This weapon is also small enough to fit in a bugout bag so it is perfect for a SHTF gun too. The fit and finish of this weapon just HAS to be seen. There are a couple FAINT rub marks here or there but over all it's a clean, SOLID running weapon that can have a lot of possibilties. I currently have it set up to be similar to a Navy SEAL MK18 Mod 0 (but with a MUCH better rail system than the Knight's RAS) and this gun can easily and legally be turned into an amazing SBR if you get an NFA tax stamp for it and slap a stock on it. But, use it as a pistol while you wait for the stamp to come back."

Several companies started producing the necessary training rifles for this purpose. Unfortunately most training rifles did not bear markings that identified their origin.
These training rifles had no standard design and were often made from older models of military rifles or parts from these rifles. Therefore you will find many variations of the same model. There are known models that used 1888 Mauser, type 99, type 30, and type 38 rifle parts. These training rifles continued to be produced until the late 1930's. Some of these rifles could not be fired while others would fire wooden bullet blank ammunition. Many of the blank firing rifles were made with smooth bore barrels. Rarely would any of these rifles fire the standard service round. Nearly all of these training rifles could carry bayonets. This rifle only shoots blanks. no import marks"

Gun has had about 700rds put through it and has performed flawlessly. This has been my wife's concealed carry gun that she keeps in a holster in her purse, so it has very little wear (no cosmetic scratches).  The reduced power internal springs took the grittiness out of the trigger pull and the 20 lb recoil springs lessen the recoil substantially.  She would like to get the new XDS-9mm in place of this Ruger, so I would be open to trade offers of the XDS-9mm.

Bike has 5,9xx miles on it (maybe a little more as I ride it) and is clean, never dropped except for a bubble in the paint on gas tank that needs to be re done (really not noticeable unless you know it is there) I am in no hurry to sale as I don't need the money I am just looking for my next venture so don't try and low ball and beat me up over the price, this thing is ready to go has thousands in custom work has zero issues, clean title and you can ride it home today. The only things I could say I would be interested in trading for is another v-twin bike (no rockets!!) that runs, is reliable, has the title included, and has more then 1000cc and yes I would be interested in any Harley sportsters or other Harleys for a new build. I am also a gun enthusiast but don't need any junk or run of the mill guns, I like lever actions, nice handguns, revolvers, winchester model 70's, Springfield M1A's, but might be interested in a nice saiga 12 or AR.

Product Details:
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Simple as that - the unequaled accuracy and dependability of a Kimber plus more rounds in the magazine and as few design changes as possible. All the Ten pistols have the custom features expected from Kimber, and the  polymer frame is almost identical in dimensions to a standard single stack. Kimber frame inserts are machined from the finest aluminum and steel, then molded into a polymer body. This is more expensive than machining an investment casting like other brands but the Kimber insert is more precise and lasts a lifetime. This year, the Kimber Tactical Extractor is standard on every ten pistol. Other features include stainless steel slide, polymer beavertail grip safety and mainspring housing. 
This Kimber is lightly used with no marks or scratches, night sights and shoots like a dream.  I am asking $800.00. 
I also have a MechTech carbine upper that the Kimber can be installed to, just remove the slide and barrel and attach the 1911 frame to the upper. You can drive nails with this set up! I am asking $400.00 for the upper.

An update:  Had failure to feed/jamming problems.  Took it to 'smiths.  Polished feed ramp.  Good to go.  Loads and ejects fine.  Then failure to fire issues.  Firing pin travel issue.  Took to 'smiths.  Burrs filed off.  Still failure to fire.  2 out of 9 fired.  Pin has plenty of travel.  It's probably the hammer or spring.  Just spent 100.00 at the 'smiths.  Aint spending any more.

Hammers are @ Numrich for 24.50.  Spring is 8.25.  Strut is fine as is the strut pin.  Only firing pin, extractor pin and spring, magazine, recoil buffer and trigger spring are sold out.  CZ45 parts are interchangeable.  They're available @ several websites.  It's really a good shooter when right.  Have over 250.00 invested.  Rounds unfired have 'pin punch' marks on the primers suggesting the hammer spring is fatigued.

Contacted a local 'smith who's got an ad in the Nashville 'shotgun' section and he suggested the hammer spring being weak may be the culprit."

Description from LWRC:
The LWRCI™ M6A3™ features a midlength short-stroke gas piston system that is the perfect blend of tactical carbine and sniper-capable rifle. The midlength operating system’s softer recoil allows for faster return-to-target and follow-up shots.

The M6A3™ rifle features an adjustable gas system. Four positions - (O- Off, S-Suppressed, N-Normal, A-Adverse), which allow for optimum performance in any situation.

Designed with optics in mind, the M6A3™ rifle is perfectly suited to accept a red dot sight or a high-powered scope. It features an integrated flip-down front sight and patented ARM-R free-float rail system. The easily removable top platform gives quick access to the barrel and piston system and reinstalls in seconds with no tools required.

The M6A3™ rifle is the perfect all-purpose weapon for the modern warfighter or law enforcement professional.
