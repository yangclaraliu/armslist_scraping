NOTE 4/17/2013: I just received an email from a gentleman accusing me of running a scam because I increased the price of my listing. If anyone is concerned with this being a scam send me an email with your phone number and I will call you to discuss. What is very frustrating about selling something is that people expect you to give something away. Here is a simple breakdown to illustrate my point:

Mini 14 - $849.99 (on sale at Cabelas)
magazines - $161.65 (Buds Gun Shop)
muzzle Brake - $70.00 (sorry but I bought on Ebay so I can't locate the reseller)
ATI Strikeforce - $131.99 (again bought on Ebay)

Lets do the math: 849.99+161.65+70.00+131.99=$1213.63 (mmm $1000 seems to be a fair price)

I actually bought at GAT so I paid $895 (before tax) for the rifle and $199.95 (before tax) for the mags so I have $1296.94 into the gun which I am still selling at a LOSS for $1000 because I feel its a more fair price in light of today's market.

If you can get a better price elsewhere than I encourage you to go there and purchase it. Please refrain from sending me emails complaining or accusing me of things that are untrue. If you are so hell bent on voicing your opinion send me your number and let have a phone discussion like real men do."

Sig P938: No rainbow or diamond plate editions please, ideally I would like either the Scorpion model or the plain Rosewood. For I used one I am looking to spend between $550 and $600.

I have the following 3 handguns for trade or sell:

Bretta Nano 9mm carry gun.  All black looks as new with no blemishes or idiot
marks. I am the second owner and have put about 250 flawless rounds through
it. It is one of the most dependable guns in my safe. Shoots any 9mm ammo
(even the cheap crappy stuff) and goes bang every time! I have bought several 
other hi-end ""carry"" guns and this little Beretta just sits in the safe. Comes with
box and factory goodies and 3 magazines (one extended) Cash price $360


S&W Bodyguard .380 APC with factory laser sight.  Officially I am the second
owner of this gun too, but the first owner never fired it.  I took the stickers off
the side of the gun. It has been fired about 30 times without incident (I bought 
it for my wife and she has trouble pulling the slide back on the gun) It does not 
fit my hand very well, so want to get it out of the safe too. Comes with box and
factory stuff, including the zipper pouch.  The laser is bright and has 2 modes, 
the battery is user replaceable. One magazine.  Cash price $365


Ruger LCP .380 ACP  Newest model, I bought it new at Greentop. Maybe a
150 rounds fired at the range. This has been my ""car gun"" but has no holster
wear or other distress marks...all black...looks as new! Comes with box and 
factory items Ruger zipper pouch and 2 mags. Excellent pocket pistol.
Cash price $269

Pictures: If you've seen one Pepsi Cola...you've seen 'em all! These guns are all
black and all look like new. If you want to look at them you can Google them
faster than I can take pictures and post them. If we can't make a trade, it won't
be because the guns are not as pretty as you think they should be! Please do
your homework and due diligence to make sure these are guns you actually want. 
I do not want to drive to meet you and hear... 'it's not what I'm looking for""

As usual, must show VA picture ID, and concealed carry permit or VA voters
registration card, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. Low ball cash offers
will not be acknowledged...If you see any of the above handguns offered
by someone at a lower price, please do not tell me about it...just buy theirs!"

This specific revolver was built in 1900. It is, per serial number  and component design, a !st generation early smokeless powder SAA.   This design of SAA was built from 1896 to 1908. The revolver we listed was completely refurbished approximately 12 years ago.  That's when the cylinder was replaced as well as possibly some of the internal action components by a very competent gunsmith. The fit, lock-up and action is very tight.  The barrel is marked ""Colt Frontier Six Shooter"", but I believe the marking was done during the refurb since the marking is not acid etched. 

This is a shootable collector.  ""Blue Book of Gun Values"" lists values of this revolver in 50% condition at $5000.  With it being refurbed with all Colt parts, we are asking considerably less.  A true Frontier Six Shooter like this gun would value in the $9000 to $12,000 range.

We have additional higher resolution pictures of this item available upon request.

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in many Movies, TV Shows and Video Games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun), this allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS-12 shotguns were stopped to the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS-12.

This is a wonder to shoot. The gun is in great shape other than minimal wear mark from being shot. The gun has has about 200 rounds down the pipe, cleaned, and put into the safe. The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$.

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I answer email immediately, or can be reached by text. Please no calls.

A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage.

I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50.

This has been on top of my AR-15 for about a year and has treated me wonderfully and has worked great in 3 Gun and Practical Rifle competitions. The only reason I'm selling it is because I want to switch to an unmagnified red dot so I may compete in a different division. This scope is covered by the Burris Forever Warranty.

$200 for the scope, and for $50 more I will include the P.E.P.R. mount, which is the perfect height for a good cheek weld on an AR-15. I'm available most days on the north side of the city and most evenings in the Northwest suburbs.

If you buy both, we can mount it and torque it to spec, and if you want me can meet at my gun range and zero your rifle at 100 or 200 yards.
