It has a “exquisite” walnut monte-carlo stock.  The barrel is chrome vanadium made by FN Browning in Belgium.  The receiver is a custom Mauser action.  The caliber is 270 Weatherby, which is a super charged 270 wm.  Bullets should be available at the local upper-level sportsman gun orientated outlets and at Cabalas.  The trigger and bullet loading housing is nicely and fully engraved.  The rifle is very finely blued and the stock elegantly finished walnut with simply outstanding grain.  Also, suspect many coats of finishing oil.

 It comes with a very clear Bausch & Lomb Balvar 50mm X 3-9 variable scope in black satin finish (might be 8mm objective lens).  Frankly, it is one of the “finest” grained walnut wood stocks I have ever seen.  Because it is in such a “new” condition and is such a “looker” I am certain it has never been out hunting.  I have had it about 8 years and felt it is simply too gorgeous to take out and subject it to the normal field hunting nicks and scratches.  I originally bought it for its great looks only.  One feels especially nice  simply looking at it.   

 Frankly, it is so nice it should be highly attractive for one whom has a very high appreciation for the best in custom built rifles using the finest of wood grained walnut stocks.  I would like to see it go to folks whom really appreciate superb grained wood and the classic elegant lines in fine rifles. 
It is ready for deer/elk hunting immediately.  Final purchase is conditional to full compliance with the Colorado State law."

Manufacturer's Specs:
This MOLLE compatible pack splits the difference between our small assault pack and our larger Tobago bag, proving a good deal of carrying capacity in a straight-forward, comfortable design that maximizes the available volume.
At 19"" x 15"" x 8"" with two main compartments and two large pockets, this pack is plenty big enough for most activities in the field. But if you need to haul more gear, you will find it is covered with MOLLE webbing attachment points, or PALs, so that you can add more pouches. It even has them on the bottom so you can attach bedding. The waist belt provides even more attachment points and is perfect for hanging a first aid kit, magazine or other pouches.

As you would expect, it has a built in compartment for your hydration bladder (not included) and your choice of three hose exit positions. It has a heavy duty rubber drag handle and the back is compression molded and contoured for the maximum comfort against your back. The wide straps are cushioned and offer additional attachment points. Other features include d-rings, removable padded kidney belt with quick release buckle, and fully adjustable contoured shoulder straps."

Heckler & Koch USPc 45 Compact DA/SA Safety / Decocker w/ 2 8 round magazines Made in Germany USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories - Ambidextrous magazine release lever - Extended slide release - Patented Lock-Out Safety device

$1000.  Cash sale only. PRICE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY $100.

Serious inquiries only - I am not interested in any trades.

2 additional 8 round factory magazines $70. each - available only to purchaser of pistol

This is a private sale and requires an FFL transfer.

On butt of gun has inscription of H.P.D. no 901  This is a used condition revolver....it still shoots great.

Still fully functional self defense weapon for male or female.  I've shot it and cleaned it after wards, then it just got put up for 10 years, so I figured I'd see if anyone else would have more use for it.

I do not have a box for it or any papers as I inherited it.

Just a leather holster that came with it. It has wear on the grips, the left is better than the right one and holster wear.

The bluing is discolored. Best to look at pics and see gun first hand. Overall its in good shape for a gun from 1944. That's based on the serial number I looked up on Colts website and an independent website.



I've been watching them on gunbroker the past few months and they are listed anywhere from $425 for much worse condition up to $800 in better condition. 



So I figured I'd split it down the middle and ask $575 obo cash or open to trade offers for something I can use for home defense or fun with the kids. 



Throw me any gun offers............I'm wide open.



Worst I can say is no thank you.

Desert Eagle Technical Data

General Features

The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

I would prefer 9mm, or .357 but other ammo types aren't excluded. Also I am willing to provide any documents needed. email me with any questions concerns. 

Also alot of people get worried when I say 18. It is legal for someone who is at least 18 years old to own a handgun. It is also legal in Virginia for an 18 year old to buy an handgun in private sale. It is illegal for anyone under 21 years old to buy a handgun or handgun ammo from an FFL Dealer. If you have any questions or concerns call the ATF, or the Virginia State Police and ask to talk to someone in the firearms department. They will tell you the same thing they told me that its legal for me to purchase a handgun in a private sale at 18 years old but I cannot buy a handgun or handgun ammo from an FFL dealer.

330,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2201330,For Sale:  Very early Charter Arms .38 Undercover,"Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States",$ 275,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 8, 2013",Handguns,Charter Arms                                                                                ,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"This revolver was made in 1967, when Charter Arms was a highly respected American handgun manufacturer. They were used by police all over the country, and even carried by American pilots  in Vietnam because they weighed only 16 ounces and were reliable handguns with aircraft aluminum frames and modular construction. Ruger basically copied much of the design when they came out with the much larger Security Six later in the decade. In many ways, they are superior to the design of the S&W AirLite or Chiefs Special. There is no sideplate to screw up and the solid frame is stronger because of that.

This specific revolver is in almost mint condition with no wear to the action, and no holster wear either. I wrote ""almost"" because there is a 1mm scratch near the hammer on the right side. It doesn't go all the way through the finish, but it is there. You can see it in my second photo, and it looks worse in the picture than it actually is. The casehardening colors on the hammer and trigger are strong, and the frame anodizing has turned a pleasant plum color with age. This anodizing process appears to be tougher than most modern aluminum treatments,  and is similar to the finish found on classic Leupold scopes. I know because I used to work for Leupold. 

This Undercover .38 has the relatively rare 3 inch barrel. It is about as concealable as a 2 inch, but it is MUCH easier to shoot accurately. It fits in a pocket just great, and while this one is unaltered, many people bobbed the hammers for just that reason. It particularly  likes any 158 grain .38 Special ammo, and the sights on it seem to be regulated for that. No Coke can has been safe within 35 yards, and frankly empty shotgun shells are an easy target at 25. The trigger and action are at least the equal of about any currently produced S&W,  and far superior to the current crop of Taurus and Ruger revolvers as well. The fit and finish are amazing, as are the internals. It makes me wonder why we accept the sometimes-junkers that are being produced these days for two or three times my asking price.

At any rate, this one is as tight, crisp, and smooth as the day it came off the line in Bridgeport, CT in 1967...By the way, it is light and accurate enough to not only conceal well, but also to make just a great trail gun or hunting back-up. Remember, with a revolver you never have to worry about a jam or finicky ammo. Pull the trigger and it goes bang. Every time. Not sexy these days I guess, but they just work.

You will NOT be disappointed when you see this gun, and will  be extremely happy when you shoot it. I am only selling it and another gun here to fund an antique that I have been trying to find for a long time. 

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call or text you to meet and see it. Once again, thanks for wading through all of this. Your reward for reading this far is a box with 40 American Eagle 158 grain .38 Specials when you buy the gun so you can enjoy it right away. Free. Of course, the little plastic case that I fitted it in is also included. The gun was too nice to not have SOME kind of case, lol.

All the best,

one of the most popular .22's on the market today. It features an extremely
attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on
guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth
many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any
internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and
cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

This amazing rifle is in like new condition, and has been cleaned and properly maintained after the the 3 times I shot it.  It comes with original box and all manuals.  Must see to appreciate.  Local FTF only.  This rifle is $379 if you were to buy it from the store, so save yourself some money!

As you can see it is basically a miniature version of the Colt 1911, and it does have a spare magazine with plastic bump pad. It has all the modern enhancement features that make it very shootable, such as the extended beavertail grip safety, enlarged slide release , wide manual safety, and extended magazine release. The feed ramp has been polished so it will shoot hollow points reliably, and it has a Commander hammer. Sights are modern 3 dot style and it shoots to point of aim. It is also quite accurate, giving me 2 to 3 inch groups at 25 yards. Finish is deep polished blue over Electroless nickel. The gun comes with the stag grips as shown, and the black original factory grips as well. The factory grips are in perfect condition, but I thought this gun deserved a set of custom grips, so I had the faux stags made for it. They are quite comfortable and well-fitted. 

I have owned this pistol for several years,  and even before I polished the feed ramp, I had never had a single jam, misfired, or failure to feed or eject. It has been dead reliable. Not all Llamas are like this of course. Llama seemed to take particular pride in these little 1911 clones, and this one is a really good one. It is after all hard to improve on perfection, and as I say, this Micromax has had a perfect reliability record with me. I used to collect these, and the fact that this is my last one says something. It was and is my favorite. 

These are safe to carry cocked and locked,  since they have all the safety features of the greatest fighting handgun in  history, the Colt 1911. They have been used by sportsmen and police all over the world since before WWII, and the Spanish even sold them to Germany for use by pilots, aircrew, and officers. With their size and features, it is easy to see why. I have pictured it with a pair of my sunglasses to show the size in case you haven't handled one. Even though they are small, they seem to fit many different sized hands, and I have found it to be one of the most comfortable-shooting semiautos I have ever shot. 

This gun is all steel, and no plastic was killed in the manufacture of it lol. You can buy cheaper .380s out there. There are plenty of nice and cheap plastic guns that work just fine. However, these little Llamas might actually turn out to be less expensive in the long run, since they actually appreciate in value unlike the plastic fantastic guns we get nowadays. Heck, even I have an LCP. I keep it in my car and if it got stolen I would be upset, but not exactly devastated if you know what I mean. When at the range, nobody ever came up to me and got excited to see my LCP. These Llamas are quite a bit more shootable, and much to my surprise, they have become quite collectible as well.

As with my other ad here, if you have had the patience to read all the way through this long winded advertisement, your reward is a fresh box of ammo for it included in the price. You also get the concealment book case I made up for it.

This is a lightweight, and very quick rifle built to move and connect at close/medium range but would serve just as well with a bipod and a scope. It is very accurate and a shooter can easily engage out past 100 yards with this rig. And adding a scope to this barrel, I've managed MOA or better groups at that range.

Description:
Model 416 Rimfire Pistol .22 Long Rifle 9 Inch Barrel Pistol Grip Adjustable Rear Sight 20 Round
The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the 416 .22 rifle. The 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. This comes with a 20 round magazine

Operation
A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

I no longer have time for this hobby due to work and other commitments. 

First up for sale is my Traxxas E-Revo brushless edition. I bought this in July 2012. I've only driven it a handful of times, it's never seen water or been abused in any way. It's only been ran on 4s and 5s. (I've only ran it on 5s two or three times). It's basically stock except the red aluminum pushrods and the tires/wheels are from an Emaxx. This truck is very fast and will pull wheelies all day long!

It will come with all the original parts/accessories and also additional accessories and parts (all are pictured).
Also included (as pictured)
* Turnigy Nano-tech 2s 5000mah 45-90c lipo battery (only 2-3 cycles on battery)
* Turnigy Nano-tech 3s 5000mah 45-90c lipo battery (only 2-3 cycles on battery)
* Onyx 235 charger (has built-in balancer)
* Team Integy allen set

The truck is in great condition, normal scratches here and there. Everything mechanical and electrical work as they should. The E-revo body is in very good shape. The Emaxx body that it comes with is in decent condition, not a ton of life left in that one.

I'm asking $550 or similar value on a trade.


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Next is the E-maxx brushless edition. I've only owned this for about a month. I bought it from an individual from Craigslist. He had bought it new about a year ago. It's a good truck. He had plasti-dipped (ie, waterproofed) the ESC. I didn't care for the fact that he did that (mainly b/c it voids the warranty). But anyway, I removed the plasti-dip from the ESC as soon as I got it home and the truck performs just as it should electronically. He had also stated he replaced the rear-diff a few months ago. He had also only ran it on 6s (the two mismatched lipo's as pictured)

With that said, I've only driven the truck on three occasions (all driven on 4s, with the 2s batteries pictured). I had to replace a few parts on the truck and it's running as it should now. The slipper clutch might need a little adjustment for though. 

I'm including the blue body he included (poor condition) and a new-ish red EMBE body. 
Also included:
* 2 - Turnigy Nano-tech 2s 5000mah 45-90c lipos (only about 5-7 cycles on these)
* 2 - 3s 4000mah 20-25c lipos (Onyx and Venom are the brands)
* Onyx 230 charger
* Equinox Lipo balancer

Changes easily from charge to charge without emptying powder hopper. Numbered measuring screw is used for reference to find a given charge at a later date. The measuring cylinder has precision ground surfaces and slides into the honed main casting for a precision fit. Standard 7/8""- 14 thread. Includes stand plate, drilled for easy mounting on a bench or under a reloading die lock ring. Two drop tubes for .22 caliber and up are supplied. The Uniflow Powder Measure is fully capable of accurately measuring all three major powder types - ball, cylindrical, and flake. It will even cut the cylindrical powders so that a precise charge can be obtained. NOTE: The Uniflow Powder Measure should be used in conjunction with an accurate powder scale for setting the original charge and for checking charges occasionally during the run. *Not for use with black powder.

One of the many on-line reviews: ""These are the newest imports to the American AK market, and probably the best bang for the buck right now. These rifles are produced for and imported by M&M Arms, located in Colorado. They feature Romanian receivers opened up to accept all standard AK mags and chrome lined, hammer forged Romanian barrels. They also feature a unique gas block/front sight combo, front rail system, and Hogue grip. They are available chambered in 5.45x39 or 7.62x39. There are two configurations, one with a fixed stock (pictured), and one with a side folding Romanian wire stock. The wire stocked ones are a tad more expensive. The fit and finish on these is very good, and they are solid step up from the Century WASR imports. They can be found in the $650-$850 range depending on caliber and configuration.""
