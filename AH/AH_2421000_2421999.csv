The gun has the Crimson Trace laser grips from the factory and it is dead on. 

I took this gun to the range to test it and it is pretty amazing to shoot. you can use 38 special for inexpensive target shooting but its performance with .357 magnum is intimidating - gigantic boom and plume of flame. even more amazing when you realize all this from a gun you can stick in a purse or coat pocket. The grips absorb the recoil pretty well so you can shoot the heavy loads pretty well. Ive heard people say that a warning shot from one of these guns is all it takes and I think that could be true.

I bought 2 boxes of Remington jacketed soft point ammo and put about 20 rounds through it, so the rest is included with this sale.

But I now have another daily driver so I don't need this one anymore. It has a very small amount of rust. The body is in good shape. Under the hood has been well maintained oil changed regularly. Front rotors and pads have been changed in the last year. And best of all no E-Check! It does have some minor things that could be fixed or left alone such as:  Muffler had a crack in the pipe from where a tow truck guy dragged the muffler on the ground. So I had it taken off and it just a straight pipe. No A/C. And sometimes you have to turn the key a couple of times to get it started. My mechanic looked the car over recently and he said it started for him every time. Maybe willing to take a cash/trade (this car is worth $3,000 I am selling it cheap just to get rid of it). Let me be clear this is a turn key car. I still drive it often just because it drives so nice."

It is part of the final delivery of the so-called “Kuba Pistolen” to Hoffmann & Reinhardt of Zürich. The pistol has an excellent bore suggesting a low round count with standard pressure ammunition in conjunction with minimal wear marks on the breech. It retains about 95% of the original matte blue finish, with light edge and high spot wear and minor thinning on the lower frame. 

H.P. Doebeli, the first chronicler of the P210, applied the denomination of the “Kuba Modell” to a batch of surplus P210-4, a part of the 1,500 pistols produced in advance by SIG expecting orders from the German government following their 1951 delivery to the Bundesgrenzschutz. When the German order failed to materialize, 1,417 of these pistols were sent to Denmark as the third delivery of their m/49 military contract. (See Vetter, p. 69.) Originally numbered as a continuation of the German BGS order between 5025 and 6441, the pistols redirected to Denmark were renumbered by prefixes with the numeral 3, yielding the range 35025-36441. The tail end of this production run, unclaimed by the Danes, and numbered between 6442 and 6500, remained at first in Switzerland. Vetter shows SN 6491, the last P210 delivered to the Basel police, and the final SN 6500, on p. 74. The gun in this auction is numbered between these two. It bears U.S. importer marks of “Benet Arms, S.F. Cal.94-4079”, applied around the magazine well

Danish army shot many kinds of 9mm ammo, including the Bofors M39B. This caused the slides to crack between the opening for the loaded chamber indicator and the ejection port. In early Sixties, SIG delivered unmarked replacement slides, but since they were already hardened, the numbers engraved by the armorers were not as deep as the original roll marks on the frame. Armbruster’s book shows on p. 137 one of the m/49 pistols, SN 35763, retrofitted with an upgraded slide for delivery to Denmark.

This fine and rare pistol represents the original SIG P210 design in its last and most definitive embodiment to date. It is fit to serve as the centerpiece of the most advanced SIG P210 collection. It rests in a locking factory leather presentation case. High resolution photos can be seen here"

Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, it is not a roller lock bolt but rather a lug type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18. The SL8 was originally developed for the German Bundeswehr, to provide a weapon for training reservists similar to the G36 and able to be provided to reserve organizations not able to provide military grade armaments.

Under 200 rounds fired.  It's stock except the grip has had the plug removed for the installation of a surefire flashlight.  Includes stock iron sights, one mag, lock and paperwork.  

If you're not familiar with the FS2000, look at some of the online reviews.  It is a truly ambidextrous CQB rifle.  The spent casings move forward through an ejection tube and exit from the front of the rifle.  The casings fall to your feet in a neat pile instead of off and to the right somewhere.  They typically eat any ammo you can find, and this particular rifle is no exception.  I've never had a FTE, FTF, stovepipe, etc.  Clearing a jam is supposed to be easy as well.  Pull the mag, cycle the action 2 times, reinsert new mag and recharge.  I say ""supposed to be easy"" because I've never had to do it.  

And it's an attention getter.  In addition to this rifle, I have an FS2000 in OD, and a PS90.  These are the two I usually take to the range.  I always have people asking me about them and trying them out.  And virtually no-one doesn't like them.  Even die hard AR guys.  There's something elegant about these rifles, and no-one can refute the fact that they just run and run and run.  Just make sure the mag is inserted fully.

I'm willing to meet at Red's South if you want to try before you buy.  

For 1,925 I'll include the FN tri-rail which replaced the forward hand grip.  That's a $200 value.

I have many more photos if you want.

FTF preferred in the Austin area.  Requires Tx DL for FTF."

I'm selling my Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun. It's in good condition and fully functional with less than average wear. It's been well maintained and not shot very much although, a LOT of fun to shoot.

Only about 1,850 SPAS-12's were imported into the US. This amounted to about 5% of production. The rest went mostly to European and Asian militaries and police. It's a  dual-mode shotgun that can be used in semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept many different attachments from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. until 1994. After the Clinton administration's Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. stopped."

There were only 2,000 of the TT (which stands for Titanium) models made and then they were discontinued because they were too expensive to manufacture and still be profitable.  It’s really light weight –6 lbs and that’s including the scope and mounts!  It’s the lightest and strongest rifle that Christensen had ever made.  With the Carbon 26"" barrel and titanium muzzle brake it recoils like 30-06.  Needless to say it’s extremely accurate -1/2” MOA consistently and Christensen guaranties the barrel’s accuracy for life.  You can call Christensen to verify any of this. The stock is Tungsten with Grey Webbin.  There is a Jewel adjustable trigger that adjust from 1.5 lbs. up and the action is the reliable Remington 700 RH.

This is a very interesting sub-micro-mini-compact pistol with respectable firepower it is the predecessor to Keltec (see the resemblance?). I am getting rid of this due to the fact that it is a little small for my hands. There are grip extensions for these out there though they are hard to come by. The original owner used this as a back-up piece because it’s tiny and offers 10 rounds of influence. It is double action only, has an internal (non-removable) magazine, a concealed hammer and low profile sights meaning it is perfect for non-snagging concealed carry. The only controls on this are the trigger and slide release (doesn’t even need a slide release in my opinion) the only safety is its long firm trigger pull and there is no need for a mag release so there is not much to go wrong if you pull this out of the nightstand half asleep (with the gun, God forbid you have to…). Included is the original box, owner’s manual, speed loader/take down tool, stripper clips (uses M-16/AR-15 stripper clips), 10 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense with FTX Bullet (the other 15 rounds cycled flawlessly).

The gun has the Crimson Trace grips from the factory and it is dead on. 

I took this gun to the range to test it and it is pretty amazing to shoot. You can use 38 special for inexpensive target shooting but its performance with .357 magnum is intimidating... and loud! Very nice for a gun you can stick in a purse or coat pocket. The grips absorb the recoil so you can shoot the heavy loads pretty well. 

I bought 2 boxes of Remington jacketed soft point ammo and put about 20 rounds through it, so the rest is included with this sale.

This is a relatively rare local creation (Manufactured in Azusa, CA 1960-1965) in very good shape. It sits on a Ramline synthetic stock and metal handguard which is similar in feel to a Remington 597. I have shot with this and GI stocks and personally prefer the aesthetic of wood but the feel and performance of the Ramline. Wood stock sets are available on a “broker site for guns” for around $60 if you wish to restore this excellent shooter to its former glory. The magazine is a WWII era US Postal Meter 15 rd blocked to 10 rd. Get it now before you have to register it Jan 1 2014. Per ATF rules this does not qualify for C&R as it is on an aftermarket stock (does not qualify on no stock either, it must be original or of original style configuration) Sorry

This is 1 gun with full size(14+1) and subcompact(10+1) grip frames and slides. Both are chambered in .40S&W. There is an interchangeable fire control group which is the only component with a serial number that can be switched between the two grip frames.  Both slides have factory Sig night sights. I have only fired mag through each.  Bought in July of last year and only took out to the range once.  Bud's has the gun new for $450.  The x-change kit is $250. This will save you over $100 plus the FFL transfer fees.  Time to sell this and move on to something I would use more.  Or trade my gun + some cash for Glock 30s or 5.56 or .300 AAC upper receiver assembly, piston upper preferred but let me know what you have...maybe we can work something out."

Remington Model 597 Rifle, .22 LR, 20"" Barrel, 10 Rounds, Gray Synthetic Stock, Matte Finish, Includes Scope and Mounts. 

The Model 597 with scope starts with the proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy. Of course, Remington didn't stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull (that stays that way). To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we've also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot 'hold open' magazine feature and the patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE features the lwrc fully ambidextrous lower receiver. The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE has controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, The new dual control lower receiver of the LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver of LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. The LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base of the LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new LWRC M6 IC SPR FDE Individual Carbine from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

This is a brand new in pack, never opened camera that was ordered for a customer and never picked up. For those of you that have never used one of these, they are simply amazing and a must have in your deer or property surveillance arsenal. They take pics continuously, as often as every 5 seconds, and then you can play it back like a video. With the provided software you can see an entire day in only a few minutes. They work best on large shooting lanes or food plots, where deer aren't in a concentrated area, and will capture deer that traditional cameras never would. I personally have 2 of these and love them. Normal price on this camera is $250+tax, this one is marked down to $225 total cash. I also have an extra steel lockbox for these made by Camlockbox I can include for $25, normal price on this box is $43. I can also include a camo Masterlock Python cable for an extra $15, normal price is $20. These will work to lock the camera to the tree and also slide through the existing hole in the lock box to lock it shut as well, leaving no need for an extra padlock. If you buy everything this weekend I'd do $250 cash. I would also be interested in trading for firearms, but trade value would be full retail at about $300. I'm located in Stanfield, NC. These can be picked up local or shipped for minimal cost. Get this one today at this great price before its gone. Thanks for the interest. CHRISTMAS FINAL MARKDOWN, price is now $220 for camera and lockbox, or $200 for camera. You won't find them any cheaper, get it before its gone!"

Info for purchasers of our micro/mini uzi striker assembly: We have measured approximately 100 IMI mini and micro bolts plus a few other aftermarket mini and micro bolts. We have determined that they all vary dimensionally (even the IMI). We have also measured the mini and micro striker assemblies that we were able to acquire. Without the original IMI striker blueprint there is no way to determine the original +/- tolerance values. We have reverse designed this part to be able to work in the majority of cases with out any modification required. However, if the firing pin protrudes thru your bolt too far it could pierce a primer and this would be a possible dangerous situation. In which case you might need to remove a small amount of material from the tip of the firing pin. Therefore, by purchasing this item from us and installing it in your gun you are certifying that you have the gunsmithing ability to check the firing pin protrusion in the bolt prior to shooting the weapon and can make the required modification if any are required. Or, that you will take it to a competent gunsmith to have it checked. We certify that this is a US made part and meets 922r requirements as a US made fire control component. Please study all BATF and NFA rules before purchasing. By bidding on this auction you certify that you are of legal age and have researched local, state, and federal laws and that it is legal for you to purchase this item. We take credit cards. We must charge Texas sales tax. Shipping is $7.50."

Comes with three 12rd magazines with 3 flush base plates and 3 extended base plates so you can choose any combination you like. Rubber texturized thin Talon grips already installed which provide an awesome grip and feel. All factory paperwork and original box from S&W also included as well.

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2421985,"For Sale:  4500 PSI air tank for PCP Air Rifle - Marauder, Daystate, etc","NE, Houston, Texas",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, December 7, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This tank is perfect for high pressure PCP pellet rifles like the Benjamin Marauder, which is what I used it for. I bought this in April 2013 from Pyramid Air. I filled it once but have just decided to go with the hand pump as the paintball field is too far away for convenient refilling. Bottom line here is that you can save yourself $50 on this unit by purchasing mine.

This tank retails for right at $300 at Pyramid. Mine is clearly a Ninja, carbon fiber tank and in perfect condition.

Check out pyramydair.com
In their search window, type in Carbon fiber air tank 4500 and you should find this set.

Please note: this tank has a special high pressure regulator as installed from the manufacturer. It is set for an output pressure of 2900 psi. This means it will not work for lower pressure paintball guns without changing out the regulator.

I have the literature / paperwork / owner's manual for the tank and fitting, which I will of course include. I'll include the neoprene cover.  Tank will be shipped with zero pressure for safety. Sorry."
