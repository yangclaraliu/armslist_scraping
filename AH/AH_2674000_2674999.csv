This particular model was does not have an ordinary trigger, instead this trigger is extended towards the rear of the gun beneath the firing pin. This rifle is in full working condition, and is fired by depressing the trigger on top with your thumb. It is chambered for .22LR, & .22 Short. From what I have gathered, this was the only Winchester ever made with a thumb trigger, and their first rifle listed with a rebounding lock. I am including a lot of pictures for full disclosure on condition of the rifle. If you have questions, please ask, if you want a specific picture from another angle or better lighting, please ask. This was passed down to me by my grandfather who took small game as a boy with the gun, and fortunately took very good care of it. I hope to allow someone else to enjoy it that truly appreciates the gun, that in my opinion is a very unique and interesting find for the avid collector.

This rifle is chambered in the well-known, widely available, and cost effective 7.62x39 cartridge, making it both extremely versatile and cheap to shoot. I have owned this rifle for about a year or so, bought it brand new. Took it with me down south to hunt feral hogs and here in the NE to hunt whitetail, coyotes, and ground hogs. It's essentially a 30/30 round out of a bolt action rifle, at a fraction of the cost to shoot. Great for someone who already has a 7.62x39 firearm (AK, SKS, etc.) that doesn't want to add a new caliber to their collection. 

Both the bluing and stock on this rifle are deep and rich in color. The Monte Carlo all wood stock is absolutely gorgeous. Overall this piece is in exceptional condition, can hardly tell it has been used. Accuracy is outstanding, have personally taken out 2 deer at around 200 yards and coyote/ground hogs at between 100-200 yards. I haven't had to opportunity to see what it can do past 200-250 yards, but according to the owners manual and various YouTube videos, 400-500 yards with decent ammo is well within its effective range.

Included in this package:

- Zastava M85 rifle ($525)
- Vortex Crossfire 2 (2-7x32). Great optic, zeroed at 100 yards ($150)
- Burris signature 1"" Zee scope rings (medium) w/ ""floating"" self-centering inserts. ($50)
- bi-pod (pivots, and each leg is individually fully adjustable) ($65)
- neoprene gel sling (very comfortable and durable) ($35)
- soft rifle case that fits this rifle, along with the bi-pod and scope ($30)
- 50 rounds of high end Hornady SST (polymer tipped hunting ammo) ($45)
- 100 rounds of Wolf brand ammo (either soft point or hollow point) ($30)

Comes with owners/operating manual for the rifle and the retail box for the scope (including users manual and warranty info). 

I have over $900 invested in this package. Obviously, I want to be realistic and therefore I understand I'm not going to get that out of it. However, I think $550 is extremely fair for everything here, and the condition it is in. 

FTF only, no shipping. Must be at least 18 yrs old with a valid OH ID. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. CCW and/or NRA card holders (like myself) are preferred.

Weatherby Mark V Deluxe Review:  http://www.chuckhawks.com/wby_mkV_rifles.htm

Introduced in 1944, the .300 Weatherby Magnum is the all-around cartridge for the big game hunter.  Based on the .300 H&H Magnum, the .300 Weatherby delivers 300 more fps than its British cousin.  Considered one of the best rifle cartridges of the 20th century, the .300 Weatherby Magnum had the flattest trajectory, longest range and the greatest killing power of any .300 magnum on the market until the .30-378 Weatherby Magnum came along.

I also have a harbor freight milling machine I can sell with it. there are some vices to go on the x-y table along with various other random parts. will include the end mills and drill bits I used to create my first lower. its a 12 or 16 speed version. cant remember. its no longer made but in great working condition. has its own table stand that its bolted to. 
I wanted to get into building a few of these but have let them sit for quite awhile and am moving on to other hobbies. 
new prices are as follows: lowers are $80 each. jig is $90. the mill was around $300. 
looking for $500 obo for the whole setup.

Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U.S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ""3-dot"" sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions."

I can not express how much time and work have gone into this weapon. It has operated FLAWLESSLY for the past 6 range trips. Absolutely accurate. Styling on the gun is incredibly unique, and took many painstaking hours at the workbench. I have personally fit EVERY piece of this weapon, and have had it in my nightstand for the past 2 years. Buy with confidence. 

Asking $1,100 OBO. Will consider trade for custom/high quality, full size 9mm. Make an offer, we'll make it work. Please no low ballers. I'm not in a rush, I'm merely making the switch to 9mm due to the high volume of ammo I'll be firing in the months to come.

The latest evolution of our SR15 16” Carbine now features an improved URX 3.1 with a longer overall length to allow for better muzzle stabilization. This alteration allows for reduced weight by removing the commonly unused rail section of the system. It also allow shooters who prefer a thinner rail diameter the ability to still mount accessories on the front and rear sections of the rail while providing a comfortable grip.

It is in overall good condition - I am NOT an expert on holsters so please ask me questions! I will be as detailed and thorough as possible.

I bought my Luger from a good friend about 6 years ago and the Luger came with the holster. He purchased the holster after he bought the Luger so they were not a matching set (otherwise I would keep it).

The leather is in overall good condition and shows some scuff spots but mostly a nice dark brown. The buckle is in good shape and metal shots some patina and wear, but still works. My Luger fits in it very snugly, no wiggle room or anything. The draw strap is also intact. Only markings are located on the back of the holster, and on the inside of the flap.
The back reads ""L.Z.A (followed by an eagle emblem) J. Colin. On the inside of the flap there is a big black inc stamp marked ""B.A.XT"" and a seal that has writing in a circular pattern (sorry hard to read with my eyes and it appears German) around the date, 1917. From what I can tell the L.Z.A is a production stamp from the leather manufacturer and the B.A.XT is a military acceptance mark."

It has one real imperfection on the top rail that you can see in the picture. I have no idea really how it happened. Other than that I've fired about 200 rounds (Federal American Eagle) through it and it's sat in my safe the rest of the time. I also put a rattle caned paint job on the lower, but it's already coming off, shouldn't be to hard to remove with some paint remover that's safe for plastic. Thanks for looking!

This shoots the 5.45 x 39mm round that the russians use in their AK74's. Great thing about this round is that it is absolutely the cheapest high power round to shoot in a AR15. Unlike the 5.56 round that can run about 60 cents every time you pull the trigger, the 5.45 x 39 round runs between 15-17 cents per round to purchase. Check it out on ammoseek.

This is a Model 1905 .45 Automatic...the predecessor to the famous Colt 1911. At the time this pistol was conceived, the U.S. Army was seeking a suitable semi-automatic pistol chambered in .45 caliber. John Browning adapted the current production Model 1902 Military (a .38 Caliber automatic) to a newly designed .45 caliber automatic cartridge in a first attempt toward meeting the military requirements. Although the 1905 was not accepted by the military, it did meet with some modest success on the civilian market and 6210 were produced between 1905-1912. Further developments and the eventual adoption of the Model 1911 by the U.S. military brought production of the 1905 to an end. Like the Model 1902 military and the earlier Colt autos, the Model 1905 operates using the parallel ruler principal where the barrel is attached to the frame by swivel links at both the front and rear. A ""wedge"" at the front of the pistol passes through the frame and secures the slide. This pistol is in good original condition and retains a fair amount of original blue finish."

It is in very good condition, as you can tell the previous owner did a custom camo paint job on it that I thought was pretty neat. These rifles are ceasing production and as such will of course start to cost more and more.

Here are the extras/upgrades that come with the rifle:
-10 Arsenal Circle 10 Waffle magazines: 8 black and 2 clear (though they have been painted). Most of these are new and never used but a couple of them show slight to moderate wear at the feed lips, though I'm sure they will still last a long time as these are well known as the best AK magazines
-4 Promag 5.56 AK magazines
-US Palm AK Grip
-Manticore Nightshroud Flash Hider 
-Ultimak Picatinny Upper handguard rail for optics mounting
The Midwest Industries AK side mount in the first picture is not included but I can include it for a little extra.

Brand new designed Follower with added ramp feed technology. This allows better cartridge alignment on the feed ramps. Floor plate has been designed around the custom limiter for restrictive states. This is ultrasonic welded inside the Magazine. Our new  magazine shoe has a new loop added. For easy paracord installation of quick pull magazines from any pouch.
Since all AR-15 / M4 / M16 are made to mil-spec, this does not mean that all the firearms are created equal.  We have a tall order to make our magazine fit every AR-15 / M4 / M16 gun ever made.  How we overcome this issue, we over engineered our magazines.  After you fit our magazine into your firearm, this will form fit the magazine to the weapon.  After inserting the magazine in and out of the weapon      ( 20 times or so) you should have a perfect fitting magazine for your AR-15.  You also can rub the magazine on concrete to reduce the stand offs.   We also sell 9 round magazines.  These are 50 State Compliant Magazines for the AR-15 / M4 / M16. We have a special limiter than is installed into the magazine. (3 ROUND, 5 ROUND, 9 ROUND, 14 ROUND, Limiters are available. (We also make custom size limiters.) For California Compliance the magazine shoe is welded to the magazine cavity rendering no modification allowed, or limiter removalable. When the limiter is installed this acts as a recoil buffer in the gun.  Since you have a spring that’s in the magazine wrapped around the limiter, this acts as a vibration buffer. The Size of these magazine cavities allows for easy forward grip operation.

Very very well built gun. With the gun, ammo and extras I have $1721 and change into it. So the trade value will be that and I will take $1600 cash for all. Here are the specs on the SAM7K AK Pistol.

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Took this in on trade to even a deal. Small, but solid so it has a light recoil.

.32 caliber (nice size between a .22 Magnum and .380) - which is very easy and cost effective ammo. Great bed-stand, console, or even carry piece

Single or double action. Person who traded it to me said it was a 60's model, but you could not tell it wasn't new by looking at the finish. The second 'trigger' is actually a 2 piece trigger - ensuring that if you drop the gun it won't go off, it will only fire with a pulled trigger.

I selected .38 short as the listing because .32 isn't an option to choose. Go check the availability and pricing of .32 to see how shooting costs compare. This weapon shoots S&W .32 and .32 long."
