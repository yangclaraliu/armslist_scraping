Bore is in great shape, stock is in decent shape, no great dings and no cracks. Bolt cycles well. Crown is in good shape.

Bluing is probably about 75-85%.

Can sell 8mm yugo milsurp ammo for 50/cents round, if you need it.

Rifle is accurate and has been tested out to 200 yards. I can hit small steel plates reliably with it at that distance.

Trigger is great.

Reason for selling is trying to reduce number of firearms that I own. Thank you."

I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

""The FM35 is a red filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.25"" bezel diameter. Produces a smooth beam of red light that will not degrade night vision as white light would. Hunters use the red filter to avoid spooking game during pre-dawn hours - deer see poorly in the red color spectrum. The filter is also useful for close range, non-tactical applications - such as map reading -- as it reduces the intensity of light output. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight.

Fits: All flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.25"" bezel

- Fits 1.25"" bezels, including Z2, AZ2, C2, C3, G2Z, G2, 6P, 9P

Bluing is 95% and the action, bolt, receiver, and internals are nearly new looking.
Very few rounds have been through this rifle and it shows. I have only shot 7 rounds through it in all the time I have owned it.

Unfortunately, the stock is shortened considerably and would be perfect for a small woman or youth.  There are plenty of stocks out there and I may have a line on a replacement that you could purchase directly from the owner if you desire.  There are also lightweight synthetic stocks that turn these into lightweight brush machines!  Short and light easy to maneuver.

I have not installed a suitable butt pad and have mocked one up from a shotgun to see what size I would need for the best fit.

I am selling the rifle AS IS. I am not changing anything out prior to sale.

I feel the rifle is worth $400 but offers are accepted.  I have hundreds of rounds of ammo including Hornady Lever Evolution.

The rifle is in excellent condition overall and a great brush gun.

The .223 SJC Titan was designed and developed with USPSA Grand Master Eric Lund to provide a competitive advantage in 3-gun competition. It is legal for Limited, Tactical and Open Division rifles. 

This compensator will reduce your muzzle rise, giving you better control of your rifle. Gas vectoring technology maximizes recoil reduction and minimizes torque and shot to shot recovery time. The design traps expanding gasses in the baffles and increases dwell time for maximum efficiency possible, allowing faster follow up shots and transitions between targets.

- Can be used on any .223, ½ x 28 threaded barrel. - Blends smoothly into any .750"" barrel 
- Comes with instructions and crush washer""

It was manufactured in 1915 in 25-20. Why it is so rare is that it is a trappers carbine with an 18in octagon barrel. Most all of the trappers were round barrel and chambered in 44-40. Another rarity is it has a saddle ring. This the ONLY trapper carbine i have seen with a saddle ring. The gun is in overall good shape no pitting or rust but it does have dings and scratches in the metal. The wood is in good + shape with good original finish and a few minor dings and scratches.  Functions flawlessly execllent shooter. The only downfall to the gun is it has been rechambered in 357mag. It sucks i know but it has... it had the barrel and the chamber rebored. This IS the original barrel. Also it has had marbles front and rear sights put on years and years ago.

This gun is a former German police pistol and has the Polizei coat-of-arms!

Unknown round count, but being a former LEO gun you can bet it's pretty high. I have about 200 rounds through it. This gun is solid and while the finish shows it's age, the fit is still pretty damn tight. The rifling is sharp and this gun is very accurate. This gun is extremely reliable, and never gave me any issues that weren't operator induced. It has less than 100 rounds on Wolff factory-weight recoil, hammer, and firing pin springs. Included magazine has a new Wolff spring as well. Selling to fund another purchase. This one doesn't get used enough to justify keeping it.

Gun comes with 1 factory 15-round magazine and a parts kit (any springs/pins you should ever need), three new extra mag springs, and the old recoil/hammer/FP/mag springs that were in it when I got it.
