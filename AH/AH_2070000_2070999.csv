This upper has been designed to not just merely tolerate corrosive surplus, but to be more resilient than the original AK74 designed to use it.

OPTIONAL EXTRAS:
I can also include the Sightmark red dot pictured in the photo. This optic also has zero range time use and offers perfect co-witness with the A2 sight post and MBUS provided.

It  also has a quick release lever for quick attachment/detachment from a picatinny rail. The reticle can be changed from a simple red dot to various crosshairs. It also has an integrated side laser with optional pressure pad (included). Will come with original box + tool kit/lens wipe + instruction manual + fresh factory batteries installed.

30,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2070030,"For Sale:  Rare good condition Saiga ak wood. 7.62x39, .308, .223, 410","NW side, Tucson, Arizona",$ 80,"Listed On: Sunday, September 8, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I don't see a lot of good wood on saigas any more. Synthetic black seems to be all that's importing these days. 
The wood stocks are sought after as it makes the rifles look a little more classy and classic. Maybe like a dragunov little brother. These wood stocks should fit any saiga rifle, the 410 shotgun and maybe the 20g shotgun. Will not fit the 12 gauge without modification.
But even when I do come across saigas with wood stocks the wood is normally beat to s*** and the finish is in disrepair. 
I came across THIS wood set and my rifle wore it only during one plinking trip. And otherwise just sat in the safe wearing this pretty dress. 
This wood is in nearly new condition. It must have been taken off its original host right after unboxing in trade for a pistol grip configuration. 

This sets grain travel and color also match superbly!  Even when you get good wood on these its not uncommon to see different colors or directions of grain. This set must've come from the same hunk of wood!

I've seen wood in lesser quality than this sell for $100 on the saiga-12 forums and there were no regrets. I'm putting this up for $80obo for a quick sale and hopefully it finds a non-abusive home where its quality is appreciated. 

If you are wondering ""why wood stocks"" I answer this ""the wood creates a MUCH improved balance on these rifles, enhances the cheek weld and lines your eye up perfectly (these were made specific to these guns) and in my opinion every saiga should have wood furniture as it really just looks SOOOO damned good!  

If you're interested please text me at (52O)55l-O555 or for best luck send me an email through this add. Include your contact information if you like."

I've got a used Kel-Tec P-11 that will come with the original plastic box, the manual, one mag and lock/key. It is the model with the black lower end with the tan slide. It actions smooth and has the normal long and tight kel tec trigger pull. I got it in on trade hoping that my gal would love it, but of course she did not haha. It doesnt have any large wear on her and only has normal marks/wear from being shot. The previous owner said he had put about 200 down the pipe with no problems. I am looking to trade or sell this for another gun. For the right offer I can include some ammo (amount subject to the exact deal). In terms of what I'm looking for, i am pretty open to offers. I would like to possibly get another conceal 9mm (LC9, Kahr's, PF9, 709 slim), or maybe a 22 rifle or pistol, or any other kind of gun really. I would eve  consider a trade for a large quantity of ammo (although it would have to be alot of ammo, and not at the hyper inflated prices) but Im not set in stone, just make me an offer. Im reasonable and my price is flexible. Shoot any offers or questions to REDACTED via TEXt only please and maybe we can make a deal. My microphone on my phone is busted so I cannot talk but I can text or email with no issues. Im open to partial trades, or even adding cash on my end for the right deal. All I ask is please be reasonable on the offer, I buy and sell and trade pistols and rifles alot and three of my friends are FFL holders and have a shop so I know what I can get nearly any kind of firearm out there for. 
Thanks for your time and have a great day!"

NO TRADES FOR RANDOM ITEMS! I've been offered gold coins, computers (both working & not), rims (which I prolly would have accepted had they fir my car lol), SUNGLASSES (WTF?), an assortment of lower quality guns, etc. I'm in the process of moving and I'm just trying to cover all the expenses involved with it, so I'm just looking for cash. However, if you have some amazing gun that I feel that I can't live without, I'm listening :)

I was also asked ""What kind of ammo is included with the SKS?"" IT'S PICTURED~!

And finally, the most annoying question I've been asked countless times.... ""How many clips/mags comes with it?"" If you really have to ask a question like that, then you prolly have no business owning one of these to begin with. Not being an ass, just saying :P

THIS GUN HOLDS 10 ROUNDS! TOP LOADING! I HAVE *NOT* MADE IT TO ACCEPT A DETACHABLE MAGAZINE! After market mags are cheap, and you can feel free to attempt to make it accept one. Personally, I don't think it's worth it due to the fact that quite often there are feeding issues involved when doing this and I want to be SURE that it will fire each and every time I pull the trigger. But you may do with it as you wish~!

P.S. No, I WON'T accept $150 cash! (Yes this was a real offer lol)"

3.3 XD-S™ SAFETY RECALL

Issued August 28, 2013
Technical Background          Get Started         Contact Us         Springfield-Armory.com
Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur.

What should you do?
STOP USING YOUR 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP PISTOL AND CAREFULLY UNLOAD IT! 

To begin the upgrade process and for fastest response, click on the Get Started link at the top of the page. On that page enter your serial number and click Next.  If your pistol is subject to this recall, you will need to provide your name, address, phone number, and email address.  The serial number is located on the frame beneath the dust cover (accessory rail).  If you prefer, you may initiate the upgrade process by calling REDACTED.  If you no longer own the 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol, please advise Springfield of the current owner.

XD-S Serial Number

What pistols are involved?
This Safety Recall applies only to:
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm pistols - serial numbers between XS900000 and XS938700 
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols - serial numbers between XS500000 and XS686300.

This Safety Recall does not apply to any XD® or XD(M)® pistols.

What will Springfield do?
Springfield will send you a return authorization and mailing label, allowing you to return your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol to Springfield at no cost to you.  Springfield will upgrade your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol with the new components, and return it to you.  Springfield will provide tracking numbers so you can monitor the receipt and return of your upgrades.

Questions?
Visit www.springfield-armory.com for further information about this safety recall. You can reach the Springfield Armory Call Center at REDACTED.  Springfield apologizes for this inconvenience, but your safety is our paramount concern.

We greatly appreciate your loyalty to Springfield products."

It has the less common factory Ilaflon finish, which is slicker and shinier than Sig's usual Nitron finish.  These are nicer in fit and finish than the newer US-made Sig Pros.

The gun is used, with approximately 800 rounds through it.  It has a stainless guide rod installed, along with a new recoil spring and Siglite night sights that are still bright.  Also included is a Hogue grip sleeve, which can be removed easily if you so choose.  The installed grip is the ""medium"" Sig Pro grip.  No other grips are included.

There is some wear to the barrel hood as shown, but than it normal for a used handgun.

I also have additional magazines and holsters available for it.  Six of the magazines are 15 round Sig factory mags, three of which have the hard to find compact baseplates.  The other four magazines are 17 round Mec-Gar magazines.  (Mec-Gar makes the Sig factory magazines.)  

The three holstes are a kydex Comp-Tac CTAC IWB (which they no longer offer for the SP2022), a black leather UBG Regulator snap OWB, and a Safariland 6378 ALS OWB.

Also included, but not shown, is the original factory plastic case.

I'd be willing to sell the whole package for $850 cash.  FTF sales only please.  I'm NOT interested in splitting up the package for a sale at this time.  

However, I will split up the package for the right trade.  I'm looking to trade this SP2022 (+/- cash or accessories as needed) for one or more of the items listed below.  Those are the only trades that I'll consider.

It has a 13+1 capacity meaning it holds 13 rounds in the clip and 1 in the chamber for s total of 14 hard hitting .45 ACP rounds capable of knocking down a 250-300 pound man easily. The package comes with 13 Factory Glock High Capacity Magazines which have a generous 13 round magazine capacity instead of the usual 10 round capacity and one Super High Capacity 26 Round Magazine(allowing 26+1 capacity for a 27 round total capacity) and everything works Flawlessly. The gun has been used very little and only has enough rounds through it to make sure it's s perfectly well functioning, accurate,  reliable weapon. It has been meticulously maintained and kept clean, even if was only shot once or twice it was totally disassembled, cleaned and lubricated in the proper areas just like the manual calls for, this Gun is better than new and I personally wouldn't trust a GEN 4 Glock because of the problems I've heard about but this is a tried and true Generation 3 Glock, if not the most reliable gun you can get, It's certainly at the top of the list, Glock is #1 in my book and I've got everything from Kel-Tech to Kimber and everything inbetween. Yes, I would pick this up instead of my Kimber 1911 if I knew I was going to a Gunfight, and it has to stand for something that Glock Pistols are carried by over 65% of the world's military and various law enforcement agencies. I also have over 1000 Rounds of Brand New Federal Premium ""High Shock"" Self Defense/ Law Enforcement Ammo- this ammo is as good as it gets and sells for $1 per bullet and more if you can find any, the round has been temporarily discontinued by Federal but its Law Enforcement and Military clients are demanding it back, it's a super hard hitting and powerful round with exceptional penetration and expansion characteristics and the favorite of many military units,cops,and civilians alike. I got lucky and found some of this great ammo before it was all gone but it was not cheap, I also have a nice Glock Range Bag to organize everything, 2 Premium Holsters- one BLACKHAWK SERPA holster with self retention feature and that makes it impossible for anyone to take it out of the holster, it only comes out when you hit the button which is perfectly placed. It's adjustable with the quick turn of a screwdriver for a straight up position, forward cant or rearward cant so it's always comfortable. I  also have a SAFARILAND Holster with retention system and is also capable of holstering the gun with a tactical light, laser, or both and keeping it all concealed and protected with its internal leather lining. It can be worn on your belt or as a Paddle Style Holster- it has an adapter for each one that attaches with 3 screws and can be switched out in 30 seconds or less. I also have 2 Belt Mounted Clip Carriers that hold 4 Magazines Each and a belt mounted Dual Magazine Carrier and my personal favorite is the Fobus Clip Carrier that holds one backup magazine that doesn't require a belt at all. All of this stuff cost over $2000- the gun was over $600, 13 Factory High Capacity Glock Magazines @ $40 each plus tax was $558 more dollars after tax, the 26 round magazine was $55 but worth every penny and works great- I was skeptical about it until I tried it and it works flawlessly, the 2 Holsters(Blackhawk and Safariland) and Glock Brand Range Bag were $123 for the 3 of them. The magazine pouches were $70 and the most expensive thing of all was the case of 1000 Federal Hi Shok Bullets was $817 shipped to my door and I have receipts to prove all of this.WILL TRADE UP OR DOWN- I CAN ADD CASH OR YOU CAN.

Overall, it is in very good condition, but it not perfect.   It has some issues from being stored improperly.  There are a couple of small scratches half way down the top of the barrel, and some slight rust spots on the magazine.  It has some small rust spots on the bottom lip of the receiver. The finish hides it, but you can feel it.  There is a small dent on the bottom of the stock.  The brass pieces could use some polish."

I am the third owner that I know of, I picked it up at a gunshow from a whimsical stranger, who claimed the original owner traded it in(One of those dime a dozen FFL shops that pop up like weeds), all serial numbers match. 3 of the magazines show a bit of wear. I have put about 100 rounds through the gun myself I was told it had 200 through it originally. I've kept it well oiled with ATF+4 transmission fluid for the internals, silicon grease on the slide rails, and Hoppes to clean it. The only thing I noticed was the extractor shows a bit of discoloration, which I have been told by several people is due to the high quality steel that HK uses. The paint is intact on the barrel weight compensator and the slide lock is still stiff as new which is unusual for me as its had a good deal of rounds through it. Also bore looks immaculate."

Oracle is an excellent entry-level upper assembly that incorporates the versatility of the A3 Flat-Top configuration in selecting a preferred sighting arrangement with a solid, fully functional foundation of quality components. It is the perfect way to get into the larger, more powerful LR-308 platform, and is an ideal candidate for future user customization. 
The Oracle features a 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel with a versatile 1:10 rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. It utilizes a flattop upper receiver with forward assist, ejection port door and integral shell deflector. The upper comes equipped with heat resistant polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 birdcage flash hider.

The left side top to bottom. My Glock g23 with work done to it.  everything from the factory comes with it. Here is what iv done. Iv installed Ghosts springs in the firingpin which is now 4lb, also comes with factory sping and 6lb spring. Iv put on the reduced power safety plunger spring also comes with factory. And iv put on the 6 lb trigger sping. So it has a much nicer trigger pull compared to factory.  I put the chrome 3 piece pin set on it. Comes with the factory black. Iv got a black and chrome glock brand extended slide release that I haven't installed but they go with the gun. Also I put a stainless steel guide rod and spring on it. And the last thing iv done to it was put the ace of spades on the back of the slide and on the bottom of the mags. This gun comes with 3 mags (2) are 13 round and (1) is 15 round.    The middle gun is sold and the bottom is a brand new xd40 with 4inch barrel. Comes with the xd gear. Speed loader, 2 mag belt holder. , and the xd holster.  And 2 mags.

Next is a Smith & wesson 38 special snub nose from the 50s or 60s with a leather belt holster. It's a model 38.  And the bottom is an old 32 h&r 6 shot top break. Comes with an old leather holster.
