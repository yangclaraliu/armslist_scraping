I am mostly looking to trade but will obviously entertain cash offers.  I am not going to give you a cash price.  If you want to buy it outright tell me how much it's worth to you and if I am happy with that number we can make a deal.  With that being said I am mostly looking to trade.

More pictures upon request.  Sorry the light is glaring in the photos.  And sorry to anyone who has replied to this post and it took me a while to reply.  For some reason all armslist messages were going to straight to spam.  I think I fixed that.  Reposting just to see if anyone who sent a request is still interested while I sort through the offers"

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

2nd- German made Sig Sauer P225(not the -6 model)

This is a gently used 1992 Sig Sauer P225 9mm. This is not the -6 model. I would rate the gun as being in 90% condition. It comes in the factory cardboard box which is also in great shape and all associated paperwork minus the test target ( I know, it hurts my feelings too). This model is no longer in production discontinued in 1998, and is a must have for serious Sig Collectors. It has some very light holster wear and comes with 1 factory magazine. I am currently looking to purchase a couple more mags but thought I would list it first and see what happens. I have seen The same gun on Buds @ $750 and there is one on GB with a 3 man bidding war that is currently at $675. 

I'm asking for $1650 cash for both, or they are also listed separately."

Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market.

Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

279,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2844279,For Sale:  AR15 Complete Lower - Brand New,"Akron, Akron, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 22, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have an AR15 complete lower for sale. Bought for a build that I never got around to finishing. The lower is Mil-spec forged aluminum with Mil-spec internals. For those of you who may not know, Anderson Manufacturing is one of the premier names in AR15/M4 style rifles. As a matter of fact, several ""big name"" AR15 manufacturers have, or still do, use re-branded Anderson lowers on their products. The finish and tolerances on these lower receivers are 2nd to none. This is a factory 1st lower....NOT a ""BLEM"" or Blemished factory 2nd with cosmetic issues. 

This complete lower has the PSA enhanced LPK (excellent trigger), adjustable butt-stock and pistol grip. It is ready to mount to any compatible upper and head to the range. It is brand new and unfired. 

To purchase you must be at least 18 and have a valid DL or ID to prove it. FTF only, not shipping. Can meet in the Akron area. CCW (like myself) preferred. Not really looking for any trades at this time. 

Price is $225."

 Ported 32 inch barrel 
 Deluxe ""tiger stripe"" wood 
 Adjustable cheek and butt plate
 Custom black leather cheek-guard
 Located in Independence, KS.
 The Browning BT 99 is one of the most highly regarded and sought-after trap-guns ever made and was produced from 1968 to 1995. It was re-introduced by Browning in 2001. How ever, most newer BT 99's lack the metal engraving and high grade ""tiger-stripe"" wood the early 99's were renowned for. Also the newer models lack the full-tang ( long ) trigger guard that was also a hall-mark of 1st generation BT-99's.
 This particular BT-99 was manufactured in 1971 using superior grade wood furniture. As you can see, even after over 40 years, the wood on this Browning trap is close to flawless. The weapon has been very well maintained, freshly cleaned, oiled and lubed with fresh shooters grease.
 Trade interests include pre-1965 silver coins, Morgan silver dollars and what ever may catch my eye ( No junk please, this is a very nice higher-end trap gun )
 Sale / Trade value for this Browning BT-99 is set at 1,200 O.B.O"

This 130gr., hard cast, 327 Federal load, is the direct result of customer request for such a load. It is designed primarily as an 'outdoor' load as it penetrates deeply and does not expand. It will perforate a large bear's skull and will also serve well for any application that requires very deep penetration. This load utilizes flash suppressed powder, so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to fire in low light situations.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses stock over-the-counter firearms to determine our published velocities, so the shooter will know what to expect in the real world. The industry wide practice of using extra-long laboratory test barrels, that generate unrealistic and exaggerated velocities, is dishonest to the customer. The below velocities were fired from my personal stock, out-of the-box revolvers.

507,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2844507,For Sale:  Sabrewerks Kalashnikov Optics Platform (KOP) Authorized Installation Center,"Mount Sterling, Kentucky, United States",$ 79,"Listed On: Saturday, April 25, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Meridian Ordnance LLC is a Sabrewerks 13 LLC Kalashnikov Optics Platform (KOP) Authorized Installation Center. 

For a quick familiarization of the KOP system and review, check out MAC's video here: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aas1cKG95g

The KOP is a fully integrated interchangeable optics mounting system for the Kalashnikov family of firearms including stamped and milled receiver variants of the AKM, AK47 and AK74 as well as the PSL. The KOP System consists of a rear sight block platform and interchangeable optic mounts.

The Platform is mounted to your rifle in place of the original rear sight base (RSB). This Platform allows the use of any of the numerous interchangeable Optic Mounts available from Sabrewerks.

Each Optic Mount is specifically designed to mount an off-the-shelf optic such as the Aimpoint T1/H1 and Trijicon RMR. Optic Mounts are also available for mounting scopes and many have Picatinny rails for mounting your choice of rail mounted gear.

Your interchangeable Optic Mounts allow you to rapidly swap optics. Start shooting with your Aimpoint installed for fast acquisition shooting. Swap out a magnified optic for long distance, and change to your starlight scope when the sun goes down, all with the same base. Optic Mounts can be swapped in less than a minute. In addition, the KOP system allows for normal disassembly of the host rifle and transmits very little heat to the mount or the optic during prolonged strings of fire or heavy use.

Meridian Ordnance LLC offers KOP installation on any host rifle, carbine, or short barrel rifle that will accept a factory Sabrewerks rear sight base platform. Generally, installation will require removal of the front sight block, gas block and rear sight block. The new KOP system platform replaces your rear sight block and we then re-install your existing gas block and front sight block. If you so choose, this is an excellent time to consider the addition of a Bolton block or other one piece gas block/front sight block. If you are commissioning an AK build from a parts kit or a Saiga conversions, we can install the KOP system at a discount usually. Customers may purchase a KOP directly from Saberwerks 13 LLC or through us at Meridian Ordnance LLC. For pricing on installation, please contact us with your specific platform and details. Pricing starts at $79 for basic installation on a stripped or virgin barrel and goes up from there depending on the degree of work and labor/parts involved.

I simply do not have the need for a 223 as I have my AR. I am looking for cash offers and trades. TRADES: 9mm carry gun(SW,Glock,anything but XD), bolt action rifles in NON-deer hunting calibers (.17,223,22-250etc.), anything else that would peak my interest.

It has two tube magazines which the user of the gun can switch between manually.[2] Each tube holds a total of seven 2.75 in (70 mm) 12-gauge shotshells or six 3 in (76 mm) shotshells. Also it takes 27 1 inch shells.


OPERATION:

The Kel-Tec KSG shotgun is a manually operated, pump (slide) action weapon. Barrel locking is achieved by a swinging wedge, located inside the top of the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. The sliding forend is connected to the bolt by dual operating bars. The ammunition feed is from two independent tubular magazines, located below the barrel.

The user is required to manually select a magazine by switching a three-position lever, located behind the pistol grip. The middle position of the switch blocks the feed from both magazines and allows the user to chamber a single round manually. Switching the lever to one side brings the respective magazine into the feed cycle. Once one magazine is depleted, the user manually switches to the second magazine by pushing the magazine selection lever toward it.[2]

Rounds are loaded into the magazines through a large loading/ejection port, located at the bottom of the gun in the stock, behind the pistol grip. Empty shells are ejected down through the same port. A manual safety is available in the form of the cross-bolt button, located above the grip, making the gun fully ambidextrous in use. Sighting equipment (iron sights and/or red dot sights) can be installed using the standard Picatinny rail located above the barrel. A second Picatinny rail is provided at the bottom of the sliding forend, permitting installation of other Picatinny rail accessories. While not included with the stock weapon, perpendicular forward grips and back-up iron sights (BUIS) are almost always shown in photography and video demonstrations of the Kel-Tec KSG.

Please do not be one of those hand loaders who is going to search through this information just to find the stated ""MAXIMUM"" load and start with that.

There is much more to determining your maximum load than just how much powder you can dump in the case.

Temperature, bullet type, bullet weight, bullet seating depth, barrel twist, groove diameter, chamber throat profile. These are just a few of the variables that can affect velocity and pressure.

In our never-ending search for high velocity, anyone can overload a cartridge to achieve ""BRAGGING RIGHTS"".

In doing so however, you risk damaging your rifle, endangering yourself and those around you.

The following information will assist you in working up an accurate, high velocity load for your rifle in a safe and prudent manner.

A good set of reloading dies, a quality set of calipers, an accurate powder scale and a reliable chronograph are some of the items you will need.

Begin by firing the first shot with the starting load and record seating depth and velocity.

Increase the powder charge no more than 1 grain at a time. If you experience ANY ONE of the following signs of pressure, reduce your powder charge by 10% and consider that your maximum load. Never exceed the maximum load stated in the following chart regardless of whether or not any pressure signs are apparent.

1.	If you begin to see pressure signs on the primer such as flattening or ""cratering"" around the firing pin dent.
2.	If enough brass flows into the ejector pin hole on the bolt face so as to cause a shiny spot or dent when the cartridge is ejected.
3.	When ejecting the fired cartridge, the bolt is sticky or hard to lift.

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Rem 700, nice looking wooden stock, great trigger (factory but appears tuned, light and no overtravel, better than any 700 factory trigger I've tried). Has iron sights, and new leupold bases with new leupold 1"" rings. Blind mag. Don't know round count, but from the chamber and barrel it appears very low. Smooth bolt operation, the new ones just don't compare.  Early 90s make, great shape. I don't deer hunt anymore so no need for it. No trades unless you have a FWB 600 series air rifle, or similar. Price is shipped. Will not ship anywhere illegal, and MUST ship to a valid FFL if not in Texas.

The stock includes an adjustable length of pull and an adjustable cheek rest for customization to the operator's requirements. The adjustments are achieved via rotating dials that incrementally move the butt plate and cheek rest respectively back and forth or up and down. The stock features a rubber recoil pad with an aluminum core for reduced fatigue and stainless steel adjustment shafts for corrosion resistance. Molded from nylon reinforced polymer. The stock includes an adapter for sling mounting.

The 110 BA also comes stock with a Heckler & Koch PSG1 style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which contains an adjustable palm shelf. A hex bolt rather than a rotating dial tightens or loosens the palm shelf. Loosening the bolt allows for the palm rest to move up and down to accommodate the shooters hand size. Tightening the bolt locks the rest into a set position that is now customized to the shooters hand size.

The fluted heavy barrel that is free-floating which provides high accuracy. Thicker barrels are generally stiffer, and thus deflect less when a force is applied, such as when a forearm touches a barrel. A heavier barrel also tends to vibrate less when fired, thus sending bullets more consistently in the same direction."

Cheaper then you will see in your local store.

I prefer to sell complete boxes of 450 rounds. However I will break them down into orders of 50 rounds at $17 per 50. Since I am breaking a box down the ammo, it will be loose and not in racks if you choose to purchase less then what comes in a full box.
