Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. Apparently the SEALS think differently! Note: in a picture from “No Easy Day” there is this model HK45C top left in the locker of equipment used in recent operations. Same gun minus the suppressor.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:

Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
Two high-capacity 10 round mags that fit both the HK45 and HK45C
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy (four extra rings supplied)
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable Tru Dot night sights

BE CAREFULL!
A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any way!

There are some tips for you to look after your knives

    Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

    After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

   Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


    If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.

    These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

Remington Model 760 Carbines

A major change to the Model 760 line occurred in 1960 with the introduction of the Remington Model 760C carbine. The carbine's action tube did not extend past the end of the forend and an ""O"" ring was fitted in the fore-end to reduce rattle. Both were so successful that they were later incorporated into all 760s. The CDL carbine grade appeared a year later, and it was equivalent to the ADL rifle. Both the carbine and the rifle were fitted with new sights compatible with the ""all purpose"" stocks.  Production of the Remington Model 760C carbine stopped in 1980, and this firearm last appeared in the 1979 Remington catalog. In the twenty-year period, a total of 62,726 Model 760C carbines were sold.

320,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2219320,For Sale:  NEW ACU IOTV Vest,"Morristown, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 400,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 17, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new LARGE Improved Outer Tactical Vest, US Army Standard Issue. These are brand new and never worn or seen combat. The vest inlcudes all of the soft armor, kidney pad, collar armor, groin armor & hydration attachment with tw0 bladders.. These sell new for over $800 if you can find them. There were wore out ones on the table at Knob Creek for $400! This wont last long!

$450

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation."

If I receive a low ball offer I won't even reply. If you have any questions shoot me an email. I work a swing shift so please be patient. I just found out the spring to the bolt release is broke the gun smith says it will cost 75 for a gunsmith to fix on average could be different depending on where you go. So I lowered the price from 400 to 300 firm any less and I might as well give it away. I could fix it myself and take it back up to 400 but I just don't feep like messing with it. I do not do out of state sales if you do not live in kentucky then don't bother contacting me.

There is some slight rusting on the trigger and some spots on the gun itself (see photos)... But I think it just needs a good cleaning. shouldn't by anything more than usual wear as it has always been stored correctly.

I personally purchased this double action revolver less than 3 months ago and have put less than 250 rounds through it. It shoots as good as a 1.875"" barrel snub nose can shoot; the XS Big Dot front sight is a must have, great for quick target acquisition and better accuracy than you would think using this type of sight system. The stock grip is designed and manufactured by Hogue. This revolver has an excellent grip texture, not too sticky and not too slick, just right. This LCR has a very smooth double action pull which can be staged for accurate follow-up shots. Like the title says, this piece is like-new. As an added bonus I have thrown in my personal inside the waistband holster (never used, other than trying it on). The IWB holster is a hybrid type (White Hat Holster's Max Tuck, made in the great state of Texas) similar to the ever popular Crossbread Supertuck and the Galco KingTuk. It has a horse hide leather backing (best quality and great for fighting against active sweat) as well as a solid fitting kydex sheath. Overall this revolver and holster pair is a great light weight carry option. The Ruger LCR weighs in at a ridiculous 13.5 ounces according to Ruger's website specs! I have included the shipping price in the bid price, so no extra fees will be sent your way other than your FFL transfer fee paid to your local dealer. MSRP is listed as $579 for the LCR and the holster ran me just over $75. As an added bonus I will throw in 2, 6 round speed loader strips free of charge.

Gun is extremely accurate and has a smooth trigger pull in double action and a crisp break in single action. I bought this gun solely for range shooting, but decided to go with the full size B model after trying out a friend's. 

The gun has only been to the range two times, each time less than 100 rounds were fired through it. It will include the factory case and all paperwork (warranty registration has not been sent in, so you could still register it with CZ to make use of the factory warranty) and will come with 5 14-round magazines. 

I paid almost $600 for the gun and two mags and almost another $85 for the three additional mags.

I have a Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm that is almost brand new. Less than 300 rounds fired through it and meticulously cleaned. Feels good in the hand with a decent trigger. This is the California model, with the manual safety but for any 1911 jockeys out there, the safety is nearasdammit identical. Very easy to engage and disengage. 

I am selling this for $500 firm, or for a good trade, particularly other M&P's, some Glocks, and definitely SIG's. This unfortunately was just not the gun for me, simply because I am not an external safety fan. If 1911 style safeties don't bother you, this is a perfect little workhorse of a pistol. The pistol comes with two factory 17 round magazines, three backstraps, and the original case. I have all the original Smith and Wesson papers, the test brass and the receipt from the previous owner. Please be a legal Oregon resident with no criminal record and be willing to fill out a Bill of Sale for my records.

I have a fantastic Colt Commander ""Hybrid"" in .45 ACP.  If you are wondering what I am talking about...let me explain!  This handgun is truly one of a kind as the barrel/slide on the gun is blued steel and has the Colt Combat Commander markings, while the frame is Aluminum Alloy from a Colt Lightweight Commander.  All parts are original to my knowledge with the exception of the iron sights which have been upgraded.  This is truly an exceptional handgun and you will NEVER find another like it.  I am the second owner and have owned it for approx. 17 years.  I have only put somewhere around 200 rounds downrange with this beauty but I cannot get over the accuracy and fantastic feel of this gun in my hand.  It is perfectly balanced.  In addition, each time I have taken this gun to the range since I purchased it, someone has approached me to take a look, make me an offer on it, and/or the really brave ask if they can take a few shots with it (not always thrilled with those types).  I have always said I would never sell this gun but I have finally found a handgun on the current market that might make me let go of this great Colt!  

***Please see the ""FOR TRADE"" section below for information regarding the handgun I am interested in trading this one for.***

ADDITIONAL INFO/ACCESSORIES INCLUDED:
1. Two original 7 round magazines that came with the gun
2. One 8 round stainless steel magazine.

I purchased this gun back in 1996 from it's original owner (who happened to be a family friend and Vietnam/Korea vet).  I have rarely shot it over these past 17 years....maybe put a total of 200 rounds downrange total, but it is a beauty to shoot.  I have never had the gun jam on me or otherwise malfunction in any way.  I have always made it a priority to clean this gun (and all my other firearms immediately upon my return from the range and when storing it, I always add a very light coat of gun oil on the firearm to keep any rust from forming.  Please let me know if you need any additional information or pictures, etc.  

RE: SHIPPING - IF BUYER CHOOSES THE BUY IT NOW PRICE, I WILL PAY THE $20 SHIPPING FEE ON MY END!!!

FOR TRADE:  I would be willing to accept the following in trade for this handgun:

One Sig Sauer Series P250 9mm ""2SUM COMBO"" w/ a 17 rd magazine, Black Fixed Sights, Full/Med Grip.  This Combo kit is something special in Sig Sauer's product line.  The description from Sig's website is below...

""The P250 2 Sum is a combo that includes a full size P250 and a sub-compact P250 without the trigger mechanism. You are able to swap the trigger mechanism from the full size to the sub-compact frame within a minute or two. Basically, it is the same as having two guns and the combo is priced cheaper than most of the regular P250.""

My Colt Commander ""Hybrid"" (as I like to call it), chambered in .45 ACP, is  again one fantastic gun regardless of whether all parts are from the same gun.  It has never jammed on me, it is dead on accurate and is a great range gun or even a carry gun. 

If you choose to purchase from me or trade me for it, be prepared to attract attention at the range...it has happened to me every time I have shot it our local range.  

I hate giving up this handgun and swore I never would.  I have no one to will it in the future because I have no sons and my daughters are not currently interested in guns (and probably never will be if my wife has anything to say about it)!  

Please feel free to contact me asking for more information, additional pictures, etc.  My mobile number is REDACTED if you want to call or text me.

Thanks and good luck bidding!  Someone is going to be a very happy gun owner!!!  I have never enjoyed owning a gun more than I do this one.  If I don't stop describing this gun and how great it is, I am going to just talk myself out of selling it!  :)

 I was told that this gun fired off one mag about 25 years ago-And after seeing this gun I believe it, this could pass as never fired. After slowly, carefully stripping it down I've found most of the springs were just hardened stiff-and there was very little powder residue on the feed ramp. I cleaned it all out lubed it up and replaced all the springs with a set of Wilson Combat springs-a standard set-not competition springs. And that's it-everything else is original. As you can see the gun is flawless- If you didn't know better you would think it was never fired. Forget the fact that its not only a collectible gun-with a cool box-Its a mint Colt 1911 built in 1970-that feels and looks like a new one-and you can run it at the range-along with your other guns.

From Uberti’s site: “The Uberti Top Break is true to the original, designed by Major George Schofield at the Smith & Wesson factory in 1869. The Schofield revolver was created as a cavalry pistol. Its efficient, break-open design could be operated one-handed. That made it easy to eject all six spent cartridges and reload the single action revolver while on horseback. The U.S. Cavalry was slow to see the merits of the top break, but Jessie James, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok saw the fast reloading capability as a distinct advantage in their line of work. After numerous trials, the U.S. Army finally purchased three thousand top breaks with an improved top latch design.”

If the old stock is salvagable then I will box it up and put it away. It is a piece of history and will never be manufactured again. If you want to keep the stock and sell me the functioning metal for $100.00, that will work.
If your Mosin looks pretty good, I'll give you $120.00 for it with the wood stock and will still box up the wood stock (and I won't cut the metal bands. They don't have to be cut to be removed, just opened up with a pair of ring pliers). I also would buy a different Mosin variation as long as the barrel has been cut/crowned for the purpose of removing the bayo. A muzzle brake on that cut barrel would be ok too.
I'll buy it right now if you are in Louisville and can meet me near my work (toward the Downtown area) or after work if need be."
