SAFETY

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries."

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not looking to separate at this time.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking. 

NOTE: 2 of the 3 rifles have matching serial #'s on the bolt, barrel, and bottom of the magazine. The one that doesn't is the M44."

Very high quality stuff.

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not looking to separate at this time.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking. 

NOTE: 2 of the 3 rifles have matching serial #'s on the bolt, barrel, and bottom of the magazine. The one that doesn't is the M44."

This listing is just for an upper , not the lower also. if you want the Vortex SPARC in the pic I can include it for another $125.

 There is hardly a mark anywhere on this upper , it is in excellent condition . you can tell by looking at it that it was babied and treated with care. It's very clean . Runs flawless! This upper looks and feels like a 5.56 upper , weighs the same too. So this is perfect for training on the AR15 platform. The round count is probably around 350 rounds right now. 

I am including with it 7 black dog 27 round magazines.  4 of them are smoke colored. The other 3 are solid black and marked spikes tactical on them. The Spikes magazines are very hard to find, i have not been able to find anymore that say spikes on them. The black dog mags that do not say spikes are readily available tho and work exactly the same of course. If you buy this upper from me i have a 300 round box of Troy Landry edition CCI mini mag I can sell you for $35 and 2 bricks of CCI blazer I can sell you for $75 for both. So you would be getting a lot of 22 for pretty close to pre panic pricing which will keep you shooting for a while. The ammo is not otherwise for sale, i am only gonna sell it if you buy the upper. 

Price for the upper is $750 and you are getting $150 worth of magazines with it ! Just the Daniel Defense rail alone is $300. It's like you are getting the upper for $300 when you total it all up. This is an absolute steal considering these uppers are impossible to find. I am located in spotsylvania but can meet anywhere between the town of louisa and fredericksburg."

180,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2841180,For Sale:  Elcan DigitalHunter Day/Night Digital Riflescope w/Video,"Downtown, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,300","Listed On: Friday, March 21, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand New-Never been mounted.  Great for recording first-timers, students and even professionals the Elcan DigitalHunter Parallax Free Digital Riflescope ELDHDN lets you record your shots so you can view them later. This Digital Rifle Scope from Elcan  has a Daylight Mode that provides excellent imagery for targeting during the day while the Lowlight Mode gives stunning low light level performance.  This Elcan Riflescope is a lower-cost, good-resolution alternative to image intensifier or infrared rifles scopes. And since the Elcan DigitalHunter DayNight is a digital riflescope, it provides electronic ballistic compensation, automatic video and still image capture and replay, field selectable reticles, and customizable reticles. The Elcan Digital-Hunter Day - Night Digital Riflescope w/ Video Capture is not plagued with common telescope issues such as parallax, magnification change-induced bore sight shifts and exit pupil diameter reduction, and limited eye relief. Electronic ballistic compensation enables the shooter to ""hold where you want to hit""! Elcan DigitalHunter Digital Rifle Scope is a range compensating riflescope, removing one contributor (holdover estimate) from the shooting equation. The four field selectable reticles, when coupled with the four ballistic data tables, enable the scope to function as four different rifle scopes. The Elcan DigitalHunter Digital Riflescope can be setup for a center fire rifle, a shotgun (great for turkey), a crossbow and a muzzleloader. Since the reticles are graphic images they can be any color, shape or size that can be drawn by the user via bitmap generating software...circles, lines, squares. Parallax is avoided since they aren't physical features of an image plane.  Check out the Youtube Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfRWsd2czdU"

It comes in the factory cardboard box which is also in great shape and all associated paperwork minus the test target ( I know, it hurts my feelings too). This model is no longer in production discontinued in 1998, and is a must have for serious Sig Collectors. It has some very light holster wear and comes with 1 factory magazine. I am currently looking to purchase a couple more mags but thought I would list it first and see what happens. I have seen The same gun on Buds @ $750 and there is one on GB with a 3 man bidding war that is currently at $675. I am asking $700.00 or will consider reasonable trade offers."

** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

This class is offered by a police officer in Illinois with 19 years in law enforcement and is a federal and state certified firearms instructor. The instructor also was recruited by the Department of Defense in 2004 to go to Baghdad, Iraq to help open and operate the largest police academy in the word where he was the head of the handgun training for the entire academy. It is no secret that this is troubling times for everyone. There are dangers faced everyday no matter what your occupation is or if you just travel across the country, it is your constitutional right to possess a firearm. This class is available to anyone in any state in America as long as you are a legal gun owner. The cost of the class is $150.00 and then there is a fee to pay to the state of Illinois and the conceal license is good for 5 years. This license is good in all the states mentioned including Illinois. At this time Illinois does not recognize any other states conceal license so unless you have this class you CANNOT conceal and carry a gun in Illinois. Chief Darnell is the head instructor and would be willing to travel to your location to do the training if there were enough students or if a group wanted to take the class without traveling here. Signing up couldn’t be easier, just message Chief Billy Darnell at REDACTED or go to his Facebook page and leave a message. Anyone wishing to come to this class has several options for lodging. There are hotels within 15 minutes of the class along with a very nice camp ground with water and electric for campers one minute from our class room with a beautiful river with boat access, fishing and ATV trails. Students who camp get a discount on nightly rates at our camp ground. The cost to camp is $15.00 a night if you are signed up as a student in this class no matter how many people you have in your party or if you are in a tent or a R.V. or camper. Come enjoy a weekend of training during the day, then in the evening kick back and relax on the Wabash river fishing or take off on a night ride on your ATV on the trails. It would be a great way to spend quality time with loved ones or friends and get the training you need at the same time at the lowest price possible."

I want to sell these items as a package.

Kel-tec Sub2k
-Purchased last may from Honey Creek Tackle on 135 in Trafalger. This rifle is extremely accurate. Obviously accuracy is 90% the shooter but I consider myself an average shooter and was knocking over bowling pins one by one at 75-100 yards. The grip has been professionaly trimmed to accomodate Glock 23 magazines (Originally for Glock 22). I consider this advantageous because it allows you to use any glock .40 caliber magazine besides the G27.

Glock 23
-the glock 23 is in excellent condition and has a new set of Trijicon night sights, a new steel recoil spring as well as a new set of Tallon Grips. I will include original sights and spring

Mags
-All magazines are glock brand magazines. 6 are glock 23 mags (two with extensions) and one is a 10 round glock 22 mag that came with the sub2k

I want to sell these items as a package.

Kel-tec Sub2k
-Purchased last may from Honey Creek Tackle on 135 in Trafalger. This rifle is extremely accurate. Obviously accuracy is 90% the shooter but I consider myself an average shooter and was knocking over bowling pins one by one at 75-100 yards. The grip has been professionaly trimmed to accomodate Glock 23 magazines (Originally for Glock 22). I consider this advantageous because it allows you to use any glock .40 caliber magazine besides the G27.

Glock 23
-the glock 23 is in excellent condition and has a new set of Trijicon night sights, a new steel recoil spring as well as a new set of Tallon Grips. I will include original sights and spring

Mags
-All magazines are glock brand magazines. 6 are glock 23 mags (two with extensions) and one is a 10 round glock 22 mag that came with the sub2k

I value everything as follows

Kel-Tec Sub2k -$475
Glock 23 -$515
Magazines-$20 each ($140)

It features CZ's omega trigger system allowing you to switch between a deckocker or a safety to carry cocked and locked, both ambidextrous.  It's a very soft shooter thanks to its low bore axis and has a very smooth double action pull for an accurate first shot and light single action pull for on point subsequent shots. Comes with everything from the factory  (2 mags, case, paperwork, etc).  This gun was carried and does show minor holster wear but is functionally perfect. Estimated round count: 400 rounds.

Not looking for anything in particular, but no long guns unless it's one heck of an AR build. Feel free to ask any questions. Round count is approximately 400rds down range with not one hiccup. I'm gonna go ahead and have the feed ramp polished this week. I know what this beauty is worth so all low ball offers will be ignored. It comes in the original blue Springfield box w/paperwork and all the gear from the factory as well. I have had several offers but nothing that has really grabbed me. Thanks!"

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Beretta Super Sport .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle. This Beretta has never been officially imported into the United States. The very few examples of this rifle found here in the USA have either been brought back by returning military personal who were deployed in Europe, or by people who were returning to, or entering into, the USA from a European country.

Beretta manufactured this rifle model from the mid 1950’s until the mid / late 1960’s. Beretta’s XX proof mark, located on the barrel where it joins the receiver, indicates that this particular rifle was manufactured in 1964.

There were two other .22 caliber rifles manufactured by Beretta during this time. They were the Olympia, and the Sport Models. The Super Sport Model was designed for special heavy service in target shooting having a much more robust walnut stock with a large checkered fore end, heavy pistol grip, specially shaped cheek rest, and longer barrel than that of the Sport Model. This rifle is in outstanding condition only showing some handling marks on the stock. I would rate the metal finish at 95+%. This is truly a rare, and difficult to find, rifle that would enhance any firearm collection, and a great one to shoot and enjoy.

I have for sale a like-new and well-cared for P238 (black nitron finish) with a black Hogue wrap around rubber grip. Only selling because I don't need two! 

Comes with:

Hogue rubber wrap around grip
Sig's factory night sights (glow brightly in the dark)
Sig factory six-round magazine (1)
Sig OWB polymer holster
Sig original plastic grip panels
Sig SAUER hard case.

The pistol is very clean both inside as out. The frame looks the way it did the day I got it. Slide is in excellent shape as well with no missing finish, no dings or scratches. The barrel has normal Sig swirls and a bit of wear on the barrel lug, though nothing out of the ordinary. Inside of the barrel looks great. I would rate the gun at a 9.5/10 - it's only fault is a missing grip screw (that does not effect grip performance).

I am the original owner and bought the gun new in April of 2012. The pistol has 250 flawless rounds through it - both (Winchester) FMJs and (Hornady Critical Defense) - and I have had zero extraction issues with it. 

Price drop to: $520 (from $550). Can meet whenever works for you.

This has been used twice. As I mentioned before, I've noticed the 10/22 needs to be fed more ammo, so I'm switching up to the BX-25's, but don't want these to just sit in a corner, when they can be doing someone some good. 

In addition, I just purchased a .223 and I'm not a big Magpul fanboy. WIth the gun, came a free G2 PMAG. I'm not going to use it (going to use Troy Battlemags instead). I was going to just throw it out, but thought that I'd include it with this auction for $0, just in the off chance the successful bidder for the Ruger mags also happens to have a black gun. If you don't - you can throw it out if you'd like. You're not out anything, I'm not charging you for it. 

Speaking of not charging, I'm going to ship this for free as well! (USPS flat rate). 

Pretty good deal, I think. 

Send me an email about payment. Cash, money order, or check accepted for payment. If you have any other quick, discreet payment ideas, email me. 

Thanks!"
