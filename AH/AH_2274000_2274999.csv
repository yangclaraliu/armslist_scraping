I've got a lot of my Father's old collection.  He was amassing one of every conflicts main rifles, it seems.  These are the ones I have left and intend to sell/trade.  I'm much more interested in a trade for a classic car or truck.  My daughter is beginning to drive and she loves muscle cars and vintage rides as much as I do.  Her favorite is the 2nd Generation Camaros with the 350 not the 305 (engine is Dad's preference),  Please take a look and contact me.  I'm a reasonable guy, but know what all these long guns are worth.

All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts."

I have used it for two days of hunting and two days at the range.  Other than that it has been sitting in my moisture controlled safe at home.  It is in excellent shape, no defects with perfectly functioning illumination.  The illumination setting is adjustable and does not drown out the FOV in daylight.  It comes in the original box with original paperwork, sun shade, scope cover.  The forever warranty is transferrable per the Burris website- great warranty!.  There is a Butler Creek flip cap on the sunshade that may take some effort to remove if it is not needed.  

Additional Info from the Burris website:
From tactical teams to competition shooters, the XTR scopes have earned a strong reputation. From their crisp, clear optics and versatile Gen2 Ballistic reticles to their rugged, feature-rich construction, the Burris XTR riflescopes are in high demand.
The brightness and resolution are the result of extra-large, premium lenses with index-matched HiLume multi-coatings. Their ruggedness comes from tube walls that are 25% thicker for more strength. The double-force spring suspension system guarantees perfect tracking and repeatable accuracy. For long range precision, the XTR scopes are equipped with a side turret parallax adjustment system. Both the 1x-4x XTR and the 1.5x-6x XTR include illuminated reticle systems featuring the proprietary XTR Ballistic reticle that can handle anything from CQB to long- distance target engagements.
XTRs are made in America and come with a Forever Warranty.

Burris has gone to extremes to engineer the ultimate in high-performance optics — XTR Xtreme Tactical Riflescopes. Extra-large, ultra-premium lenses produce unsurpassed resolution, clarity, and brightness. Index-matched HiLume multicoating boosts clarity and, enhanced with StormCoat, causes water to bead and shed off for a clearer view when water drops are present. All XTR scope tubes are 30mm, resulting in 25% thicker main tubes and 42% more strength. Double-force coil spring suspension locks the inner tube in place for unfailing accuracy. XTRs also feature side turret-mounted parallax adjustment systems. The 1.5X-6X XTR — equipped with the innovative XTR Ballistic 7.62 Reticle — represents the state of the art in tactical optics.

All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts."

I am selling my custom rifle mid build. I cannot seem to scrape the money together to finish and there are bills to pay now. It has been sitting in the corner of my closet for over a year and has been collecting dust. I was hoping that it could bring someone else happiness. 

This is a fully custom rig with ZERO rounds though it. It is untouched I never even shot it. I am selling it as a complete barreled action but I will be including a Remington plastic fantastic stock with a blind magazine in case you just have to go shoot it. 

This was built to be a long range .308 with 1000+ yard sub moa capability. I am sure it would do just fine. It is a tank. 

Includes:

Customized Remington 700 Short Action with weigth saving cuts
Custom fluted .308 Bolt
Massive Oversized recoil lug Probably Badger or similar
Remington Tuned Trigger
20 MOA  Picatinny  Rail
Super Heavy Duty Scott Rings
Spring/ Magazine Follower
Super Heavy Profile Barrel with custom fluting. I designed the fluting and it was supposed to be the signature look of the gun. The cuts decrease in length to give the illusion of the barrel tapering when it does not. 
Barrel is Stainless Steel with threaded end 5/8 x 24 tpi
JPI .30 Cal Muzzle Brake with custom indexing washer
Everything is Duracoated Matt Black and you can see a few marks where it has been bumped during moving.
Remington Plastic Fantastic Stock

I set the action in a short action stock for pics so you could see what she looks like mounted and ready to go. I am not selling this stock. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Email is the best way. REDACTED We can exchange phone numbers after 

I will meet within 30 miles of Area code 31015 or I will ship to the FFL of your choice on your dime

I am asking $2200 cash but I am willing to listen to all offers. Please do not hesitate to make an offer. No parting out and everything is first come first serve. No parting out and everything is first come first serve. 

Thanks so much for looking,

Both guns are brand new. when I test fired the REM/870 I did it with the barrel that came stock on it ( it cycled flawlessly ) so BBL is Brand new and I gave it a thorough cleaning afterward so it is just as new as it was when it came from the factory. The Hi-Point paperwork says there were 10 rds. fired through it for function / accuracy test. There is a check next to the box there so I assume that means it passed all tests. I want a Saiga in 7.62/39 or 308. will consider a 5.56 depending on ammo trade and how many magz it comes with, etc. I just really want another AK platform rifle as I sold my AKM in Jan '12 and I have serious seller's remorse. I will definitely make the deal worth your while, you will def. be satisfied.

Umbrella Corp doesn't make polymer ones (I got a couple questions from folks recently).

Update: I'm also willing to disassemble this rifle and sell it as complete lower + stripped upper for $650. I will not sell the receivers separately , they have to stick together :-)
If you're looking at this listing, you probably already know about Umbrella Corporation Weapons Research Group products. The quality and the scarcity. 

I built this rifle off of a complete huucr factory cerakoted receiver set that I picked up in the brief moment they were available. All of the flat dark earth furniture is genuine made in the USA Magpul MOE,  except the grip which is Umbrella Corp's specially designed grip 23. 

Barrel is a 16 inch DTI super light weight profile chrome lined with f-marked fsb and a standard 1:9 twist rate and a2 flash hider. This is a mid length gas system which significantly reduces felt recoil, muzzle rise, and internal wear.

The bolt carrier group is premium, a Rubber City Armory black nitride infused full auto profile bcg,  featuring a carpenter 158 shot peened bolt. The black nitride coating makes it cycle super smooth, easy to clean, and can be run dry for thousands of rounds if need be.

I've got a total of 84 rounds down the pipe now, without a single failure ( almost to the official ""breaking in"" round count).

There are some natural signs of wear around the brass deflector where the hot shells will leave their mark on any rifle. 

Includes two FDE windowed 30 round pmags. Can be picked up face to face near pittsburgh with bill of sale, or shipped to the ffl of your choice for $25.

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it."

The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle.

Now, more about the firearm itself:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

This is not one of those picky 1911's you hear about.
Blued finish has some wear on the corners, a bit of a slide stop scratch, but is in pretty good shape for it's age. I've never carried it, just toted it back and forth from the range wrapped in a silicone rag in it's case.
Has installed: an STI short trigger, Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight, Springfield adjustable rear sight.
Original rear Novak sight and trigger included.
Whoever owned it before me had thin grips installed on it, and from the looks of it, they filed down the grip screw bushings rather than replace them. I bought a set of bushings, but the old ones work fine, so I haven't gotten around to it. New bushings included, as well as the thin grips, and the original Springfield grips, in addition to the snazzy grips that are on it now.
Has the box, brush, and owner's manual, comes with two Colt marked mags.

I have for sale a Just Right JRC-9 9mm carbine, This carbine takes all 9mm Glock magazines (17, 19, 26) it also accepts the 33 round box magazines and the 50 round drums

The gun is in excellent condition, and has seen 400rds over its lifetime, I bought this rifle over the summer for more than I should have paid at the time (later learning that the MSRP for the gun was much lower) and even though I had the funds for it then, being a gunsmithing student, I need funds for my tools now and reluctantly have to part with some toys.

To the buyer:
I will require either a permit to purchase or carry permit in conjunction with a valid drivers license or state ID, I also will write up a complete bill of sale with the transaction. Lastly, as I live both in Pine City and in the Eastern Twin Cities I am willing to drive almost any stretch to meet along that route.

The gun will come as pictured fitted with the Hogue grip and the Magpul Back Up Sights, I will also include two (2) 33rd magazines with the purchase."

This is a very lightly used AR-15, has but maybe 100 rounds through it. I bought it but need the money to pay some bills. 

This gun includes a FREE FLOAT rail as well as a Magpul MIAD grip. This is a sweet deal because this gun is custom to the top. The lettering on the lower has custom red inlay making it look real SWEET. The Free Float rail allows for greater accuracy by not adding negative pressure to the barrel. The barrel is crome lined and it has a 1x7 twist rate, which allows for heavier bullets up to 90 gr. Also is included is 2 30 round PMAGs.

The stock can be upgraded for an extra charge of 90$ to Magpul STR. (total gun price of 765)

931,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2274931,For Sale/Trade:  1967 Chevy C10 Automatic (Straight 6),"Shreveport LA, East Texas, Texas","$ 2,500","Listed On: Tuesday, October 29, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I got this truck to restore/learn on but lost interest after a few months.  It was used as a farm truck before I got it so it was pretty beat up but has cleaned up well.  The truck runs but is not street legal yet, needs tail lights and windshield wipers fixed (I think it’s electrical) and possibly some body work.

This is the perfect project truck for those with the time and knack for it.  I’ve started it for you:
-installed new brakes and master cylinder
-new fuel pump	
-cleaned the carburetor
-installed new cedar bed (could use a refinish)
-put in a new mirrors, dash panel, alternator, “new” old windshield (minor chip on passenger side) and vent glass, and a dozen other little minor fixes and changes here and there.

TITLE ISSUE:  I bought this truck in TX and have a TX title for it.  At the time I didn’t realize I would also need a Bill of Sale in order to register in LA and failed to get one from the seller.  I tried to overcome this problem by having a buddy of mine sign the title then sign a BOS over to me.  However LA still wants a BOS from the original owner to my friend.  If sold back to a TX resident there won't be any problems.  If sold to a LA resident I know there are ways around this problem, especially with an older vehicle, but I don’t care to take the time to do that.  I will give you all the paperwork that I have and we will do a BOS to get it transferred to you.

I’m at Barksdale Air Force Base (Shreveport Area).  Since the truck is not yet street legal, it will need to be towed.  I can tow it to a location in the area or I get you on base to pick it up.

My wife really wants this truck gone and I’m ready to move on to other projects.  The cash value I put on this is $2500 but I’ll entertain ANY offers.  If interested, just message me and we can talk/text. REDACTED

986,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2274986,For Sale/Trade:  1967 CHEVY C10 AUTOMATIC (STRAIGHT 6),"Barksdale AFB, Shreveport, Louisiana","$ 2,500","Listed On: Tuesday, October 29, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I got this truck to restore/learn on but lost interest after a few months. It was used as a farm truck before I got it so it was pretty beat up but has cleaned up well. The truck runs but is not street legal yet, needs tail lights and windshield wipers fixed (I think it’s electrical) and possibly some body work.

This is the perfect project truck for those with the time and knack for it. I’ve started it for you:
-installed new brakes and master cylinder
-new fuel pump	
-cleaned the carburetor
-installed new cedar bed (could use a refinish)
-put in a new mirrors, dash panel, alternator, “new” old windshield (minor chip on passenger side) and vent glass, and a dozen other little minor fixes and changes here and there.

TITLE ISSUE: I bought this truck in TX and have a TX title for it. At the time I didn’t realize I would also need a Bill of Sale in order to register in LA and failed to get one from the seller. I tried to overcome this problem by having a buddy of mine sign the title then sign a BOS over to me. However LA still wants a BOS from the original owner to my friend. If sold back to a TX resident there won't be any problems. If sold to a LA resident I know there are ways around this problem, especially with an older vehicle, but I don’t care to take the time to do that. I will give you all the paperwork that I have and we will do a BOS to get it transferred to you.

I’m at Barksdale Air Force Base (Shreveport Area). Since the truck is not yet street legal, it will need to be towed. I can tow it to a location in the area or I get you on base to pick it up.

My wife really wants this truck gone and I’m ready to move on to other projects. The cash value I put on this is $2500 but I’ll entertain ANY offers. If interested, just message me and we can talk/text. 318-538-1027
