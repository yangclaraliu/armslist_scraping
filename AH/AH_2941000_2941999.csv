A small child was killed due to a rifle firing, caused by simply lifting on the bolt while the safety was engaged.

All Remington Model 700 and Model 7 rifles built between May 2006 and April 2014 are being recalled. Seems there was an over application of a certain bonding agent when assembling the XMP triggers. (Most SPS, Varmint, and other ""tactical"" models). The rifle is not considered drop/bump proof. A small child was killed due to a rifle firing, caused by simply lifting on the bolt while the safety was engaged. 

It is ILLEGAL to sell a known defective, unsafe firearm. They have been pulled from store shelves. Buyer and seller beware!

I keep getting flagged as a ""scam"". I'm guessing it's by those trying to sell a rifle, and they don't want this information out???"

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.

It is complete with dust cover, cleaning rod, and bayonet.  The Mum has not been ground or struck!  All parts have matching build numbers except for the bolt, which matches itself.  From the research I have done, this rifle appears to have been made around 1917.  It is in good condition with a good bore.  There is some pitting on the receiver, but it's nothing major.  The finish is really nice under the dust cover, which leads me to believe that the dust cover has been on it since it was brought back and not added later.  The bayonet shows signs of heavy rust on the hilt.  It was apparently cleaned at some point.  This rifle is still chambered in 6.5x50."

Anyways I picked up a brand new Glock 26 two weeks ago and it has the ""New Glock"" slide finish which is a flat matte dull kind of black. This is in the one at the top of the picture below that I DO NOT like. There is nothing wrong with this new finish except that it stands out like a hooker in church next to my other five Glocks. I was wanting to trade my new and never fired Glock 26 for your older Glock 26 with the older textured finish as long as it's in pretty good condition. I'm very OCD and take extremely good care of my pistols. I just want all my Glocks to match."

A small child was killed due to a rifle firing, caused by simply lifting on the bolt while the safety was engaged.

The Rifle is a Chinese Polytech m1a side stamped. The rifle was shipped to Warbird Custom Guns http://www.warbirdscustomguns.com/ and had several things done to it. First I had the Polytech bolt replace with a complete LRB bolt from LRB arms. http://www.lrbarms.com/m14parts.html do some research and you will find this bolt is the foremost bolt for the M1a currently. I also had Tim at Warbirds install new American made springs and a sadlak National Match spring guide. I also had him drill a USGI connector lock hole so the stock that the M1a For sits in would perform flawlessly. The M1A sits in a J tactical Rogue bullpup chassis.  front sight base made by Smith Enterprises. I attached a PWS PRC muzzle brake to the front. http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=127 between the muzzle brake and the chassis system the rifle kicks about as much as a quality AK47. I also have a grip pod system on the front rail. http://www.grippod.com/. Rifle fuctions flawlessly I have shot about 300 rounds of foreign nato 7.62x51 with 0 malfunctions.

Introducing the XD-S. Superior innovation in the palm of your hand. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand. At only 1 wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a .45 with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability.

Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

I am going to regret this one for sure. 

 This little Winchester 62-A was made in 1937 according to the data base I looked in. It's a C&R obviously. The action extremely smooth is like all of these, and it's the sweetest carrying and shooting .22 I have ever owned. When I got it, my first shot with it was at an old Coke can at 100 yards, and I hit it smack in the middle. It's frankly just hard to miss with it, If I still lived back east and could squirrel hunt, there is no was I'd sell it. But where I live now, the squirrels are few and far between, and I haven't shot it in a year. I'm no longer collecting Winchesters, and other than a beat up old '94 this is the last one I have. There is a reason for it being the last one to go, lol.

 Metal is a very smooth brown/blue patina, with no pitting or damage that I can see. It's a really attractive rifle and looks better than my cell phone photos show. The bore is great, and like I said, it is accurate. much more accurate than it has a right to be.
 I think the finish on the forearm is original, and very nice. 

These shoot .22 S, L, and LR interchangeably. Lol, when shooting Shorts in it, you don't even need ear protection. Sounds like an air rifle! It has digested every type of ammunition I have ever put through it without a hiccup, and is a truly fine rifle. One of John Browning's best designs in my opinion.

 Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and we can arrange for you to see it here in Santa Fe. If you are too far away to come in person, I can ship to an FFL or a C&R. If you live in NM, I can ship to you without an FFL. You would just need to send me your NM Drivers License.

Excellent condition.  Ammo and carrying case included. America's favorite lever-action keeps advancing. This time with a big-loop lever for faster, more efficent chambering and ejection with gloves on, plus striking laminated woodwork that improves weather resistance and adds aesthetic appeal. Its 18½"" barrel is handy in the brush, and the full-length magazine tube gives you six rounds of 30-30 Win."
