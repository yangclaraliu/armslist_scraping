the law of our Constitution that states in no uncertain terms that we as a people are responsibly to take control and remove all parties of a facist tyrannical  government and insert a new governing body voted by the people for the people. It is your duty or you are breaking the Law. And if there is no disclosure in voting in these 2nd amendment infringing laws then Oregonians we must act first!! We are a precursor state !!! A testing state if it happens here it will serve as a model to make it happen in all states I am not going to be that Model I am not going to lay down and cower and give up my right that so many of my blood and kin and yours alike friends family neighbors husbands wives, and sons and daughters have paid for with there lives !!! what a dishonor!! Stand now and tell your local and state law makers that if this law should happen to pass that you will join in the removal of all parties regardless of there stand because of this anonymity and we will vote a totally new governing body into the state capitol!! And that we will be the model for America!!  The model that shows we will not Stand for Tierney .

Brand New At Dealer Cost,"Spencer NY, New York, United States","$ 3,000","Listed On: Thursday, March 13, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I am a property owner in Ithaca and I came across the opportunity to purchase a ton of brand new solar hot water heating equipment from a company that went out of business. I am not looking to make money on this. I am only looking to sell what I don't need.

I am ONLY looking to sell 4 systems out of the lot of equipment. 3 of the systems are pretty much complete but the 4th will be missing a pump station controller because I don't have enough to go around. Luckily they are readily available and none of the equipment is proprietary.
The rest of the lot I am keeping.

A complete solar hot water system will include the following which are all made by Free Hot Water out of Palo Alto California;
2 -- 5000 series solar collectors
1 -- S400 L 79 gallon tank
1 -- TDC3 Pump station controller
1 -- Expansion tank
1 -- Water tempering valve
1 -- Air vent
1 -- Single line pump station
1 -- Roof flashing
2 -- Tubes of calk
Misc. fittings
Mounting hardware for solar panels (I'm not yet sure how they mount or which hardware you'll need but there is a lot of mounting hardware there. I'm pretty sure I have what you will need.)

The owner of the defunct company I am purchasing this equipment from told me they would sell this set up for $8000 not including tax or installation. Wholesale/dealer cost on all of this, NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING OR TAX is OVER $3500. I was told shipping would be another $500 - $1000 on top of that. But keep in mind, the average consumer would have to go through a dealer and there is no way to get any of this at dealer cost, without tax, without installation, and without shipping. This is truly one of those very rare situations to save a bundle of cash.

For the above system I am asking $3000.

I am not an expert in this field but from what I have learned this set up is perfect for a household or apartment building for 1 -- 8 occupants. If there are more people you could either go with more panels or let your backup water heater provide the extra hot water. Either way using this solar hot water system will definitely save you money and will probably pay for itself in just a couple years.

Please feel free to email me. I have specs on the materials, more photos and more info."

I have for sale or trade a rare little old pistol. It is a 25 acp ""MAB"" French made pistol. It is one of the more rare ones that came with the nickel finish instead of regular blued. It also comes with the original Leather holster for it and one factory 6 rd mag. The gun has definitely seen better days and has a large amount of wear but shoots great. she might not be the prettiest example of these but it shot fine for me with no hitches (except the one dud round i had haha). This pistol more specifically is a Model A, 2nd variant. Dating these is really difficult due to a lack of any real records, but this is one of the older models because it is a variant 2 and a model A. This appears to be all original except one screw on the grips looks to have been replaced. Because the value for these is all over the board I think my asking price is fair. I would also trade for a bunch of different kinds of guns, primarily pistols though. Please dont lowball or try and waste our times with needless comments. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). Please message with any offers or questions and I will try and respond as soon as I can! I can get more pictures as well if you desire.

I won this late last year and hoped they would make it closer to me but after factoring in the drive time/plane ride, it wouldn’t make financial sense for me. I would much rather it be used by someone than just go to waste sitting in my in box. 

This voucher is for Kinetic Carbine or Kinetic Pistol Course. He will also do a private class but I just don’t have 5 people who want to train. 

Although the voucher does have dates for classes to pick (from late last year), the trainer has said its good for anytime this year and I just followed up with him to confirm the voucher is transferable. 

Quotes from the email: 
My schedule is pretty much booked through November, if you decide to do a private class. You are welcome to wait it out and see my 2014 schedule as well. 


the voucher is yours to do with however you like. If you want to give it to someone else then that’s fine with me.

It comes in the original box with one colt magazine and the bore rod and brush.  These are excellent build guns because they are made identical to the Colt 1911a1 out of recycled railroad ties which are much harder steel than other 1911's.  Many Race guns are made from Norinco frames.  They are known for their durability.

-Unissued would be ideal
-Covered in cosmoline is fine since I will need to inspect and field strip it upon receiving gun
-Factory integrated safety and longer grip are partial reasons for wanting YUGO M57. If you know of a stronger,better made Tokarev, please let me know. I've had TOKS pop and burn out on me before but never an M57. I'd like a pair if it helps with the cost.
I will be taking to the range regularly so please as solid as possible.
I also have started to notice the PPS43C style Tokarevs and would like to get a good deal on one of those also. Someone please help! I like the cheap hot surplus ammo as well. Make me a TOK Package. Thanks
I like to use my firearms as well as admire their beauty so these items need to be sound  and solid for I value my limbs and senses as well.
Thank you much."

Includes lighted reticle with red or green illumination, and 5 brightness settings, all on one easy knob.  Turn to Off position for unlit black reticle.  Reticle is a CQ close quarters donut design, and includes range and bullet drop estimation.  Eye relief is just right for most AR-15 style rifles.  The view is best for ranges of 10 to 200 yards.

Unit is lightly used and works perfectly.  No scratches on the optical surfaces, and the body still looks brand new as well.  Includes battery, sunshade, integrated covers, and Burris AR-QD Quick Detach mount.  Comes with everything you need to use it today on your rifle, as long as you have a little bit of empty Picatinny rail.  

Sight plus mount sell for $438 total on Midway.  I'm asking $330 for mine.  Cash only, pickup only, in northern burbs area (glenview/northbrook).

Oh, and to those people who think the reticle in these sights is canted to the side:  it's an illusion.  It's the slope of the prism - that's how they work.  To be sure, switch the rifle to your left shoulder and look through it with your left eye.  If you thought it was canted before, it should appear canted the opposite way now.  It makes no difference anyway.  I shot tight groups with this sight at 75 yd."

The Mossberg 715T is a great little plinker with a tactical look modeled after the AR15, it's a lot of fun to shoot and has no problems with the federal or cci ammo I have shot out of it. I have around 200 rounds shot through the rifle so it's pretty new.
Included: Scope, Laser, Flashlight, 10 Round Mag, and Carrying case.

I am open to trades for other rifles, or shotguns. Please feel free to send me any offers I'm very open."
