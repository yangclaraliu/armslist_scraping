Each can contains 550 rds. One is open, the other has never been opened. The cans are full of rounds loaded on 10 rd. stripper clips. I have shot approx. 80-100 rounds of the opened can, so the total for purchase is approx. 1,000. I say approximate due to the fact the stripper clips are all individually wrapped in brown paper and tightly packed in the can. I have weighed the full unopened can and the open can and calculated that about 80-100 rounds are gone, so purchaser could possibly get a few more or a few less than the 1,000 rd. total. The unopened can has 550 rds. Also, there are 60 rds. loose, not on stripper clips in the open can. My numbers are as honest as I can be.

Chinese Copper Washed AP steel core ammo. Steel case copper washed and very very effective. So effective Clinton signed a ban on future imports of it in 1994. Get it while you can. The steel core stuff has been classified as AP by the ATF and will never be imported again. Cases have sealed primers and sealant at bullet base.

NEW XDS9 (9mm), In stock and FACTORY REPAIRED WITH NEW COMPONENTS. Yes, this pistol comes from Springfield with the recall work completed. These are the latest and greatest, fixed by the factory. Received back on 11/8. Hard case, manual and (2) 7 round magazines.

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol. Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) 

Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

The M&P15T (the ""T"" stands for Tactical) is Smith & Wesson's most expensive and best optioned model in their AR15 model range. The barrel is free-floated for great accuracy, and chrome-lined for great durability and long life. The Eotech holographic weapon sight alone costs about $500, is compatible with night vision devices, and is simply the best weapon optic on the market today. The Surefire M951 weapon mounted light system costs about $400. It has a pressure switch pad that fits into the Tango Down vertical fore grip, so a squeeze of the grip turns the light, with it's blinding 150 lumens, on."

I took a brand new Marlin 795 and put it inside of a almost new Echo 1 H&K G36c airsoft body. I had seen these done a few times, but usually with glue and epoxy all over it. This takes down using the standard pins as it normally would, no epoxy or glue, just hand made parts and fabrication. The charging handle works as it normally would on a real G36, actually operating the slide and ejection port. The trigger is handmade to match the real thing, and works great. It still uses the stock 10rnd Marlin 795 magazines through the hole where the real mag would go, and an airsoft mag was modified to fit over it and clip in like normal to make it all look right. The folding stock works and is easily removable. THIS IS NOT A SBR THOUGH. The barrel is full length still, and with stock folded or removed the muzzle to butt length is still over federal regs. The barrel is threaded at the end, but the suppressor on the end is actually a mock airsoft suppressor bored on one end and fits over backwards, (the barrel goes all the way through and fits flush at the muzzle when screwed on tight). I have received many compliments on this gun on and off the range. It's pretty quick to take down and put back together. in fact it can only go one way, so it's fool proof. When it was built it was very reliable, but because it's so fun to shoot, the mags need new springs and the ejector on the Marlin could use replacing, THATS IT. Both very cheap and easy things to do. 

For $400, it comes with everything seen in pics. 911 tactical bag which fits it perfect, red dot sight, and collapsible bipod."

Shot only 2-300 FMJ rounds. It is a medium sized 9mm pistol. It is well suited for CCW use.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. 

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

This is a complete package for a piston driven system rifle. I built this rifle in 2011 to be used for competition. The recent birth of my son has put any thoughts of competing on hiatus for an extended period of time. This is a VERY accurate, VERY high speed rifle, with the intention of being nearly completely ambidextrous. It was built to fire fast and with little to no recoil. It literally just ""pops"" in your hands, and will put little holes on paper, right next to each other, as fast as you can pull the trigger. I know a lot of people say their rifles ""recoil like a .22"".. but in all honesty, my Ruger 10/22 has more recoil than this rifle. All brass lands in a neat pile about 2 feet to your 3 o'clock. I have several hundred rounds through the rifle, so it is broken in but FAR from being well used. I was ringing steel with this build as far as 540 yards as of just recently. It will devour everything from 55gr to 77gr with no problems. While the intention was for competition, I never made it beyond a few range sessions. Rather than stare at a safe queen all the time, I decided to list her up.

I used all name brand, high end parts for this build. I didn't want to leave any question to reliability or quality. This is truly breaking my heart to list this rifle up here. While I don't ""need"" to sell it, I think if I can get a fair price for it, the funds will serve my family better elsewhere.

All in all, I have well over $2,500 invested in this rifle. I'd like to see some return on my investment, but will discount based on use.

The carbine gas system is hidden inside the handguard, and a second gas block is located at the rifle-length location. The second gas block required HEAVY modification to fit the barrel at that location. 

This is the ONLY 14.5"" Dissipator I am aware of in 300Blk. I found one other 14.5"" Dissipator on another site, but he went completely different on the sights system and he built it on a 5.56...

I have over $1,200 invested in this upper and am looking at going in a new direction. This is one hellofa shooter, and was built with the intention of being used for local pig hunting. I put a few hundred rounds down the pipe, but primarily just for plinking and sighting it in.

I also have several hundred rounds of ammo available. They'll be listed for sale separately, after I'm able to go through and count them all out.

You will see it took me quite a while of planning and building to get this all done right.

Aside from some light holster wear on the barrel it is in excellent condition.  Is incredibly light and exceptionally easy to carry.  This is a Total Titanium model, 100% titanium, NOT the aluminum framed, titanium cylinder Ultra-Light model M85, MSRP is in the $600-650 range.  These are no longer in production and getting harder to find.
Here's some links to prove the price and construction:

http://www.genitron.com/Handgun/Taurus/Revolver/85-Total-Titanium/38-Spl-P/Variant-1

I'd like to trade for one of the polymer framed revolvers, either a Ruger LCR .38 or .357 or S&W Bodyguard .38 (the revolver, not the .380).  Would be a good choice if you'd like to have the same .38 snub nosed gun but with the easier to shoot SA/DA trigger compared to the DAO.  Would also like a Beretta Nano or Kahr CM9 or CW9.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $450 obo.  Will include a fobus paddle holster and speedloader in the sale or trade.

FTF only, I live in Wichita but work in Mcpherson and can meet there if you live in the area.
