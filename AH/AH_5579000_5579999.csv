Beautiful figured stock with classic lines, 24"" barrel with hooded front sight. I removed the rear sight to clear the scope, it is included with the gun. This rifle is in absolutely flawless condition without a scratch on it. There are less than 150 rounds through the gun. I originally purchased it from a gentleman who had bought the gun and put two boxes of ammo through it at the range before losing his eyesight in his dominant eye through a workplace accident. I bought the gun with the intention of taking an elk with it. During the time I owned the gun, I put no more than 5 boxes of ammo through it sighting in the scope and shooting a few tannerite targets on BLM land outside Reno (highly recommend-- it is awesome seeing a soda can explode 350 yards away, and this rifle is up to the task). I never managed to get an elk tag, and this gun mostly sat in the safe for the 5 years i have owned it. Now I am moving the midwest where whitetail prevail and elk hunting is not in my immediate future, so I am selling it to fund a .270 or .243. Other important details: Comes with Montana leather sling and Butler creek scope covers (If you take the scope too). Custom trigger job by a smith in Sacramento. Trigger breaks like glass right at 3#. Action was also glass bedded by the gunsmith. This gun is not only presentation-grade beautiful, it is insanely accurate to boot. I am putting 3 rounds in the X ring at 200 yards off the bench and I am a lousy shot."

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo.  Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Product Name  CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Carbine w/ Muzzle Brake   SKU  08505   Firearm Type  Rifle   Purpose  Home Defense   MSRP  $999.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  20+1   Magazine Type  Double stack polymer   Frame  Fiber-reinforced polymer   Grips  Polymer, adjustable for reach to trigger   Trigger Mech  SA   Sights  Low-profile fully adjustable aperture and post, 4 rear aperture sizes   Barrel  Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 1/2x28   Barrel Length  16.2   Weight  6.06 lbs   Overall Length  36 in   Height  9.4 in   Safety  Ambidextrous thumb safety We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Bought it for a deep concealment gun which it is excellent for but just don't find myself carrying it too much so I'll let it go for my asking price. Has factory Siglite tritium night sights. Wonderful shooter once you get used to the double action only trigger. Extremely accurate and soft shooting IMO. Trigger feels about 8-9lbs but is very crisp. So far it has 400 flawless rounds through it. Cleaned after every range trip. 
It is small enough to fit in a pocket, yet the thickness makes it feel like handling a 'larger' gun. This gun would be a great carry weapon for women too and people with medium to small hands as they can almost get a full pinky grip even with the 6 round mag.
*Note* This gun is the latest model with restrike capability and was manufactured only back in April of 2016!
Comes with:
1 standard 6 round magazine
3 extended 8 round mags
Kydex IWB holster as well as factory Sig OWB paddle holster
Sig Piranha G10 grip plates (pictured) Original grips included as well
Original box and whatever papers came with it.
 
$420 cash only. No trades. Price is FIRM. Lowballers will be ignored as I am in no rush to sell this. First come first serve. I can meet Weekday evenings after 6pm around Saint Paul. On Weekends before noon if I dont decide to go to work.

It has never been carried and has been stored in my safe since its purchase. Function has been 100%.The reason for this sale is that the weapon itself is a little too large for my hands as well as being to large carry (the Glock 19 is more my size and have already purchased one). I am not looking to trade so please, do not ask. Glock MSRP is $637.00 with local store prices around the $540-560 range new, making this price better than you will find in this condition. If you plan on making an offer of $400 or less, don't bother.I have about 300 rounds of ammo to sell with it at so just ask if you are interested.Good Luck!!"
