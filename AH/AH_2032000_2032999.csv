It is heavy, around 9 pounds when loaded, it's nearly all metal.
The steel stock folds and locks up tight in closed position to form a pistol length UZI, then expands again and locks into place to form a full size rifle.
It has a foregrip with built in Bipod and also a super bright Lithium powered rail mounted flashlight with quick-release(mounts to the rail on the side of the foregrip).
It comes with a padded case and a ""bungee"" sling that clips to the swivel that is installed on the UZI. The swivel moves to two different spots on the UZI.
It has never malfunctioned ...at all... in any way; and it has zero blemishes. It is the same as new. It is a bad cat, period. I don't care about selling it, I just want to see if someone has something they want to trade that will cause me to part with it. I'll trade it for the right deal....

This is one of the earliest evolutions of the mil spec model, as evidenced by the uncut ejection port and the location of the cross cannons behind the ejection port. This particular time period is sought after by collectors and is also considered to be of higher quality than the current production mil specs.

The barrel has been upgraded to a Colt barrel and the trigger feels smoother than stock. I would guess that this gun has had a trigger job at some point, but cannot say for sure because, aside from swapping out the grips, I have made no changes/upgrades to the gun since I have owned it.

The grips are a beautiful cocobolo made from a piece of Brazilian cocobolo driftwood. I can take $40 off of the price if a buyer is not interested in these grips and would prefer black Springfield Armory plastic grips.

I have owned this pistol for about 7 years, during which time it has been fired only a few times (approx. 50 rounds fired); it performed flawlessly each time and there were no malfunctions of any kind. I am not sure what the round count on the pistol was when I took possession of it. It shows signs of use in typical places such as the all too common ""idiot mark"" and rub marks on the trigger, hammer, grip safety, and mag release. Also, the buyer of this 1911 should be pleased to find that I keep all of my firearms immaculately clean."

its owner maximum protection against accidental discharge. The North

to the firing position the cylinder rotates to the next chamber. Note: The
traditional half-cock position is to be used for loading and unloading only.

Eagle Arms ""Action Master"" .223/5.56 rifle produced in 1993, Retail then was $1075.

Factory original , unaltered rifle...20” Douglas stainless steel 1:9” twist match bbl float tube, flat top upper receiver and Natl match trigger.

Eagle Arms, back then was basically the retail outlet for Lewis Machine & Tool's AR's, which are widely regarded as some of the best.
Here is a short article about Eagle Arms:
Karl Lewis and Jim Glazier formed a company named Eagle Arms in Coal Valley Illinois
in 1986. Lewis had manufactured a wide variety of both commercial and military parts for M16 rifles, and Eagle
Arms assumed the increasingly distracting retail business from Lewis’ company, Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT).
Eagle Arms initially marketed M16 and AR15 type rifle parts. The early Stoner patents had expired, and Eagle was able to build both parts and complete rifles. In 1989 Eagle commenced production of complete rifles, with LMT serving as the major supplier.
In January 1994 Mr. Mark Westrom purchased the company.
After the purchase, he continued producing Eagle Arms EA15 rifles with a focus on high grade target rifles. The bulk of the engineering work was contracted out to Lewis Macine Tool.
In early 1995 Westrom purchased those rights, and production of ArmaLite rifles resumed in Illinois. The corporation was reorganized as ArmaLite, with Eagle Arms
converted to a division of ArmaLite. First shipments of new ArmaLite rifles began in 1995.

I contacted Armalite and furnished serial number and photos of this rifle....
**** Here is the reply from them...""Your rifle is an Action Master rifle produced in 1993, 20” Douglas stainless steel 1:9” twist match bbl float tube, flat top upper receiver and Natl match trigger.

So this is basically a 'Pre-ban' rifle that was made by LMT (Lewis Machine Tool)....If you do not know who they are....search online and you will find the quality and prices of their guns.

I got this from the original owner ...he bought it new and it has ~500 rounds thru it.

See the reviews on this same ""Action Master"" series of rifles in the 1992 American Rifleman Magazine Photos..... I have the magazine and can send pics..
This is not some mix and match AR that someone tossed together!! 
Google to see what others say online about the quality of LMT and specifically this Action Master from Eagle Arms!!

The MAS-36 is a short, carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern, rimless 7.5x54 French cartridge, a shortened version of the 7.5x57mm MAS mod. 1924 cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's FM 24/29 light machine gun. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles used, like the British SMLE rifle (rear locking lugs resistant to dirt), the US M1917 Enfield rifle (turned down bolt, peep sight), and the German Mauser (five-round box-magazine), to produce an ""ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable"" service rifle."

TACTICAL PRECISION

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment.

ONLY ONE is for sale/trade. I am keeping the other one for my Ruger 10/22 which eats this stuff like candy. This ammo is terrific for semi-auto rifles and pistols. It's 40 grain bullet and clean burning powder cycle them great without gumming up the action. 
However, I do most of my shooting with a pair of bolt action 22s that actually prefer the cheaper 36 grain copper plated Federal Champion and Remington Golden bullets.
I'll sell the whole case for $400.00, which is FAR CHEAPER than the .19 and .25 cents per round I just saw this stuff listed for from multiple internet retailers, who also charge shipping and handling further raising the price. They also limit the number of boxes you can buy. Incidentally, these were well known retailers and not entities that just popped up for the short term.
I prefer not to sell it, but would rather trade it for Federal Champion 36 grain copper plated 22LR, or I'd even consider trading for Remington Golden Bullets 22LR. That way I won't have to spend the next 6-8 months trying to replace it.
If you want a good 22LR cartridge that will cycle your semi-auto properly without gumming it up, this is it!  Make a trade or buy it outright. (trades preferred)
Trades would be: one box of FEDERAL AUTO MATCH for one box Federal Champion in either the 525 blue or 550 red box. Or, one box of auto match for one 525 round box of Remington Golden bullets 22LR"

This rifle has alot of extra stuff that cost money. I am not by any means asking more than all of it is worth. This was made to be broken down in to just 24'x12' case if preferred.

Custom Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 for sale or trade + cash.

This is a very nice .22 AR, and impresses everyone who sees it and handles it.

It is in EXCELLENT condition, and has had 175  rounds put through it, as most all .22's do. If guns were made to wear out after 5000+ rounds it would be worth nothing. Include a lifetime guarantee (doesn't matter how many owners) you can't go wrong.

It comes with:

1. Eotech Green/Red dot sight (%100 eye relief)
2. Magpul MOE adjustable stock
3. Magpul black MOE rubber buttpad
4. Magpul angled foregrip
5. Troy flip sights front and rear (orig m4 sights too)
6. Magpul rail covers (extras included)
7.KINETI-TECH barrel shroud with concave end cap and thread protector
8. GEMTECH .22 barrel extension new (can be also put on the end of Sig Mosquito 22also fully functional brand new)
9.AMMO CCI & Federal .22 lr 850 rnds (700 of which are new & sealed


All of the accessories cost $$$ not including shipping and gunsmith labor.

$650.00 is very fair for what would cost you plenty $$$ to do on your own.

Also comes with 3 25rd mags,Manual, and plano rifle case.

If you want a basic M&P 15-22 for 500, then have at it. If you want a decked out M&P 15-22 that already has tactical upgrades, so you dont have to mess with it, then this is the rifle for you.

This rifle is very accurate. Ejection issues 99% of the time is caused by the large amount of powder residue left from .22 ammo.
You must clean the chamber and the bolt face very thoroughly, in order for the rifle to function properly. This may require cleaning during shooting after a few hundred rounds. Failure to fires are generally caused by residue build-up on the bolt face where the rim of the round seats in the bolt, which keeps the round from seating completely in the bolt, causing the firing pin to not be able to fully strike the rim of the round. 22's are bad for this, as it is a dirty round.

IT ALLOWS ANYONE WITH AN AR15 LOWER, TO CONVERT THEIR GUN TO THE SAME
ARMOR PIERCING MACHINE AS FN'S PS90!! 
This is PW Arms’s AR57 Upper. The receiver and its component rails begin with a single block of Aircraft Grade 7075 T6 aluminum, rated at 83000 PSI strength. The entire upper is precision milled to within .002 tolerance. This upper is well ported for heat dissipation, and comes with an integral picatinny quad-rail system. The assembly process’s final steps include Infused Hard Coat Anodized finish on the alloy, and parkerization on steel surfaces, installation of front and rear sight area picatinny rails. GBQ Parkerizing process ensures finish durability on the steel. Barrel is 16.04 inch 4 channel fluted, free floating with open ended flash suppressor. Rate of twist is 1: 8.5 inches. Bolt is heat treated 4140 chrome alloy parkerized, like the barrel. Receiver and rail block measures just over 17 inches overall length; from the receiver back to the muzzle end, total length is 24 9/16 inches. This upper receiver comes furnished with a 3 5/8 inch Carbine buffer; owners of A2 rifles will need an AR type buffer. The most important feature of this upper, writes the factory, is its reliability. Unlike many other receivers, they continue, there is no gas system to become clogged with carbon or fouling. The chamber stays clean well beyond extended shooting sessions. Simplicity is key, they summarize, with the free sliding bolt being the only moving element. Its easy removal makes maintenance literally a snap. The AR-57 system ejects spent rounds through the lower’s magazine well, another plus! While these assemblies do not come furnished with any magazine from the factory, I am including the buyer’s choice of an FN Factory 10 rounder or 50 rounder. We might even have a 30 rounder on hand. Replacement pricing on uppers of this quality and caliber ranges upwards of $1000 per unit in many areas. FFL not Required

Stainless Steel Ruger Mini 30 Ranch series 582 in 7.62x39 with black all-weather stock. Comes with two 30-round magazines and a 5-round factory mag, and over 500 rounds of ammo in a new weatherproof ammo box (mix of brass and steel). Has a Weaver Marksman 4x scope on it with black rings (the scope has seen extensive use on several of my rifles so it's in the roughest shape, but the sights are clear and crisp). I'll throw in a second set of silver scope rings with the rifle.  (I can mount a like-new Simmons Blazer 3-9x40 instead of the Weaver, or include it with the package for an extra fee). Finally, I'm including a leather rifle bag that's quilted on the inside and fits the rifle perfectly without the scope mounted. 

I'm also including a Tapco Intrafuse tactical stock with both angled and straight 6-position extendable butt, and rails top and bottom to mount your favorite accessories. Pistol grip has a compartment for batteries, small tools, whatever. The SigSauer Mako light foregrip pictured is NOT included.

The rifle's been to the range a few times for breaking in, but it's in great condition and ready to visit the range with you, protect your home, farm, or business, or take down a deer for you.

The classic look of an M-14 with the firepower of an AK-47 and the reliability and accuracy of a new Ruger Ranch rifle, plus the ability to accessorize with AR goodies."

I have a like-new Thompson rifle in .45.  It's had approximately 200 rounds fired through it, and about the same number of blanks.  It has the inside front portion of the barrel (approximately 1 1/2"") threaded for a blank attachment (not included) which doesn't affect the firing of actual rounds.  It comes with a Thompson case custom cut for the rifle and two stick magazines, a WWII sling, a WWII 5-stick magazine pouch (marked 1942, but both the sling and mag pouch look too good to be actual World War 2 era so I suspect they're reproductions), and 7 30-round stick magazines and a bolt-removal tool.  Includes lock and instruction manual.  The case foam has a cut-out for a drum magazine which I don't have.

This gun was used in WWII reenactments so has some usage wear, but it's excellent condition without any gouges or finish marring.  There is about $1400 worth of stuff in this package."

The gun also comes with a 1-8rd factory magazine, and a 1-8rd brand new Kimber Pro-Mag stainless finished magazine. Comes with the factory smooth wood grips, but it has the nicer VZ Operator II grips on it right now (brand new, cost me $60). I installed a new Smith & Alexander checkered mainspring housing (pictured but blurry) on it a few days ago (factory mainspring housing including). Plus, in addition, I'll throw in a brand new Tactical Drop Leg Holster with the gun. You must be at least 21 years old or older to trade this gun. And you must be a Kentucky resident and have a valid Kentucky Driver's License to trade with my gun. Got over $100 extras on or with the gun. Thanks for looking.
