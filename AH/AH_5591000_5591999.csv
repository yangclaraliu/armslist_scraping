The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

HistoryIn accord with it's western counterparts, the Soviet Union followed the pattern of the United States, Britain, and Germany in discontinuing the production of a long infantry rifle in favor of a shortened all purpose weapon of an intermediate barrel length, usually a barrel length of 24 to 30 inches. The Russians also issued short carbines based on this intermediate length rifle to mounted troops, crew served weapons teams and general support troops. An exhaustive series of trials and field tests lasting almost eight years (1922-1930) were conducted concerning the adoption of a modernized infantry rifle based upon the basic design of the day- the m/91 Dragoon which was nothing more than a shortened m/1891. After the general testing of a short barreled version of the m/91-30, a carbine version was decided on in 1938. The weapon was submitted to the Defense Committee on the 26th of February 1939 for approval and was accepted. (2) The rifle differed only in barrel length, stock, and handguard length, a shorter cleaning rod and rear sight size. The new carbines shortened rear sight is graduated to only 1000 meters instead of the 91-30’s 2000-meter range. The front sight assembly differed slightly in that it was a pres fit sleeve that was retained by a pin while the m/91/30's was a soldered sight base that was part of the barrel. The m/38 was in all respects a slightly modified and shortened m/91-30. It was not intended to accept a bayonet. The weapon was put into immediate production at the Izhevsk weapons manufacturing plant and the first examples were issued to troops shortly there after. The year of design and submittal for testing was done in 1938 and the initial year of production taking place the following year in 1939.Will trade for:"

(Grade 8 on the 54r.net chart). Comes complete with accessories. A short and handy mosin. Also open to trades. HistoryIn accord with it's western counterparts, the Soviet Union followed the pattern of the United States, Britain, and Germany in discontinuing the production of a long infantry rifle in favor of a shortened all purpose weapon of an intermediate barrel length, usually a barrel length of 24 to 30 inches. The Russians also issued short carbines based on this intermediate length rifle to mounted troops, crew served weapons teams and general support troops. An exhaustive series of trials and field tests lasting almost eight years (1922-1930) were conducted concerning the adoption of a modernized infantry rifle based upon the basic design of the day- the m/91 Dragoon which was nothing more than a shortened m/1891. After the general testing of a short barreled version of the m/91-30, a carbine version was decided on in 1938. The weapon was submitted to the Defense Committee on the 26th of February 1939 for approval and was accepted. (2) The rifle differed only in barrel length, stock, and handguard length, a shorter cleaning rod and rear sight size. The new carbines shortened rear sight is graduated to only 1000 meters instead of the 91-30’s 2000-meter range. The front sight assembly differed slightly in that it was a pres fit sleeve that was retained by a pin while the m/91/30's was a soldered sight base that was part of the barrel. The m/38 was in all respects a slightly modified and shortened m/91-30. It was not intended to accept a bayonet. The weapon was put into immediate production at the Izhevsk weapons manufacturing plant and the first examples were issued to troops shortly there after. The year of design and submittal for testing was done in 1938 and the initial year of production taking place the following year in 1939."

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. LAST ONE! Call ASAP to reserve.   The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul®  flip-up sights included.   The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.
