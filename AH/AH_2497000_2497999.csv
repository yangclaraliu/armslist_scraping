These Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads were designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for defense against humans. Both loads feature light weight, hollow nosed bullets, designed to mushroom dramatically at the intended impact velocities. Item # 4H will perform on humans much like our DEER GRENADE load (Item # 4F) performs on game animals. The light-for-caliber weight of these bullets, aids in reduced felt recoil, for faster follow-up shots. We've employed flash suppressed powders but, with any bullet moving this fast from typical length revolvers, there is still a decent flash in low light.

Both of these loads will also work well on light, big game such as whitetail deer.

Both of these loads are safe to use in ALL/ANY 44 mag. firearm that is in normal operating condition.

Note our real world velocities taken from my personal stock firearms. We prefer to establish our advertised velocities from over-the-counter, stock firearms, while most ammunition companies establish their published velocities from laboratory, long, test barrels, which provide false or exaggeratedly high readings. We feel that this long established practice does not give the customer a true idea of what the ammunition is doing when fired from 'real world guns' under 'real world conditions,' where these numbers really do matter.

Rifle comes with the original sling, and a Bayonet 40 rounds of military .308 and 25 rounds of .308 tracer rounds. Bore is in excellent shape! 
The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO-standard rifle grenades. 

History: The FR-8 was introduced in 1950 using left over Mauser parts after WWII came to a close and this gem lasted into the 1970's before being retired in favor of the need for an assault Rifle. The FR-8's were side lined as target / training rifles. The sights clearly show this and it is vary accurate. The rear sight is an elevation-adjustable rotary type with aperatures for 200 m (220 yd), 300 m (330 yd) and 400 m (440 yd), as well as an open ""V"" notch for 100 metres (110 yd). The front sight is elevation-adjustable via a special tool. Operation is identical to the standard Mauser design.

I have shot this At a range of 200 yards with iron sights the rounds are about 1 -2 inches off bulls eye but other wise she's a good rifle.

Imports on these rifles to the U.S. stopped about 18 years ago so this is a rare bird so to say in the U.S. Only serous collectors please Cash Only Local pick up in the Tulsa area. More photos can be taken and sent on request.

I can do two things local pick up or if you live out of state contact me and maybe we'll see what can be made in arraignments to have this shipped to you only after payment has arrived in the form of a U.S. Money Order.

News Release -- The distinctive look of the Winchester 1892 large loop carbine rifle was the dream of many young boys and old men who watched the gun being used on TV shows and in movies 50 years ago.   Watching their favorite actor handle the rifle with one hand was the envy of every want-to- be cowboy.

Winchester Repeating Arms is helping make those dreams come true with the introduction of the 1892 Large Loop Carbine back in to their rifle line for 2012.  The new rifle looks just like the original 1892 with a 20-inch button-rifled barrel and overall length of 37 ½ inches.   It features a Grade 1 walnut stock with a rich, satin finish.  The steel contoured carbine strap buttplate is quick to shoulder and protects the buttstock from damage. 

The new 1892 also features a Marble Arms front sight with brass bead and an adjustable rear sight.   The full length magazine holds 10 cartridges and the rifle is available in 4 calibers: 357 Mag., 44 Rem Mag., 44-40 Winchester and 45 Colt.   Each rifle comes with an eye-catching saddle ring.

However, the most distinguished feature of the rifle is the Large Loop Lever with radiused edges.   The lever makes it easy to cycle the rife, even with gloves on.   The 1892 will be produced in limited quantities so interested buyers need to contact their Winchester Repeating Arms dealer soon.

Improved design over the FS. Improved internals for recoil reduction, better handling of +p rounds, much better sights, better frame design, added accessory rail, and all the internals have a polymer coating, to resist rust, and sand.

Feel free to double check my math.
Gunbroker, GunsAmerica, and other related sites have this gun used for an average of $575, plus FFL and background fees, so $625.
 New is closer to $600, plus shipping, plus FFL transfer, plus background check. So closer to $660.

I'm just writing down my thought processes, so you can see my logic.
$580 for the pistol, and the 3 ""safe capacity"" magazine kits that it comes with.
$17ea for the 5x15 round magazines I have. $85 (They go for $25 new, these are used, in good condition.)
A box and a half of FMJ ammo. $20 or so.
20 rounds of Win PDX1. $25.
Hogue grip, and original grip. $15.
Used TLR-1 tactical light $75. ($150 new on Impactguns.)

Comes out to $800.
Has had half a box of ammo through it. Was cleaned, then put away."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single BRAND NEW, factory fresh and VERY hard to find Bushmaster A3 Gas Piston-Operated AR-15 Rifle! These awesome rifles are no longer being manufactured, making every one a collector’s gun! This gun is crafted with aircraft-grade aluminum for the upper and lower receivers, and ships with a large 30-round magazine!

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell QUICKLY for just $1,399.00 (cash price).

The Bushmaster gas piston system rifles bring new levels of reliability to the AR-15 type rifle platform by eliminating carbon build up, gas leaks and heat within the upper receiver. The gas piston system operates by tapping gas pressure off the barrel, much like the systems found on the AK-47 and FAL. Functions with a wider range of ammunition – less gas pressure – lower cyclic rate. Offers improved reliability and control, with cleaner operation and reduced recoil. Keeps carbon build up and powder residue from reaching and fouling the upper receiver and bolt carrier. A detented plug in the gas block allows easy cleaning of the system’s hard chrome plated piston. Shipped with operation and safety manual, 30 round magazine and black web sling. One year Bushmaster warranty.

This pistol has been meticulously maintained.  Has been my daily carry since purchased on 8/30/2013.  I would safely estimate 400 or so rounds down the tube with absolutely no FTE or FTF.  It has the SigLite night sights, and a P250C 13 round clip with pinky extension (my preferred way to use it).  It also comes with the factory 10 round clip for more concealed carry.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol.  Has been holstered in leather so has minimal holster wear (minor polished spots).  It is a DAO, but has a consistent trigger pull with zero stacking.  

I am NOT looking to trade.  All transactions will be FTF and will require a CPL and signing a transfer form.  Please understand, No CPL NO SALE.   I am willing to sell the holster I have with it, as these can be a bitch to find for this pistol, but that will increase the price.  $450 stand alone, or $500 with holster (holster was just under $100 new)."

The receiver and most of the bolt are captured Tula (I don't remember the year of the receiver, sorry), but the bolt connector prominently wears the circle ""R"" Remington proof, while the cocking piece is stamped with the SAKO gear.

Original cleaning rod and sling are included.

16 inch chrome hammer forged lightweight barrel made by FN with 1 in 7 twist

rifle length YHM Diamond quad rail
PWS 556 muzzle brake
Telescopic leg tension lock bipod

Magpul Bad Lever


The gun is set up well. The FSC comp keeps recoil very mild for an ar-15, and the rifle length buffer system helps as well. The scope is precise and has more than enough eye relief and is adjustable for parallax as close as ten feet away. I have these on multiple guns and they work very well. The scope sits on a riser for a good cheek weld to the stock. The 45 degree iron sights allow the user to use iron sites without removing the scope. The pistol grip provides very good grip on the gun and has internal storage, as does the stock. I have shot 160 rounds through the gun with no failures of any kind, and once sighted in the gun was grouping about an inch at 100 yards, and very very tight at 50 with groups covered by a quarter using cheap pmc brass cased 55gr and the bipod. The gun recoils very little, and impact can be observed through the scope. The FN Herstal barrel is cold hammer forged and lightweight, and the yhm diamond quad rail is very good quality, and I added an endcap as well. The lower receiver was assembled from parts by a licensed professional gunsmith about 4 months ago, and all parts were purchased new for the build. I am selling it because I don't get up to the range enough to use it to justify keeping it. The gun is a 5.56 so it can safely run 223 or 5.56"

These sell online for $420 NOT including the shipping.  Will sell for $420 in stock form (as in no sights, vertical grip or quadrail).  Another option is you may have it in stock form WITHOUT the BCG and charging handle, and will subtract $80 so cost will be $340 for the upper in stock form.

Added:  The aluminum 2-piece quadrail, removable aluminum flip-up main or back up sights, folding vertical grip.  All are new.  If you would like all 3 of those, add $100 which is less than I paid, but I will take $520 for all.  Only thing not included then would be the Vortex Strikefire in pic.  Nothing at all wrong with any of this, all new, but I decided I want to go with a stainless bull barrel for my next build.

Bolt on any lower out there and you're good-to-go!  Am flexible with how you may want it configured, but please be specific with how you want it, and how much you want to offer.

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

The primary difference between the SSAR-15 SBS™ and the SSAR-15 OGR™ is the design intent. In an effort to cater to varying consumer preferences, the SSAR-15 SBS™ is designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks. In addition, the SSAR-15 SBS™ was designed with multiple accessories in mind which will be available in the near future."
