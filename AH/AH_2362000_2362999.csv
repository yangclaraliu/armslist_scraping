This is new in box. I've openly opened it to inspect it. Has everything you would get if you ordered it from a retailer right down to the warranty cards and literature. Literally NIB right down to the same rubberband they put around the clear plastic the scope sits in in the box. 

Great scope with mildot reticle and matching turrets. Has parallax adjustment on the side. Also it is First Focal Plane. For those of you who don't know about FFP, it means that your reticle grows and shrinks as you adjust the power, so your mildots are accurate at every magnification setting instead of just one, usually the max setting. If you read reviews, most agree that it has better glass than the Vortex Viper series. Thing is built like a tank. Only reason I'm selling it is because I decided to get a higher power scope. 

MSRP on Weaver's websight is $1117.95. The cheapest I've found the scope for from a retailer is $699.99. I'm asking $600 plus shipping. If interested, I'm happy to pull it out of the box and take as many pics as you want, but it is perfectly brand new."

I have the everything it came with when new including the Owner's Manual, 2 Keys that go into the gun and disable the trigger as a safety feature. I also have a Uncle Mike's Pocket Holster and some Brand New Factory Loaded Brass Ammunition for it as well- I have 3 Boxes of Ammo including PMC Brass Full Metal Jacket Ammo and the Rest is Premium Self Defense Jacketed Hollow Point Ammunition which is Federal Hi-Shok JHP and Black Hills Gold Jacketed Hollow Points. This is a reliable and very accurate shooting gun, it has been well maintained and ready for a new home. This Gun is less than a year old, has a low round count but a few hundred rounds to ensure everything is properly seated/broken in & the gun is safe & reliable. I have left several Glock, Kimber, Springfield and other much bigger & more expensive pistols sitting at home & carried this due to the lightweight and easy concealment of this one. That shows how much I trust it, wiith my life and others. I bought this for my wife to carry but she doesn't like carrying a gun so I am going to get rid of it since I have several others and don't really need this one, it would be great for anyone to carry daily. I will include the pocket holster listed above with the gun and we can work out something on the ammunition as well- if we trade just include your spare ammo or an extra clip/magazine or something. I will be very fair with whoever I deal with, that's a promise. I also have a fairly expensive brown leather belt holster for this gun I paid almost $100 for that can let go with it for the right deal, such as a holster with your gun, extra clips/magazines, caccessories, etc. GUN WAS JUST TAKEN ALL THE WAY DOWN, PROPERLY CLEANED AND LUBRICATED- Ready to Go!!!

GUN #2- THE ALWAYS FAITHFUL HIGH CAPACITY 9MM- I have a very nice Ruger P95DC 9mm Pistol that comes with everything it came with from the factory including a High Capacity 17 Round Magazine PLUS I bought an extra and very Rare Factory Ruger 32 round High Capacity Magazine. The Original Hard Plastic Ruger Case & Owner's Manual are Included as well. I have about 25-30 9mm Hollow Point Bullets I will include with it.
This Semi-Automatic Pistol is different from most others available today because the hammer is exposed and can be used however you wish to use it, this pistol can be operated in both Single-Action and Dual Action Mode, think about a Revolver or 1911, or Sig-Sauer Semi-Auto Pistol and how you can pull the hammer back before pulling the trigger- this system is like that and offers the use of both a Single Action & Dual Action Trigger., this means you have a choice of either manually pulling the hammer back before firing to ease the trigger pull or you can pull the trigger and use a little more effort to actuate the hammer to fire the weapon. The pistol has a rare option known as a ""DE-COCKER"" which simply allows you to return the hammer to the safe position from the cocked position with the push of a button. So, no more holding the hammer with one finger and pulling the trigger with another to release the hammer and let it down slowly to the safe position. This is a very convenient system and makes operating the gun safer. If you have the hammer pulled back and ready to fire but change your mind and decide not to just press the De-Cocker Lever and it will automatically return the gun's hammer to the safe position, lowered all the way down. This is a very nice pistol with a low round count and has always been maintained very well. THESE PISTOLS ARE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST, MOST RELIABLE, EVER MADE AND YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON THEM, THE RUGER P-SERIES PISTOL IS A GREAT, RELIABLE, AND ACCURATE PISTOL THAT WILL EASILY LAST FOREVER AS LONG AS YOU MAINTAIN IT AND KEEP IT CLEAN/LUBRICATED AS I HAVE.

Features
Bushnell gets you up close and personal with the great outdoors with their diverse world of precision optics and outdoor technologies. Every Bushnell riflescope is the direct result of extensive research and design input from real hunters in real hunting environments. Whether you're hunting, target shooting, or just plinking, Bushnell's HOLOsight will definitely give you an edge. With the HOLOsight you'll be on target as soon as you raise your firearm.
Sighting through this holographic daytime optic is different than any other type of sight you've experienced; the eye relief is unlimited, and your field of view is as wide as you want it to be. Without projecting light of any kind, an illuminated circle and cross hair reticle seems to float out 50 yd from your muzzle. In a flash you can get a bead on any moving target, and your follow-up shots will come quickly and easily.


100% water, fog, & shock proof

Low battery warning and auto shut-off

40 Hour run-time on two 1.5V ""N"" type batteries

Compatible with firearms with Weaver-type mounts
Illuminated Ring & Cross Hair Reticle 
The illuminated 65 MOA circle and cross hair reticle provides rapid target acquisition. A variable rheostat provides 20 user-selectable brightness levels to ensure visibility of the reticle under any ambient lighting conditions.

New in the box and unfired.

Mid-length gas system which means the hand-guard is 2"" longer and the front sight is 2"" farther forward than the standard M4 carbine...  This makes for a longer more accurate sight radius and softer recoil...  These are not so easy to find...

1/7 twist A2 profile barrel.

Will sell upper separate for 450.00 and lower for 250.00

I'm a private collector so there is no paperwork, back-round check, or transfer fee.

I have many more larger photos to e-mail for anyone interested.

Bluebook of Gun Values regarding the sale of used firearms:

""...do not expect to walk into a gun/pawn shop or gun show and think that the proprietor/dealer/collector should pay you the retail price listed within this text for your gun(s). Resale offers on many models could be anywhere from near retail to 20%-50% less than the values listed, depending upon locality, desirability, dealer inventory, and profitability. In other words, if you want to receive 100% of the price (retail value), then you have to do 100% of the work (become the retailer, which also includes assuming 100% of the risk).""

Please keep this in mind when requesting a trade-in."
