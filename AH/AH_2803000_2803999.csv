At two-thirds the size of our BFT01- 01G hawks, the LFT01 is designed for those operators who require a more compact tool capable of devastating performance. 

The primary cutting head is razor sharp and the spike at the business end of things has a modified Tanto point specifically designed for maximum penetration. Its pommel is well suited for hammering and incorporates a large lanyard hole for the attachment of a carabineer or rope lanyard. The LFT01's ergonomic G10 handle has been designed for multiple handhold positions to suit operators, during single or double-handed use. 

Some of the tasks we expect you'll use our LFT01 for include the following: chopping, hammering, digging, cutting, as a climbing aid, defeating locks, smashing windows & windscreens and raking out their frames, puncturing steel radial tyres, smashing steel clad doors and breaking through walls including those made of brick. 

The LFT01 is constructed from D2 Tool Steel, has a robust black Teflon coating and G10 contoured handle. Our G10 grip scales are available in coyote & black and are secured with Torx screw, all steel fittings.

That is the description from the website.  I haven't used this Tomahawk at all, so it is in pretty good condition."

My price is flexible but should match what you have to offer and reflect CURRENT market prices for a used firearm. (Sandy Hook was not last week, this ain't NY, and Obama hasn't taken anyone's guns)  I have a CCW and am more than willing to sign a bill of sale.

(replaced to add scope).  Would also consider cash offers for the SKS.

I live in Knightdale and work in Durham so either or anything in between is an okay meeting place.

STOEGER / UBERTI 1873 CATTLEMAN MILLENIUM OT ""HOMBRE""  .45 COLT 

Uberti has re-created some of the special-order single action cattleman six-shooters that would have been right at home on the dangerous streets of Dodge City, Kansas.

The Uberti 1873 Cattleman series replicates many popular variations of the Colt 1873 Single Action Army, arguably the best-selling pistol ever produced.

Not long ago, an employee at Colt was looking through old invoice files and found a special order for a Colt .45 Peacemaker with a 4"" barrel, nickel finish, and ivory grips. The request, penned on stationery from the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, was from lawman Bat Masterson.

Soldiers, lawmen, and outlaws alike had a fondness for these single actions. Now you can claim your own piece of six-shooter history by ordering one of these classic Uberti revolvers for yourself.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Winchester Winder Musket chambered in .22 Short rimfire. This Winder Musket is US marked with the Flaming Bomb proof mark. It is in overall good condition. Although the barrel & receiver have been professionally refinished, the markings are still sharp and clearly visible.

The Winder musket was the brainchild of Colonel C. B. Winder, who was an advocate for marksmanship training with a rifle of similar size and weight as a military service rifle but chambered in .22 rimfire, which was both economical and suitable for indoor ranges. The Winder musket was based on the Winchester Model 1885 single shot rifle.

It was nicknamed the ""Winder Musket"" for the Lt. Col. Charles B. Winder, who collaborated with Winchester on the design. Lt. Col. Winder was a veteran of the Spanish-American War, a renowned marksman, and the very first National Guardsman in the United States to earn a military pilot's rating! This rifle is built on the 1885 low wall falling block action. 

Although it was never officially referred to as the Winder musket, the weapon was informally named in honor of Colonel C. B. Winder, and has since generally been referred to as the Winder musket.

Winder muskets were used for target and training purposes well into the early Twentieth Century. Many were purchased by the United States Ordnance and many were issued to American N.R.A. affiliated rifle clubs. The Winder musket was superseded by the 1922 Model bolt-action training rifle, and remaining Winder muskets were sold.

The action for the Winder musket was originally developed by Browning. Winchester bought the patent and manufacturing rights from Browning in 1883.

The Winder musket featured a full stock, and was chambered for .22 Short or .22 Long Rifle. It had a 28 inch barrel and an overall weight of 8.5 lbs.

This is an extremely fun 10/22 for hunting, plinking, and making your friends look bad with their .22's. It has a Boyds stock which free floats the barrel. 

The Barrel is made by Tony Kidd, arguably the best 10/22 guy out there. It is a stainless lightweight barrel. The stainless core was hand lapped and then sleeved into an anodized aluminum sleeve that adds to the rigidity while keep the weight down. This thing is a shooter!

Also has a KIDD cocking assembly with two different spring rates besides the standard included. The original ruger assembly is also included, but i dont know why you would want to put it back in.

The trigger group was modified to have an auto bolt close. if you are familiar with locking the bolt back, and releasing it. This allows you to ""slingshot"" the charging handle to close the bolt rather than fiddle with the little switch.

The bolt has been reworked by a smith who specializes in .22 bolts. It has a jeweled exposed face that looks very sharp, a radiused bolt to improve function, a pinned firing pin to insure ignition, and a sqaured bolt face to maximize accuracy.

Also has a delrin rear pin that softens the smack compared to a factory rifle when the bolt hits the metal pin. 

***Scope and Rings are NOT included, if you really want it, it will be an additional $150.00 with original box/paperwork*** I didnt want to remove it if the right buyer isnt around.

The Kahr CM9 is a small stiker-fired 9mm handgun. A long, smooth trigger makes it safe to carry but easy to shoot. The CM9 fits in a pocket without any problem. The gun holds 6+1 rounds with the flush fitting magazines (three included, with additional 7- and 8-round magazines as well). This gun is about four months old and I am the original owner. I would estimate that between 300 and 500 rounds have been shot through it. It was cleaned after each use and is in perfect working order with no cosmetic blemishes. There is a Hogue grip sleeve on it, which I'll leave on the gun. The purchaser can remove it by simply slipping it off. Also included is the box, a small hard lockable case, a pocket holster, and as I mentioned 3-6 round magazines, a 7-round magazine, and an 8-round magazine. It came with only one mag, so if you're looking to buy a new one of these this is a good deal with the mags. I'll also throw in a new box of 25 rounds of Federal Hydra-Shock hollow points. Thanks for looking."

We had quite a few of these on backorder for sometime, but have been selling them quickly since they've started coming in . We are FFL licensed and these are factory new in box, unfired firearms. I have included the factory listed features below. But to put it in perspective, these are 5.56/223, piston driven guns, making them cleaner running and more reliable than regular direct impingement ARs. But they do accept all AR mags, muzzle breaks, QD slings and any rail mountable accessories. They also give you the ability to switch calibers. And with an overall length of 26.1"", this is the smallest rifle you can own without a tax stamp, yet it still has an extremely accurate 16"" cold hammer-forged 1/7 twist chrome lined barrel. The price is $1850 cash, which is cheaper than most are asking on these used, when you can find them. We are located in Stanfield, NC and all local, state and federal laws apply. We can also ship these to a local FFL dealer if that is needed. Partial trades will also be considered. Please contact me with any interest as soon as possible, these won't last long. Thanks for your time and interest. ONE OF EACH COLOR LEFT IN STOCK, GET THEM BEFORE THEY'RE GONE!

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers."

* BUTTSTOCK: The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. 

*SIGHTS: The MBUS (Magpul Back-Up Sight), color injection molded, folding back-up sight.
The MBUS Front Sight is adjustable for elevation and fits most 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guards, but is specifically tailored to the AR15/M16 platform.

*GRIP: AFG® - Angled Fore GripCompatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

This LWRC rifle features a factory burnt bronze cerakote and Razorback engraving on the magwell.This rifle will be sure to sell out fast due to the limited edition production, factory burnt bronze cerakote and custom “Razorback” engraving.The SIX8 weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when LWRC designed the SIX8 family of weapons, they started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, LWRC designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, LWRC designed the SIX8 platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8 family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8 rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge."

Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is Noveske proprietary chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske proprietary 7 PT button. This rifling profile differs from that in the chrome lined barrel line in that the lands have a slightly more trapezoidal shape. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others."

Like new condition. Less than 50 rounds down the pipe. There is about a six month waiting list to get one of these. The only rifle above this by Springfield is the Super Match, which weighs a ton. In my opinion, this is the finest rifle Springfield makes. It's a tack driver and the trigger is amazing. It has a Leupold VX-3  Long Range 4.5 x 14 x 50mm scope. That's a 30mm tube with side focus knob. This is a $1k real deal sniper scope. The mount is an A.R.M.S. #18. Same mount as the US Military M21 Sniper Rifle. It comes with plenty of mags and several hundred rounds of ammo. This is a top of the top of the line rifle that needs nothing to compete with any rifle on the planet.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.

All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in our state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with our heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating.

Rifle has had less than 200 rounds fired since it was built.  Comes with correct bayonet, mag case, cleaning kit, oil bottle, and one magazine.  Price is 800 if you come pick it up, 825 if we meet somewhere not too far away, and 850 shipped anywhere in Ohio.  Outside of Ohio it must go to an FFL.  Yes, it is legal for me to ship a firearm to a non FFL as long as it does not cross state lines.  No trades please.  Price is firm, I will not entertain offers."

IMI ammo far exceeds US military or NATO specifications for ammunition.

And they are water resistant longer than our mil spec ammo as well. The coating used will not burn off in your bore and chamber like other brands either. The coating also aids in feeding your weapon weather in semi or full auto.

I also have 1 PSA 16"" complete upper WITH charging handle and Bolt Carrier Group. Below are the specs for the upper; it was factory installed and tested at PSA. Other than being tested at the factory the upper is completely new and unfired. It still has a coat of factory oil on it.

Price for the lower with PSA equipment is $225. Lower with the Blackhawk equipment is $250. The complete upper is $400. If you buy the upper and one of the lowers, I will throw in a brand new P-Mag 30 round mag, 40 rounds of brass cased .223 ammo, and a single point bungee sling. 

To purchase you must be at least 18 and have a valid DL or ID to prove it. FTF only, not shipping. Can meet in the Akron area. CCW (like myself) preferred. Not really looking for any trades at this time."
