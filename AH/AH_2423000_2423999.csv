Once they are finished, I generally lose interest and go on to the next project gun. But not until I am sure they are dead reliable, and make them that way. This one comes with two original magazines. Since tuning, it is dead nuts reliable with 6 rounds instead of the 5 rounds marked on it. I have hand fitted the mag as well and it works great.

What is there to say? This is a good shooting handgun that is accurate and functions perfectly. I have a bunch of these, and I have learned how to tune them to make them reliable. This is one of those. Since it has a fixed barrel it happens to also be accurate. I routinely shoot spent shotgun shells at 20-30 yards with these. 

The best part is...where else can you find a reliable, accurate semiauto pocket pistol for $75? They make a great car gun or just plink with it like I do. I had one failure to feed and that was while I was intentionally trying to limp wrist it using flat point bullets. Other than that it has been perfect. 

Contact me through Armslist and we can arrange to meet in Santa Fe any time. I will show you how to keep it running great indefinitely. These are neat little guns despite their low price. They just need some initial tweaking since they were made to be sold at a very low price point. I have done this. I have lots of very expensive handguns, but nothing puts a smile on my face more than outshooting a $500 pistol with a cheap little auto.

EOTech XPS-2 red dot sights, OPMOD EXPS-2 sights are smaller than Eotech N-cell battery red dot sights such as their popular EOTech 550 Holosight. The OPMOD red dot sight has a shortened base that only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space, compared to the 4 inch N battery sights.

OPMOD EOTech EXPS 2 red dot sights include a CR123 battery and come with a hard carrying case.

Features of Eotech OPMOD Red Dot Sights EXPS2:
•Single transverse CR123 battery to reduce sight length.
•Short base only requires 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights.
•Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring and tethered cap that achieves a better watertight seal.
•Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to cantilever over the delta ring of AR-15 type rifles.
•Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X the battery life of N cell sights.
•Side buttons with a single quick detach throw lever to fit Weaver or MIL-STD-1913 rail.
•Submersible to 33 feet.
•OPMOD Limited Lifetime Warranty
•Made in the USA.

Designed for quick tactical shooting, the Barska 1x30 M-16 electro sight riflescope is perfect for everything from targets to turkeys. The riflescope offers such features as a seven-position reticle illumination adjustment, 1/2-inch-click adjustable windage and elevation adjustments, and a removable magnification objective lens. As a result, you'll enjoy plenty of eye relief and increased shooting accuracy. The scope's multi-coated ruby lenses, meanwhile, produce sharp images with minimum glare--a must for precision aiming. And thanks to the scope's high impact rating, it's built strong to withstand high-caliber recoil shot after shot. Other features include a parallax-free image at 100 yards, a standard Weaver-style mount, a black matte finish, a tactical red illuminated cross reticle, and a five-position rheostat that allows you to make individual reticle brightness adjustments. Built to provide unlimited eye relief for such rifles as the AR-15, M-16, M-4, and SKS."

Factory Description:

The SAM7R
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

The original carrying handle and forearm grip also included. The only thing to note with this rifle is the blasphemous muzzle brake on the barrel. It was made during the ban of 1994-2004 so it would need the upper sent to a place like double star in Winchester, Ky. to have the barrel threaded and flash suppressor installed (about $100 service).

I own a few Fullfield's and can confidently say the Signature is significantly better, especially in low light. The only issue since new is it has a tiny dust spot on the inside of the lense Only at 1.5 power, size of a pen dot. It is at the VERY EDGE of the glass and again ONLY at 1.5 power. It doesn't show in your field of view unless you look for it at the edge. It never bothered me so I didn't send it to Burris. Burris will clean the dust spot off for free if you want and I have the return form to do it. However, I just never seen the need since it's only at 1.5 power and on the edge. It has a no questions asked Lifetime Warranty. It is in great condition and this is NOT a cheap scope. It sold at $400 new. (Reticle picture shows the small dot at the top edge of the reticle)""

It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to 4052136954 and we can try and make a deal.

What a name! It's based on the fact that many judges are now carrying it into the courtroom with them-and for good reason. We know of no better self-defense firearm. Whether loading all 45s-all .410s or alternating them in the cylinder, the Judge is the ultimate shotgun/revolver duo. New for 2008, we're giving you the Judge in Ultra-Lite forged alloy. You'll be amazed how light this gun is and how easy it is to tote around. Also new is the Judge 3"" Magnum. Larger and more powerful, this Judge gives you the extra firepower you need when you have to lay down the law.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

    Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
    Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

G33.STS

The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.


This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing."

Are you tired of the short charging handle that came on your new ASR 9mm, 45 or 40 rifle? 

Does your hand need a bit more to grab onto while cocking your rifle?

Does your original cocking handle pinch your little finger? 

Does your original handle scratch or wear the coating off the upper body?



 Well, I'm offering a new extended length charging/cocking handle. 

These handles are made one at a time from steel (not pot metal) and then case hardened for wear resistance. 

They offer a longer gripping length and slightly more room between the handle and the upper surface so it wont rub and wear or gall the upper.

These have been made to within .1 of an oz. of the factory original handle. 

Each handle has been tested for fit, form and function. 

As you can see in the first photo, only about half the pinky finger is on the factory handle. This puts the skin very close to the upper while racking that first round and giving the chance to pinch. 

Notice in the second photo how the entire finger is on the handle and is comfortably enough away from upper to prevent pinching.

Again, these are made one at a time so I have a limited supply of these. Get-em while they're available."

The trans oil pump is bad,  it drove great a month ago,  but I think the cold weather is making trans oil viscosity change, and car doesn't want to drive anywhere.  I started car yesterday  let it run for 30-45 minutes and it drove fine.  I came home parked it and 30 minutes later tried to drive it and nothing,  didn't want to drive anywhere.  
I am not sure if you can come drive it home or not at this point  it just needs a trans oil pump  or a new trans.  whatever is cheaper I guess.  I have a car hauler and for the right deal I can move it to your house for you ( Only after we make a deal and you posses the signed  title ) if we come come to an agreement on moving it.

Call / text me your offers  1500 is very cheap for this car.  blue books 6-7k   so its worth a repair
