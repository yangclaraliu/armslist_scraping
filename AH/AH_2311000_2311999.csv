We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters."

No, it's not all tac'd out, it's an AK47. No it doesn't carry a price tag of $1000, BUT it will do everything a $1000+ AK47 will do. The rifle is accurate and just plain works.. Reliability with these are THE best there is. The action is butter smooth, the trigger is sweet, and the sights are spot on. I inspected this one before I bought it. If you are looking for a battle rifle that is reliable, accurate, and doesn't carry too hefty of a price tag.. Check this out..

It's a bit more of a project than I was looking for. So I am trying to find it a new home. It is a decent start to a good hunting or trail truck. No solid axle front end. 
The 4x4 and 5 speed trans mission work well. The engine is the Nissan Z-24 with elec choked, carbed 4 cylinder. I am having trouble tuning it right now so let's just say it runs and drives but with limitations and a few hick-ups. It has also developed a hunger for battery power so I assume there is a grounded wire or something else drawing on the battery. 
 Somewhere along the way the top end was rebuilt. All new vac lines, hoses, plugs wires, etc. It has a new timing chain and when the carb is running right it rolls down the road nice and quiet. 
 It currently has some bald 32"" tires on it. It has a body lift which has punched a hole in the passenger floor-board. So if you fancy yourself a body work expert, this is the truck for you. It has rust on the rockers (both sides) and rust on both floor boards.

 With a jump you can drive, but...I have antique plates and no inspection sticker so if you want it, you'll have to arrange a crafty way to get get home.

 I am looking for $800.00 cash or trade for an equal valued (45cal compact, 40cal compact, or anything else in the same category. Also interested in 12g pump, 22cal replica rifles ""H&k/Walther MP5 look-alike, etc""

When nature’s toughest predators become your prey, you can trust the lightweight T/C Venture Predator to give you the concealment, ruggedness, and accuracy you need to make the perfect shot. The T/C Venture Predator rifle is available in Realtree® Advantage HD Max-1® and features T/C’s MOA accuracy guarantee. 

The Venture™ Predator offers complete concealment of the whole weapon with Realtree’s camo. A Matched Camo 3-9X40mm Scope and rings are included with this package.

The Venture Predator is a convenient “walking varminter” size, weighing in at an easy-to-carry 6.75 pounds.

On a predator hunt, where a quick follow-up shot may be required, you can’t afford a difficult bolt that could cause a  missed opportunity. The corrosion resistant-coated bolt on the Venture rifle doesn’t require a break in period and always has a smooth action.

T/C’s 5R rifling delivers superior accuracy by causing less bullet deformation, giving greater bullet stability over multiple shots.

With an MOA accuracy guarantee for all 16 available calibers, your Venture Predator is ready to take on predators from a distance.

This is a consecutive serialed pair of brand new in box Glock 22 Generation 4 pistols chambered for .40 S&W. The GLOCK 22 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this model of perfection that the majority of law enforcement across the country put their trust in every day. The Modular Back Strap design of the G22 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size, including the popular new beavertail backstrap. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

These pistols include a speed loader and ship in Glock branded padded hard cases.

Caliber: .40 S&W

Capacity: Three 15 round magazines included per

Barrel: 4.5"" Cold Hammer Forged, 1:10"" twist, polygonal rifled

I run a summer time landscaping business and have the ability to process all major credit cards on the spot. 

I bought this tractor from the original owner's widow in Pearisburg VA two years ago. This tractor features a 42"" three blade deck, cast iron 12hp Kohler engine, creeper transmission, 6 forward speeds and 2 reverse speeds. This tractor is in very good condition and is capable of running additional equipment such as roto-tillers, snow blowers and etc. Included in this sale will be all of the original owner's manuals, paperwork, original seat, new spare air filter, 3-4 extra sets of blades and I just installed a new fuel line at the beginning of the season. This tractor is estimated to have less than 200 hours of run time, this figure is based on the original owner's neighbor. Both tractors were bought at the same time and used to mow similar sized yards, only difference was the neighbor's tractor had a factory installed hour meter. Both headlight buckets have been replaced with new OEM parts. There are a few dents, dings and one long scuff on the hood from a low hanging limb.

* Glock G23 (.40 cal) gen 4 complete upper, brand new never fired.

These Glock uppers will cost you $400.00 anywhere else if you can find one, not including a mag or case.  My price on this is a STEAL !!!

***Brand new G23 mag available for an additional $40

Replace your old worn out barrel, spring, rod, etc... (upper) with this brand new complete upper that has never been fired, still has the Glock grease on it.  Or, turn your 9mm into a .40 cal.

*** Glock 19 and Glock G 23 uppers and Frames are interchangable ***

You can use this on a Glock G19 gen 4 frame and turn your 9mm into a .40 cal.  This will let you have just one frame but two diff calibers.  Use the 9mm for cheaper ammo and target practice while using the .40 cal for personal defense.

These are extremely hard to find, especially in brand new, never fired condition !!!

I'm asking $1900 obo for just the upper, if you would like a complete rifle lets talk.

Trades:  I'm looking for unique or military rifles for my collection, ie: Scar, ACR, FN, SAS, SPS or ?    or cash works too.

MFG Description:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

I have a large amount of 22LR that I would like to sell or trade. I am pricing it substantially lower than what I see it going for at shows, and lower than what others are selling for in private party. I am basically selling for what I have in it. So if you can get it somewhere else cheaper than by all means do so. I am not trying to gouge, just recoup what I have in them. That being said, here is what I have:
-3 boxes of 525rd Remington Golden Bullet- $45 each
-8 boxes of 325rd Federal Auto-Match-$30 each
-5 boxes of 50rd American Eagle- $5 each
I am not placing any kind of limit to purchase on these so you can buy as many, or as little as you would like. These prices are for pickup in norman only. If you want to buy everything I will sell them all for $365 which is much less than what the market has them at. I would also consider trading some or all towards a Pink SR22 in good or new condition. Please shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal on it

 The bestselling Venture bolt-action rifle combines high-end features with a remarkably low price tag. With an owner-adjustable 3.5-5 lbs. trigger, Hogue traction panels, pillar bedding, 5R rifling and guaranteed MOA accuracy, you can count on the T/C Venture’s accuracy season-after-season. 

 A well-timed, accurate shot starts with a crisp trigger. The trigger of a T/C Venture can be adjusted from 3.5-5 lbs. of pull, depending on shooter preference 

 The American-made Venture Blued is backed by Thompson/Center’s famous Lifetime Warranty, which protects your investment for a lifetime of hunts. 

 Unlike other bolt-action rifles that require a break in period, the Venture’s corrosion resistant-coated bolt makes cycling the bolt open and closed quick and easy from day one.

 The Venture performs at a level beyond other low-priced bolt-action rifles. And backed by a T/C Lifetime Warranty, it offers more value than other guns in its price range.

I have up for sale or trade an old Czech CZ50 (vz50, vz-50) 32 auto pistol. These are the models that were used by the czech police. I took it in on a trade took it to the range and put one mag through it. It functioned fine for those rounds. I am only putting it up for trade because 32 isnt a caliber I reload for or have much of a use for. This is in decent shape for being as old as it is, but it does have definite signs of use and wear, but nothing too unexpected for being this old. This also could use a good cleaning, as I have not had a chance to do it because I just had it out shooting a few hours ago. This would be a fantastic carry gun because of its size and it has very low recoil. Also, I have seen that even academy stocks the defense rounds for it so ammo wouldnt be terrible to find like it is with a lot of the smaller calibers. This will also come with two extra mags for the right trade or cash offer (making the total 3 mags). Please feel free to message me on here, or shoot me a TEXT ONLY at REDACTED and I can answer any and all questions that way. This will be sold as is with no returns just because of the nature of it so please ask any questions now and I will be happy to answer them the best I can. I can also message pictures if you would like. I also have a cz70 for sale as well, so feel free to make an offer on the pair if you would like."

I have up for sale or trade an old Czech CZ70 (vz-70, vz70) 32 auto pistol. These are the models that were used by the czech police. I took it in on a trade took it to the range and put one mag through it. It functioned fine for those rounds and could mainly use a good cleaning as I havent been able to do it yet. (was just at the range a few hours ago). I am only putting it up for trade because 32 isnt a caliber I reload for or have much of a use for. This is in decent shape for being as old as it is, but it does have definite signs of use and wear, but nothing too extreme for its age.This would be a fantastic carry gun because of its size and it has very low recoil. Also, I have seen that even academy stocks the defense rounds for it so ammo wouldnt be terrible to find like it is with a lot of the smaller calibers. This will also come with two extra mags for the right trade or cash offer (making the total 3 mags). Please feel free to message me on here, or shoot me a TEXT ONLY at 4052136954 and I can answer any and all questions that way. This will be sold as is with no returns just because of the nature of it so please ask any questions now and I will be happy to answer them the best I can. I can also message pictures if you would like. I also have a cz50 for sale or trade as well, so feel free to make an offer on the pair if you would like."

I took it in on a trade took it to the range and put one mag through it. It functioned fine for those rounds and could mainly use a good cleaning as I havent been able to do it yet. (was just at the range a few hours ago). I am only putting it up for trade because 32 isnt a caliber I reload for or have much of a use for. This is in decent shape for being as old as it is, but it does have definite signs of use and wear, but nothing too extreme for its age.This would be a fantastic carry gun because of its size and it has very low recoil. Also, I have seen that even academy stocks the defense rounds for it so ammo wouldnt be terrible to find like it is with a lot of the smaller calibers. This will also come with two extra mags for the right trade or cash offer (making the total 3 mags). Please feel free to message me on here, or shoot me a TEXT ONLY at REDACTED and I can answer any and all questions that way. This will be sold as is with no returns just because of the nature of it so please ask any questions now and I will be happy to answer them the best I can. I can also message pictures if you would like. I also have a cz50 for sale or trade as well, so feel free to make an offer on the pair if you would like."

The next-generation PMAG 40 GEN M3 is a 40-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Features:
•Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction
•Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms
•Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding
•Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability
•Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves
ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its 16"" chrome-lined,
phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas
regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical
improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail forend and barrel, and
you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available. The SIG516
Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol grip. As with all
SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the Sig Sauer innovative short-stroke gas
pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle
to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the Sig Sauer
proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the
only rifles to pass NATO's Over the Beach test. It has a free-floating
M1913 quad rail, and the the top rail is optic-ready with Sig Sauer flip-up
iron sights.

The Savage Model 24 was an affordably-priced over-under combination gun,
manufactured for decades. When Savage pulled the plug, a near-constant
clamor of die-hard fans has convinced Savage to bring the combination gun
back with a different design. Now it is the Model 42. The barrels are blued
with a black synthetic stock. They are available in .22 LR over 410, or 22
WMR over 410.

When it comes to semi-automatic firearms, the ammunition feeding device often determines if, and how well, the gun functions. Therefore, whether for use as a backup mag for your concealed carry pistol or simply for saving a little reloading downtime at the range, keeping a few spare factory magazines handy is never a bad idea. 

This Sig factory magazine fits Sig Sauer P938 pistols chambered in 9mm Luger. It comes equipped with an extended base pad that not only adds extra length to the tiny gun's abbreviated frame for a better grip and recoil control, but also adds an extra round the magazine's capacity for a total of 7-rounds. While not as concealable as the standard 6-round, flush-fitting P938 magazine, this slightly enlarged version remains unobtrusive and is small enough to be a good choice for carry in the pocket as a backup to the primary magazine inside the gun in the event that it malfunctions or runs dry.

For sale in the Roanoke Valley is a pretty nice Savage model 63M (.22 Magnum) that comes with ammunition (148 rds. - some HP and FMJ) and an old leather sling. 

The model 63M is a single shot bolt action rifle that features a Mannlicher style stock, an 18"" barrel, hooded front sight, and elevation adjustable rear sight. I've read they were only made from the mid to late 60s. There are a few small dings in the stock and some small scuffs on top of the receiver where a scope must have been mounted years ago."
