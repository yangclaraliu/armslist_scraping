New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

This is the second generation of the Sigma pistols S&W made and was later sued by Glock because it so closely copied the design of the Glock 9mms. 

Mine has 300 rounds down the barrel and is extremely clean inside and out. I have added the Apex Tactical trigger spring kit and Apex Tactical AEK polymer trigger. I have all original trigger parts as well as all original paperwork that came with the gun. I only have one magazine, I did not receive the second one when I purchased it. I will also include a Galco IWB holster.

This has been a wildly reliable and accurate gun, and I only want to part with it so that I can pursue either an M&P or a Glock. I am getting into both 3 and 2 gun competition and need something that I can upgrade to the nines. 

No offence to any of the trades out there but I am really only interested in a well known 9mm (not interested in other calipers) pistol that can be upgraded and used for competition. I understand that my gun is on the low side of the value scale compared to some of the others but I can possibly add cash, gun accessories or certain hard to find rimfire ammo to the trade.

My cash price is FIRM at $350. If I don't get at least that much I'll just keep the gun and use it as is for competition until I get the funds for a competition base gun.

All laws followed PPP (which I keep) or CCW required and a bill of sale will be completed"

I treat them to massages twice a month and drink nothing but organic, filtered coconut water grown by mountain hippies.  I would estimate that they are in 95% condition based on the medical knowledge I have obtained from watching a few episodes of Doogie Howser, MD in the early 90's.  I will say that of all my organs that these are the safe queens.  In fact they have never seen the light of day.

Serious inquiries only!  Thanks and God bless.  Especially to those on welfare who can take the time to camp out at Walmart every morning when deliveries arrive with a couple buddies buying up all the 22 and then selling them for outrageous prices and artificially creating a shortage of that particular caliber.  You guys are the best and I cant wait until production catches up and you're stuck with thousands of rounds that you cant unload on people with fulltime jobs who can afford to go to the store and wait every morning and just want a box to take their kids out shooting but cant because there are jerks who heard the term supply and demand and thinks that this is a great way to generate extra income so they can finally pay off that barbed wire tattoo that they had financed."

You can pay online prior to the class (www.PROFESSIONALDEFENSETRAINING.com) or before class starts. We accept cash, credit card or checks. You need to register so that we know you are coming. 

Why take our class vs. others? Here are a couple reasons to consider:
1. We have a large classroom with an outdoor range onsite. Shooting outside is less stressful, quieter, you are breathing fresh air and its less stressful then being crammed into a small stall. Especially now that Spring is here.
2. We will take as much time as needed for the new or nervous student until you are confident with your skills. Other classes that have to use an indoor range typically rent the range for one hour and have to shuffle all their students through the shooting qualification in a hurry. You shouldn't be rushed through the live shooting exercises.
3. We have available many different handguns for students to try for FREE (you bring the extra ammo). This is very valuable if you are trying to decide which handgun to purchase for concealed carry. At a gun store range you will pay $10 to $15 per gun for rent.
4. Our class fees are very competitive compared to many that can be over $300.

Purchased both these items back in January of this year, had every intention of taking the AR out when it got warm, but priorities changed and I'm on to bigger and better things. That said, I don't NEED to sell so please no low ball offers. Thanks.

Paid roughly $1300 for both items with tax, shipping, FFL fees, etc. Since they are both still new and unused, looking to get $1200 OBO. I would prefer to sell as a package, but I am not opposed to selling the AR or EOTech separately. 

If you buy the package I will also include a brand new Balckhawk fully modular tactical soft carrying case. It easily fits this rifle (including the EOTech) with plenty of room for many other items such as mags, ammo, etc. Also included is 40 rounds of quality brass ammo. 

Must be 18 to purchase with valid ID. CCW preferred. FTF only. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. Might consider trades for 9mm semi-auto pistol (no junk please). Cash either way to even out. Thanks for looking."

This rifle is an Oberndorf Mauser production rifle manufactured under contract for Brazil by DWM. This rifle is in fact chambered in 7.62 NATO/.308 win and has all matching serials in the stock, mag well and floor plate, action, and bolt assembly. This rifle is in excellent to unissued condition, appears to be new-old-stock. At some point in the rifles lifetime it was professionally rebarrelled for 7.62x51 and parkerized as its current state is not standard military issue. Standard brazilian 1908 mausers were originally longer, blued, chambered for 7mm Mauser, and equipped with a straight bolt. The pictures will speak for themselves as to the spectacular condition of the rifle. 

Stock is finished in a fine oil finish. All the production stamps and serials (#723) are clearly visible, even to the Brazilian flag stamped into the rear of the stock. Other common stamps on the rifle are the greek letters alpha and beta. The only thing i have done to the gun, besides shoot it, is install 2 action capture screws that were missing when i bought the rifle. 

Metal finish is parkerized, and the bore has 4 groove rifling in pristine condition-mirror all the way through, the barrel appears to be new.  Shoots great. The gun is much more accurate than i am, and im able to manage 2-3 inch groups at 50 from the bench with the traditional mauser V-notch irons and aguila 147gr fmj's. All the serials match. Also there are no importer stamps. Let me know if you want different pictures, im happy to send some.

3. (BRAND NEW) GENUINE US MILITARY ISSUE CFP-90 LARGE FIELD PACK WITH INTERNAL FRAME INCLUDES COMBAT PATROL PACK.

Color: Woodland Camo

Manufactured in the US by Specialty Defense Systems

The field pack offers 4250 cubic inches of storage and is constructed of an 8.0 ounce backcoated nylon fabric printed in the woodland camouflage pattern, which has excellent abrasion resistance and water repellency. The weight of the empty field pack is 8 pounds. The field pack has two major sections; the sleeping bag compartment, and the main compartment. The main compartment has a false bottom that may be opened for full use of the field pack when a sleeping bag is not carried. The outside of the field pack has one long tunneled pocket and two smaller cargo pockets, all using compression straps for securing contents. Equipment attachment points in the form of 2 1/4 inch [5.71 cm] webbing and 1 inch [2.54 cm] webbing loops are located throughout the field pack.

The internal frame comprises two aluminum staves running the full height of the field pack. The staves are removable. The suspension system is adjustable allowing the user to position the field pack where it is most comfortable. The field pack has lower back padding as well as an extended lumbar support pad and the shoulder pads are made of bi-laminate foam. A softer, open cell foam is against the body for comfort, followed by a stiffer closed cell foam for stability and good recovery after compression.

Two strap assemblies with quick release buckles allow for the attachment of the combat patrol pack atop the field pack when both packs are used together. When used in combination with either the ammunition carrying or tactical load-carrying vests, the field pack shoulder pads are worn over those of the vest, where they are retained by two one inch [2.54 cm] pieces of webbing.

Combat Patrol Pack - The combat patrol pack is designed for short missions and offers 1200 cubic inches of cargo space in two compartments. The main compartment incorporates two tiedown straps that can be used to stabilize equipment such as a field radio. The combat patrol pack has a separate shoulder harness. When used in combination with either the ammunition carrying or tactical load-carrying vests, the combat patrol pack shoulder pads are worn over the vest shoulder pads, and retained for stability by two one inch [2.54 cm] pieces of webbing.

Regardless of the scenario this HHS provides an unparalleled advantage when transitioning from short to long range  shooting.  The EXPS2-2 offers true 2 eyes open shooting, a transversly mounted lithium 123 battery, 7 mm raised base offering iron sight access, and easy to adjust side buttons.  The G33 3x magnifier with switch to side mount provides superior light transmission and the large field of view puts the competition to shame. Both units offer an adjustable, locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal.

I was going to put it up on Ebay, could probably get more for it. But after listing price and shipping cost, I would probably lose at least 20 or 30 bucks. So I figured I would just let it go for $120.00 local.                  Have enough stuff, no trades."

The Silver Pigeon 1 marks the dividing line between Beretta’s more economical double guns and the highly decorated luxury models. While popularly priced, it offers the aesthetics and materials of the premium over-unders. The frame has extensive, but refined, floral and scroll decoration that will make this shotgun a source of pride for years to come. The oil-finished stock is select walnut finish. It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability. Befitting of a field gun that will be used in exciting hunting situations, the safety is automatic, resetting each time the Silver Pigeon is opened for reloading.

Awesome condition, looks brand new.  Never carried, so it has no holster wear, dings, or scratches. Less than 300 rounds through it.  Shoots great, no problems.  The only reason I'm selling is because it has no practical use for me, I've barely touched it in years.  

$799 cash.  No shipping.  Local, face to face transaction only.  

Note: A new one at Specialty Sports runs $899 ($967 with sales tax).  So $799 for barely used is pretty good."

I will meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range if you would like to test fire any of my listed firearms. May consider meetings at local ""gun friendly"" businesses, like a gun shop. I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time.

The initial semi-auto design, the Model 98 was unveiled at the 1998  but never went into full production. In recent years, Ronnie Barrett's son, Chris, revived the company's interest in the .338 rifle No game too big. Model 98B in action Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game. Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide. Model 98B The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action... for any inquiry pls contact    1-302 319-2338"

This beauty was created here in Indiana. It sits on a GMC Vandura35 Chassis and has a GMC 400 small block engine and 400 turbo tranny. Orange textured shag carpets, wood paneling on the walls, shag and white leather on the ceiling! Whoever bought this in 1980 was one classy guy. Heat and AC work! it has a heater in the back (pictured) that pumps out some serious heat. I have been driving this thing every day for a couple months now and it is a lot of fun, I just need a small pickup truck for work. The whole back end is fiberglass so there is no rust and the windows and screens all seal tightly, not a drafty van. Although the handle to the rear door is broken so there is a 4""x4"" opening in the rear door. it does not latch on its own. I had a new ignition put in the van so the keys don't match the front doors. I put a new heater core in it a month ago- have receipts. The tires on it (6) cost me $1200 about 3 months ago so they are still in 95% shape. The brakes are great. the 400 small block provides plenty of power. Could use a re-alignment. Gets a little wobbly around 60mph. but it will do 55mph comfy. Minor rust on the front hood and doors. nothing structurally unsound. All the blinds on the inside are very vintage and in pristine condition. Small oil leak coming from valve cover gasket. it has leaked ever since ive had it but its so minor I did the tires and heater core first. Speedometer and odometer do not work, nor does the cruise control. They all went out at once. It has a clean clear Indiana title, in my name, in hand. No bull, I wont ship. I may trade for a small pickup truck, and would prefer to add cash for the right truck. Also might do partial trades on quality firearms, no revolvers or anything that costs less than 800 dollars.

This would be great for a hunter as there is no extra crap in the van. I have camped in it a couple times- very roomy. If empty you could probably sleep 5 or 6. Electricity is not ran thru the van, there is a fold down futon but no bed. All the windows work. 

Email is best. I check it monday thru friday and most weekends. Thanks for your time."

Note: •Quantity of 500 is 10 boxes of 50

WARNING: These rounds are powered by the rimfire primer only. They must only be fired in handguns. If fired in rifles, the bullet may remain lodged in the barrel.
•Will not cycle the slide of semi-automatic handguns

•Aguila packages these as Long Rifle ammunition, but they are in fact slightly shorter than a 22 Long cartridge

•Bullet Weight: 20 Grains 
•Bullet Style: Lead Solid 

Ballistics Information:
