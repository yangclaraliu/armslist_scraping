This is a beautifully made Italian shotgun, that is not manufactured anymore.  The Russian Shooting Team used IAB shotguns during the 70's & 80's, winning many gold and silver medals.  This shotgun is not ""Hammer"" fired, it is ""Striker"" fired, and as such does not have a selector for the ""Over"" or ""Under"" barrel to fire.  The Lower (Under) barrel will always fire first.  The shotgun has auto ejectors, but the timing is slightly off on the Lower barrel ejector.  Other then that, the shotgun functions flawlessly. I had a Gunsmith fully check the shotgun within the past month.  I have added a high rise front and rear fiber optic sights.  The inside of the barrels have a very high gloss mirror finish. The shotgun shows very little wear, and apparently had very little use. If you do not want the fiber optic sights, I will remove them and sell the shootgun for $25 less.  Included in the sale is a Flambeau Safeshot Oversized Single Case (Cost on Amazon is $52).  Contact Jerry at REDACTED for any additional questions, or for additional pictures.  I also have a unfinished extra stock, that you can have for an additional $20."

Their firearms are combat-proven and are the weapons of choice by top military units and law enforcement agencies throughout the world.This Mark XIX Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 650 feet. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the effect of the rifling between the bullet and the bore, increasing accuracy. An anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The DE is designed with a high quality carbon steel barrel, frame and slide w/ full Picatinny rail and Weaver rail from the chamber to the front sight for an variety of tactical, combat, or hunting accessories. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.All of IWI’s weapons are manufactured in compliance with the most stringent military (MIL-STD) and ISO 9000:2008 standards. That history and quality was completely transferred and maintained when Magnum Research began production of this beautiful beast in the USA.Model: DE50GO / Mark XIXCaliber: .50AE Action ExpressCapacity: 7+1Operation: Single-ActionBarrel: 6""Rifling: 1:19 Octagonal RH / 6 Grooves .495” diameterHeight: 6.25""Slide width: 1.25”Trigger: Combat Style 2.75” Reach / 4 lb PullLength O/A: 10.75""Weight: 69.8 oz / 76 oz w/magGrips: Textured polymerSights: Fixed Combat 3-DotFinish: 24k GoldFrame: High Quality Carbon Steel Barrel / 24k Gold Frame & Slide w/ Full Picatinny & Weaver RailMagazine: 1x7-rd Mag"

It has been worked on by me with love and care as my primary carry, it has a trigger job that is slick as glass (stock parts throughout) double action was left in the design handguns weight will not trip sear in SA , the frame has been tightened as much as I want to go considering if I wanted to add a new slide etc it is tighter than it came from factory, Mag well has been beveled and polished and reblued , has new firing pin spring and recoil spring (factory) Note : no aftermarket springs available for dual recoil spring it in my opinion needs higher spring rate but it doesn't batter with moderate target load, I've just touched up the bluing on rails and high spots to make it pretty and it'll show the wear after the work done (like using dykem).The gun will feed anything I've shot and I haven't left much ammo untouched the next step was to fit a new barrel and pin tighter if needed it's very tight now I waited until I got a new barrel  that being said the barrel has a great bore.I'm looking to see what is out there for trade I am open to handguns only I would be willing to put paperbacks in the pot to step up. I enjoy good shooters and older firearms and designs preferably hammer fired I would probably turn down any of the striker fired flavor varieties unless it's interesting.  Email me your number and info if interested, I don't deal with text and you shouldn't either if your into online trading and sales you never know I like to talk to the Individual at least once before meeting.Thank you god bless"

Hell, the P226 platform by itself, without any of the fancy up-market features of the Elite series, is an absolutely fantastic pistol. Google/YouTube search ""Sig P226 review"" if you would like to see a mountain of lengthy and glowing reviews on this series of pistols.Anyway, up for sale today is my P226 Elite, my favorite pistol that I've ever owned. I am the first owner of this gun, which was purchased new in 2009. It has almost 2000 rounds on the clock. It has been absolutely flawless in all that time, and is without question my first choice as a nightstand/roadtrip gun. I trust it with my life. Why am I selling it, then? I got a Legion P226 as a gift, and now this one seems redundant. So there are a few negatives, all related to the fact that I never saw myself selling this gun until now. This thing has traveled all over the country with me and functioned as a pack gun and a go-to HD pistol on and off for years. I have done my best to avoid abusing it, but it has most certainly been used. Basically, if you're the sort of person who can't handle buying a used gun with a bit of holster wear and a few scratches here and there, turn back now. If you want a proven pistol that is fully broken-in for a couple hundred bucks cheaper than retail, here it is!Bad: it's got VERY MINOR finish wear in all the normal spots you would expect from holstering, barrel crown finish wear from shooting, and has a handful of surface scratches (nothing actually deep in the finish, they look like light pencil marks). The rosewood grips (yes, I have those too) have one long-ish scratch on them from when I used to carry it in my pack with those grips installed before I bought the Hogues you see in the pic. I do NOT have the box for it, I lost that in my last move...I never thought it would matter because I thought I'd never be selling this gun, but here we are. I can only include ONE MAGAZINE with the pistol, which is the 15rd factory mag. That is the only mag that came with the gun when I bought it, I have a bunch of MecGar mags, but they're all pre-ban and cannot be legally transferred with the gun...also I want to keep them for my new pistol.  Good: it's a Sig P226 Elite. The trigger is butter, the night sights are still extremely bright, and to whatever degree a pistol like this needs to be broken in, it has been. This thing is good to go, load it up and bet your life that it'll work when it needs to and put all rounds on target faster and more intuitively than anything besides a competition-built 1911. It is the most natural-shooting pistol I own, no contest. I will include both the Hogue grips in the picture as well as the factory rosewood grips, plus I'll throw in a zip-up pistol pouch in an attempt to compensate for the lack of a box. Please don't hesitate to email me with any further questions, I will be happy to answer them. I sell on here a lot, and I pride myself on collecting/trading/selling quality guns. I don't buy junk, I don't sell junk, this is a damn nice pistol and the only reason I'm getting rid of it is because it's being replaced by a newer version of the exact same gun. My normal FFL is in Littleton, but buyer pays transfer so I'll meet anywhere in the Denver/Boulder orbit for no extra charge...+$25 for me to drive as far as Summit County, CO Springs or into the mountains as far as Fairplay/Idaho Springs/Nederland/etc, +$50 for anywhere further within the state. Thanks for checking it out! Again, email only for any/all enquiries."

It's had a lot of work done to it in the past year. Not in a rush to sell, just looking for something different. This truck has an NP208 transfer case, TH400 3 speed trans (solid, shifts great), and a 350 TBI. I've driven it around the city and on the highway. Ran like a dream. Has an 89 Suburban front clip that was swapped over with the TBI. Frame is straight and no accidents, was just swapped for appearances.  It has a plow mount, but it was only used to clear the Previous owners driveway and only used a few times. The exhaust sounds incredible. Never gotten anything but compliments on the truck. Video of her running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpEeAMBdVVM  -New stainless fuel lines installed last summer -2 new 20 gallon baffled fuel tanks with new pumps/sending units and restored brackets -New fuel filter -Frame is cleaner than most 2000s trucks around here -New bed, rust free, installed last January -Rust free cab -Newer bench seat, vinyl floor -Aftermarket radio -89 Suburban front end, rust free -350 TBI  -Newer dual exhaust that exits under the cab -New disk brakes last summer -New tie rod ends and ball joint replacement last summer -New valve covers and gaskets -New plugs/wires (ACDelco) -New Distributor cap and rotor about 2 months ago -New Optima Yellow Top battery 2 months ago -New Wagner headlights last Fall -New Depo parking light housings last fall -Heat and A/C work great  Laundry List: -Has dual tanks, but only one hooked up. I bought the valve, but it was defective and I haven't bought a new one. The part is $50 and all you need to do is connect the fuel lines to the valve from both sides. Lines are all labeled and ready to install.  -Gas gauge isn't reading correctly due to only having one tank hooked up. When you install the valve, switch the connected plug on the tank and it will read just fine.  -Paint could use some small touch ups (I have some leftover matching paint). There's no body damage, but the paint has a few minor scrapes/scratches. When the truck was painted, it was done properly including all door jambs, seams, creases, etc.  -Rear bumper is a little rusty and could be replaced. They're not hard to come by, though. Rust is only on the chrome bumper, not the body of the truck.  I may have missed some minor things, please email me and let me know if you have any questions. Mileage exempt. Never used the 4wd. Prev owner told me it worked but leaked. Intended to rebuild but don't have time. Stored in the winter. Does have surface rust on the frame. Can't find any holes or cracks. Wire brushed some off and the frame was solid as a rock. I also have 5 quarts of Mobil 1 oil, new Delco filter and rear dif fluid that will come with the truck.

Willing to travel a reasonable distance. Buyer pays transfer fees."
