The gun is in really nice shape.  You do not find many Savage 110's in 7mm-08, and especially with the wood stock.  Blind magazine that hold 4 shots and 1 in the barrel. Shoots excellent as all Savages do.  Not the Accutrigger, but very nice and crisp trigger.  

The scope (Simmons) eye piece is loose, needs work, so considering it a project\throw away scope, but free to the purchaser.

Includes 9 boxes (180 rounds) of Federal Fusion ammo.  140 grain which is perfect for deer hunting.  Federal Fusion ammo, if you can find it locally, is worth at least $240 alone, not including tax and shipping.  Federal Fusion is great hunting ammo and here is a write up on the ammo.

The gun is in great condition mechanically. There are a few smudges on the cylinder, but they are only smudges.

• Removable, Interchangeable Compensator
• The Highest Velocity Revolver in the World - 2330 FPS/200 Grain!
• The Most Powerful .45 Caliber Revolver In the World - 2400 lbs/ft!
• If You Zero its Sights at 200 Yards You Will Bag Your Buck with a Center Hold 0-250 Yards with No Hold Over! Just Center It and Fire. The 460XVR Will Do The Rest
• Gain Twist Rifled Barrel for Superb Accuracy
• Lighter Loads That The 460 Will Also Fire Include .45 Colt and .454 Casull
• Incredibly Low Perceived Recoil For All Loads

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

The Mil Spec upper receiver has M4 feed ramps and a flat top Picatinny rail. The Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail 12.0 tubular handguard is free floated with top mounted Picatinny rail and modular Picatinny rail segments and has a shotgun-inspired grip. A MOE 6 position butt stock is installed.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout cartidge was designed with sound supression in mind, and with subsonic ammunition results in surprisingly quiet shooting.

Used as my personal home defense handgun for the past few years, I have run over 250 rounds of both ball and defensive hollow points through it at the range without failure. It is well-balanced and easy to get on target and shoot accurately.   

The SW99 was produced from the alliance between Smith & Wesson and Walther. The unique and ergonomic grip of the pistol was designed by the renowned Swiss match pistol grip designer, Cesare Morini. It has double/single action, locked breach type operation and features several safety elements including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety.  Notably, the pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a flush, de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. A close-up of the button is included among the pictures. The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. Its unique sear system allows a short, Quick-Action trigger pull. The frame assembly, manufactured by Walther, is high impact polymer with sure-gripping serrations and textured contours, and includes integral slots for accessories. Sights are original Trijicon Factory Night Sights that are still effectively bright. Manufactured by Smith & Wesson, the stainless barrel is 4 inch service length.  Extreme overall length is 7 inches; maximum height is 5 1/2 inches; maximum thickness is 1.15 inches at the disassembly bar, but the grip part of the frame is only 1 inch thick. Note that the mainspring housings / backstrap parts can be easily replaced (alternative straps not included) to allow shooters to adjust the contour of the grip frame.  

We are furnishing the buyer with a total of four (4) steel bodied 12 shot magazines and a Safariland Model 6280-84 (MSRP $130) leather holster, also in excellent condition. This mid-ride, Class II retention duty holster has an attractive black basketweave surface."

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev, which can be an economical alternative to the faddish 5.7X28mm round, due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, 7.62 Tok ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings.  Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with two(2) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod and documentation. With a full, 70 round compliment on-hand, the PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a compact and handy platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Designed primarily for close quarter conflicts, the PPS-43C is also a lot of fun to shoot. Felt recoil is minimal, so everyone in the family can enjoy."

My guns are fully described as to condition(listed in %), function, and whether the gun is factory original or a parts kit remake. Ask the question, has the gun been re-welded form an original de-milled receiver? Is the gun built on a newly manufacture receiver? Is it an original factory gun or just a factory receiver with miss matched parts? This information is critical when selling a gun or for the buyer to know as well. Ask the questions that need to be asked so you pay the right price for a gun. That being said, I have a Factory original Colt M16A2. As of this posting, the ONLY true Post Sample Colt M16A2 on GB. It came out of Israel and is semi/full auto. It does have a lot of rack ware, but the gun has been shot very little. I rate the finish at 90% and internals at 97%. The gun runs like new and you can tell by the inside of the mag well that the gun hasn't been shot a lot. It would make a great range rental or PD demo gun.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

It is a tube fed, 10 rounder, semi auto .22 rifle made to take down and stored in a well made canvas case with accessories and sling.

I have come across a decent amount of 22lr ammo that I have available. First of all, I am selling it for less than it is going at most all other resellers and am selling for a very fair value. So, If you can find them cheaper somewhere else, then more power to you, most of us cannot so I am selling them so that people who cannot find them will atleast not be paying the extreme prices of 50 and 60 per box for these. That being said, here is what I have available:
- 4X Remington Golden Bullet 525 round boxes- $40 each or $35 if you buy more than 1
- 2X Winchester 555 round boxes- $45 each or $40 if you buy more than 1
- 2X Federal Champion 50 round boxes- $5 each
- 1X CCI Stinger 50 round box- $8 each

I am also open to certain trade offers for cheap pistols, shotguns, or rifles (no black-powders). Please shoot any offers or inquiries to REDACTED (text only please) and we can try and make a deal. I am a reasonable person and would appreciate it if you would be as well. I think the prices I have posted are very reasonable considering everywhere else I look these are going for around 60 if not more. I do also have some 9mm available for sale or trade if you happen to need that as well. I will need to meet in norman for these prices to be valid, outside of norman MIGHT effect them just because of gas costs. 
Thank you for your time

I bought this from a gun shop and the guy said it belonged to a cop who did the ""custom"" stippling job himself.  To be honest I don't like the way it looks at all.  But it definitely has a good solid grip to it.  It's not slippery at all, even when wet.  This makes for a good ankle gun or backup gun.  And it's a Glock so it performs flawlessly 100% of the time.  

Comes with factory 10 round mag, 3 new in package Korean 15 round mags and one 50 round box of Hornady Critical Duty 135 gr. JHP's.  I have had a ton of these Korean mags through this gun and they have always worked perfectly.

Also comes with factory magazine loader.

Besides the stippling, this thing is in very good shape.  No scratches or dings in the slide, barrel is great and the internals look great as well.

I bought the gun for $1150, added a Parabellum Armament AKARS rail system which is an AWESOME setup. It free-floats a picitini rail above the dust cover for a super solid optics mount, and replaces the awful rear sight with a much larger, easier to use peep sight. Added a Parabellum Armament front modular rail system, with this you can add different rail sections where you want them, so you don't have a big, heavy rail system. I added a Magpul AFG for easier shooting, a different pistol grip with storage in it. Had QD sling swivels on the front and rear of the AK. There has been less than 4 mags shot through it. I have all the original furniture if you want to turn it back to stock and the manual. The gun originally only comes with one 5 round magazine, but I have a factory Bulgarian 30rd clear magazine and two 20 round factory Bulgarian magazines. I spend almost $200 just in magazines (they are over $50 a piece) I don't know where the box went. I have over $1700 in this gun, and i'm asking $1100. You can call/text me with any questions.

As with all Mossbergs, you can swap the barrel to another with the turn of a thumbscrew...no tools required. It is beautiful.

It has a 650 motor, Positive Traction, 4 speed transmission with REVERSE and has street legal lights installed on it. This Motor Cycle is Street Legal. This vehicle was originally designed to be a “Fast Attack” vehicle with a bed mounted Machine Gun. After the War, they were then utilized within the factory to carry parts throughout the shop. It is VERY VERY RARE and there are only two others in the US that I have knowledge of. However, parts for my Motor Cycle are readily available through many out lets. I would like to sell or trade my motor cycle. My asking price is Best Offer. I also would consider trades for a 4 X 4 vehicle or I will also take Fire Arms in on Trade.

This rifle originally came from the factory with the black synthetic stock and accu trigger. I customized this rifle for myself, but never fired it. It is mounted on a walnut stained birch stock (that costs $170.00 alone) with the savage ""chief"" medallion set in the stock grip and comes with rubber recoil pad. The original stock synthetic trigger guard has been replaced with a low luster metal trigger guard (and also comes with another low luster metal trigger guard that will fit the synthetic stock if preferred, these metal trigger guards cost $25.00 a piece from the factory alone) and a 3-9x40 Bushnell scope with medium height rings has been mounted and the scope has been bore sighted. The barrel is completely free floated up to the receiver. The trigger guard and action screws have been appropriately torqued. It also comes with a new Savage leather sling with logo and sling rings (worth over $60.00), and a black (extra) padded case with shoulder strap. The original box and paperwork and accu trigger adjustment tool also comes with it. The trigger is set at about 3.5 pounds. This rifle is new, never carried, never used and never fired! ...All accessories that come with it are brand new!!

I originally customized this rifle for myself, but the economy being what it is I need to sell it (before I even try it). It is new, and you are getting all my work on it for free also.

With my work included this would cost you well over $1500.00

I am only asking $580.00 for everything I just listed!

I also have 120 rounds of NIB (new) .243 ammo (it is visible in the 1st pic). One box of Remington 80 grain power soft point, two boxes of Federal 100 grain soft point and three boxes of Winchester100 grain power point. This is available for $100.00 separately. The ammo is worth over $185.00 

Please only serious enquiries. I am losing allot of money on this (to say the least) already, so please do not ask for trades, or anything unreasonable.

Anyone who knows about these type of bolt action rifles, or the work that goes into customizing one, knows that this is a more, than just wonderful deal! 

If interested, I sell to only those with a CCW, or who are willing to do a background check.


 Thanks,

809,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2178809,For Sale:  Homsafe 12 gun steel gun safe plus add on pistol case - $150 (Monument),"monument, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 150,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 2, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my Homsafe brand Steel Gun safe. I don't believe this brand is made anymore, but doing some internet research, it appears to be made by Homak, which still makes similar safes.

This includes a 12 gun rifle safe, that has additional space in the center for three shelves to hold ammo, mags, etc, plus three extra bins that mount to the doors for extra storage as well. I really liked these extra feature when I bought it, and I liked that this safe has twin locks on the rifle safe rather than the single that Stackon was known for at the time. I also bolted the add on pistol case to the top of it. The pistol case has three shelves to easily hold multiple pistols.

The (outer) dimensions of the rifle safe are 21"" wide, 16"" Deep, and 55"" tall
The (outer) dimensions of the pistol safe are 21"" wide, 10"" Deep, and 18"" tall
Overall height with pistol case mounted is 73""

The foam on the interior is kind of lightweight and the gun guides could use some more adhesive to stay stuck better, but it works just fine as is.

The outside are in good shape as well, except the left side has some scratches from living next to a shelving unit where I slid things next to it.

Includes 2 keys each for both cases.

I believe I found the closest match that Homak currently makes for comparison on the Home Depot web site, searching for Homak 12 gun, and Security Add on for the pistol case.

This safe also has mounting holes to allow you to mount the safe to a wall or the floor, I simply threw an extra bag of shotgun shot in the bottom and made it difficult to move and didn't bother bolting it down.

Its a great way to keep your guns out of the wrong hands and away from prying eyes.

Please contact me to set up a time to come look at the safe."

I have 2 C&R firearms that I would be interested in trading individually or as a package

1.	****SOLD SOLD SOLD****1928 COLT WOODSMAN 22LR PISTOL (SERIES 1 SERIAL# 581XX) - this is a 1928 production series 1 woodsman…I DO NOT HAVE A MAGAZINE FOR THIS FIREARM.  It is in fair condition at best, and would be the perfect piece for someone who is into restoring firearms.  It is mechanically excellent, but needs cosmetic TLC.  The original owner engraved his California DL# on the trigger guard next to the serial number.  It is a very light engraving and can be lightly sanded and  removed without any damage to the original serial #, I leave that up to the new owner

2.	1927 WINCHESTER MODEL 12 in 12 GUAGE (SERIAL# 5218XX) - This is a 12 gauge, FULL choke, 30” Nickel Steel Barrel.  It has the original red color butt stock pad marked with Ithaca gun co. This shotgun is in excellent condition with zero rust or pitting.  Some of the bluing is gone on the receiver and the wood is in good to very good condition.  I have put “2” rounds through this shotgun over 5 years ago to check functionality and its perfect.  This gun is a safe queen collector piece for me, but would make an excellent trap gun for any enthusiast.  It has been rated at 85-90% condition by my local gun store

3.	1934 WINCHESTER MODEL 63 SUPER SPEED and SUPER X 22LR (SERIAL# 52XX) – This model 63 is second year production with a tapped receiver and period correct 3X Wee Weaver Scope.  It also has the original tang rear sights and the barrel is 20”.  It has a tube magazine, and the rounds are loaded into the side of the butt stock.  .  The original owner engraved his California DL# on the trigger guard next to the serial number.  It is a very light engraving and can be lightly sanded and removed without any damage to the original serial #, I leave that up to the new owner.  The gun is rated 85-90% condition by my local gun store.  The bore is clean and shiny with no flaws, no pitting or rust, and the wood is very nice and still shines.
I am open to MOST trade offers:  MINI 14's or 30's, AR’s (STRIPPED OR COMPLETE- 223 OR 308), Complete 5.56 uppers, semi auto 12 gauge, 1911’s, Lever Action Rifles in 22lr/9mm/357 mag, ammo, other interesting firearms, etc.  Worst I can say is no.

Small CHL / CCW .380 that is styled after the Walther PPK. The Thunder .380 has a decocker safety, firing mechanism lock on the lower frame, and easy takedown latch. Nice option of SA/DA so you can carry condition 2 and still just pull the trigger. Comes with 2x 7 round magazines. I'll include the original paperwork, warranty cards, factory test shell, etc. 

It sat in our gun cabinet for about a year without being shot, so I had Colorado Gunworks (Bersa Warranty center) go over it. Video is their test firing. This weapon has been broken in, cleaned, and it waiting for someone who wants a .380. I'm moving all my handguns to the same calibers - 9mm and .45 - so this one is now an oddball.

I'll include 2x 50 round boxes of brass case FMJ as well, since I'm not going to have a .380 around here anymore. 

Academy has these for $350+tax. One magazine included. Cost you about $425 for a new one with two mags and ammo. I think $300 is a fair deal. Has a lifetime warranty through Eagle Imports/Bersa.

The gun is in like new condition. If you are shopping for this rifle, then you already know what it is and how rare they are. 

I recently sent the gun back to Bushmaster/Remington to be upgraded to the latest spec. parts (Bushmaster has upgraded some of the parts since they were orginally released). It has a brand new barrel (literally never fired), a brand new AAC 51T Blackout muzzle device, and the lastest spec gas system parts. 

The gun includes the following:
(1) Enhanced (railed) foreend
(2) Standard (MOE) foreend
(3) Enhanced (folding) stock
(4) Standard (fixed) stock
(5) Both original PMags (specially marked for ACR)
(6) Original case

Also on the gun and available for purchase are:
(1) EOTech 516 (~$500 new)
(2) Knights Armament 600M rear flip up sight (~$200 new)
(3) Spike's Tactical Nickel Boron Trigger Group (~$65 new)

Firm price for gun with both sets of furniture and none of the aftermarket additions (original trigger, no Eotech, no KAC sight) is $1850.

Price for everything is $2300

Cash or certified check only. Prefer FTF in Arkansas.  Will ship to out-of-state FFL at buyer's expense.  

PS. I realize that the EOTech in the picture is not a 516, it is a 552. I have already sold the EOTech 552 in the photo. The EOtech that is available with the ACR is a 516 which is the lower 1/3 cowtiness CR123 model.

PPS. Obviously, the suppressor is not included.

Price lowered.  I highly doubt you will find a nicer ACR for a better price."
