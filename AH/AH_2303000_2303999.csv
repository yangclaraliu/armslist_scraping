I am selling a Mossberg 500 that I purchased recently but decided I wanted to finish some other projects that need more focus first...  I have not opened the package and the gun is completely factory new, unfired.  It comes with everything that came in the box (lock, docs, etc) and I suppose you can have the box too if you really want it ;)

Asking price is $399 OBO.  I tend to completely ignore lowball offers, so unless you have something reasonable to suggest, please just save it.  Otherwise, I would welcome creative trades/cash combinations which include other firearms, or other cool stuff.  Just let me know if you're interested and we'll see what we can work out!"

Made from John Moses Browning's 1916 patent. These guns were made in the 20's which as you know makes it nearly 100 years old and it still functions and cycles like a dream.  It has never jammed on me in all the time I've owned it. A previous owner stenciled their initials on the left side of the receiver which is the main cosmetic flaw of the gun. There is a small crack where the receiver meets the butt stock but it doesn't affect functionality at all and is barely noticeable.  The crack looks to have been professionally sealed. This gun is amazingly tight to be a 90+ year old break down gun. It doesn't wobble or have any slack anywhere.  There is also a decent amount of the original bluing left on the receiver and barrel. The gun books for around $325 in this shape I would take $250 cash or $300 trade. I am open to all trade offers even if it means me having to throw in cash or another gun or some ammo to make up the difference. All offers are encouraged worst thing that can happen is I say no. Thanks for looking God Bless and have a good day.

This Walther âPPâ is marked as made in Ulm Germany and the antler proof mark on the barrel represents the Ulm proof house. The research on this valuable gun shows that the manufacturing of the Walther PP was in Manurhin France. The Gun was shipped to Ulm Germany to a brand new facility in 1957 where it was stamped with the Ulm markings, and then imported into the US. This gun was imported by Interarms and bears the very earliest marking of INTERARMS/VA. 

The Walther PP is a blow back-operated semi-automatic pistol which was first produced in .32 ACP caliber. It is considered by many to be the most elegant of the series due to its long barrel and one of the most aesthetically pleasing handguns of all time. The PP is among the first, if not the first, successful compact double-action-single action, semi-automatic handguns in the world. It is a marvel in simplicity and accuracy as well as a clever design. Many Walthers were brought back as trophies by returning GI's after WWII. In the 50's and 60's, fictional character James Bond carried the PPK in Ian Fleming's series of novels, and later movies, which spread the Walther fame around the world.

The condition of this Gun is near mint with almost no wear. I have owned this Walther PP for 35 years and only fired 6 shots from it flawlessly along with it being extremely accurate, it has been in a safe ever since as part of my personal collection. I am willing to furnish many more photos that have already been taken from every angle to supply what ever information is needed; all serial numbers and other markings are clearly visible. I have the original instruction manual and both original factory magazine clips. It also comes with a spring loaded test bullet. The price for this extremely accurate 1957 Walther PP is $2,200.00 or your very best offer."

I wil include 2 x 30 round steel or polymer ... your choice.

A civilian semi-auto variant of the Russian AKM (Chinese Type 56) rifle, the NHM-91 was built to imitate the appearance of the Russian RPK light machine gun. First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc.

Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.[1] The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines and a 75-round Chinese drum magazine.
Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.
Stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock. Made by E.C. Bishop or Boyd[2] and constructed from birch wood or hackberry, the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip,[1] though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector welded onto the threads. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted.[3]
Factory NHM-91 rifles were manufactured with a rivet in the magazine release button, preventing use of some Soviet or German-made AKM or AK-47 magazines. Instead, special magazines with a modified tang were manufactured by Norinco for the NHM-91. Since the sunset of the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, removal of the rivet in the magazine release allows use of any and all AKM, RPK, or AK-47 magazines.[4]"

you may have seen this ad up before, and since the recent Shot Show 2014 as well as the output of the company, I have edited my listing accordingly.

Hello there, I have a like new in box Faxon Firearms upper in a 16"" inch heavy barrel and in .223/5.56 setup 
I'm the first owner and I've only shot 91 rounds through it to test function; and it has worked flawlessly and accurately.

the barrel has a 1:7 twist rate

It has a long stroke variable setting gas piston system, dual recoil spring system for minimal recoil. It has adjustable gas settings, hi / low / off. The upper receiver has an interchangeable barrel system in which you can buy the 300 Blackout barrel kit to install in easily without the need for a gunsmith.

It has a right side charging handle, yet you have the option to switch it to the left side.
There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow.
A special feature with this upper is that it can be fired without a buffer tube, thus you can fire this with a folding stock or without one as a pistol; its quite versatile.

I have the original box and the sale will include it.
I'm throwing in some Magpul extras; 
1 - Magpul AFG
2 - Magpul XTM
1 - Magpul XTM Handstop kit

The grips it comes with are the original S&W Magna grips, a set of Hogue Bantam grips, and a set of Kim Ahrends cordia grips.

Asking $750 for the whole package, not looking to split it up. I'd really like to trade it for a high end AR optic, or a Springfield XDm (with ammo).

This is a Turkish variant of the CZ75b, with design cues from the Israeli Jericho 941.

This pistol features the same Browning barrel locking type system.
It has a manual safety, no decocker.
For a CZ variant it features very tight tolerances and fittings. It is a high quality pistol, I've only fired 1 magazine of PMC bronze and 27 rounds of Federal HST hollow points to test functionality; this gun works flawlessly and accurately, it can take ball ammo and JHP with not problems at all. 

The Shark FC is an alloy framed handgun that features a ported barrel to compensate for the recoil in such a light weight form factor.

I've sourced out to Cajun Gunworks for a custom job on the trigger and to refit a more ergonomic hammer, essentially I wanted this pistol's single action to mimic that of a CZ shadow and Cajun Gunworks has done something pretty close to it I must say. The trigger action this is smooth as glass and the ergonomics to this pistol just makes that pull that much better. Custom work alone came at a total of $280, I have the receipts.

Also, I've put on a set of CZ-75 SP01 rubber grips on these.
It'll come with original hammer and also a SAO style flat trigger, I've yet to have installed.

The gun will come with 4x 17 round Mecgar mags
33 Rounds of PMC bronze ammo
1 box of 20 Speer Gold Dot JHP ammo
23 rounds of Federal Premium HST JHP ammo

The reason why I'm letting go of this after so much work has been put onto this is because I no longer have a desire to keep 9mm handguns and my .223 rifles. Just to save time and money to compromise on exclusively .45acp handguns and a Kriss Super V."

Yes, I know the list price, but they haven't imported any new ones in at least two years, with none coming on the horizon; I've reduced the price to sell, but will go no lower.

TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH (ITEM 23D)","azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel

Youâll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

The AR-15A2 was introduced in 1986 when Colt's started making significant numbers of M16A2s for the US military. The AR-15A2 HBAR (which stands for Heavy Barrel Automatic Rifle) was the first serious attempt at making the AR-15 into a target shooting rifle that could really compete.

The original Colt AR-15 Sporter had been on the market since 1963, but interest in it was mainly confined to military gun buffs and military veterans. Attempts to make the AR-15 into a serious target shooting rifle had largely failed, although this was mainly because of the lack of ammunition that would enable the AR-15 to compete at longer ranges successfully. With the introduction of the M16A2 into Marine Corps service in 1984, things began to change as the USMC searched for ways to make these rifles competitive. The USMC had decided that the M16A2 would replace the M14 as the rifle used in competitions. To understand all this, you have to understand the USMC first. Although the M16A1 had been adopted in 1967, the USMC had never been happy with it because their marksmanship training included shooting out to 600 yards, and the M16A1 was woefully inadequate for that. By 1980, the USMC was able to use the reason that ""declining inventories"" of M16A1s meant they needed a new rifle. This is a somewhat suspect statement as the Army had huge numbers of the rifle in reserve that the USMC could have had. Anyway, the USMC put forward a proposal for an improved M16 that of course included features that the USMC wanted. Another argument the USMC had was that NATO had recently standardised on a new 5.56mm round that the M16A1 could not use due to its slow rifling twist. Colt's responded to the USMC request in record time, due to the fact that they already had developed most of the things the USMC wanted during various development programmes during the 1960s, and it was not that difficult to dust them off and put them together. The enhanced rear sight had been developed during trials for a Squad Automatic Weapon for example.

This sight allowed for elevation adjustments up to 800 yards, a USMC requirement. Colt's also came up with a new set of apertures, a smaller one for long range shooting and a flip up large aperture for close range.

The new rifle also had new furniture made from more advanced plastics. The design of the new handguard was taken from a mid-1960s design. The Army hadn't adopted it at the time as it would have meant a new handguard cap would have to have been fitted, but Colt's redesigned the handguards so the original triangular cap could be used. Another feature of the M16A2 is a burst-fire device, that replaces the fully-automatic capability of the M16A1. Unfortunately this ruins the trigger pull, but of course it is not a feature of the semi-automatic only AR-15A2 intended for civilian target shooters. The A2 also includes various other new features, such as a round forward assist and case deflector (useful for left-handed shooters) and a compensator. Note the lack of slots in the base of the flash hider, so that it acts as a compensator. The buttstock is now 5/8 of an inch longer, and still has the trapdoor.

Because the Marine Corps have such a strong emphasis on marksmanship, the M16A2 was reasonable as a target shooting rifle in its own right, and Colt's enhanced this further on the civilian model by putting a heavy barrel on it. The USMC was forced to accept a barrel on the M16A2 that is slim from the front sight to the chamber in order to allow the mounting of the M203 grenade launcher, but target shooters don't have this problem.

This rifle has a 1/7 inch twist, necessary for stabilising the long L110 (M856) tracer round. Colt's wanted to put a 1/9 inch twist on the M16A2, but the military had to refuse. The problem with 1/7 is that it is such a fast twist that erosion occurs much faster than in the old 1/12 twist barrel on the M16A1. Early Colt civilian A2 rifles like this one also have the 1/7 twist, originally this was considered a problem until heavyweight bullets started to appear in the mid-90s for long range shooting. With the much longer heavyweight bullets a 1/7 twist barrel is a definite advantage, and it is no longer necessary to have the rifle rebarrelled for target shooting if you get a good one from the factory. However, in USMC testing group sizes opened up by 90% after only 6,000 rounds. The USMC blamed this on poor prototype ammunition, which is possible.

The US Army issued a report heavily criticising the M16A2 for various reasons, an overly complex rear sight with no setting for less than 300 yard shooting, a burst-fire system that made the mechanism too complex, the fast rifling twist leading to very short barrel life and so on. Unfortunately for the Army, the Joint Services Small Arms Programme (JSSAP) was in full swing, and with all the heat they were taking over standardising the Beretta M9 pistol there was no way that JSSAP were going to allow the Army to adopt a different variant of the M16, it was a political non-starter. The Army gave in and started buying the M16A2 in 1986, two years after the Marines.

And this is why these civilian models became available! In 1989 President Bush banned the import of semi-automatic ""assault rifles"" into the United States, and feeling the political heat, Colt's decided to stop making the AR-15 for civilian sales. Colt's Firearms Division was then sold off and became the Colt's Manufacturing Company and the AR-15A2 was reintroduced as the Colt ""Sporter"" rifle, with the bayonet lug removed and the lower receiver and mechanism substantially redesigned to make it harder to illegally convert the rifle to full-auto. In the US these pre-89 rifles are highly sought after by collectors, as it is as close as most Americans can come to owning an M16A2.
