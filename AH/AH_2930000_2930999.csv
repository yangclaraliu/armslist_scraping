Great marriage/partner with the wonder nine Beretta 92FS.  Take a look at video review below which explains it further.  

Prefer buyers with FL CWP and FL Drivers License and will require FL bill of sale with signature.

This gun has been utterly reliable but I am trying to thin out the herd a bit. Really looking more to trade than to sell.

This particular 26 has had some excellent modifications. The grip has been professionally reduced and stippled. There are also relief cuts in the trigger guard and the space where the trigger guard meets the grip, making the bore ride very low in the hand. This also provides a reference point for your support hand. Additionally, I installed a Meprolight front night sight, and I have the rear sight (uninstalled) along with it. It includes the original case, the two magazines that came with the gun and three additional factory magazines. There is a Clip Draw affixed to it currently, and I have the original slide cover plate as well.

For those of you who haven't shot a 26 before, one of my favorite things about them is that they conceal like a subcompact yet shoot like a full size handgun. You also have the option to use higher capacity Glock magazines of the same caliber, so you can carry the 15 or 17 round magazines as a spare.

-Gun itself: I'd put a fair value on it at about $450. There is some wear on the slide from being carried, but overall it's in very good shape.
-Extended slide release: $12
-Meprolight night sights: These go for $90 on Amazon but I will value them at $70 because the rear sight is not installed. (The original front sight is also included)
-Grip reduction: This cost approximately $60.
-Extra magazines: There are five total with the gun. Two come with it from the factory. Three are the standard flush fitting ten round magazines. One has a +0 pinky extension and the other has the Glock factory +2 base plate (stippled to match the gun). Extra magazines at a local shop run about $28, times three is an $84 value.

I realize that many modifications are subjective in value to the end user, but the ones made on this gun are pretty universally advantageous for everyone. I don't need to get rid of it and if it doesn't go I will happily keep using it a back up carry piece or a vehicle gun. I can add cash to trades depending on condition and extras, which are listed below. Please have an idea of what you want out of your gun, and we can iron out particulars from there. I'd prefer to keep all transactions in the Indianapolis area, but will travel some for the right deal. Cash price is $575. Thanks, I look forward to working out a deal with one of you lucky folks!"

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

I have upgraded the recoil spring and guiderod with Galloway Precision stainless steel replacements, and I will include the original parts. The new parts really make this into a precision instrument of destructive goodness! Can't ask for a better, smoother trigger! This gun has been completely reliable since the new extractor was installed, with 250 rounds completely flawless since it was returned.

There are no blemishes on the gun, it has never been carried in a holster. It's a great looking, great shooting .45. It's much lighter than it looks, and slim enough to be carried as an EDC. Though I've never carried it in a holster, I have carried it in a holster tshirt, it's slim enough that it disappears.

I am including the gun, the Galloway Precision upgraded parts, and a total of 5, yes 5 factory magazines, all completely reliable. I am also including everything it came new with, plastic box, lock, etc. The three spare magazines alone cost over $40 each.

If I can get this out the door today, I will add 100 rounds of .45 acp, factory target ammo! If I can't sell this today, I will probably pull it and go another route.

I am selling all of the above, for the low price of $400! Yes it's priced to move, I don't need this one as it's not my EDC, but another opportunity has come up and I'd like to move this asap. It's like you're buying it from the store, but not paying tax, AND getting upgraded parts and extra mags, so come on, you know you want this inexpensive, reliable, sexy .45 to come home with you. This is an excellent nightstand, range, EDC gun. It can and will do everything, reliably and humbly. It is incredibly accurate and fun to shoot.

First with the cash takes it. I can do FTF on FA10 anywhere in the Worcester - to - Uxbridge area. Thanks!

PM me here or email REDACTED or for faster response, text or call me at REDACTED

I can email pics to anyone, but it looks exactly like the ones on Ruger's website. No difference at all, no blemishes on the gun.

Buck Mark Pistols. Rimfire pistols, built the Browning way.
Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX™ and Ultragrip DX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes"

It has some bumps and nicks in the stock, but that is to be expected for a rifle of this vintage. While it was made during WWII it still retains the pre-war scallop cut on the receiver. While the bore is a little dark, the rifling is sharp and the bolt is pretty darn smooth. With 147gr surplus ammo I am able to get groups of about 3.5"" with the iron sights at 100 yards. I have taken it to 490 yards on a torso-sized plate using the iron sights and was able to make consistent hits using the tangent sights and holding a little low and left. Not bad for an old mosin!

I paid a little more for this rifle since I knew how nicely it shot, and that is why I am asking a little more than the typical $100.

It will come with several stripper clips, 5 rounds of surplus ammo, as well as the cleaning kit and pouches.

As for trades, unless its for large pistol primers, small rifle primers, match 70+gr .224 projectiles, and/or powder suitable for .223 or .308/30-06 I probably won't be too interested. I'd also be interested in a big pelican case as I will be doing some road-tripping this summer and will need one to transport my rifles in on top of my jeep.

This is a super powerful 45-70+P loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on to them) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese Mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 300gr. TSX long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as they typical 350+gr. lead core expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and gives flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 2200+ fps is screaming and is powerful and for those that understand the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit to many shooters, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

2215 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22 inch barrel
2201 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18 inch barrel
Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

""The Remington 870 shotgun is one of the most popular shotgun models ever manufactured, so it was a natural fit for Firefield to develop a red dot specifically for this firearm,"" said Jeff Murray, Vice President of National Accounts. ""This unit is a great fit for several applications whether you're using it to hunt deer or turkey, or for personal security.""

That time of year again where I buy out the brass from a Wisconsin police range. Range does not allow reloads. This time they quit offering 40 and 45 so officers had to bring their own so as you can imagine there is very little other than 9mm that they supply. This year they also did more small purchases so there are several brands from Winchester, CBC and FC.

So, only 9mm available this year. Polished will be $32 per 1000. 2 Bucks less if you want to clean and polish it yourself.  Only have 850 pounds this year :-) 480 pounds left 4/16  355 4/24

Only interested in a cash sale or trade for another C&R gun (Enfields, Mosins, that sort of thing) or ammo. No hunting rifles or shotguns please unless it's a bolt action suitable for a youngster. Would prefer a FTF deal around north Pittsburgh but will ship if you cover the cost. I will require a C&R or better or a transfer at an FFL will be needed for the pistol. Buyer pays transfer. Cash price of the P64 is $220 and I would add cash for a trade if necessary. 

I hate to do this but: please don't offer $150, ask me to trade straight up for a hardwood-stocked 91/30, or request that I drive an hour to meet you.  This is an inexpensive gun and I'm just looking for something new, not desperate to make a mortgage payment! If I can't find anything interesting it'll just stay in the safe.

Comes with 3 Glock 15 round mags and original box. This gun is in very good shape, no imperfections. The extra barrel is fantastic.

Additional accessories include: 

Lone Wolf aftermarket .40 cal barrel (this is in addition to the Glock factory .40 barrel, and was bought to save money and shoot lead at the range), 
magwell, 
Glock 25 anniversary box (in addition to the original Glock box), 
Glockworx stainless steel guide rod and Glockworx 14 lb recoil spring,
Night sights installed (the rear sight is Trijicon), I added a Hiviz green front sight. 

The original Glock guide rod and spring are included. The original recoil spring assembly is installed in the gun along with the Lone Wolf barrel. The original barrel, the stainless guide rod and aftermarket spring are out of the gun and showing in the picture.

This is a great accurate shooter, I outfitted it for a good range gun and a great home defense gun. The value of this package is for the shooter that actually shoots their guns: the LW barrel allows much cheaper lead bullets/ reloads to be used as opposed to pricey factory ammo, the magwell and the bright sights make for better grip/ faster reloads and better accuracy through a better sight picture. 
If these accessories are not important to you just buy a new G-22- if they are of value you will save +$150 buying this package. And this gun fits the hand better and has better sights than a new G22.

This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping.  Photos show some of the first ever used trade in, genuine factory Smith & Wesson High Capacity Magazines for the M&P .40 Smith & Wesson Caliber or .357 Sig Caliber Pistols. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson, Construction is serrated body matte blue steel with black polymer floorplate and cartridge followers. Capacity is 15 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson or .357 Sig calibers ammunition. These magazines themselves show the most significant of Smith & Wesson’s improvement upon Gaston Glock’s design; these magazines hold together, free-fall eject, and always lock the slide open just like they’re supposed to, something that cannot be said for Glock pistols and their magazines, admirable though they are. These magazines come from a distinguished Department in New England, and they are well maintained. Surface detractions principally amount to edge whitening from magazine case contact, and occasional finish freckling. We rate them as Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, but photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. They are certainly excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Single mag price is $39. We’re offering them, however, in lots of 3 or more at $26 per.

This pistol is an absolute tack-driving combat-ready pistol and was awesome for IDPA and other tactical shooting competitions. Great choice for all-around defensive use in any scenario. The P226 was originally designed for military use and narrowly lost out to the Beretta M9 as the new standard issue sidearm for U.S. military forces only because the M9 was cheaper to mass produce. While conventional forces were issued M9's, many Special Operations units opted for the P226 and various models of it are still in use today by elite Military, Gov't agencies, and private security personnel world-wide. This model features an Nitron-coated stainless steel slide, anodized aluminum frame, ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE Adjustable Combat Night Sights (made by Trijicon), custom aluminum grips (made for Sig Sauer by Hogue) and has the Short Reset Trigger (SRT) system designed to reduce trigger reset by 60% for smoother faster and more accurate follow-up shots. Being a DA/SA with de-cocking lever, it maintains safety features intended for a great defensive handgun without using a manual safety lever that could hinder the shooter from rapidly engaging targets under stressful situations. Also features a MILSTD 1913 picatinny rail for mounting a tactical light/laser This package will include the pistol with fully adjustable night sights, the premium factory aluminum grips and the beautiful new factory rosewood grips, 5 magazines (3-15rd Sig mags, 2-17rd MecGar mags), like new Galco leather 3-slot holster, 50 rds Federal 115 gr FMJ range ammo, 20 rds of 135 gr Hornady Critical Duty +P defensive ammo, and factory hard case. Approximately 450 flawless rounds of only quality made factory ammo (no corrosive, mil surplus, or reloads) through it. Thoroughly cleaned after every range session and immaculately maintained. I trust this pistol with the lives of me and my family without hesitation and rest assured you can too! Bottom dollar price is $925 (cash only) for the entire package listed above. I'm wanting to round out my WWII collection so a trade involving a M1 Garand is possible. Do your research and do the math and you'll see what a great deal this is (Sig mags alone $35-$50 each) without having to pay sales tax, shipping, or transfer fees when buying retail. FTF only in DFW area. You must be legal to purchase and possess a firearm in Texas.

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in some parts of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping.  Photos show some of the first ever used trade in, genuine factory Smith & Wesson High Capacity Magazines for the M&P .40 Smith & Wesson Caliber or .357 Sig Caliber Pistols. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson, Construction is serrated body matte blue steel with black polymer floorplate and cartridge followers. Capacity is 15 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson or .357 Sig calibers ammunition. These magazines themselves show the most significant of Smith & Wesson’s improvement upon Gaston Glock’s design; these magazines hold together, free-fall eject, and always lock the slide open just like they’re supposed to, something that cannot be said for Glock pistols and their magazines, admirable though they are. These magazines come from a distinguished Department in New England, and they are well maintained. Surface detractions principally amount to edge whitening from magazine case contact, and occasional finish freckling. We rate them as Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, but photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. They are certainly excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Single mag price is $39. We’re offering them, however, in lots of 3 or more at $26 per. Own 3	for	 only		$ 78.00.			Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Chicago / Cook County IL, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, or any jurisdiction where 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items,  entire accessory orders only $10.00 USPS Priority Mail with Adult Signature, total shipping no matter how many a person buys.

A family friendly event, the goal of this forum is to give Alabama citizens a chance to meet the candidates of the upcoming state elections and to hear where they stand on important issues.

""Votes should not be determined solely by whether a candidate has an 'R' or a 'D' next to their name on the ballot, or by who has the most convincing television ad. We should cast our votes based on a candidate's history, their passion, their convictions, and their stance on the issues. This is a great opportunity for people to really get to know their candidates."" -- Stephen Burton, Director of Marketing and Public Relations for GRAA. 

Though the event will be held at a local firearms store and is cosponsored by gun rights groups, Second Amendment issues will not be the only topics discussed. 
All candidates from across the state are invited to come out and speak.

Item G-34718-1.

The Kel-Tec SU-16 version of the AR-15 rifle featured a barrel and mechanism composed of 4140 steel, but the remainder of the gun was constructed of DuPont Zytel, or reinforced polymer. The forend could be unlatched, splitting in half to drop down and form a bipod. We found that the amount of support this bipod offered was not rock solid but it was helpful when used in conjunction with additional support. For this reason our accuracy tests were performed with the forend locked into the traditional position. However, when we received the SU-16 we had difficulty locking both halves of the forend into place along the barrel. We were finally able to seat the forend by removing material along the edges where the two pieces met. The magazine release was in the familiar position just ahead of the trigger guard on the right side, but the safety and the charging bolt varied from standard AR-15 design. The safety was a crossbolt assembly mounted above and to the rear of the trigger guard instead of being available to the thumb on the left side of the weapon. The safety was hollow on the right side and capped on the left side. (Safety off required pushing the bolt right to left). The charging mechanism was a simple bar operating just above the magazine well on the right side. 

The sights on the SU-16 consisted of an oversize aperture rear sight that was mounted on the Picatinny rail and a hooded front blade that sat about 2 inches above the muzzle. The front sight can be moved left and right to change windage and up or down to effect elevation. The manual provided exact information regarding how much the sight was to be moved versus the resulting change in point of impact. The rear sight can be moved forward or back, resulting in a change of sight radius that would further change elevation. However, in our opinion, the locking pin was seated so tightly into the rail that attempting to remove it would cause irreparable damage to the pin, the sight, the rail or all three. So, we decided to leave it in place and live with the original point of impact, which at 50 yards turned out to be about 10 inches high.

The serial is 229951. All numbers on the frame, barrel, trigger guard, and butt plate match. The cylinder is stamped olts Patent no 29951. The stamping on the cylinder missed it's mark and is off to the left and the ""c"" for Colt did not hit the cylinder. It was hard to get a picture of this. The stagecoach scene is all but gone I can barely make out the wagon wheel. If the gun is pointed at the floor the cylinder will rotate when the hammer is pulled but if the gun is held level the cylinder will not rotate when the hammer is pulled. The trigger will release the hammer. The packing rod is operational but stiff. There are a couple screws missing one in front of the cylinder just below the barrel on the left side and one on the brass backstrap.

Comes with factory box and test target, but no manual.

Has two ten round mags that came with the gun. I am including a 15 round P226 mag that functions in this gun but doesnt fit flush with the bottom of the grip. I'm including two thirty round mags that I bought just for fun in the mid 1990's, I dont recall the manufacturer. Factory OEM 15 round flush fit mags are available, I just never bought any.

They dont make German quality Sigs anymore and they dont make the P228 anymore either.
