Will negotiate for cash (best offer). I understand that this ammo isn't worth anything to me, but no lowballs. $249 is $0.41/round. This is $0.04 cheaper than the 1000-bulk pack from bulkammo.com (and that doesn't include shipping).

-text me directly at 480.seven one 7. two four. 59. You can call, but text is better and faster.

ID will be checked for transfer of ammunition. You must be 21 years old, with a valid license and be willing to sign a bill of sale. If CCW holder, no bill of sale required.

If selling or trading, we will find a public place to meet that is convenient for both of us. My preference is to meet at the Rio Salado Sportsman's Club, Bass Pro Shop Mesa, or Caswell's Shooting Range, but we'll figure out what works for both of us. I'm easygoing.

Buy the IWI Tavor and receive 30% off a STI Patriot III 45 acp

The most interesting and highly reviewed firearms new for 2013: the Israeli IWI Tavor bull pup. Specifically this is the compact black TSIDF16 model, chambered for caliber 5.56mm NATO (.223 Rem also). Furthermore, this is the hard-to-get IDF model, with milspec Meprolite M21 optic installed from the factory. This is the same optic on the selectfire TAR21. This is a 100% factory new firearm, fresh in from IWI. It comes with 1 high capacity magazine and accessories. 
Much has already been said about the new Tavor TSB, so i won't go into great detail here about it. Needless to say, that if it is built tough enough to meet the needs of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), it is more than strong enough for any shooter in the USA. 
The TSIDF16 features a 16.5"" long Cold Hammer Forged chromelined barrel, with removable flash hider. It is built from Israeli parts, in the US by IWI-USA. The IDF Model comes from the factory with a true milspec optic. The Meprolite M21 uses both fiber-optic and tridium inserts, so its always on and can be used in any lighting condition. This M21 even has the 'bullseye' aiming point which is what the IDF uses. The optic is mounted to the barrel securely, so it maintains perfect zero all the time. Behind it, there is an additional mounting point for a magnifier or other siting device. Other features include: removable side rail, fully ambidextrous controls, flip-up backup iron sights, easy to use mag catch & bolt release controls, and the ability to feed from standard AR15 magazines. The Tavor SAR is just like its military TAR counterpart, but limited to semi-auto only operations. It has prooven just as reliable, durable, and accurate. 
This auction is for a 100% factory new and fresh in from IWI, Tavor TSIDF16 black bullpup. It comes with the standard factory accessories, including 1 - 30 rd IWI marked polymer magazine, cleaning kit, and quick detaching sling swivels. It comes in the factory box with operator's manual and warranty. This is a very well thoughtout and executed 21st century bullpup carbine. These have been very difficult to get, especially the IDF Model, and I feel lucky to have been able to get this one for a customer, he backed out, his loss your gain. This is exactly what I have into the rifle,, will eat shipping to your FFL.

This has been my EDC recently, due to requirements of some training I am undergoing soon, I need to finance a Beretta M9A1. I am switching to a .357 for EDC anyway, so its not that much of a loss to me.

Like I said it has been an EDC weapon for me, so it has a scratch on the grip, and the finish on the magazines isn't NIB quality (dry fire drills, practicing mag changes and what not). I tried to get the worst of it in the pics but as you can see its really not that bad. Its got a fairly low round count (about 400 rds) since I got the thing. I can put 95 out of 100 rds of Federal 9mm ball in a face sized target at 25 feet. This thing is scary accurate. 

It comes with SIG LITE night sights, E2 grips, and a Galco Gun Leather Holster .

This weapon cost me 945.00 so I feel that 840.00 is a more than fair asking price. If you low ball me or message we with any trade that isn't what is listed bellow don't expect a reply."

The 5.56 Midlength Evo Ultra Lite 14.5″ Upper is a .625″ lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12″ tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the combination of the .625″ ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution rail, amd the new ultra lite .625″ gas block, we not have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you’ll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own. lower had a crisp trigger break at 3.5pounds magpul stock magpul flip up sights. this is a top of the line AR15"

Comes with two holsters: a DeSantis tuckable IWB model, and the original (somewhat beat up) holster it came with when it was originally issued to Czech police. It's an ugly holster, but it holds the extra mag, so there's that. Plus it doesn't really look like a holster; you could open carry and nobody would know.

This pistol is nearly 30 years old, so it's not in mint condition. It does feel quite solid in the hand though and shoots well. I've never had a problem with it. The importer didn't do the best job in the world with their marks and there is some cosmetic blemish as a result. You can see its imperfections pretty well in the photos.

The rest of the components in the lower were from a new PSA build kit.

The upper was ordered from Lancer Systems and it includes a low-profile gas block under their LCH rifle length carbon fiber handguard. Lancer systems is big with the 3-Gun crowd for their light weight and ability to mount accessories anywhere along the length of the handguard and every 45 degrees around. Thanks to the light weight of the upper this carbine weighs a bit less than 6.5 lbs. with the empty magazine inserted. Included is one new MagPul FDE 30 round PMAG.

Description from ad.
Stoeger Cougar 8040F, double-action, auto-loading pistol is a perfect choice for defense, with no-nonsense, rugged performance you can rely on when it matters most. With the finest technology and proven features, the compact Cougar delivers excellent accuracy and manageable recoil. The barrel rotates to lock with the slide, for added strength and accuracy when lives are on the line. Stoeger's standard, quick-read, three-dot sight system is designed for fast target acquisition. The ambidextrous safety and decocking lever is easily accessible to the thumb of a right-handed or left-handed shooter. The Cougar's rounded edges provide snag-free drawing, a plus when every moment counts. This pistol features a synthetic grip and includes two 11-round magazines and a factory carrying case. Also includes box and instructions plus cleaning rod and two bore brushes"
