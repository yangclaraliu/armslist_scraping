Up for sale is a very, very nice shooting S&W No dash Model 19 with a nickel finish. In mint condition these go for $1k +. This no dash model 19 would be an excellent candidate to be sent to S&W for restoration ($350 I believe). This gun is used and was a police sidearm. The finish has lots of light swirls that could be polished out. They are only visible up close. The finish looks beautiful from 6 inches away. But there are some light scratches on the side plate over the S&W logo where the holster snap was. They are light and do not go all the way through the nickel. I will add that picture later since I cant find it in my files.

The trigger is perfection. Smooth double action and the trigger goes off if you look at it in single action. No cylinder fore/aft play and very good lockup. The bore is excellent.

I buy/sell/trade guns all the time as a way to try as many as I can. I'm not interested in revolvers at all but I have held onto this for longer than any handgun I have purchased in the last two years. This thing is awesome and I have never been more accurate with any other pistol. I planned that if I kept it until next year I would send it in for restoration and keep it forever. 

I never believed it but there is something special about these classic S&W revolvers. the trigger is smooth, the fit and finish is amazing you can really feel the difference in quality than in modern semi autos. I wish you could get this kind of soul in a semi auto.

I do not need to sell, I have had a few unexpected technology items break and need replacing so the ""toy"" fund is low so I'm selling this excellent pistol.

Price is $600 OBO cash preferred but I will consider some trades. No other revolvers!!!

The Mossberg SSi-one break action single shot is a rifle/shotgun. It looks a bit similar to the No. 1 Ruger at a glance. I like the feel of the gun at the shoulder better than a Remington Model 700, and even better than my pre-1964 Winchester model 70 featherweight 308. The original rifle  came with the 243 barrel. All 4 barrels below come with the combo.

270 Barrel

22-250 Heavy Barrel
12 gauge ported turkey barrel with screw in choke
The rifle is in nice condition with only very minor aesthetic imperfections. The scopes are included. The 22-250 did not come with a scope base, but the screws are present and 
either of the 270 or 243 bases will fit. This is a very nice set. I have not seen a set with this many barrels for sale. FTF local transaction only. Scopes are not included. A box of 22-250, 243, and a box with 18 rounds of 270 ammo come with the gun. The no haggle price of $625 takes it all."

I am an honorable member of this forum and have many people that I can reference who I have personally done business with here before.

This series RMR requires no batteries, because it utilizes tritium and fiber optics to illuminate the reticle. The reticle is an amber triangle. This is far superior to a dot because you use the apex of the triangle as your point of aim rather than the center of a dot. The smallest dot Trijicon offers in this model is 7 MOA, that means it covers 7 inches at 100 yards, 14 inches at 200yds, 21 inches at 300, etc...  You put the triangle at the top of center mass and you have a ""kill shot"" from 0-300yds.

I would sit in it and change gears without the motor running and pretend to drive but didn't actually go anywhere. It only has a few miles on it and is just like BRAND NEW!!!! I'm not going to sell it cheap.........besides being a Pre-Ban, it has been owned by ME and that makes it worth something in and of itself. I will personally provided notarized documents that I owned it so it's value retention will be assured. Who am I? Heck if I even know anymore but it sure sounds good!!!!

Why go buy a brand new one when this powderpuff has been cared for by ME and now it can be yours for only $14000. Here's the photo from the last Car Show we entered it in! 

Also,  if you are Obama's Aunt in Kenya and still want to purchase this where you contacted me through Craigslist.......I've decided I will ship it to you now.

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. This is a used sight that has cosmetic scrapes and wear on the exterior of the scope but the glass and optics are in very good condition and the red chevron is very bright during daylight and still has a good glow at night. It comes with the flat top base that is shown in the pictures. It was manufactured in 2008. Call or text REDACTED"

I have previously owned a Colt Defender and a Colt Night defender and they were both excellent pistols but got traded somewhere down the line. So I was eager to have another and jumped on it when one became available again.
I am basically a Kimber guy and really love their pistols and own several, they are tight, accurate and sometimes tempermental. On the other hand the several Colts that I have owned rattle when you shake them, sometimes are not finished well and may seem dated. But more importantly they have always been reliable, shot every time I pulled the trigger and have always been accurate. I have never doubted that a Colt would not come through for me if I ever needed it to. This Defender is no different. I have only had it two days but have put 300 mixed rounds through it with absolutely no problems. For me the 3"" 1911's are the perfect carry pistols and are very accurate to 25 yards and further with practice. This Defender has a great finish, looks good and feels good in my hand and loaded is light enough for all day carry. Even with it's light weight, recovery shots are just as quick as with my Kimber Super Carry Ultra HD which is much heavier with its steel frame.
All said if you are looking for a reliable 3"" 1911, you really can't go wrong with the Colt Defender and it's proven history."
