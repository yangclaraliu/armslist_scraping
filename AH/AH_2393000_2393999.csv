EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. 
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

Product Description
The A300 Outlander is a reliable solution for shotgunners willing to step into the Beretta world of superior semi-auto performance at a price anyone can afford. Beretta's patented gas system is self-cleaning, low maintenance, and tested with tens of millions of rounds. The receiver is machined from solid aluminum with a hard anodized matte black coating that prevents corrosion and wear. The trigger guard is made of heavy-duty polymer with a larger opening for ease of operation and a wear-resistant finish. Younger shooters love the A300 as well because the Outlander grows with you. Casts and spacers are used to increase or decrease length-of-pull and change cast. The shotgun uses a Mobilchoke system with three chokes (F/M/IC) included.

No scratches or dings, includes box, printed out owners manual and 1-6rd Magazine.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Mounts to the Glock rear dovetail for the rear sight and allows mounting a Trijicon RMR miniature sight to any Glock slide, without milling the slide.

Allows you to approximate the function of the RMR red dot sight on your pistol, before committing to cutting up the slide. Mounting is compatible with Trijicon RMR sights (not sure if it fits others-- it would if it has the same footprint).  

Or if you are happy with it, staying with it, and you can save money on permanently altering the slide, and also reverse it, if the time comes to move on.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

I bought this gun brand new on Jan 28, 2013 for $414 (still have the receipt to show you to prove the original cost) I got it to shoot in a .22 league over the summer. I got very addicted to shooting competitively and to shoot in the indoor .22 league I want to be in this winter, I have to use open sights which this gun does not have, it is a scope only rifle. I am only selling this gun to pay for another .22 with open sights. This gun is truly in great shape. I literally sighted it in, shot it during my league, cleaned it regularly, and kept it in a case. There are NO marks on the gun, plus it is less than a year old. I am asking $350, that is all the more of a hit I am willing to take on this gun, it is worth more to me unused in the box than selling it for less than that. If you buy this gun I will throw in an unopened box of 325 Federal 1200 fps .22 ammo because I understand that a lot of people don't have .22 ammo.

It was made for the military of Peruvian Government on lease for Mauser, by FN, at the facility in Hertsal Belgium.  These rifles were made between 1935 and 1936.  Due to influence of the Peruvian national marksmanship team, the flip wing safety was reversed.  These are the only Mausers ever made in this configuration.  The weapon was on safe when the safety was on the left side ( in front of the shooters eye) and on fire when the safe was on the right side (opposite of the shooters eye). 
    Both the Peruvian seal on the front of the action and the model number on the side, show this  rifle to be a Peruvian model 1935.
   These were the last bolt action rifles purchased by the Peruvians.  They stayed in service until the 1950's when the Government of Peru purchases 30-06 surplus rifles from the US.  Some of the model 1935 Mausers were converted to 30-06's either the factory in Belgium or
By their technicians.  They got new barrels and were rebuilt.  This rife is one of those as can be seen by the "".30"" they all had stamped into the Lower receiver.
   Besides it's undetermined value due to its rarity, this is a silky smooth auctioned, accurate and fun gun to shoot.  30-06 ammo is still readily availible and is a great round for hunting everything in North America.  It would be sporterized with little effort for hunting.
   This is a quality Mauser action and would also be perfect for building a custom Mauser rifle in virtually any caliber one could choose.
    This gun is worth every penny being asked right now, and potentially a lot more. Photos are availible upon request."

RAND CLP is non toxic, odorless, safe on all metals, polymers and woods and provides faster & easier cleaning after the initial pretreatment.

RAND CLP helps with:

• Carbon build-up/fouling removal
• Rust prevention
• Jamming/malfunctions
• Water displacement
• Dirt, lint, dust - does not attach to the metal
• More functional, accurate, durable firearm
• Smoother slide, action and trigger pull

The state of the art nanotechnology we use allows our nano-particles to work their way into the metal in your firearm and form a protective shield against rust, carbon and dirt. The vegetable oil acts as a scavenger, “lifting” the carbon/fouling from the metal, allowing it to be wiped away easily during cleaning. 

After extensive testing by Kyle Lamb of Viking Tactics (VTAC), this product is endorsed by VTAC. I have been personally using it for almost a year, and prefer it to anything else on the market. I am currently sold out of the 4-oz. bottles, but just had a shipment of the 2-oz. size come in. Give RAND CLP a try and you'll find yourself using it for all of your firearms as well as other uses around the house, shop or farm. 

I am in the Georgetown / Lexington / Nicholasville areas most of the time and can meet you in those areas.

Heckler & Koch - Umarex -  Manufactured by Walther

DETAILS:
The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.
Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.
The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

OPERATION:
The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

Every round ive fired through it has been since the trigger job was done and ive never had one issue or one jam.

It has the og rings and a centerpoint scope on it, not sure which model but it is a 4-16 mil dot and is illumintated red or green, and has turrets and parallax adjustments, I don't have a battery in it but I just put one in from my aimpoint and it does work.

Produced in January, 1981 but still feels solid as new.

This is the German Police version of the P225 and is single-stack with an 8rd capacity making it legal to own in some less gun-friendly areas. Features are the same as other Sig-Sauer pistols and most aftermarket accessories will fit this model including grips, hammers, sights etc.

From what I have seen, these guns *lose* value when modified so I left it as-is, including the holster wear, original grips and the notched hammer. Research has told me this was to indicate if the pistol had been dropped on it's hammer so the armourers could pull it from service but as you can see, this one is intact.

German-made Sig-Sauer pistols are the best in my opinion and they hold value very well. This one is being sold to fund an NFA item and must go soon since the wait is... long.

I'm asking $545 cash or offer, no trades please. Prefer face-to-face sale with Nevada ID but this gun IS legal in most 'ban' states including CA and I would consider selling/transferring to such states at the buyer's expense. It is NOT on the CA dealer-approved list but CAN be transferred at a CA dealer person-to-person.
