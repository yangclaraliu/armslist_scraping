Brief Introduction:
By projecting a laser beam from the center of the barrel axis of firearm, this laser bore sight collimator allows you to instantly&accurately set your sight or scope etc. The laser light emitting from the laser bore tool travels in a straight line while the bullet follows a trajectory. Even though the use of this device will get you very close, final adjustment should be made at the range."

I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

Back and sides are Sepele Mahoghany with a Rosewood fretboard. Bone nut and saddle as well as set-up and, a few years ago, I had 3 or 4 frets professionally replaced in the cowboy chord position.

The case does show some outside wear including a worn spot through the covering and into the wood, but no hole. It was on the road with me for a few years.

I will replace the brass bridgepins with the original plastic ones and take the the Dunlop strap lock off of the front (and replace if I can put my hands on the original)

I really thought I would keep this, but found a Gibson Songwriter deluxe over the last week and something has to go.

I will leave it here a few days and then off to e-bay.

Trust me, I am always first in line to bring pro-citizen rights forward but I believe that one detail has been over looked. IKEA does have a childcare area in their store so parents can shop at a more leisurely pace. I am not certain, but I would guess that the ""NO GUNS"" may be in direct correlation with Ohio State Law regarding child care facilities. I am NOT saying that is the situation, but is something to consider before waging a boycott.

It has a 4"" target crowned, under lug vent ribbed barrel with oversized grips.  Comes with ALL the paperwork, including the test-fired round from the factory.  Also comes with the original box and packing.  
I've only fired it a few times, so it essentially looks like brand new.  There are NO blemishes of any kind.  With the indigo adjustable sights, it's a pretty accurate little weapon.  Being a little heavier than the other mini-revolvers (weighing 10.7 Oz), it has almost no recoil with .22 LR, but a little more than that with mag rounds.   Still very comfortable and fun to shoot.   You can shoot all day for pennies with the LR cylinder, but the mag cylinder with 4"" barrel would plenty enough to ward off a grizzly bear.  OK, maybe not a bear, but a bobcat or dog no problem!
Thanks for looking.  Please include you phone number to ward off the scammers.  Also I'll want to see some ID and a Good-guy card of some kind.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Overall length is 57” and it weighs 28.7#. Includes one 10 round mag, Pelican case, rear mono-pod, adjustable bipod and operator’s manual."
