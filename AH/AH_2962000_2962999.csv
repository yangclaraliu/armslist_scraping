This is not a Countersniper scope. It was manufactured by the same company that sells the scopes to Countersniper who then simply puts their name on it. This is the exact same scope, without the Countersniper logo. Built for military snipers. Specs can be found on the Countersniper website.

Never been mounted or used. No scratches or marks anywhere. Brand New!

Brand New Military Spec 34mm Mounting rings are included. Cost me $150 by themselves.

Other scope in pics is a Leupold 3-9 Vari-X II for comparison. Leupold scope and deer rifle not for sale.

Unbelievable range. 4x zoom for the closeup shots and up to 50x zoom for those 1000 yard shots. If you know scopes, you know what this is worth.

$500 cash. Price is firm. Saving cash for a gift for the wife... but I really don't need the money. Offers below $500 will be ignored.

Thanks."

Excellent condition. Purchased new in 2013. Smaller SF frame. Round count exactly 414 rounds. Well cared for nightstand gun that has NO holster wear. Has NEW decal grip panels. These can be removed easily, but I found that they greatly increased grip and follow-up accuracy (perfect for nightstand gun). Also has installed new Meprolight TruDot night sights and a steel guide rod assembly (steel/night sights and steel guide rod are generally thought of as must have upgrades for Glocks). Comes with factory box, factory guide rod and papers. Also comes with the two factory 13 round magazines and 2 additional UNUSED 10 round magazines (still have packaging). I purchased the 10 round mags specifically for if/when a magazine capacity ban happens. They are hard to find right now and will likely only get harder. This way you won't have to worry about having a gun but not having any mags you can use to shoot it with if a ban occurs. If this doesn't concern you, they will make great shooting range mags. Asking $575 OBO. If you purchased new, it would likely cost you about $525 for the pistol, $10 to OSP, $100 (plus install) for the sights, $30 for the guide rod and $30+ for each new magazine (I paid $33 each for mine). That comes to over $700. Thanks for looking. Oregon residents only. Face-to-face sale. Must be legally allowed to own a firearm."

Extremely accurate and reliable.  I took it out this past weekend & put about 100 rds thru it - the first it has been shot since the sights, trigger work, & Cerakote.  Adjusted sights & made sure it functioned perfectly with different types of ball & hollowpoint ammo.  Barrel, frame, slide, grips, grip safety, hammer, extractor, ejector, mainspring housing, &  firing pin safety have about 500 rds total.  Remainder of parts have 100 rds.  

CCW or PPP & bill of sale.

Price is firm - a lot of time & money went into customizing this gun and making it an ultra-reliable, tack driving, carry gun.  I'd rate the condition 99% overall. Very minor finish wear on the barrel from firing and very slight marks on the sights from adjusting but overall looks like a brand new gun.

I'm not in any rush or desperate need to sell.  If I end up keeping it I won't mind.  I won't respond to lowball offers.  Not interested in trades at this time 0 need to raise cash for a large purchase.

The Garand receiver is dated to May of 1955 along with the barrel. All parts are correct for this rifle, I cross referenced build sheets, manuals, and several collector websites that are knowledgable in the M1 Garand. I collect and restore M1 Garands for a hobby, so I know what they are, what makes them correct, and what they are worth. 

The Garand you are looking at is the one at the bottom of the three. The rifle has the correct 1.5"" DAS and circled P on the stock. Everything down to the gas plug and springs are right on this beauty. The only thing questionable is the top forward most handguard, but to fix that will cost you some time on eBay and about $40. I wasn't too particular about that since there are no markings of any kind on hanguards to identify them as SA. 

This M1 Garand is also unique in the fact that it is a 5.7 million serial number block. The 5.7m range isn't a common find and only about 6,000 were ever produced due to HRA making a stink about SA using their serial block. My value on the rifle is $1700 OBO. If you know anything about M1 Garands, you'll know that I'm on the lower end in price, especially if you're a CMP forum member."

The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail™ 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

I bought it in factory condition with a 5 1\4"" barrel on it. I put the hammer bushing mod into it which improves he magazine release and allows the magazine to drop more freely. I also removed the magazine disconnect so the trigger will still function without the magazine in it. I had the barrel cut down to 4"" and threaded it for a suppressor/flash suppressor/ compensator. Was threaded with 1\2-28 threads with an 11 degree target crown on the end. The trigger group has been cleaned up and polished to clean up the action of the trigger and drop the trigger pull slightly. The trigger group has a very clean break to it. The pistol also includes a factory thread protector to protect the threads when not using attachments. The grip also has grip tape installed to enhance the ergonomics of the grip and helps provide memory of the hands to grip the pistol the same every time. I will be happy to remove this grip tape if not desired to be on the handle by the purchaser. The gun functions perfectly with zero issues. I bought and built this gun for speed pistol competitions, but decided to go to different platform which renders this pistol useless to me. I will sell to Indiana residents with proof of identification. All out of state residents will need to go through an FFL to be able to purchase. This FFL transfer is not included in the price and will be required to be paid and performed by you. You can get a hold of me @ REDACTED, my name is Joe. You can also e-mail me through this ad.

For: Springfield XDM Standard 4.5"" barrel in 9mm and .40 cal

Easier to see: Highly visible pulsating laser allows for faster target acquisition and re-acquisition. Research proves that the human eye is drawn to pulsating objects - just like caution lights, police and ambulance lights, and even school bus lights.

Activation is easy: Single sided teardrop switching system activates or deactivate with a simple flip of the switch. You decide when the laser is needed, leaving no chance for accidental activation alerting an intruder.

Holsterability: With the Guide Rod Laser for the XDM there's no need to have a custom holster. The Guide Rod Laser even fits the standard holster that comes in the package with the XDM.

Action is smooth, as this is a Benelli M1 clone, and even takes Benelli chokes. POSSIBLE TURKEY GUN!!!

Comes with an ATI +3 magazine extension (in factory package, not installed) and whatever high brass ammo I have on hand, maybe 20+ rounds. Well over a $50 value. Gun will come with factory ported choke, improved cylinder choke, wrench, box and manual.

This shotgun reliably feeds everything. It eats birdshot, buckshot, it doesnt care! The only flaw on the whole gun is marring/indentions where I tightened a red dot to the sight rail too tightly. That factors into why im selling so cheap. It literally affects nothing function wise on the  gun, which has been 100% reliable. Only reason im selling is to fund another project.
