This rifle is the .22 version of the Sig 556 classic. This is an awesome and fun .22 plinker. It also has the Swiss stock unlike some of the versions floating around out there. I hate to sell this rifle but it has sat in the safe for a long time. I only have 60 rounds through it total. This also makes a great alternative to a ruger 10/22 if you are interested in mounting an optic. The rifle will come with the original 25 round Mag and also the rear sight. I removed it for a red dot. I also do not have a case so that is something you should bring.If interested please email; I am not really interested in trades. I will not sell to you without a valid Michigan I.D I also will produce a bill of sale containing the serial number for both of us. I am also a CPL holder so everything is good on my end.

It does not come with the scope or bipod in the picture, but it's easy to slap a .22 scope on and rock it for around $30. It has a bull barrel, accu trigger, and a 5 round steel mag. Smooth auction, very fun to shoot. I'm asking $250 cash or a trade for a decent 12 gauge. Located on Fort Riley. (Maybe open to other trades)"

Been in my family since new. Built in March of 1949, my grandfather bought it new a few years after the war when he returned to the U.S. Unfortunately, he only got to use it a couple years. It was passed down to my mom who had it professionally cleaned and stored. She does not shoot. About 10 years ago, it was passed to me. I've taken it to the range and probably have put about 40 rounds through it. Function wise it is the most satisfying rifle I have ever shot. The bolt is like butter and the trigger is crisp. It has the lever style safety that switches very precisely. The rifle is beautiful and everyone I have showed it to, friends and professionals, have always complimented me on it. I have decided it is time to let it go. I don't hunt and although I take it out every few months to clean it, there is no range around here that has the distance to shoot it at. I have Harper Ferry Civil War rifle that was also passed down to me and figure I will keep that one and can let this go. If you know about these rifles and are looking for a pre 1964 you will really appreciate this one. This could be used as your main hunting rifle, occasional rifle, or collectors item. I've been told by one gun store to list it $1500 OBO and one at $1250 OBO. I am just going to ask $1000 straight up. That way no negotiations have to take place, you can come check it out and if you want it, $1000 will take it. Just to sum it up, it's all original. Never been refinished. Excellent condition stock, barrel, bore, bolt, trigger, etc. It has vintage Weaver swing model scope rings that allow you to swing the scope to the left to load the rifle. The rings themselves are actually rare and worth a fair amount. Also included is a Uncle Mike's leather sling and padded soft case that's  made from ballistic nylon on the outside. FTF, located in Arlington. Easy parking at my condo and can use conference room to transfer. I have hige res picturesif interested. Thanks, Mike"

It is a pistol made specifically for pocket holster carry. In jeans or loose shorts, the gun doesn't print at all. It is the most comfortable to pistol I have ever carried. The pistol has a 6+1 capacity and I have two magazines (1 came with the gun). You can easily swap the base plates to either have a pinky extension or be completely flush. I have two of each type of plate.The laser on the front can be actuated by the trigger finger or on the other side, by the thumb of the support hand. One press puts it on, steady. The second makes the laser blink. The third turns it back off. This gun was made to be fired at very close range. The double action only trigger is heavy and deliberate, which some say is preferable in high anxiety shooting scenarios (less likely to go off from an accidental squeeze if you are surprised). In spite of the heavy trigger, this gun at least goes *bang* every single time I pull it. Jerry Miculek actually has a video of shooting a torso sized target at 200 yards with this gun, stock. Check it out on YouTube! I would say that for us, mere mortals, the gun is effective up to 25 yds away.Comes with the factory zip-up nylon bag, original cardboard box, Tagua pocket holster, 116 rounds of 380 auto FMJ, 19 Hollow Points, two magazines with alternate base plates, and (of course) the gun.Please no trade offers.A breakdown of my investment in this gun:Gun and holster + tax = $431.16Extra Mag - $202 Boxes of FMJ ammo (not including the partial box) - $3519/20 rounds of 1 Box of Hollow Points - $19Total Investment: ~$500I think the $450 price is fair. The gun has no scratches or other marks of wear. If you are not interested in the ammo, I will eventually just shoot it for fun and update the listing (probably down to ~$410), so check back, later!"

I am the second owner of this gun, but it came from Rankin Arms and he stated that he sold it to someone, they put 20 rounds through it, then gave it back to him where it was on consignment until I saw it and snatched it up. I put 267 rounds through it one day back in April and it is a lot of fun to shoot. The monolithic slide and rail really help keep recoil under control. I also love the 15 lpi checkering on the front strap and mainspring housing. This gun also comes with GI's functional blend magwell with lanyard loop. I wouldn't use the lanyard loop, but it doesn't bother me at all and is not noticeable while shooting. Overall this is a GREAT gun.It is in excellent condition with no scratches, scuffs, or dings.
