Since then I've had it out of lockup about a half dozen times and I have shot it. However for the vast majority of the time it's been stored in a dehumidified safe.

Rifle's  receiver is marked ""Lithgow SHT.LE III - 1931"". The overall condition of this rifle is nearly perfect - both metal & wood. There are only the slightest handling/storage marks and you'd really have to examine the rifle carefully to see them. The bore is excellent as well. Overall I'd put the rifle's condition at 99%. As you would expect the chambering is .303 British.

Rifle comes with an original Enfield military cleaning kit, bolt disassembly tool, two khaki color WWII vintage slings. Plus an original British bandoleer complete with 50 rounds of clean surplus .303 ammo loaded on 10 original Enfield stripper clips. 

Additionally, there is a high quality reproduction 1907 pattern, hooked quillion bayonet. I bought this several years ago from IMA and it was their Grade 1 (collector grade) model. I decided on this after looking at many original bayonets which were all beat up and just didn't match this beautiful rifle. Then finally there is a  high quality reproduction khaki color Enfield case. It's made of very heavy canvas just like the original, and it has a separate pocket to carry the cleaning kit & tools. The rear of the case has two sewn in eyelets that the second sling (included) attaches to that enables the case to be shoulder carried. 

Asking price for everything is $850. Transaction is FTF with pickup in the Brandon, FL area. You must be a Florida resident and at least 21 to purchase. A proper bill of sale will be provided."

 It's in very condition with at least 95% of it's bluing intact. There is some slight loss of blue around the muzzle and where the action rode in the holster. The bore is  excellent and function is perfect. Pistol is well marked with the Circle 11 symbol that designates it as produced at Radom Arsenal, Poland so no question that it's high quality. I suspect that HK must have licensed their P2A1 to Radom because the two are virtually identical. 

Comes with an original carry bag/holster with shoulder strap that's in good condition. Also included is a 26.5mm size cleaning rod & original rope style lanyard.  Finally there is a brand new Sub-caliber Adapter that allows any .22LR ammo to be safely fired from this flare pistol. Note that once the adapter is dropped into the pistol that it does become a real firearm that must be treated accordingly.

I bought this barreled action back in the early 90's and hand fitted it to a laminated thumb hole stock.  While it does have an excellent recoil pad on it - as can be expected, the 300 Win Mag has a substantial recoil.  If you are not familiar with Interarms - they are out of Manchester, England - VERY similar to the HOWA actions, and I encourage you do do some web searching on them. The action is a Mauser type, and the bluing and workmanship is spectacular.  The laminated wood thumb hole stock does help put some of the recoil into the palm of your hand, and with the high cheek piece - it s a beautiful piece of furniture.
Asking price is with the Nikon (older, original higher quality, not the newer Monarch) scope - deduct $150 if you don't want it....you keep the mounts and rings"

This rifle was only shot to sight in the laser sight then it was cleaned and put in the safe if you research the prices of guns ,ammo, and magazines right now you'll see that  even if you can find it it's expensive so my no haggle price is more than fair .

The barrel has been re-blued.  The receiver has had new case coloring put on it and the action has been adjusted.  I have test fired this gun once and it functioned just fine.

Not shown in the picture but it also will come with the original bayonet, cleaning kit to fit in the buttstock, oil bottle, sling, and manual.  It will also come with the original 5 round magazine it originally shipped with in case you wish to hunt with it.  

These are extremely good AK's and the price listed is less than the last ones sold on gunbroker in the last few weeks for.  I have included a picture of the sights to show there is no issue with those as well. Thanks!

I would love to get cash for it but I realize that times are tough and that the latest panic took alot of peoples cash so you can feel free to offer up trades. Not really looking for hunting rifles or shotguns but just about any other firearms would be considered."

It has no other issues and is a very smooth and clean operator for both left handed or right handed shooters with the center tang safety and bottom load and eject. I take great care of my firearms and it shows in the operation and zero rust/ mechanical issues. I take pride in how they look and operate in the field. And as an avid waterfowler I can say that this gun is perfect and has been great to have. I have enough shotguns though and not enough $ , so this is the first one to go. It comes with the original box and I also have some extras (turkey/deer sights) and matching neoprene non-slip Shaddow Grass sling by Avery that could also be negotiated.

Sale includes original box, paperwork, Leupold sunshade tube (~4"") and Leupold front flip-cover.  The only reason I am selling is to get a higher-magnification Leupold Mark 4, and I don't have another rifle that needs a scope.

The illuminated ""FireDot"" duplex reticle is the primary reason I chose the VX-R.  The brightness can be adjusted to several levels, extending your shooting capability in low-light conditions even on the bench test when it starts getting dark.  The scope also has a great tactical look and solid feel.

This VX-R is the CDS or ""Custom Dial System"" version that allows you to send your rifle/ammo specs to Leupold and they customize a ballistic drop turret for you, giving you an immense advantage in timed shooting competitions.  I never sent in for mine (been working on rifle break-in) so you can send off and customize this scope to any rifle you have (paperwork included in box).  The scope comes with a standard 1/4 MOA turret for use until you send off for your custom dial, or if you wish to shoot various ammunition.

This scope sells MSRPs for $789.99, but sells for $629.99 on MidwayUSA without the sunshade or lens cover (genuine Leupold parts, $100 value).  The scope is professionally mounted in Weaver Tactical picatinny-style rings that are not included in the list price but negotiable.  Condition is like-new; only been mounted for 2 months and 150 rounds.  I'd rather hang on to it than accept a lowball offer, so keep that in mind.  Hopefully this is obvious, but the rifle is NOT included.  Thanks for looking."

This Gold Cup is brand spanking new - never a round chambered, let alone fired. It is also 100% black other than the ""GOLD CUP TROPHY"" and Logo on the side of the slide - I've never seen one like this and the model isn't offered or even mentioned on the Colt Website, so I have to assume its a limited release. The pistol comes with everything including all black TSA approved hard case w/ foam interior, manual, warranty card, safety card & lock. Trade value on this pistol would be in the $650 range, although this is just a number to help you with your trade offers. This pistol is not for sale. Can you find one listed cheaper online? Yeah, probably, but take into consideration tax, background check, shipping and FFL fees, plus the fact that you'll be the only cat at the range with an all black Gold Cup, and I believe this is a good starting value on which to base your trade offers. I much prefer face to face transactions (you must produce ID showing me you're a TN resident and over 21 at time of exchange) but am willing to ship it to a FFL in your state at your expense."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Features: •Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame •Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life •Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes •Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish •Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves •One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel •Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories •Ambidextrous magazine release lever •Extended slide release •Patented Lock-Out Safety device."
