This is so effective that the only sounds during firing are from the bolt reciprocating and the barely-audible explosive discharge."

The place, Utah Territory. A man rides shotgun on a stagecoach carrying federal reserve notes from San Francisco. He's read the papers. The Abrams Gang has robbed three stagecoaches in the last month. He wipes a bead of sweat off his brow as he thumbs back the hammers on the double barrel lying across his lap. A streak of dust along the horizon to the right can only mean one thing. Jesse and Jack Abrams have spotted the coach and are closing in fast. The man swings the gun around, taking aim and draws in a quick breath and holds it in. So goes the story of the end of the Abrams Gang. This is not that shotgun, but it's still pretty cool.

,  I have close to the 300 rounds left that I purchased with new rifle that will go with for right price. 6.8SPC is regarded at one of the best  small game hog, deer, hunting cartridges ever made easily out to 500yds. Everything is in like new condition, scope is new as well. I fell in love with the 6.8SPC after using it for quite a few deployments so I purchased this back stateside. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.  If you would like to offer please be reasonable, not needing to sell, would like to sell to someone that will use and shoot. Here is the price break down of what I have into this setup, I don't except any where near that for your offer, but a fair offer. Everything is either new or in like new condition. I can take away parts or equip as you would like.

The safety, cocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm.

Functions perfect, Accuracy is dead on, Shot my first Buck with iron sights with this rifle some 12 years ago.  Have had a professional gunsmith modify the bolt to accomodate a rail mount for a rifle scope.  Does not come with any rifle scope.  Numbers all match.  Wood was sanded 12-13 years ago for aesthetic purposes and coated simply with a sealant and treated before being coated with polyurethane.  Finish has held up beautifully - this is no vault queen, and once upon a time when I had 15/20 vision it would hit at 1000 yards within a 5"" group.  But now I'm old and need that 5"" to turn into about 5k in optics!

Would consider cash for this.  Would like to find a GSG 1911 model .22 to plink with.  Doesn't have to be aesthetically perfect and if it needs something fixed or replaced let me know and we can negotiate it.  Would also consider trading for 500 rounds of .223 or 500 rounds of .45 ACP for plinking - and before you tell me that's crazy - go look at rare ammo dot company and look at the Tula ammo.  I think that would be more than reasonable."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Comes with:  Original case, three 10-round mags, mag assist doohickey, two backstraps (to increase grip size, if necessary), manuals, and bore brush.  Changing the backstraps is a simple matter of pushing the Small pin out of the grip, and then using the larger pin coupled with the Medium or Large backstrap.  

From Glock's website:

The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight Caliber: 5.56 NATO Barrel Length: 16.1"" Spiral Fluted Weight (unloaded): 7.1lbs (16.1"" barrel) Length (overall): 32"" - 35.25"" (16.1"" barrel) , Rate of Fire: Semi Auto , Rifling: 1/7"" RH , Stock/Pistol Grip: LWRCI/Magpul MIAD , Sights: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and Rear , Magazine: Magpul 30 rd.
