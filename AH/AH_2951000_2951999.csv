I know... it is a strange offer and will likely sound crazy to most people.
I'm posting this for collectors or folks that strongly prefer the G1 frame.

Wait, what?!
Here's the story... I was about to send my G17 back to the factory because it had never had the factory ""updates"" in the early 90s. The factory will go through it for free, install the updated parts, repair anything that needs it, replace magazines, likely replace the frame with a Gen 4 frame, and send back a gun that is functionally like new. Figured I'd have them reblue the upper also, since they will do it for about $50. I filled out the form to send it, but stumbled on some forum threads noting that Glock collectors cringe whenever someone sends in a Gen 1 glock to be updated, as Glock destroys the old parts... and the collectors WANT the original parts. It also looks like some folks prefer the flatter grip surfaces of the Gen 1 frame WAY better than the newer frames that have raised finger grooves.

So, I'm happy to send it in, and will do so this summer if no one wants to trade. However, I figured that if there are folks that really like the all original Gen 1, I'd give them a chance to save it.

Mine has the bright metal serial number plate (not the black plate) forward of the trigger guard with the # ""FFxxx US""
The slide and barrel have matching serial #s (just ""FFxxx"", not ""US""). It also is an Austria made gun and has the Austrian proof marks.
The right side of the barrel is engraved ""MPDC"", which I believe are the initials of the agency that ordered it from the factory. It was a service weapon and the frame and upper both show moderate holster wear.

It shoots great and has never let me down in the nearly 20 years that I've owned it."

No New York City. This listing is for THREE magazines; hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. For several years now, all of us have experienced difficulty finding quality magazines to fit the Smith & Wesson 908, 908S, 3913, and 3914 pistols. Here is Triple K’s contribution. Manufacturer is Triple K of San Diego, whose magazines have dramatically improved in the past decade. Corresponding Smith & Wesson Part Number is 190730000, Triple K number is 2087M. Construction is satin texture Nickel Plated steel body, steel spring, black polymer finger flat concealment type floorplate and traditional S&W type black polymer cartridge follower. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm caliber ammunition, 9x19, 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, call it what you will, THE 9mm. These magazines will fit only Third Generation Compact straight line grip frame pistols chambered in 9mm caliber, including models 3913 all variants including LS and TSW suffixes, 3914 all variants, 908, 908S, 3953 all variants, and 3954. They will fit in, and function in, a Chief’s Special CS9 but will protrude from the butt of its grip frame. They will not fit a model 39 Smith & Wesson, Will not fit a Kel-Tec PF9, will not fit the flush valve handle of a 19th Century Italian Bidet. They will only fit the 3900 series compact Smith & Wesson pistols we have enumerated above. These are excellent magazines, and they are not any easier for us to get than the factory mags. Our single magazine price is $39.00. We’re offering these fine magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $29 each. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

I had it in the For Trade section for a while but didn't get offers for any trades I really liked.

So I've decided to just sell it outright so I can go get what I want brand new at a store somewhere.

The gun is in really good condition, no scratches or anything. I only have about 200 rounds through it.

It comes with the box and all factory accessories (2 mags, speed loader, safety lock, cleaning brush, paperwork etc.) plus a small IWB holster. I also have 2 boxes of target ammo that I will throw in with it since I won't have a use for .45acp ammo

I'm pretty firm on the price of $600 which I feel is more than fair since I'm throwing in the holster and some ammo.

Buyer must be a FL resident and sign a bill of sale, would prefer somebody that has their carry permit.

Since it's all the original wood there are some minor chips and scratches, but no cracks that go all the way through the wood. Beautiful patina and natural finish!

Based on the research I could find, this shotgun was made by Colton Firearms in Toledo Ohio (marked on the action) between the year 1904 and 1914. All the parts are original and proofmarked. This gun could use a little oiling and some quality time with a toothbrush, baking soda, and lemon juice, but its a steal at $200, a lot of fun and a great piece of history!

Beautiful patina in the stock, with a bloodwood inlay on the fore-stock and beautifully simple bear tracks carved into the cheeckpate area, this is a true beautiful hunting shotgun with a barrel that is in EXCELLENT condition! Action is good and oiled, and the parts are all in tact! 

The only two flaws this gun has are a chip and two small cracks (but what do you expect from a 100 year old stock, and they were repaired by a pin by its previous owner before I got it,) that in NO way effect the integrity of the gun, and there is no buttpad, but those are a dime a dozen and you could get one perfect for you to shoot with!

This is a full power plus 41 Mag. load. It is safe to fire in all 41 Mag. chambered firearms and has short enough over-all-length to fit even very short cylindered revolvers such as the Taurus. We are not able to use a flash suppressed propellant for this load, so you’ll notice a large muzzle flash when fired from barrels under 7 or 8 inches in length.

This load is designed primarily for hunting animals the size of deer and medium sized black bear. Additionally, it would make a wicked defense load against humans.

As always, Buffalo Bore refuses to follow the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities. Our advertised velocities are generated from real world firearms so our customers can see what type of results they will get in the real world, where it matters.

The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Elite 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 7"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.

• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer
magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Comes with one 30rd. PMag.

Manufacturer's Description:

The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

 Based on the full size USP, HK's USP40C combines compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. The USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip polymer frame with open mounting grooves allowing for the addition of a variety of accessories. It has fixed sights, an ambidextrous magazine release, and an extractor which doubles as a loaded chamber indicator. This weapon is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. 
Note this is a double/single action hammer fired pistol, hard to find in the larger calibers. Low round count and shows very little wear.
German made quality costs, but delivers exceptional performance. New this firearm is priced mid $800's and above .I would entertrain trades, preference to 1911's in .45, Glocks, Springfield, S&W in 9mm or .45 plus boot. I won't trade straight for a $500/$600 weapon.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine is also included. 

Scorpion, features a flat dark earth frame, and slide, Hogue Extreme G-10 grips and mainspring cover.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $25.

-Llama Model IIIA - History and Information:

The Llama Model IIIA was designed as a locked breech, 7/8 scale replica, of a Colt 1911, chambered in .380 ACP.  Through the production years of the Model IIIA has seen several Series/Variations, and as indicated above, this is a Series 2. I've researched the Serial # for this particular gun, and have placed it as a 1975 model year.  This is imperative because in 1976 Llama switched from a locked breech to blowback operated (which is how most present day semi-auto handguns operate, excluding the 1911). This gun is a completely polished model (which i've seen very few of and in my opinion is a much nicer finish when compared to the sand/bead-blasted models as indicated above). 

I purchased this gun used at an auction, but from breaking it down and cleaning it I can tell its been fired very little, and would be considered in Good/Very Good condition.  This would make a great little ""carry"" piece for someone who's looking for something unique, compared to todays polymer framed, double-action only, compact semi-auto's.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Any current production quality polymer magazines, like the MOE Produced Smith & Wessons, owe a debt to Canadian Company Thermold. Ever since they came onto the market 20 years ago, Thermold brand, now Master Molder, magazines have been outstanding. They work. They do not necessarily free-fall or lock the bolt open, but they feed a mag full. These are not to be confused with the Eagle or Ram-Line magazines of the early 1990s; these are quality magazines. Manufacturer is Master Molder, aka Thermold Design & Development, of Wilson, NC, and Sandy Springs, GA. This magazine holds 30 cartridges or rounds of .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO ammunition; construction is high impact beveled graphite-based polymer. This magazine fits a Ruger Mini 14 rifle only. All these are brand new magazines. Sometimes they come to us packaged, other times shipped in bulk. We’re always glad to get them. Our Single Mag, onesy twosy price, is $29 per. We’re offering these fine magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $19 each. Own 3 for only $ 57.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, District of Colombia, Hawaii, South Bend IN, Wichita KS, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where 30 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement only.
