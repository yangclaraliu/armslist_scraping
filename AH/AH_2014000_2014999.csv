The Dan Wesson Pointman 9 is the only Government 5” size Dan Wesson 1911 chambered in 9mm Luger.  Dan Wesson has offered this pistol in limited production quantities over the last few years. Demand for this pistol has always been greater than production capacity allowed.

The PM9 features the Dan Wesson version of the Clark style rib on top of a forged slide, and an adjustable target sight in the rear and a red fiber optic sight in the front.

The slide also features DW’s custom front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless steel with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering. DW polished the flat surfaces of the pistol to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounded surfaces for a beautiful contrast. This pretty pistol is finished off with Double Diamond Cocobolo wood grips.

With the low cost of 9mm ammo, and the lack of recoil, this is a perfect model for comfortable shooting and for competition shooting. Women should have no trouble shooting this pistol.

The pistol comes with two DW 9 round magazines and two 10 round Wilson Combat magazines (a $76 bonus). Add one in the chamber for maximum capacity. The trigger on this pistol has been tuned by a gunsmith and is appropriate for match or competition shooting.  A fitted Smith and Alexander magwell has been installed by the same gunsmith for ease of magazine changes. The magwell and gunsmithing cost $125 together.

The DAN WESSON ADVERTISED PRICE is $1,558.00, if they are available from DW. Instead of that $1,558 price plus the $90 magwell, plus the $76 extra magazines, plus the $50 gunsmithing, you can buy this pistol in like new condition with all of the original factory items for $1,250.00.

I can sell it to you face to face in Lubbock, Texas with no paperwork, or I can ship to your choice of an FFL. I will accept cash, money order, verified cashier’s check, or, with a 3% service charge, I can accept Visa, MasterCard, or Discover. No personal checks will be accepted unless I hold the pistol until your check clears my bank. Any shipping cost will be added (the actual amount charged by UPS)."

One is the Glock 34 (with lots of trigger work), and the other is the XDM 5.25 with the PRP Ultimate Trigger. I own three of the 5.25s and I'm selling the newest one. Read on.

If you are not familiar with this Rob Leatham designed competition pistol, go to Springfield Armory’s site and read about it, or just YouTube or Google “XDM 5.25.” All of the superlatives and praise about its accuracy, reliability, ergonomics, and handling have already been described and discussed at length. This is a barely used pistol (about 300 rounds) that has every single thing that came with it from the factory, even the extra fiber optic rods.

It also has the very best competition trigger, the Powder River Precision (PRP) Ultimate Match Trigger kit fitted and installed by a gunsmith. That’s a $200 package. With this trigger work, this pistol would cost more than $1,000 if purchased new. This pistol is just like new and you can buy it for $777.00. All of the factory owner manual and warranty information is included and the pistol has never been registered with Springfield.

I can sell it to you face to face in Lubbock, Texas with no paperwork, or I can ship to an FFL of your choice. I will accept cash, money order, verified cashier’s check, or, with a 4% service charge, I can accept Visa, MasterCard, or Discover. No personal checks will be accepted unless I hold the pistol until your check clears my bank. Any shipping cost will be added (the actual amount charged by UPS).

I got here a great condition 638 bodyguard 38special  as you can see from the photos it is great condition I baby my guns and clean/lube all of them with mpro7 . Let me tell you why you want to jump on this gun:
1. This gun is plus p rated so you are only limited to how much you can stand in loading this gun.
2. Unlike semi autos this gun loves snake shot and would make a great hiking  piece.
3. Unlike the 642 or such guns this gun still has a functional hammer that can and has been used for single shot  firing.
4. Also note the grips these tame recoil to not much at all . But you still have the original grips if you want to hid it better  .
5. I have ammo and speed loader and a multitude of holster choice for sale with it . So I would be happy to set you up with the  best  stub nose package .

And finally I am a honest AZ resident who will treat you right.  Any question let me know . 

Lastly by law I can only sell this gun to people with valid AZ id . Also I would love to ship this fine gun to you but I have found the cost to be too much on both ends for this to work.

And for the cost well that is the best part you do you research  and tell me what you think you would want to pay for this . From my reading these goes from 440 and up so something in that area would be grand . But if you were to buy ammo,holsters etc well then I would be happy to talk combo pricing . And lastly cash is king in this but may entertain trades for non junk  only no tools bikes what have you . Some of the things I like are below can add cash if needed 

I would post a phone number but we all know about the scammers here so I will be happy to talk on the phone with you if you are serious just email me through here

This is a tack driver with very few rounds through it, in excellent condition.
A sleek, handy rimfire that’s making a big impact on varmints and small game nationwide. Chambered for the hot 17HMR, it launches a 17-grain projectile at 2,500 fps – 25% faster than a 22 Win.

Like the original 1911, the 1911 R1 has a flat mainspring housing, short trigger, and double-diamond American walnut grips. Modern enhancements on the 1911 R1 include a flared and lowered ejection port, beveled magazine well, loaded chamber indicator, a precision-machined slide and frame, high profile dovetailed single-dot front and two-dot rear sights, a crisp 3.5 - 5 lb. trigger pull, and a match-grade stainless steel barrel, and barrel bushing. It also has the Series 80-style firing pin block safety. The Remington 1911 R1 ships in a custom plastic carry case with two seven-round anti-friction magazines and a barrel bushing wrench."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Straight trade only because I can locally buy a Ruger SR1911 for 689$ or a Custom II for 699$. Figured I would give someone a chance at this gun before I return it and buy one of the other two. This 1911 is VERY nice and high quality. I just like the Stainless look of the Ruger, and I like the small roll-marks and look of the kimber."

 ""Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid gas system. Mid profile barrel is phosphate coated to mil-specs. Barrel is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability, and is finished off with an F-marked front sight base, Magpul OE hand guards, and a pinned and welded A2 flash hider, which brings the barrel out to 16"".

 Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, these uppers are made for us right here in the USA.
