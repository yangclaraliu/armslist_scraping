Comes with all the case candy, one 6 round magazine – all the stuff that came with it new. Note this is the SAS model, with stainless slide and rounded corners. It was made for pocket carry.

Great pistol. Nice trigger, small, compact, light. Very accurate. Extremely reliable. No issues whatsoever in the 500 or so rounds I put through it.

Bright Night Sights.

I’ve owned an LCP, Colt Mustang, Kahr P380, Taurus TCP738. This is by far a better pistol than all of those. The LCP has a terrible trigger, the Mustang was a feeding nightmare, the Kahr has a recoil spring that makes slide retraction a real challenge for some, and the TCP is light but has a very long pull and tiny grip. Overall the Sig is a far better gun.

So why am I selling it? I’m lefthanded, and finally decided to get another Sig P238 SAS identical to this but with the ambi safety.  So this one, with the standard safety for a righthander is no longer needed.

Price is firm. I will not respond to lower offers if and until the market dictates. I can just keep it rather than discount it too much.

The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted
to different needs. The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked
breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise.
Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease
of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect
the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced
polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a
custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

The scope is mounted on Barrett's ultra-high rings. The rifle was once fired by our ballistic specialist with 20 rounds of Black Hills 250 grain ammunition. The barrel and bore were cleaned after each shot and was given time to cool down as to break in the barrel. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing."

For those who are wondering what in the heck a Fime group is... They are a company in Las Vegas who makes extremely high end weaponry. When Arsenal quit making the Saiga 12 five years ago they picked up the production. Although unlike the Arsenal corporation, Fime Group made a deal to have these actually built and converted with all the correct bits and pieces in Russia with Saiga. So unlike an arsenal these aren't just sporters converted over here with us parts. This is a real deal Russian Saiga 12-94 shotgun imported legally. I did put a medieval muzzle break on it. I also put a Hogue pistol grip on it which is much nicer than the original which I also have. The all aluminum Surefure quad rail has also been installed.  You get the factory 5 round mag, a surefire 10 round mag and promag drum mag is also included. 50 rounds of S&B buckshot and 100 rounds of federal bird are also included. Do a bit of Googling and you will see that I have $1800 sitting here.

This Glock 21 comes with 2 factory 13 round mags and 1 Kriss Vector 25 round mag (80 dollar mag).  It also comes with a Glock soft case.  This gun also has a Ghost trigger and an extended slide release installed.

This gun was sent off to Cummings Custom Refinishing for their CPII coating.  This is a plating process, not a cheap spray on coating.  Both the slide and barrel was plated with their CPII coating.  You can read more about it below.  This coating also has a lifetime warranty.  Very easy to clean up after shooting.  And this coating self lubricates itself.

CPII is a true composite plating process. It is an Electroless Nickel / Boron Nitride tank based plating system that incorporates Boron Nitride particles within the matrix of a phosphate system. Benefits include exceptionally low coefficient of friction, superior release and excellent wear resistance. CP II is perfect for applications that require the lubrication of Teflon but need more wear resistance. As wear occurs fresh particles of Boron Nitride are exposed continuing to ensure the lubricating factors though out. CPII also allows longer firing periods between cleaning and makes cleaning of your gun a breeze CPII is a multi facetted plating process that offers outstanding rust and corrosion protection Up to 10 times the protection of other plating such as Nickel/Teflon and Chrome CPII is far from your standard plating it is a true composite plating process that is made possible by the breakthroughs in Nano Technology CPII is also an Eco friendly process. CPII is the color similar to a Bead Blasted Stainless.                   http://www.ccrrefinishing.com/information.html"

The gun shoots great and is a perfect truck gun if I must say so myself. The 30-30 is a great all around cartridge that won't let you down and has been proven time and time again. With that being said, rifle is a shooter and is in good condition with some honest wear, no wall hangers in this house. I believe the ser # puts it somewhere in the 70's so it's when Winchester was still making great guns and actually owned it. It's not a pre 64 but still a great timeless classic that will live in infamy. I also have a scope that's noting special but will get the job done if you don't prefer iron sights. It's got the quick detach mount already installed if you wish to go that route. I personally just love to let that gun run with open sights and do what John M. Browning intended it to do. Anyhow that's my speech let me know if you need more pics or info. Great gun, runs all day, ammo is everywhere, shoot straight, drink water, and change your socks.

Was my grandfathers gun. It's Belgium made and from what I remember he bought this in Europe when he was stationed there. The shotgun was used for skeet shooting. For 30 years the shotgun was in my grandfathers storage in a bag. I have had the last few years and have shot it several times. Works perfect and still super accurate.  One barrel is 20 inches and the other is 18. (I believe from researching it) one is chocked. Wood Is in a amazing condition for 40 years old. Few rust spots on the outside, internals have no rust. 

Super rare to have this shotgun with both barrels."

Needless to say she racked it the opposite way I tried to teach her and she got a little bite from the chamber. She says get rid of it.
I have the pistol, a nice leather pocket holster, 1 6 round mag, and a rubber sleeve if you want it. Also obviously with the minimal time I still have the original plastic box in the picture, manual, and lock. 

I've literally only shot about 150 rounds through it so it is just broken in. I've also had the barrel polished for smooth feeding here in town at a local shop. It shoots super accurate and is flawless when I use both types of ammo. I'm asking for 300 cash as I paid 375 for it then bought the 40 dollar holster. 

I may be interested in a trade but it would only be for another pistol so feel free to text or email me your offers.

Thanks,

964,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2749964,For Sale:  ND3 LASER DESIGNATOR BY LASER GENETICS ~ FOR COYOTE PREDATOR HUNTING!,"SW BOISE, Boise, Idaho",$ 275,"Listed On: Friday, February 28, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for an ND3 Laser Designator by Laser Genetics. This thing is amazing! There are a lot of ""green lights"" used to hunt coyotes & other predators that mount to your scope to help you see at night, but this is in a completely different league. 

The ND3 is a green laser, not a cheap LED. You adjust it to fill up the view of your scope, and it's like having perfect night vision. Being a laser, it projects about 500 yards as a ""wide beam"" and ""miles"" as you narrow the beam. Also, the laser makes any animal's eyes reflect in a way that a light will not do. 

I used this unit to hunt wild boar in North Carolina last Spring, and it was awesome! This is NOT just the ND3 itself, but rather the kit that contains all of the accessories. It's got all of the mounting hardware for any riffle including AR's. It also comes with the pressure switch that can be stuck to the side of your riffle, which I have NOT used. This will sell fast.

I bought it cause in the state of California it is legal to carry a taser concealed. You should still check your local laws. I have never used this except for a practice shot at the target it came with. It includes 3 cartridges, case, battery pack (batteries not included), the taser gun. This M26c is the civilian model and the cartridges shoot up to 15 feet. It's equipped with a red laser for easy aiming. This taser is selling online brand new for $500 plus shipping and all you get extra is an extra cartridge and a target, do you wanna pay and extra $100 for that??
