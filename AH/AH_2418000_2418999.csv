These were made on H&K machines in Greece with H&K techs overlooking the operation, so high quality.  Comes with two 20rd magazines, one aluminum, one poly; two five round magazines.  Also has a Harris bipod, and a Stanag-style scope mount and small scope on it.  I also have a port buffer for it, to keep the rounds from ending up in the next county (they extract like Olympic athletes throw a discus..).  Fairly low round count, rollers measure .016.  Must have a purchase permit.  The only gun I would take as a trade in would be a CZ 550 6.5x55, otherwise just looking to sell.  Thanks!   REDACTED"

It's somewhat rare in that the magnifier is a 4x instead of a 3x.
The 4x magnifiers were discontinued, and are known for having much better glass than the 3x.
They also have a square view that matches the square shape of Eotechs.
The square also gives a much larger FOV when compared to the circular 3x ones.
Look up the prices of these new, they're around $1,150-$1,300 when you can find them.


Anyway, this is a matching MPO set from Eotech, it's night vision compatible, and is in great shape.
I think I'm only looking to sell it at this time, but I will entertain trade offers.
I can send more pictures upon request.

It's somewhat rare in that the magnifier is a 4x instead of a 3x.
The 4x magnifiers were discontinued, and are known for having much better glass than the 3x.
They also have a square view that matches the square shape of Eotechs.
The square also gives a much larger FOV when compared to the circular 3x ones.
Look up the prices of these new, they're around $1,150-$1,300 when you can find them.


Anyway, this is a matching MPO set from Eotech, it's night vision compatible, and is in great shape.
I think I'm only looking to sell it at this time, but I will entertain trade offers.
I can send more pictures upon request.
Thank you

The McRees chassis (R7ST G5+) is an extremely nice system that can be configured for length of pull, cheek weld, etc.  This chassis allows my girlfriend who is 5'2"" and very small framed to shoot this rifle accurately and also allows me, at 230 lbs and 5""11"" to shoot it accurately with the changing of a few allen screws. I have placed a Hogue grip on it, but you may utilize any AR15 style grip of your choice if you prefer. Harris Bipod. This chassis has a drop free 5 round magazine. This Chassis actually beds the rifle for accuracy, no further bedding required. Just torque the attachment screws to spec.  I do have the take off overmolded stock for this rifle.  

The optic is a Nikon Monarch (top of the Nikon line) 4-14X44mm Mil-dot Reticle, sunshade (30 bucks extra), and I have purchased the target turrets for more easy dialing if needed (70 bucks extra) I do have the original box and turrets for this optic. This is a new optic, no scratches, or marks. Adjustable side parallax (focus). You can use this optic with Nikons ""Spot-On"" software on their website to dial in a specific data card for your specific load. A very helpful software if you do not currently have a ballistic program. 

I am currently looking to trade for a nice AR10 bull barrel for my GF to hog/deer hunt with. Cash talks as well.

 An economically priced rifle that's earned the title of ""most popular 22 in the world."" Since the Model 60 was first developed in 1960, it has continuously represented a great value. It has a 19"" Micro-Groove rifled barrel, cross-bolt safety, manual bolt hold-open and a patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open, a safety feature that locks the bolt half way open after you've fired the last shot, allowing you to see clearly into the open action. And with features such as its sleek hardwood stock, a brass inner magazine tube, which completely eliminates the rust problems you come us against with steel tubes, and a precision-crowned muzzle for enhanced accuracy, it's easy to see why the Model 60 continues to be one of America's best selling rifles.

This is not to be confused with the newer (and vastly inferior) SAR-8 sold by Springfield with the cast aluminum receiver, this is all steel receiver, and not some parts kit build. These are HK-91 clones made on HK tooling set-up by HK engineers, made by HK trained technicians at Hellenic Arms. These were imported by Springfield as SAR-3 for a while before being caught up in the early assault weapon ban. Springfield slapped a thumb hole stock on them, pinned and welded a non flash suppressor on them and overstamped the SAR-3 with an SAR-8. The quality on these is felt to be second only to HK since everything was set-up by them. Included are 3x 20rd steel magazines, 5x 20 rd aluminum magazines, and the original 5 rd magazine. This rifle does have some small handling marks but I would say it is still in very good condition. It has been kept in a safe and very well taken care of. I'm parting with it because my interests have changed and I need to make room for some other projects. TX drivers license and bill of sale required for transaction, prefer CHL. If you have any questions, please send them and I will respond promptly. I'm also interested in trades (AKs, ARs, tactical rifles, tactical shotguns, historical firearms, really want a LaRue or Noveske upper).

This is a mid 90's production, H&K marked model. 7+1 mag tube, pump or auto. I have the original box, with matching serial number for the barrel and reciever on the box. (I have marked out the serial number in the pictures for saftey) In the box is the original owners manual, mag plug (to restrict to 3 shots for hunting) even still has the wrap that was on the gun when new. Has the original bottle of oil, (however it is empty) and rear sight adjustment allen wrench.
I have had it probably 10 years, I bought it used from the original owner. It has a very slight/faint scratch on the left side of the reciver that was on it when I bought it. Other than that, there is no other major blemishes or damage. Gun has been taken care of, and cleaned after every shooting and is in excellent condition for being 18-19 years old. 
I am selling this because I just purchased a M3 tactical and as much as I hate to, I dont really need two M3's, plus I am saving up for a M1A supermatch. So the M3 needs to go to a new home.

This is an older Smith with pinned barrel and the firing pin on the hammer, so I believe this is C&R eligible.  Pre-lock with no MIM parts.  Holds 6 rounds and is rated for +P ammunition according to the manual (included).  I do not have the original box.  I recently testfired this revolver at the range and was putting cloverleafs through the bullseye at 30 feet.  Gun is more accurate than I am.  DA trigger pull is smooth, and SA trigger pull breaks like glass.

The gun alone, in this condition, is worth $400.  With the custom grips and ammo, value is closer to $500.  I am pricing this to sell quickly . . . only $350 takes everything.  THIS IS A GREAT DEAL.  Cash only.  Will not ship.  I also have a customized CZ82 for sale which I just dropped the price on.  Thanks."
