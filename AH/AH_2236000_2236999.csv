While Form 4 waiting times are long, we take our customers shooting during that waiting period. No use letting it sit in the dealers safe….. 

The model 30P-1 is the Thunderbeast Arms flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. It offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30P-1 was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM. 

The 30P-1 has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced. The 30P-1 is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out. The 30P-1 is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varmiters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.

To answer the frequently asked questions, the receiver is not rusted. It has an aluminum receiver like almost all 500s.  Mossberg puts a coating on the aluminum that often flakes off.  The coating on the steel parts is still good. This is a $450 gun new and a $100 stock new.  $200 will not buy it so don't waste my time with the lowball offers.

It has a UTG five way folding front grip. It has a 3 1/2lb TSS trigger and a Carolina Shooters Supply riveted on trigger guard. It has a Tromix extended charging handle and RAM extended mag release.

While Form 4 waiting times are long, we take our customers shooting during that waiting period. No use letting it sit in the dealers safe….. 

The model 223P-1 is a thread-attach suppressor for sporting rifles in .223 Remington and 5.56 mm NATO which yields competitive sound suppression levels in a very light weight format. The 223P-1 was designed primarily for semi-auto use on AR-15s and use on bolt-action .223 rifles. The direct thread-on attachment is best for rifles that will be shot suppressed most of the time. The 223P-1 is made of titanium and stainless steel to minimize weight added to the weapon while maintaining strength and durability required for sustained semi-auto fire. Muzzle blast concussion is eliminated. The recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. Communication with your spotter is aided and the need for hearing protection is reduced.

 The 223P-1 improves the accuracy of most rifles. The suppressor is sealed and requires no maintenance. The 223P-1 is ideal for: sporting and varmint use on semi-auto and bolt action rifles in .223 Remington and 5.56 mm NATO.

112,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2236112,For Sale:  SILENCERCO Osprey 45  Suppressor in Colorado on Form 3,"Aurora, Denver, Colorado",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, October 18, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Simply the best pistol suppressor in the market today. Innovative design, reliability, and function. Currently on a Form 3 here in Denver. And while you wait for the Form 4 to be approved, you can join us on the range to use your Osprey. 

This is a 45 Osprey with your choice of pistons, 45, 40, or 9mm. www.silencerco.com for product information. Silencerco’s Osprey family of pistol suppressors (or silencers, as often called) is a perfect blend of form and function. With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. 

What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. 

The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 

Other Benefits Besides having the best suppression levels available for centerfire handguns, the Osprey silencer family has other benefits and features that are unique to the industry. Mounting System Because of its eccentric design, the Osprey must have a way to index to the host gun. Silencerco designed the patent pending cam lever locking system that allows the shooter to time the silencer to any host pistol. 

To mount, simply thread the Osprey on the muzzle just as you would a traditional silencer with the cam lever in the locked position. When the Osprey shoulders, hand tighten to ensure a tight fit then release the cam lever and rotate the Osprey to the proper orientation. Finally, move the cam lever back to the locked position. The Osprey will return to this index point for subsequent mountings until you change the host pistol or remove the piston assembly for cleaning. Booster and Accessories Working in harmony with the patent pending cam lever locking system, the Osprey has a unique booster, or Nielsen device, that allows flawless cycling with all relevant semi-automatic handguns. All of the boosters are the same dimensions on all three Osprey calibers, which means you can interchange the piston portion for different thread specs and subcalibers. For example, you can shoot a 9mm or .40 S&W through a 45Osprey or a 9mm through a 40Osprey. 

Silencerco also offers a fixed barrel spacer for use on subguns/pistol caliber carbines and host weapons that have fixed barrels. Nomenclature Tax stamps are expensive and take a lot of time. Silencerco believes that one tax stamp is enough for your silencer. With this in mind, Silencerco designed the Osprey for quick repairs and placed the serial number on the part least likely to be damaged by baffle strike or other mishaps. Warranty repairs are quick and easy.

 Lightweight and Compact The Osprey is very lightweight and does not greatly affect the balance of the host pistol. The 45 Osprey and 40 Osprey weigh 11 ounces, and the 9 mm Osprey weighs 9.84 ounces. Many people feel Osprey actually improves the balance of their host firearm. 

The Osprey also is a handy 8 inches long in the 45 Osprey and 40  Osprey models and only 7 inches long in 9mm. This design makes them “short” for their performance level. CALIBER .45 ACP WEIGHT 11.1 oz DIMENSIONS 1.3""W × 1.75""H LENGTH 8.0625"" MOUNT Threads

The Western Field rifles were sold out of Montgomery Ward stores back in the day, and this one belonged to my dads family when he was younger.  It was hunted with a time or two, and then it sat in the attic for decades.

I got my hands on it a few years ago, and have only taken it to the range once where it shot beautifully.  It is in fantastic shape.  I refinished the stock, and gave it a thorough cleaning.  It turned out beautiful.  

This gun is a re-branded Savage Arms 840, and parts are interchangeable.  The gun was actually built by Savage Arms and sold by Montgomery Ward.  I couldnt give you a date on this gun for sure, but from a bit of googling I would say before 1980 for sure.

P.S.  I am going to go on a small rant.  Arms list used to be a nice place to trade.  People were reasonable.  They knew what a firearm was worth and didn't try to cheat one another.  

I know my rifle isn't a ""Mercedes Benz"".  But its a damn nice rifle.  I know what I paid for it.  I am tired of hearing people say that DPMS is cheap and then ask me what is the lowest I'll take for my rifle.  Who are you kidding?  If you were some connoseur elitist of AR-15s, you probably wouldn't be trolling arms list, insulting peoples' taste in firearms and acting like a used car salesman maggot.  $650?  Really?  Get the f@#$ out a here!  My upper/barrel alone cost more than that.

To those that are respectful, reasonable and appreciate the value of their firearms and the firearms of others;  I salute you.  End of rant."

The tip up barrel means that you don't have to rack the slide to chamber and unchamber a round and the .22lr shoots soft enough that even a recoil averse shooter can put rounds on target easily and consistently. Features a single-action/double-action trigger and a manual safety so it can be carried in DA with the safety off or on or SA with the safety on, however is preferred. Great backup gun or a carry gun for new shooters or those who don't have the hand strength to easily rack the slide on a small semi-auto. Absolutely disappears in your pocket. Works best with hot ammo, I've had excellent reliability with CCI stingers and Mini-mags. Extremely little wear on the gun, finish is 98% and there are some minor scratches on the grips.

I know it's an odd request, but I imagine a few of y'all may have some you don't want anymore, so if you do message me at REDACTED and maybe we can make a deal!
Im down in Norman as well. Have 9mm and 22LR ammo I might be willing to trade as well"

The WRS Level 3 DUTY HOLSTER w/Tac-Light allows the user to carry his or her favorite under-gun light on the rail system of their duty firearm. The WRS Level 3 holster was designed to mimic the traditional style thumb break used on our standard Level 2 Duty holsters but with that extra measure of security required for certification as a Level 3 holster. The WRS Mechanism is extremely fast and perfectly suited for high stress situations such an armed encounter when seconds count and a quick and natural (second nature) draw stroke is needed. The WRS feature allows the user to re-holster their weapon and lock it down with level 3 security quickly and easily by simply rotating the hood and lever cover back to their locked, upright positions. The WRS holster comes with the standard Duty Dropped and Offset belt attachment to make it compatible for carry with most types of body armor while still allowing for a “Full Combat Grip”. The holster new is $130 plus $50 for the mag pouch and thigh rig, Im selling all of it slightly used in new condition for $180 obo call or txt Dan REDACTED"

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package. The 13 round capacity (12+1 in .40S&W) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols."

A 2000 Jeep Cherokee Limited for sale. It is Maroon with tan leather interior. This is the highest end Cherokee that was made. Body is in good condition. Interior is in good condition. The bad part is the engine. It suffers from the 0331 head problem. I took the head off before any gaskets went bad or it consistently overheated. I was in the process of putting on a new head, but I don't have the money or time to complete it at the moment and I really need a different vehicle. Currently, the truck is inside in climate controlled storage with the engine pulled and sitting on a stand. The head is off. The short block should be fine functionally. You could slap a new head on it for $500 and be ready to go. Or you can stick a new engine in it for $1200'ish plus labor. It would sell for $4500 to $6000 with the engine working. I am only looking for $1650 and trying to get it sold this weekend. You get all the parts plus the engine stand with the truck.

 The Magpul® MOE™ Stock – Military Model is a drop-in replacement butt-stock for carbines using mil-spec receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The Military Model includes a standard 0.30” rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.
 Adjustable for length of pull. This stock features a unique locking mech that friction locks the stock to the buffer tube for zero movement.   Mounts on Mil-Spec AR15/M16 carbine receiver extention (buffer tube) (including; Colt,  BCM, CMT, LMT, Vltor, Stag)

A round that proved to be too much for the FBI but not too much for people anywhere who want something stronger than .357 except semi automatic and that can be used for personal defense from any two legged and most four legged animals

I had got the pistol with the intention of using it as a sidearm when out hunting or just as a truck gun, since you can get light loads of 10mm that are very suitable for self defense or full power loads that are comparable to .41 magnum but I ended up getting something I like better, and since I don't really care for 1911's anyway I decided to never even shoot the gun

The Elcan SpecterDR Optical Sight model DFOV156-C2 1.5-6x 7.62 NATO (DFOV156-C2) represents a revolution in optical sight design.
The world’s first truly dual field of view optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 6x magnified sight to a 1.5x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 6x and 1.5x modes. Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center.
In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and Elcan’s legendary crystal clear image. In CQB mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. The 6x and CQB Reticles are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP.

I've got a baby comin and need cashola more than I need this. As the title says, I am selling my almost brand new Sig Sauer X5 Competition All stainless full german 9mm race gun. This is NOT the far less expensive Sig ""all around"" model. They are nice but this is the top model under the full tier L1 X5. This gun, the ""X5 Competition"" has a msrp of $1975 and sells for anywhere from $1650-$1850 in real world prices at most retailers. It has never been competed with. I am an amateur pistol collector and the original owner. It was bought brand new only months back. I have run exactly 250 rounds through her. It's not even begun to be broken in. It is as new and perfect in every way. No marks. This is the most recent release literally made in germany 10 months ago. With proofing. It comes with one factory Sig Sauer German 18 round race magazine (with the factory aluminum silver basepad). Also, Fully adjustable sights, Ambidextrous safeties, factory X5 Magwell and extended mag release. EXTREMELY ACCURATE! Comes with Sig Extreme Grease, Rear sight tool, Factory test target, manual and the x5 case. Price reduced to $1525 Cash. Or available with a second Sig factory matching Racemag with Alum basepad for $1590. These mags go for $100 a piece so $65 for the second mag is actually pretty good!
