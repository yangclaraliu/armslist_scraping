Will entertain offers of course but will not include all extras for low prices. Would not sell this piece but need a compact mid size piece. I find the rubber houge grip makes it way more comfortable to shoot but obviously it is easily removed. Hard to put up as not many 40s have a 15 plus 1 capacity. The gun has no wear and has never had a failure of any kind. Would rate at 97% only due to being fired. Was cleaned and oiled after every outing. Just have to pick this or my 9 and with my full size 9 and my shield and other non M&Ps the 9s need to hang around as thats the most ammo I have and am set up to reload currently. These are the best guns around in my opinion. sweet triggers and accurate/reliable as can be pistols for a good price."

This is a DAO semi auto with one of the best DAO triggers I have ever used. It is a great all around gun. It is in between a glock 19 and 26 size wise making it perfect for CCW with the shorter mag, put in the 15 rounder and you have a very effective home defense weapon. It is simple to use and the kick is very mild.

Yes, we all know these came out of Cabela's where they sold for $99 last week.  I'll just sell mine for less than him, that's all.  Probably you should stop overpaying for ammo...  If the resellers can't sell, they will stop scrubbing the shelves clean so you can't find ammo in the stores.  Don't buy mine, don't buy his.  If anyone wants more than slightly over retail, they're not only ripping you off, they're preventing you from finding ammo in the store.

An adapter is required to interface with the application.

They’re unfailingly dependable, easy to carry and exceptionally accurate out to the farthest reaches of shotgun range. Our single-shot action’s strong lockup and stout build creates an inherently precise platform. But another major contributor to their ultra-tight grouping capability is the Ultragon™ Rifling. It uses six oval lands and grooves without sharp corners like traditional rifling. This system imparts stabilizing spin on your slug without distorting the sabot jacket or exterior of your slug, leading to a better gas seal, higher velocities and more consistent flight characteristics. No nonsense. Just pure deer-dropping performance.

This pistol has exactly 49 rds shot through it by a 75yr old man, he started to polish the slide but lost interest and hands do not work so well. The frame is in new condition, the pistol is tight and no slop in the slice to frame fit, this pistol is so smooth, give her a rack and you will be surprised on how smooth it is, the fellow sent it to a gunsmith but does not remember what he had done to it. No scratches and the slide just needs some loving. This pistol is guaranteed to shoot like a new one, or like one that just had 49 rounds through it. I have references from buyers here on Armslist if you want to check me out. I also have the Box it came in and I may find a set of grips but not promised same with the rear sight, I will also include a 7 rd magazine, you cannot go wrong with this pistol, would be a great carry pistol or car pistol or a home defense pistol. Everyone knows the RIA reliability and reputation of the quality these have with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. All this reliability for only $350, yes, not a misprint check out this need some loving pistol. If this ad is active I still have it for sale.

The first person that checks out this pistol I bet will buy it once he racks it, if he knows his guns. That is gospel!

This is my prized possession but i need to part ways with it. I have owned 2 PSLs and this one is in close to factory condition. I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

This pistol is as it came from the gun store. Never fired and still has the factory protective coating.

Tapco T6 Intrafuse stock system
2- Tapco 20 round mags

The rifle itself is original Chinese and the wood stock was all broken when I got it so I upgraded to a Tapco Synthetic. It was packed in heavy cosmoline for storage for roughly 60 years (since WW2) but the metal had some surface rust on it so I cleaned everything as best as I could with some steel wool and put a coat of flat black on it. The inside of the barrel is near perfect. It is chrome lined and the rifling is sharp. It comes with the bayonet also. Rifle shoots perfect and no jams in over 5000 rounds. I have sighted the scope at 100 yards and my shaky self has 10 shots inside a 6 inch circle (I have a video: http://youtu.be/znRLCnDq18s )

Has all the original NorCom (Norinco) factory stamps as well as the US Customs import stamp. This rifle most likely saw battle during WW2 and may have its own unique history. Would make a great collectible or as I have used it, a great deer killer!

I am asking $450 ($400 without scope). The price is pretty firm cause I have more than that into it. NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES...
