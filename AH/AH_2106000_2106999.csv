Description
MAG5-60

Due to tremendous demand, High-Capacity Magazine orders will be delayed. 

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest. 


Features 
•Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
•Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required
•Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance
•Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
•May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue
•Only 1.66"" thick, less than two 30-round magazines clipped together
•60-round magazine is approximately same length as two 30-round magazines clipped together
•60-round magazine fits in most dual-mag pouches

It is designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Features Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

I have a used Dillion RL450 reloading press set up with a .45ACP die set. You can buy other dies to reload other calibers and even rifle cartridges. Comes with Frankford Arsonal case tumbler kit, impact bullet puller, 3 universal loading trays, digital scale, primer tray, 100 large primers, an ""ABC's of reloading"" book and a Lyman 49th edition reloading hand book. This is everything you need to reload .45 ammo. You can buy other die sets to reload other calibers with this system. I have been reloading for a couple of years with this set up. It works well. I don't have the time to continue reloading. Everything is in working order. The press is an older model, but has been maintained well as you can see in the pictures. The case tumbler kit and everything else is like new. I can send you pictures of the case tumbler upon request. Also included are some .45 caliber bullet heads and some .45 ACP brass. I recommend doing your homework before beginning to reload if your new to the hobby. It's pretty exciting making your own ammo but can be dangerous if not properly educated. I actually learned by watching youtube several years ago. I will be glad to provide tips for any perspective buyers that are not veterans at it. Must be willing to come to Montgomery area to pick up, as I don't want to carry this package far. There are a lot of components. I plan to carefully breakdown and package the set up, then put it in a heavy duty sterlite container for transport. For detailed pictures or questions Call or text (334) 31eight- 919eight"

Please resign if you are actually a LEO enforcing this nonsensical SAFE Act - you are doing a serious, I repeat serious disservice to America and NY proceeding with any enforcement of the unconstitutional garbage that your Elected Tyrant Cuomo has placed into quasi-dictatorial effect.

Don't agree that he is a brewing dictator awaiting to be wakened (maybe a bit extreme, but you get it, or don't you?)? You're simply delusional - and thus you need to resign immediately on that basis that you do not obtain a grounded enough mentality to be a properly designated and effective LEO in the interest of the public. In other words, you're dangerous. What's dangerous to a sociopath though, right? Oh ok, I get it now... you're a sociopath and you just take orders, or even worse yet you have full faith in the orders you received regarding the enforcement of the SAFE Act.

If you're not LEO requesting currently illegal ""ARs"", you do realize what you are requesting is illegal right? Due to the SAFE Act... are you aware of that? I'm pretty sure you would all have to be aware of that, which makes it's pretty obvious these ""illegal AR"" requests are LEO's acting on behalf of Tyrant Cuomo's goon-squad. As earlier stated - immediately resign if this applies to you as a LEO.

Wake up and smell the roses LEO's. Your leader is a monster in sheep's clothing and he is using the monsters among your departments to cull the sheep.


Disclaimer: This address does not pertain to all the good officers we have in NY and throughout the country. I'm clearly aware that the majority of officers are against this nonsense and their tyrant in office.

To the gooned-out LEO's - take a hike. Don't like my act of freedom of speech? Take another hike."

Docter Red Dot Sight 3.5 MOA utilizes two highly polished, optical quality glass lenses (compared to one plastic lens in some competitiveimage models) sandwiched together and solidly set in the frame of the red dot sight. A specially formulated DOCTER multi-coating is applied between the lenses, which protects the coating from scratches and abrasions. Coating on Docter Red Dot Scope Sight assures a bright, clear sight picture, greatly reduces distracting, over-the-shoulder glare on the lenses, and eliminates parallax out to 40 yards.
Featuring a compact tubeless design the Docter Red Dot Sight 3.5 MOA Gen 4 Red Dot Scope is a low weight Docter Sight that does not sacrifice in performance. Because of the small size and weight this reflex sight can be mounted directly on short barrel guns. The outstanding features of the new Docter Optic Red Dot Sight make it the most desirable sight of its type now available. Even though Docter Red Dot Sight is smaller, lighter in weight and more compact than most red dot sights, it is extremely strong and durable, withstanding up to 500 G's of recoil. The frame of this tactical sights is made of stainless steel, brass and anodized aluminum.
The dot of the Docter 3.5 MOA Red Dot Scopes covers approximately 3.5 inches at 100 yards and is best for handgun hunting and rifle applications.
Brightness of the precise red dot is automatically adjusted in Docter Optic Red Dot Sight 3.5 M.O.A. to ambient light conditions through use of a light sensor which reduces the intensity of the dot in low light, and increases it for better visibility in bright conditions. Docter Dot Sight has a built-in ""Battery Save"" mode which extends average battery life to approximately six years. Power is provided by an easy-to-replace, standard lithium Type CR 2032 3-volt battery.

The rifle has 1 box of rounds through it. Great shooting and in great condition. Not a scratch anywhere on the gun very clean and taken care of. The Smith and Wesson M&P .40 Cal is a pistol I picked up following my graduation from the police academy at Lawmens in Columbia. I fired one box 50rds. through it and have not shot it again. It shot wonderfully but I have too many pistols as it is and cant shoot them all and they are taking up space in my safe. Im looking to trade both of these evenly for a nice Remington 700, Browning A-Bolt, Ruger M-77 Mark II chambered in 30-06, .270, or 300 Win. Mag. I have around $525 in the rifle with scope, mounts, rings, bipods, etc. And I have $400 in the pistol because I got a reduced price for law enforcement. I would like to trade evenly or if what you have is only a hundred or so more than worth of what I have I can put the cash on top. Let me know what you all have and make offers. If you do not have a good trade and would like to buy either one of these .40 M&P $350 and Rifle $350 with all accessories. Will text or email pictures nothing to hide both are in excellent condition."

This is a nicely done Sub 2000, low round count (Under 300), with the upgrades done that this little 9mm carbine needs.

Red Lion Precision forend with top rail. This is THE rail you want for this- nicely machined, and allows you to roll your red dot out of the way so the rifle can still fold. These sell for $147 through Red Lion

Red Lion Precision front sight. The cheap plastic front sight is a real weak point on this rifle. I broke the blade when it was just sitting in my bag- not abused. So replaced it with the metal, again great machine work from these guys- these sell for $70 through RLP.

S&W Mags. I have the original 10 rounder plus 3 15 rounders that come with this. 

Also have the tactical carrying case from Kel-Tec, and all the manuals and whatnot. I am the second owner.

Also comes with a UTG Red/Green dot.

I've got about $900 into this package, it's a great shooter, and a total blast, but I'm looking for something a little different.

For trades, here are the ONLY things I'm looking for:
VZ-58/VZ-2008. Must be able to accept stripper clips and be 7.62x39
M1-Garand (Bear in mind, the CMP still has these available)
FN-49
FN-FAL

You're going to let your state or government tell you that you can't defend yourself with 30+ rounds of continuous semi automatic fire in the event of an emergency or national/global disaster? That's just silly. It's your life, you should be able to adequately defend it.

Just remember, it will be DHS walking around with ""Assault Rifles"" in an event of a national disaster - do you want to be under-armed if they are not operating ethically towards you or your community?

The out of state FFL's are talking you guys for a ride by undermining the prices of these guns when they purchase them from you. They have to make money as a business, but they also understand your desperate to sell them because you don't want to be a ""felon"".

Comes with the XD(M) Gear Package  3.8"" match-grade barrelRugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finishUltra Safety Assurance Trigger SystemThe easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

Pictures tell the story.

Manufacturers information is below.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially produced the KG-99 under the designation of TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.

The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

    This shotgun is the pinnacle of home defense with many extras.  Screw in choke tubes means you can select your desired spread pattern with ease.  With the Full tube it is more than accurate enough for hunting.
   The barrel has tear drop style porting instead of the traditional round holes.  This results in a 50% reduction in felt recoil and muzzle rise.  Very nice when shooting 3 inch mags.
   Ghost ring sights are the best I have ever used for following a moving target.  All work was done by Briley Manufacturing, and is the only way to get all these features in a compact 18 inch barrel.
   The rubberized grips provide the necessary traction if your hands happen to be wet.  Also comes with side saddle, scorpion streamlight / mount, and sling.  It has been well taken care of and is like new.

For trade I have a Taurus 851 5 shot .38 special. It has a very low round count and is rated for +P ammo. It's very accurate and has a super smooth trigger. The shrouded hammer gives you the option of firing single action for accuracy and provides one of the smoothest draws from pocket carry. This is a really well made and dependable firearm for concealed carry or home defense. 

This pistol is in excellent condition aside from one small chip on the hammer near the hammer lock. It's purely cosmetic but if necessary the good folks at Taurus would gladly take care of it as this firearm has a lifetime warranty.

Comes with the factory hard case, manual, and a Fobus OWB paddle holster.

This is a pre-Remington Marlin, made in 1995.

The blued metal is in fine condition with no signs of freckles or rust, very minor evidence of handling, in and out of soft cases, the usual things for a rifle that is 18 years old which hasn't spent it's life standing in a safe.

The wood has a few very minor, small dings here and there consistent with even the most careful safe handling.

The action is crisp and tight, cycles shells normally. The barrel bore is bright and clean with sharp spirals. Cleaning with Eliminator shows it to be free of lead and copper fouling.

I would rate the rifle lightly used. I'm not the original owner but I have put a couple boxes of 300 gr downrange and find it to be very accurate with just iron sights. It is factory drilled and tapped for a scope. I see no evidence one was ever mounted, the plug screws are present and intact.

I'm selling it because I ended up with two rifles in 45-70, I don't need both.

Asking $525 or best reasonable offer. No trades please. Need to peek at WDL, CPL/WAC or LE credentials. Thanks for looking."

For five decades, the Remington 700 bolt action rifle has been used by the U.S. military, law enforcement, hunters and civilians. Along with the Winchester 94 and Marlin 336, it's considered to be one of the top-selling rifles in U.S. history. Continually praised for its accuracy, in the late-1960s the Remington 700 rifle was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and made its primary sniper weapon. The 700 over the years has also remained popular because of its versatility as it comes with different stocks, barrel configurations, finishes and calibers. Are you sold yet?

No, your eyes are not playing tricks on you; the stock is short. it is also factory. Yes, they were made like that. This shotgun is NOT made to shoot from the shoulder. As a matter of fact, the words ""DO NOT FIRE FROM SHOULDER"" are stamped on top of the barrel.

Overall, this shotgun is in great condition for its age. The bore looks great.There are a some imperfections from normal handling and relatively light use.

While the hammer is there and usable (if you have a strong thumb), the hammer ""ear"" has been broken off. The buttplate is also missing. With some searching online, I'm guessing both original parts can be found.

As I mentioned, this is a single-shot, but there are two factory holes in the end of the buttstock which are made for two spare 20 gauge shells.
