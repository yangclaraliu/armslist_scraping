I’m interested in selling it to fund another gun purchase. 

These SR series of pistols from Ruger are probably the most underappreciated semi autos around. During my time with this SR40 I’ve experienced zero issues, and find it a pleasure to shoot. If you do some research, you’ll find that a common opinion on these is that they are a very soft shooting .40.  The fully adjustable sights get back on target quickly, while the short reset allows for fast & acccurate follow up shots.

This gun is fun to shoot, and is a fantastic all purpose pistol. It’s suitable for range fun, home defense, and concealed carry. The SR grip and slide are slim for a full sized pistol, and you can really feel that when carrying. The accessory rail will accommodate a tactical light or laser for home defense or tactical training purposes. The .40 S&W is often considered snappy, and ballistically nothing to sneeze at, however the SR’s high bore axis grip keeps it comfortable for a day of shooting.

The weapon has been meticulously maintained, and has been upgraded with a stainless steel guide rod, and new recoil spring purchased from Galloway Precision.  The factory polymer rod and spring are in good condition, and are included with the pistol.

Included in the sale are:	Original Ruger pistol case and literature
				        Two 15 round Magazines. 
				         One magazine Loader
				         Installed Traction grip material

                                         Somewhere shy of 200 rounds of .40 S&W Range Ammo.

The M10 is a new manufacture Romanian rifle imported and converted by M&M industries. Unlike a WASR, the M10 isn't cobbled together from parts kits. This means much greater reliability and impressive accuracy.

I will add pictures when I get home from work.

I do want to mention that, like many AKs, the finish on this gun is kinda rough. It doesn't impact function, but it will not win beauty contests. This rifle is a definite candidate for duracote.

I will include the original polymer magazine, a one-point sling it came with from the original owner, and (for the right trade) 4 East German AK mags with their case.

Our 357 mag. ammo adds more power than ever before to the 357 mag. This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump.

The below velocities are offered so that you can see what guns/barrel lengths give what velocities with this new 357 mag. ammo. You'll notice that new S&W revolvers with short barrels are often shooting faster than older S&W revolvers with longer barrels. The new S&W revolvers are very good and are made with equipment that makes them more consistent and faster than the S&W revolvers of yesteryear.

Springfield Armory XDS9409B XD(S) Slim 9mm 4"" 7+1/9+1 Black Poly Grip/Frame Blk

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S
model comes with a durable rugged case and two  magazines--one
flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag
X-tension 9-round magazine.

Im the second owner and have yet to shoot it.  Previous owner said he had fired about 100 rounds through it.
MSRP is over $320.  The Crimson Trace was $190.  The extra mags w/ extender were $27 each. Total value is close to $600.  I am willing to trade for much less, as I dont believe in keeping a weapon as a safe queen, or just for the sake of having a gun. I would rather have a usable gun.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S
model comes with a durable rugged case and two  magazines--one
flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag
X-tension 9-round magazine.

Taurus PT92 In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Features:

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

3 Position Safety Decocker
Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.

Taurus Security System (TSS)a
All the Taurus family of revolvers features the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your firearm and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I purchased this new March 1997, I shot it once, cleaned it and it's been in the safe ever since. 
the dealer mounted and boresighted the scope when I bought it.
I thought I would get into varmint hunting but alas it never happened...Time to let it go...

rings and mount and Leupold box and bipod all included.
I'm thinking the value new is about $2,000 but not totally certain.
I'm not certain the current market value, but I would like to get $1,600.
no trades,would ship after i get paid.shipping over to your licence holder is free thanks"
