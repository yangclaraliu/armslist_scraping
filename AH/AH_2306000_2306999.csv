The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier.

The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available.

I'm honestly getting tired of people asking who aren't interested.  I ignore what gives me the impression my time will be wasted.

Firm means firm.  $250 IS my bottom dollar.  I am not responding to emails that ask questions I have answered in my listing.  ""Will you take $200"" and ""What is your bottom dollar"" have already been addressed.

I'm probably not interested in trades - but if you have something feel free to email me.  If I'm interested I will reply.  If not I won't.

Currently I'd trade for a decent full bed set and a 32 or larger LCD TV.

I will be happy to show you the gun if you are within 10 mile driving radius of me.  I may be OKC this weekend.  I do not expect you to buy the gun if I show it.  

Gun shoots great and hasn't been shot much (at least by me) and I purchased it from a youth pastor several years ago who bought it new.  Have a hard time believing he shot it much.

I think the wear on the barrel comes from being in the plastic case.

But I expect you to have a fraction of respect for my time.  Last time I had a no show that I drove thirty miles to meet.

If you have any questions that haven't been answered feel free to contact me.

Here are the specs. The pics on the web show the serrated blade, mine is the straight blade.

I just had a new Walther-Lothar barrel put on it by Larry at State Arms.  I've only put 16 rounds down the pipe on it since.  The stock is completely adjustable and the bi-pod is super beefy.  The trigger is factory set right around 19 ozs.  The rifle is in great condition and shoots like a dream. 

I have 110 rounds of Singapore M33 ammo and 15 rounds of 750gr A-Max ammo that I can include for $230.  The A-Max's are reloads that were set for the old barrel.  

If you would like the scope and rings that are on it, I'd take $700 for them.  The scope is a Zeiss Conquest 6.5-20x50 with the Rapid-Z 1000 reticule in it, super clear glass.  I'd reuse it on my varmint rifle, but I'd like a different reticule as I don't need to reach out to 1000 yards with my 22-250.  The rings are Warne Maxima quick-detachable with a guaranteed return-to-zero.  I have tested that feature extensively and have never had a problem with the zero shifting. 

If you have any questions, just ask.

Late war (May 1945) production that bears the SA/NFR cartouche on the stock.  Incredible condition for a 68 year old battle rifle.  Rifles in this condition are incredibly hard to find today and when found they command a huge premium.  Bore is excellent.

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll. 

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

With box, manual, cleaning rod, and cleaning kit. 

A working scope mount is hard to find and options that will work are limited to a few. Not the highest dollar scope on it, but has very good reviews, the mags are all factory. 21 inch fluted  barrel (or 550mm), not a thing wrong with it besides I can't afford to shoot it or keep it.

The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and either a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver or fixing bases for a top scope mount.

VEPR SUPER comes with a fluted barrel for reducing the rifle weight and improving cooling ability.

All VEPR SUPER rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual.

This is a CZ75 clone but is offered in a configuration not readily available from CZ: a compact alloy frame with a manual thumb safety.

Stylistically it resembles the Baby DE, also a CZ derivative, but with a frame safety instead of the slide mounted safety on the Baby DE.

Trijicon TR24G Accupoint 1-4x 24mm 97.5-24.2ft@100yds 30mm Tube Blk Post Tringle

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

The gun has only a few hundred rounds through it. Have never had any problems with rifle and both polymer mags work great. 

There are a couple marks on the receiver where i accidentally scraped the safety lever while cleaning the rifle, but it's a minor cosmetic issue. The safety lever doesn't drag on the receiver nor is it stiff and hard to manipulate. Gun is in 100% working order, just needs sighted in, as i don't have the tool to do it.

I also have a Mak 90 sporter stock with matching handguards set, along with an extra standard AK polymer pistol grip and two magazines that i will include with the rifle.

mostly looking for cash, I'll consider trades though.

Looking to sell my Gen 3 Glock 23 with lonewolf 40-9 barrel. Comes with two .40 mags ( one 13 rd and one 15 rd), 1 15 rd 9mm mag, and the lonewolf barrel. All mags are made by Glock. Like having a Glock 19 and 23. Also have 4 piece chrome set (not installed) slide release, take down lever, and two pins. This 23 is a bit older I believe around the year 2000 was when it was manufactured. The slide is the less slippery slide unlike most gen 3's. Has minor holster wear on the tip of the slide. 9mm barrel has had around 200 flawless rounds and the .40 barrel has around 500-600 I'd say. All flawless as you'd expect from Glock. Internals look excellent, surprisingly smooth trigger for stock. Not in any rush to give it away, please feel free to make offers. Feel free to text or email me REDACTED. Will respond quickly to either one. Will ship on your dime.

The front-end optical system is similar in basic design to the ANVIS but the eyepiece optics are significantly different.  These NVGs were designed to provide a see-through combiner (beamsplitter) in front of each eye which allows the wearer to see his instrument panel or head-up display (HUD) directly without going through the image intensifier. This concept was developed to allow a pilot to view his aircraft HUD without the loss of image quality that might occur if he/she viewed the HUD through the image intensifier system. The “Cat’s Eye” is a Type II (projected image) Gen III NVIS made by GEC-Marconi, and is standard in the AV-8 series of Harrier aircraft. Asking $1,800."

I totally restored one of the stocks so it has absolutely no dents. They both have their own bayonet (non matching #s) and there is an original oiler and small cleaning kit that came with one of them. Also they both have original slings. Both are original 8mm mauser. $299 each. Only reason I'm selling them is I don't have the time to modify them like I wanted to and I need to clear out some space in the safe.  I've never fired corrosive rounds through either of them and I clean them every time after I shoot them so they're good to go. I have yet to meet anyone who maintains their rifles to the extent that I do.

Rifle #1: I did a full restoration of the stock so it took out 100% of the dents, and the only flaw would be a little gap between the hand guard and lower stock but that's just a cosmetic detail. The rifle I did the full restoration on is totally reblued and the only setback regarding the metal parts are some minor putting from ww2 in the action. Bolt is still super smooth though! The barrel is nice and bright with no pitting. 

rifle #2: The rifle without the total rework still has a great stock but I didn't fully restore it because the dents are so few & minor on it. However, the barrel does have some pitting but based on what I've noticed it's just as accurate as my other rifle. Apart from that there is no pitting anywhere on it! 

Just ask if you want to see some pictures of a specific part on either rifle!

The aiming light increases the accuracy of direct firing at night. After being properly mounted and zeroed to the weapon, and turned ON, the aiming light sends out the invisible light beam along the line of sight which allows the user to engage targets successfully.

Has a rail under the barrel so you can attach your favorite flashlight or laser. 

If you don't know about the Rhinos, they have their barrels aligned with the lowest cylinder, so the recoil from each shot goes straight back into your wrist and reduces muzzle rise. A rhino will have much less felt recoil and muzzle rise than a conventional magnum revolver. .38 specials out of the Rhino feel like .22lr's and you can go through a box of .357 mag without having sore wrists afterwards. Designed by the same man who designed the Mateba Autorevolver, the Rhino shares a lot of the same characteristics, mainly the lower axis barrel.

Turns out I can afford the wedding after all!! :) So basically consider this cancelled. That said, anyone who's really hurting for a box or 3 of something (except the .308 because I'm short on that), I'll help a brother out at 10% below market price, especially the .223/5.56 because I've got lots.

Oh, and the 33lbs of brass I'll still sell if anyone wants it. I don't have a press, my coworker does, but he doesn't have dies for my loads anyway.


I've got a case of PMC x-tac xp193, and most of a case of magtechball m193 (both 556 i think). I'm getting married in about 2 weeks and need the quick loot. I bought these during the panic when i paid between $440 and $550 per case, but I'll let it go for $0.40 (i hope) per round (all brass, no bullshit russian steel). 

Make offer, but it needs to be bare minimum close to $0.40/rnd. I can meet at Academy on 183 and Oak Knoll. If push comes to shove and you'll take a full case of 223 or 556, i might drop a bit lower. Remember, no tax or shipping. so you save a good deal over what I paid and even what you can get now. 

I also have .40 cal (about 1000, 500 of which are PMC JHP 183gr hollow point) and 9mm 500 of freedom munitions reoads, 500 of UMC Remington  target, and about 750/rnd of 308, but i'm only wiling to part with maybe 100-200 of the 308 and it's all magtech (except for a copule boxes of PMC, armscore, and one box of 175gr SSA).

i've got some premium rounds of 223/556 (couple boxes of hornady match 75gr, some remington, pmc, federal bulk, one box of Fusion, one box of tracers, etc), and half of my 9 is remington, 

I don't want to sell out of anything because 2 days before my wedding we're having a range day, but i can part with 250 minimum of any of the 4 calibers, and as many as 1000 of the 223/556 if the price is right.

I'm at anderson mill and 183.

If you want closer pics of a particular caliber, reply via the post. :(

I refuse to sell completely out of anything since the day before my wedding we're gonna have a range day, but if it have to part with a case of brass 223, so be it. 

i also have bout 32+ lbs of brass from all of these cals, mostly 308 (magtech), that i've picked up as i've shot it, i can let that go for $1.50/lb. all of the 308 and 223/556 are one shot (and the .308 is the lions share), but some of the 40 and 9mm are mixed stamps because they started as freedom munitions reloads.

I think the 500 rounds of PMC .40 cal 180 gr JHP might be of real interest to someone. I'd like close to 0.40/rnd, but might drop to 0.35 if you took them all.

Help me and I'll help you *sad face*

All are new in box, of course, except the fired brass obviously.
