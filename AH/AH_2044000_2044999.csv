""In the field, you’re the predator and the prey will never see you coming. The Venture™ Predator takes predator hunting to the extreme—extreme accuracy, extreme concealment. Featuring a 22"" light fluted barrel and T/C’s 5R rifling, the accuracy is unmatched in a rifle priced so affordably. The bell style bolt handle makes for quick, comfortable follow up cycling and the nylon three round clip reduces weight in the field. Venture Predator features Realtree MAX-1™ camo for the best in seclusion technology. With features like this, an affordable price and an MOA guarantee, the coyotes don’t have a chance.""

Bluing is perfect with just a slight bit of wear on the edge of the magazine cover as show in the pictures. The magazine cover is also inlaid with a silver game animal. The trigger guard is also inlaid with silver vines. The highly figured stock displays lots of flame grain with just a few minor handling marks. It has a rosewood grip cap with inlaid bear head outline and a rosewood forearm cap. The gun is scoped with the period correct Redfield 4X12 using original Sako mounts and rings. Also included, but not pictured, is the original Sako rear adjustable peep sight. This is truly an outstanding low serial numbered gun from the Pre-Garcia era. It has the renowned Bofors steel barrel.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 is a 10-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Incorporating new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability, the PMAG 10 provides next-generation performance for those needing lower profile magazines.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® MR556A1 and FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S as well as AR15 mag wells with tighter tolerances. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit.

Low round count, excellent condition. It's a great shooter, I just like my 17HMR better and don't need both. I have a fair amount of ammo for sale also, different kinds, that I'll offer to the buyer first at a very fair price, then sell separate if they're not interested in it. 

I'm looking for $700 cash, or trade plus cash depending on the package. I'm willing to travel a little bit for the deal if you are. I can ship it also if need be and will split the shipping cost (in Kansas)."

The first is a smith and Wesson. Model 60 stainless .357. Excellent shape, and approx 100 rounds through. Small j frame for conceal carry. All accessories and box and papers. Also have a houge hard fitted tactical holster for the model 60. 

I have a carcano 6.5 mm Italian. Rifle. It's the Kennedy Assination rifle. Exact model. It has the cleaning rod with it, adjustable sights, and it's in excellent shape. I have 4 boxes of ammo with it. 3 were bought the year Kennedy was killed. It was my grandfathers. He bought it when Kennedy was killed. The ammo is probably worth more than the gun. Lol.

I have a savage .410/22 over under rifle shotgun. It's beat up, and the stock is worn. But it locks tight and shoots good. Little bluing, and no trigger guard.

For sale is a Miroku Arms .38 special revolver 2"" barrel.  This belonged to my late father who had this for more then 41 years.  As you can see from the photos gun needs to be re-blued on one side.   I've done re-bluing myself before and it really doesn't cost much.  I just don't have the time anymore and don't want to buy a kit to do it because of my limited time.  I took it to the range last week and fired it, it fires great!  Just like is used to when I was a youngster.

Model 1891 infantry rifle. Not looking for common 91/30s, the recent imports, or one you can regularly go to a Gander Mtn, Cabela's, Big 5 or local sporting goods store to find. I am looking for the original model 1891 antique dated on the barrel and receiver tang (dated 1898 or prior). The earlier the better, and earlier features the better. No import marks is a plus. May consider other years of M91 production, like 1919 Tula or pre 1909 dated M91s with early features. More matching the better, Finn capture OK too.

This gun is in excellent condition.  There are no flaws in the wood, and the metal finish is still in excellent condition.  These were made in the factory 26, the only Russian supervised factory in China.  They came with chrome lined bores, and the notorious SKS slamfire issue was resolved.  In my opinion these are the top of the line iof the SKS world.  Accurate and very reliable you cannot beat these guns.  I fitted this one with a promag 30 rounder (properly) and it will also come with the original 10 round box magazine and sling.

Gun History: Received this gun on a trade from the original owner who is in a Army Competition Shooting Team. He said he lazer bore sighted this rifle in at 100 yards, then shot 3 rounds at 100 yards, 3 rounds at 200 yards, and 4 rounds at 300 yards. So rifle only has 10 rounds down the barrel. I have not shot any rounds thru this rifle. Must see to appreciate the wood stock. The gloss finish is in perfect condition. Beautifull gun, I just wont ever shoot it, so I want to sell.

It also has a black plastic case.

Now for the details:
The entire firearm was disassembled, thoroughly degreased, given an acetone bath to remove any left over grease and oil residue then sand blasted with 100 grit Aluminum Oxide. The anodizing was left on the frame for added protection. The frame was lightly blasted just to etch the surface for the Cerakote.
The frame was Cerakoted in Burnt Bronze, Slide was done with Blue Titanium as well as the grips and all controls were coated in Graphite Black.
The barrel was polished as well as the feed ramp. It was assembled using a new spring kit. It has contrast sights and as you can see looks absolutely beautiful! It has not been fired since it was complete but I have cycled 100 rounds through the firearm to ensure proper loading and ejecting.
