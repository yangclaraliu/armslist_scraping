XD(M)® SpecsXD(M)® - 5.25 competition series
Springfield Armory’s® Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details.
They have, once again, raised the expectations of what a polymer pistol can be.
Fiber Optic Front SightAdjustable Rear Sight
Lightening Cut
Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. 
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination.

The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. 

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.
(M)odel Contour Frame(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsTechnology
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shot.
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsInnovations
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.
(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
(M)inimal Error Disassembly
(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. 
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsPersonalizationUsually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsThe Standards
In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. 
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….
Loaded Chamber IndicatorStriker Status IndicatorGrip SafetyUSA Trigger System™The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. [Zoom]Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied."

XD(M)® SpecsXD(M)® - 5.25 competition series
Springfield Armory’s® Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details.
They have, once again, raised the expectations of what a polymer pistol can be.
Fiber Optic Front SightAdjustable Rear Sight
Lightening Cut
Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. 
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination.

The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. 

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.
(M)odel Contour Frame(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsTechnology
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shot.
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsInnovations
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.
(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
(M)inimal Error Disassembly
(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. 
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.
Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsPersonalizationUsually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

Gallery | All XD(M)® SpecsThe Standards
In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. 
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….
Loaded Chamber IndicatorStriker Status IndicatorGrip SafetyUSA Trigger System™The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. [Zoom]Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

I also added a sling and an aftermarket cheek riser to the folding wire stock to afford thr shooter a better cheek weld. This gun is very accurate and very reliable, not to mention the straightup badass points for rockin out with a collapsable ak. I bought it at $800 but I'm looking for $650. It also comes with 100+rds of 7.62x39 and four 30rd magazines. I am looking for cash so unless you have something insane id rather not trade.

Also comes with 4 magazines as well as the box and everything that comes in it.

I've had quite a few different carry guns and I really just prefer the Springfield XD line.  I'd like to trade straight across for an XDm 3.8 Compact in .40, or an XD40 subcompact with extra mags, ammo, or cash.  Not really interested in selling, and these are the only guns I'm looking for.

My disclaimer: I stand by my word. I describe item condition honestly, I properly own all items I sell, I only make legal deals with qualified individuals, and I keep appointments. If you are a flake, don’t waste my time. If you don’t keep your word, the deal is null and void. Unless I specifically say I will reserve an item, it is open to the first paying individual. If you say you will buy it and then don’t get around to sending payment quickly, don’t be surprised if someone buys the item out from under you. When you pay, I ship ASAP. If you are unhappy with an item bought from me, I will probably refund your money, less my shipping costs, when you return the item to me promptly and in same condition.

This is a great rifle. It's very accurate and reliable. I sent it to Magnum Research to have them do a trigger job on it ($85). I'm only selling it because I have too many .22LR rifles and I can't use my suppressors with this one.

These rifles are a high-quality clone of the Ruger 10/22. The receiver is CNC machined from aluminum and the scope rail is integrated into it, not attached with screws. The barrel is stainless steel with a carbon fiber-wrapped sleeve. It's very accurate and lightweight. You can use 10/22 parts on it (barrels, stocks, trigger groups, etc.)

The red dot sight and bipod shown in the photos are NOT included.

The target shown was shot with this rifle. It shoots as well or better than any of my other .22 rifle including some more expensive and/or modified rifles.

This thing is a tank, and for an Ak it is an accurate rifle. You will have no problem getting under 2 MOA groups. This is partially due to the thicker standard barrel, not the thin akm barrels that are more common now.

Looking for either a .22 or a shotgun, but am open to all offers. Would sell for cash for the right price, but really looking to trade. Will give priority to someone willing to drive to Keno and let me test fire the firearm in question, you can test fire the mosin too (not a deal breaker but preffered, we can shoot 2 min from my house)."

The next component that was added was a lower parts kit by DPMS. The butt stock of the gun is a Magpul PRS fully adjustable stock. It has an adjustable cheek piece as well as adjustable length. It's not collapseable. The pistol grip I believe is a magpul hard rubberized grip with the hard rubber base plate. The fore foregrip is also hard rubberized with storage compartment in it. Might be big enough to house a field cleaning kit. This brings us to the upper. It is a complete upper from ARD has a flash suppressor that easily will screw off for the addition of a can. It is the 16 inch 1:8 version. It has the quad rail on it from the factory. There has been less than 150 rounds through this gun.

Really looking for cash or Remington model 7 micro 300 blackout bolt plus cash To make up the rest. This is a cash price if you are looking to trade it will need to be at least 1300$ worth of the trade. Cash price for every thing I have including 4 mags and eotech 517 sight is 1400 firm.

Remington 7400 .243 with two magazines. My father in law gave this to me a while ago, complaining would not eject correctly. It sat in the safe for a couple years, because of that. I recently cleaned it and took it to the range (today), and it ejects fine, no,issues. However sometimes the after it loads another round in the chamber it does not close all the way. Leads me to believe is needs a new spring. 

It sat for years with him. So maybe a very thorough cleaning could do it. But I won't say for say.

I just wanted to put up front that may need a new spring or something along those lines. When I did shoot it, it felt great.

Comes with two magazines.

Really looking to sell however will trade for a 9mm or .45 pistol. Would only consider a smith and wesson (if offering up a revolver for trade).

This is a LNIB, Glock 26, 9mm handgun WITH Glock NIGHT SIGHTS!!! ($90-$100 value) 

I put approximately 150 rounds through this handgun.  All of the rounds were factory FMJ and hollow point Speer Gold Dots with zero malfunctions/stoppages as one would expect from a Glock.

This Glock has never been carried in a holster, etc, and has zero marks on the finish.  There is so little wear on this handgun that if I was dishonest I could claim that it was new in the box and only the most well trained eye would know otherwise.

This gun comes with two ten round mags and one 15 round glock 19 mag.

This is an extremely fair deal, a new Glock 26 withOUT night sites is $499.00 at Bud's.  Factor in only two mags, paying for shipping, and FFL transfer fee, and again not even having night sights makes this more than a fair deal.  

Will not ship, FTF in the Indy area.  Although not required by law, I insist that the seller provide an Indiana driver license AND concealed carry permit which will be recorded on the bill of sale which one copy will go to the buyer and one copy to me."
