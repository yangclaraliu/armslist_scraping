Includes the shotgun, box, and owners manual.

A little background on this gun:
For those of you who may not be aware, the patent on the Remington 870 tactical shotgun (standard issue for most police and SWAT teams), expired a # of years back.  Since then, it has been completely legal for companies to reproduce the 870, under their own name of course. This is exactly what this shotgun is, a Remington 870 clone. It looks, feels, and operates like a Remington 870, only it is a third of the cost. All 870 accessories, add-ons, and upgrades will work with this shotgun as well, with one exception, the barrel. The barrel on the IAC model uses a little bit thicker steel. There are plenty of reviews and videos about this model on youtube, check them out. You'll see, for the money, these are one of the best home defense/tactical shotguns out there. 

I have owned one of these exact shotguns for years, and I absolutely love it. Very dependable and rugged. Shoots both 2.75"" and 3"" shells. A friend of mine recently wanted me to purchase one online for him since he liked mine so much. So I did, and he ran into some financial issues and is not able to take it, so it is up for sale. I paid $200 plus shipping plus a $50 FFL transfer fee. I'm selling it at a loss for $225. I may consider trades, but they would be at a higher value ($250+) depending on the trade.

Here are the specs for this shotgun from IAC:
12 gauge
18.5"" barrel
3"" chamber
5 round capacity (can add the 870 hi-capacity tube for 2 or 3 more rounds if desired)
Polymer stock
Matte black finish
Machined, solid steel receiver
Adjustable ghost ring sights
38.5"" overall length
7 pounds 

Must be 18 yrs old with a valid OH ID to purchase. No shipping, FTF only. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. CCW preferred."

The .40 barrel has just under 300rds and the 9mm barrel has 100rds through it. The Lone Wolf conversion barrel is precision machined and is considered to be much more accurate than the factory Glock barrel. Gun comes with 1 Glock Factory 15rd .40 magazine, 1 Glock Factory 17rd 9mm magazine, and 1 Korean 33rd 9mm magazine. Gun comes stock, but a Grip Force Beaver-tail has been added to maintain a higher grip and prevent slide bite. For those of you who are unaware, the Glock 35 is the ""competition"" version of the Glock 22. The G35 features: Extended Slide Release lever, Extended magazine release, 4.5lb trigger, and a longer sight radius that it's G22 counterpart. This gun is used by many competition shooters and it's rock solid reliable and it is in perfect condition with no slide wear or scratches. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I recently bought a Glock 30 for carry and see no other point for .40 for me. I carried this gun for self-defense the past year with the .40 barrel for the stopping power and used the 9mm barrel for much cheaper training with the same platform. The only thing needed to convert the gun from .40 to 9mm is to remove the slide, like you would for routine cleaning, remove the .40 barrel, and insert the 9mm barrel using the same guide rod and everything. Load up the 9mm magazine and have fun! This gun sells new for ~$650 online and even higher at most retail shops. I paid ~$120 for the conversion barrel and the gun also comes with the grip force adapter and 2 Factory magazines. I think the price and trade desires are very reasonable.This gun is essentially 2 Glocks in 1! Ladies, this would be a great Christmas gift for you husband, and Gentlemen, this gun has gotten a lot of looks at the range and from buddies.  With all of that said, do yourself/spouse a favor and buy this great gun for competition, home defense, self defense, cheap(er) training, or for just plain ol' range fun.

Emails are sent directly to my phone, and is the best way to reach me, and feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns. Face to face trade in the Boone area is preferred. Buyer must prove that he/she is legally able to purchase a firearm in the state of NC by either a pistol purchase permit with valid NC ID (Driver's license, State Issued ID card of some sort), NC issued concealed pistol permit with valid ID, or meeting at a FFL gun shop and go through the process of a transfer (buyer pays fees). Since Boone is so close to the TN border, if anyone in TN would like to purchase/trade, I will meet you at the closest FFL dealer to the NC border and it is your responsibility to pay any transfer fees.

240,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2419240,For Trade:  FT: Home Bar/Man Cave Upgrade - ISO: Shotgun or Rifle,"North-east Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, Indiana",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, December 12, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"I'm looking for a dependable home defense weapon (shotgun, smooth-bore preferably) in trade for everything. I'm not ""shooting for the moon"" (forgive the pun), and I'm open to any offer you'd like to make, but for now I'm not taking cash offers for individual pieces or interested in other types of trades.

  Up for trade is a home bar / man cave upgrade stuffed with more than enough products to either get your man cave started or fill out your den enough to truly call it the home bar you've always been looking for. These are all display pieces that I've taken (with permission) from my work over the last seven years or so that I don't have a place for in my own home bar right now. Every piece has been treated respectfully... it has first been displayed in a store set, and then spent some time in my own home bar set, so they have some general wear and tear but are in good condition.

  I would like to keep the set together so I will give preference to those trade offers. I don't have a great deal of extra money right now, so any ""+cash offers"" you make I will likely have to turn down.

  A few important things I'd like to point out are:

 The Camel neon is one of the old models that are built to last - the new neons all have these sh*tty-ass transformers that go out after six months and cost more than the whole damned neon to replace. These old models are built like a brick sh*thouse and as long as you treat it with respect, it should last you as long time. I can send you as pic of the transformer if you want to take a look.

  Some of the signs are vintage (none of them are reproductions), such as the bud tin and the cigar clock. I have no idea on ""value"" but they add a nice old school elegance... the cigar clock runs on batteries (two AA's), and must be plugged in to light up. It keeps fairly accurate time with fresh batteries and I've never had to replace anything, but I've added more neons to my home bar and don't have room for it anymore. The minute hand is beat up but doesn't impede functionality, and you could replace it easily and cheaply if you wanted to spruce it up.

  If there's anything else you feel you need to fill out your bar, let me know and I can probably dig something up from my collection.

  Another important point to make is that I'm a big guy... I don't take something home that's going to break under me. I can sit in those chairs *comfortably,* so unless you've got me beat by a hundred pounds you can rest easy. Aside from that, you can see everything included... I can text or email you any more pictures that you want. If you live in Fort Wayne, I can deliver it all to you. If you're not, I'll try to find a fair middle ground with you. 

  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll get back with you as soon as possible.

  Thanks for taking a look. I appreciate it!"

Gun is in excellent condition and barely used. Teeny ding on grip. The bluing is more of a royal blue finish. Walnut grips.  This gun is essentially the same as a beretta cheetah and made by Beretta also under contract.  The differences are the Browning has a slide mounted safety. the safety goes up to shoot, has traditional hammer spur, a closed slide, round trigger guard and slightly different sites.  Many say this is the most elegant handgun ever made.  I agree as this is my second one I purchased. Very reliable, even with hot 380's. Alloy frame makes for lighter carry and conceals very well and is comfortable edc. Great triggers and very accurate. With 14 rounds of hot 380 in an accurate reliable gun like this you'll feel protected. One medallion fell off and is not on the gun. Common problem with these. They sell on ebay cheap and if you put on just use a two part epoxy glue.  My other one I'm keeping had both come off too.Just one flaw they all suffer from. Pachmyr grips are made for these and look pretty good fyi. Good all around gun, even for women.   Will come with a never used mahogany JBP holster that I got for around 30 bucks. Comes with just one magazine and no box. Collectible as had not been made since late nineties.  This is NOT! one of the Israeli or European beater former police ones. Contact or text me- Kevin- (cell) REDACTED anytime. Reasonable offers please. Oh. and I recently field stripped and super cleaned the gun with break free with the grips off to perfection, took apart mag and cleaned as well so it's not going to need you to do any of that for awhile."

If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

1895-1911 W. Richards 12 Gauge SxS Underlever Shotgun. You don't see many of these underlevers around. It has a 28.25"" Cast Steel Barrel (un-cut), Functioning side hammers and working double triggers. Walnut stock is in good shape.  No scroll work on wood or metal. Has incorrect bolt for breech pivot pin. Left firing Pin needs replaced to make mechanically functional. Not recommended for shooting, and not to be confused with Wesley or William Richards shotguns.

1966 Rohm RG10 .22short revolver, blued w/white plastic grips, 2.5"" barrel – Excellent+ condition w/original box and 13 rounds of ammo. Box of ammo are likely as old as the gun. Great trainer or novelty piece.

1972 Remington Speedmaster 552 .22 (S,L,LR) tube fed semi-auto, 23.5"" barrel - Excellent working and physical condition. Bluing is strong with some scratches mainly on the receiver. Stock has a few minor dings as might be expected, but looks very good. I've taken this one down and did a thorough cleaning. It is in great shape with a bright shiny bore.

1975 Winchester Model 94 30-30, blued w/wood stock, 20"" barrel – Excellent working and Physical condition. Has some minor pitting, especially on one side of receiver, due to setting for many years. The rust and finish have been removed from the left side of the receiver where most of the pitting is located. Because of the difficulty in bluing this model, it will either need to be sent out for special processing, or one could go the paint route. Brownell's has a product called Paint & Bake that is said to look very nice and is very durable. It was owned by a very elderly man who has passed away. Considering he was up in his years when he bought it new, I would guess it did not get much use. The action and condition also indicate very little use.

1976 Glenfield Model 60 .22LR, tube fed semi-auto – Very good condition with the stock having some minor scratches and thinning of the finish in a couple places. Checkering is in great shape. Also has a Bushnell 4x Sportview 22 scope. Overall a good looking rifle. If the stock were just a little better, I'd grade it excellent.

2012 Bersa Thunder .380 Duo-Tone, DA/SA, 3.5” barrel – LNIB w/extra 9rnd mag, soft case, & holster. Only 3 shots ever fired. Can include some ammo for a good deal. Great CC package. Cash sale of this handgun requires a carry permit or proof of handgun ownership.

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

They are also night sights, and glow in the dark. This pistol is a single action firearms with a crisp trigger and an excellent feel.

This one is not brand new, but runs like a charm. If you are in the pressure Washing business and need a heavy duty machine for big jobs. (Specifically the ones you need for big concrete jobs/hot water) It needs a new hose and gun. (Can buy a replacement set at lowes for as little as $35.00, so please don't offer me $500 and say the low offer is because it needs a hose and a gun)

I am asking $1400 OBO. May be interested in Trades or partial trades. I like cool stuff, hunting/firearms/electronics/pigcooker or other, let me know what you have and we can try and work something out.

What a name! It's based on the fact that many judges are now carrying it into the courtroom with them-and for good reason. We know of no better self-defense firearm. Whether loading all 45s-all .410s or alternating them in the cylinder, the Judge is the ultimate shotgun/revolver duo. New for 2008, we're giving you the Judge in Ultra-Lite forged alloy. You'll be amazed how light this gun is and how easy it is to tote around. Also new is the Judge 3"" Magnum. Larger and more powerful, this Judge gives you the extra firepower you need when you have to lay down the law.

These upper receivers are precision AR platforms.  They are designed and manufactured to shoot consistent sub-MOA groups.  My experience with this particular upper is no different.  My best ten shot group out at 100 yards was .35 utilizing Hornady .75gr BTHP match ammo.

Specs:

Upper Receiver - The LaRue Stealth receiver is an improved-version of the currently fielded mil-spec flat-top receiver. Machined from billet 7075-T6, the Stealth is designed with more of material in critical areas to alleviate past issues of weakness and to stiffen the receiver, maximizing the weapons overall accuracy.

Barrel - 16"" Barrel, made from LW50 Stainless Steel, Wylde-chambered in 5.56mm, 1-in-8 twist polygonal rifling in medium-weight contour.

11"" LaRue Tactical Free-Float Rail system - CNC-machined out of aluminum.  Features LT's two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, which translates into no chance of movement whatsoever.
