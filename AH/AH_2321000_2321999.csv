This Czech VZ52/57 is an sks variant semi-auto rifle and is highly sought for its quality milled receiver and accuracy, but mostly because it was manufactured for the Russians in 7.62x39 caliber from 1952 to 1959. This is a rare rifle since most that are found are chambered in 7.62x45 which you can't find. There are barrel sleeve conventions, this factory barreled. Side story is this rifle could be a Greneda bring back, I however can't verify this, also there are no import marks and this is all matching.

I understand the events in the previous months that have caused the AR-15 to become ubiquitous in the current market and you can now buy a Colt at Walmart for $1,000. This is not one of those rifles. The rifle I am selling has only the best parts money can buy and it has still retained its value even through the ups and downs with the politics surrounding firearm sales.  $3291.99 is about the total price it would cost to get everything I am selling in this package.  In this total cost I have even made some items below the cost that you would find in a retail store. I believe everyone works hard for their money and would only want to offer an honest and fair price for what I have put into this rifle. For instance, the mill spec mags in this package I saw selling for $50 in Academy Sports but listed them at $35.00 to try and bring the price down some. You can review all the items and their current prices. I ask for serious inquires only and would hope that this rifle could go to a member of the armed forces for a Christmas present or a responsible American citizen that values their second amendment rights.

I do not have a way to run it and I have disconnected the fuel tank and lines in order to store it for the winter.  All I ask is that you understand that this is a cheap motor for a reason.  One that runs like a new one or is in excellent condition runs about $500-$750 used.

I had 6 identical rifles with consecutive serial numbers and this is the last one. All were in their original factory wrap (in wood crate) when I bought them in 1989. 

This rifle has never been fired and is as good an example as you are ever likely to find. It's in the exact same condition as when it left Mother Russia. 

The stock is the laminated version and it has the beautiful  ""tiger stripe"" grain pattern that I personally think is far more appealing than the hardwood version. 

Both metal and wood are in 99.9% condition with no handling or storage marks that I can detect. 

Bore actually gleams in the way that only those in unfired rifles can. 

Bolt is the bright version, and almost looks chrome plated because of the extensive polishing at factory. 

Every number matches: receiver, upper cover, bolt, magazine & trigger group.  

Bottom line is that this rifle is one darn fine collectible that you'll never feel the need to upgrade. 

Included with rifle: 
Original Russian khaki color web sling. 
Original oiler & cleaning kit complete with some original cosmoline. 
(8) original steel stripper clips. 
Leapers scope mount with rings. 
Nice quality Simmons red dot sight (never mounted). 
High quality PRE-BAN integral blued steel 20 round magazine (never installed). 
ProMag 30 round polymer magazine in unopened original packaging. 
80 rounds 7.62x39 ammo - lacquered steel case, non-corrosive, 123 grain FMJ bullets. 
Ammo is packed on 8 additional strippers with reuseable olive drab nylon bandoleer. 

Asking price for package is $850.  Rifle to be picked up in Brandon by a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old."

Used but not abused, you will find this Wildey powerhouse to be in very good to excellent condition inside and out. Other than a few light scratches on the frame and some marks on the trigger guard this beast could pass for new.

This Wildey comes with one mag, sorry, the box and manual have been discarded.

The Wildey was purposefully designed to be a hunting firearm. The pistol is built to withstand breech pressures of over 48,000 psi associated with Moore's proprietary cartridge lines. The Wildey was the first gas-operated semi-automatic pistol.

The Wildey employs a unique short-stroke gas operation which has allowed for the adaptation of the pistol to fire several high pressure cartridges ranging from the 9mm Winchester Magnum to the .475 Wildey Magnum. Moore described the Wildey patented gas system as an ""air-hydraulic piston powered by the firing gases through six small holes in the barrel. This piston forces the slide rearward, initiating the cycling of the pistol."" A further advantage of the Wildey's gas operated system is that it allows for the reliable operation of heavy and light loads for each cartridge type. The gas system must be tuned for each load and is done so manually by opening or closing the gas regulating collet. Another advantage of this gas system is that it is capable of reducing felt recoil.

The Wildey uses a fixed barrel, three lug, rotating bolt design. The bolt locks into the aft barrel extension. The bolt is linked to the slide via one of the bolt lugs. When the cartridge is fired, the piston is forced against the slide. The retracting slide catches the extended bolt lug which causes the bolt to rotate open. The spent cartridge is ejected by the bolt through the retracting slide's ejection port. The fixed barrel design is considered to promote greater accuracy over pistols designed around an articulating barrel design. The Wildey can be used as either a single shot or an auto-loading pistol."

A lot of game has fallen for the rolling block. Now it's your turn.

In 1866, the rolling block rifle was the choice of serious hunters. Now, Knight has captured that rugged design in its new KRB607 muzzleloader and enhanced it with modern day in-line muzzleloading technology.

The Knight KRB607 is available in .50 caliber and incorporates a removable breech plug that accepts a 209 primer, without the use of the Full Red Jackets.

Like all Knight muzzleloaders, the KRB607 comes with a Green Mountain barrel, the most accurate barrel money can buy. Only Knight offers a guaranteed shot accuracy at 100 yards.

I used 300 of the original 900 case and never had a problem. It is great ammo. My Vz. 24 was stolen, so I have no need for the ammo. I think I've had all the fun I can have with an 8MM bolt gun anyway. The remainder that I am sellings, 600 rounds, are all in 15 round paper boxes in the original wooden crate it came in. I am only asking 300$ firm cash, but I would trade for:

***A Mosin Nagant (91/30, M38, M44) and 7.62x54R to make it up to 300$
An Archangel stock for a Mosin Nagant

I am flexible, if you have a good bolt gun you'd like to trade in .308, I'd be willing to take the rifle and a little cash or maybe give you the ammo and a little cash if the rifle is worth more than the ammo. I feel that 300$ is a fair price, and I really am not in a position to budge. If you have something interesting you think I might like, let me here your offer."

Needs a tune up (rotor, cap, wires last replaced at 190K), battery was just recharged at Batteries plus then my son killed it again by trying to start it.  It will jump.  Will need another recharge but the battery is fine.  Everything works... clean interior for the year.  Power package LX.  Now it dies every other time my son drives it and we're not mechanical.  This is not a reliable car any longer for long trips outside the immediate area because of this.  Last month I was going to and from Tacoma in it.  It gets a true 35 mpg because it's been well maintained until now that the work may surpass the time and money I want to put into it.  Clean title, has 252K, coolant flushed at 225K, water pump and timing belt at 204K, 5 speed (excellent tranny), needs a clutch soon (or avoid stopping on really steep hills lol).    

Body is solid, suspension is too (shocks replaced at 140K by previous owner), and the electical system is good as well.  Tires are ""ok,"" but could use a new set by next summer.  This was my son's first car and would make for an excellent project or I hate to say it... a parts car.  If no one bites, I have been offered half of my asking price at a junk yard, but I really hate to see a great car that just needs a tune up go to trash.  It's blue (faded paint).  Estimate on tune up at a shop is $200-$300, clutch $180 parts/$380 labor.

If you're mechanical come get your easy project and flip it... I don't want to deal with it anymore.

In those days the United States was a firearms manufacturing colossus, so Britain turned to various American arms factories for weapons. First was Smith & Wesson for revolvers. As early as 1887, Britain’s military handgun cartridge was the .455 Webley. By the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, smokeless powder had replaced black powder in that .76″ long case. Bullet weight was a hefty 265 grains, its shape was a rather odd conical roundnose and velocity was rated at only 580 fps. This was their Mark II cartridge (Source Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition).

In 1907 Smith & Wesson introduced their first swing cylinder, large frame revolver. It was at first named the New Century, but collectors have come to term it the Hand Ejector, 1st Model. Most writers in the gun magazine business usually call it a “Triplelock.” Its introductory chambering was .44 Smith & Wesson Special, but before it was dropped, circa 1915, some were also made as .45 Colt, .44-40 and .38-40. To accommodate the British it was a simple matter for S&W engineers to alter “Triplelocks” to .455 Webley."

 For anyone looking at this post let me just say that a Rommy WUM-1 is NOTHING like a WASR10, the quality is much higher, SAR-1 and WUM-1 AKs are slightly modified Romanian military AKs without the happy switch, note the dimple on the magwell for a tight fit and the overall fit and finish on the close up shots, this isn't a canted sight, wobbly mag WASR - this is a good AK."

721,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2321721,"For Sale:  7MM Speer 175 Grain Grand Slam Box of 50 .284"" Dia","Western Blvd, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 32,"Listed On: Monday, November 11, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is one box of 50 Speer 175 Grain Grand Slam Projectiles with a diameter of 284” (7MM). 

    Grand Slam premium hunting bullets are made for the demanding hunter. Years of research and continuous improvement are the key factors in this bullet. 

    Grand Slam jackets start with precision-drawn gliding metal like other Speer bullets, but that is where the similarity ends. The Grand Slam jacket is drawn from thicker metal used in the critical shank portion, the part of the bullet that has to hold up when the going gets tough. Ahead of the shank, the jacket is carefully profiled; making the transition to a gentle taper that allows reliable expansion over a wide velocity range.

    Multiple internal flutes at the jacket's tip insure uniform expansion whether you're shooting a 300 Savage or a 300 Weatherby. Grand Slam also uses Speer's exclusive Hot-Cor process. The proprietary ternary alloy is melted and injected at 900 degrees F into each jacket, flowing into shell folds for a better grip and eliminating oxide formation that can cause bullet failures.

    Final forming produces adds a long, ogival nose profile for flatter shooting. The extended jacket design protects the bullet tip from in-magazine damage. A cannelure allows securing the bullet for use in heavy-recoil rifles and provides additional holding power to retain the core during expansion.

    Grand Slam has evolved over the last quarter century into a highly respected game bullet, both in North American and on the plains of Africa. They cost more, but more goes into making each bullet. 

    If you have any questions, please contact me via e-mail at REDACTED.  Please expect a delay in correspondence. 

    I accept cash, check or money order for payment.

The other has slight finish wear and also performs perfect.  No issues great summer carry guns.  I have just moved on to different carry pieces and figure someone else can use them.  Each one comes with 2 10 round mags.  I have a total of 6 extra 10 round mags and 1 extended mag.  I will sell the extra mags for $10 a piece.
