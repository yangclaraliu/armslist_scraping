It is in overall good condition. This is a low number 1903 that has had a hatcher hole added indicating possible USMC use. This is a low numbered receiver, considered by some to be non shooters. From what Ive read online the Marines continued to use low numbered rifles all the way through ww2. This was made in 1917 best I can tell. Finish is mostly patina. The barrel appears to be an Avis dated 10-18. Marking is very faint. I would rate the bore as fair, some light corrosion and looks frosty over all. Not a sewer pipe by any means. The muzzle wear is just over a 2. The stock has been nicely refinished and there is some shine to it. There is a small crack behind the receiver tang. This is some light old pitting on some parts of the receiver. It is not very noticable. Looks like its been there a long time. No import marks. Please feel free to ask any questions.
FTF on the south side of Indy. Will need to see an Indiana DL, no info will be recorded.

Never been fired. I have about 10 boxes of ammo I am willing to sell if buyer is interested. Hard shell carrying case included (not shown in picture)

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, V5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down."

This precision weapon is in absolutely pristine condition and has only 41 rounds through it.  

The SPR (Special Police Rifle) series features a chrome lined bore for extended barrel life and accuracy.  The FN SPR A3G has been selected by the FBI as one of their tactical precision rifles. The A3G offers Controlled Round Feed, blade ejection, the original Model 70-type two lever trigger and a three-position safety. Chambered in 308 Win., the A3G features a cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC fluted barrel with hard-chromed bore and is held to +/- .001"" headspace to produce and maintain a sub-half minute of angle (sub-½ MOA ) accuracy standard at 100 yards, making it ideal for long-range target shooting and competition. The forged steel action is hand-bedded with Marine-Tex® epoxy into a fully-adjustable McMillan™ A3 fiberglass tactical stock that is equipped with multiple steel sling studs. 

Those of you who are familiar with this weapon knows it retails for around $2700 ( http://grabagun.com/fnh-usa-spr-a3g-308-win-24-fluted.html)  I'm asking $2200 for the rifle.  Scope and rings not included.  Not interested in trades at this time.

This brass has been lightly cleaned. It has NOT been deprimed/resized/trimmed to length or had the primer pocket crimp removed or has been processed in any other way. This is mostly Lake City brass with nato headstamp. However, other military headstamps may be included. I've had lots of questions over the last 6 months or so from new reloaders. This is guranteed once fired brass. Commercial mixed headstamp brass may have some rounds that have only been fired once. But will also include rounds that have been fired twice or multiple times. The amount of times availalbe to reload commercial brass are less than with once fired military brass. All reloading manuals reccomend sorting all mixed headstamp brass seperately. One of the reasons for this is each manufacturer's brass may have ever so slight different dimenions from one another and may process differently from other rounds from other manufacturers. Military brass is much more uniform and made to mil spec's. So be aware when purchasing cheaper commercial mixed headstamp brass. I'm asking .19 cents per round."

Very fun to shoot, but I am having a kid on the way and selling some of my things I don't use often.  This gun was bought new from cabbellas for 350 and I still have the receipt and all the stuff that came with it, including the box and manual and stuff.  It also came with a trigger lock.  I swapped the sights out for a laser dual shot reflex sight made by sight mark that was 100 bucks plus I bought the warranty for it.  It has 4 different reticles and is amazingly accurate and also has a laser for even quicker shooting.  I still have the original sights for it too.  Also it came with a sling and two magazine clips.  Next is a Winchester gun cleaning kit that was 35 bucks and has everything you need plus tons more.  And lastly, I have 400 rounds of bullets that cost roughly 180 bucks.  All together over 650 bucks!  Yours today for 500 obo.
So a recap (and for those who don't like to read), you get:
-nearly new .40 cal hi-point rifle with all original papers and box
-laser dual shot reflex red dot sights
-2 clips
-gun cleaning kit
-and 400 rounds of ammo

This version takes series 92 magazines. It is also a bit of an ""in betweener"" model (made in 2010) -- it is the later version that has the pic rail on top between the sights, but not the most recent version that has the checkered foregrip and pieces that protect the safety.

I am the second owner of this Storm, and it is in great condition -- a rough estimate is that it has 500 rounds total through it. It is an excellent shooter, very accurate (almost boringly accurate out to 100 yds), eats any ammo I've put through it including Tula steel and Blazer aluminum, and has not seen heavy use. It is not a ""problem child"" that malfunctions, has problems, is damaged, or has any other issues. The only cosmetic issue is a small ding on forward edge of right side ejection port (see photo below), which is a fairly typical bit of wear for the Storm Carbine. It had some very light work done to the trigger/hammer/sear by a gunsmith that significantly improved the stock factory trigger pull. I actually really love this carbine and hate to get rid of it -- its been a very comfortable, accurate, and reliable range toy -- but I just had the opportunity to pick up an MP5 clone, so this one has to go.

Comes with 2 x 15-round factory magazines (standard 92FS magazines) and 1 x 17-round aftermarket mag (also 92 FS compatible).

Accessories included (not installed on the carbine in the photos):
- AIM Sports red dot sight
- Forend tri-rail
- UTG Ergo foregrip
- Ultimate Arms incandescent light with rail mount and remote pressure switch
- Factory plastic case, cleaning kit, manuals/papers, etc.

$850, FTF preferred. Located in Enid, and willing to meet within 60 minute drive radius (more than halfway to OKC or Tulsa areas if desired). Thanks for lookin'!

It’s time to bring your antique SKS into the modern day with the INTRAFUSE® SKS Stock System. This system gives you a 6 position adjustable T6™ stock, so it will accommodate any sized shooter, a SAW Style Pistol Grip for greater comfort and control, and an upper handguard rail for adding accessories. This version also comes with a lower Picatinny rail to add extra accessories. Our stock system works on most SKS models and is made of the highest strength composite. So, if you’re ready to leave your original wooden stock in a museum somewhere and transform your SKS into a 21st century tactical firearm, purchase the INTRAFUSE® SKS Stock System today.  

*** ALSO INCLUDED:  20 ROUND 7.x62x39 DETACHABLE MAGAZINE.  We’ve designed our SKS Detachable Magazines with serious shooters in mind. The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface. We’ve used the highest quality interior components and incorporated a metal floorplate so you can expect maximum strength from this magazine. That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything.

 *** ALSO INCLUDED:  VERTICAL GRIP.  A shortened version of our popular Standard Length Vertical Grip.  The reduced length will not interfere when using large capacity mags in your AK.


You can have all the shiny gadgets you want on your rifle, but it isn’t worth much if you can’t control the rifle enough to hit the broad side of a barn. We want to put some of that control back in your hands, literally, with the INTRAFUSE® Vertical Grip. The grip is designed to give you ultimate command over your rifle and enable you to acquire targets much faster. We’ve flattened out the sides for a solid attachment of tactical light tape switches and created a waterproof storage compartment within the grip. We dare you to mount the INTRAFUSE® Vertical Grip on your favorite rifle and tell us that it doesn’t give you more power over your rifle.

The SIX8™ weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.
