Scope is new in box. The rifle is brand new with the box papers and everything. I mean everything. It even has the three little tubes of lube that was sent with it. This gun has never been fired and has been in a silicone impregnated sock and in a safe since receiving it. Everything is worth over 1700 before taxes which means even more after taxes. I'm only asking $1400 Give yourself a nice present this year for cheap. You save $200+ off the retail price and you don't have to pay taxes on it. In other words you are saving about $300+. Please only serious buyers. I can send pictures on request and if you want to meet I will be meeting at a public location (usually a firearms store). I do not meet at residences. Cash only, no trades, FTF only.
Email by the armslist link, or text 319- three three zero -7855.
I was just at Erie Sports Store yesterday. They have the same gun, but the grade below this one for 995. So for $55 more, you get a brand new gun with a better quality stock.... or you could go buy a used one from them for essentially the same price. Sounds like a no brainer to me."

Gen 3 or better Night Vision System (NVS), like a PVS-14 / 7 or OPMOD, etc. It can be rail-mounted, helmet / binoc, or even handheld monocular (order of preference). I'm also open to something in FLIR / Thermal as well. Whatever it is, it needs to have some REAL life left in it, not some 10 year old, battle-scarred beater. For the right unit I'm willing to add boot. 

What I HAVE:
One of my AR's is a gorgeous LMT Defender 2000 that has had fewer that 500 rounds put through it (all top-shelf brass, no steel-case crap). I have a few high-end AR's but this is the only one that has been a virtual safe queen. There literally is not a single use mark on it, it looks brand new. It's an all-original LMT, purchased earlier this year, that I have tastefully upgraded with useful, high-end parts -- a Troy Battlesight rear flip-up BUIS (dead-on co-witness), a Troy Carbine-Length quad-rail, an ERGO grip, Spike's billet trigger guard, a Magul CTS buttstock and B.A.D. lever, a LaRue Tactical buffer tube and Tubb Precision spring, and an AIMPOINT PRO up top that co-witnesses with the Troy BUIS and standard front A2 sight post. I think I still have the original LMT box as well, but will have to confirm that.

At **today's** prices this rifle is easily over $2,000 to duplicate, using the best current street prices.

This isn't some cheap Rock River, Bushmaster, Windham Walmart rifle or a Frankenbuild. No, this is a beautiful rifle, and is ready to be YOUR go-to battle rifle. If you're interested feel free to email or call. I'm in Northeast Alabama, and I have my own 150-yard rifle range if you want to come by and give her a test-drive. Just bring your NVS along, and we can talk turkey.

I'm NOT interested in selling the rifle outright, unless you know someone who has a NVS and he's willing to do a 3-way deal.

Gen 3 or better Night Vision System (NVS), like a PVS-14 / 7 or OPMOD, etc. It can be rail-mounted, helmet / binoc, or even handheld monocular (order of preference). I'm also open to something in FLIR / Thermal as well. Whatever it is, it needs to have some REAL life left in it, not some 10 year old, battle-scarred beater. For the right unit I'm willing to add boot. 

What I HAVE:
One of my AR's is a gorgeous LMT Defender 2000 that has had fewer that 500 rounds put through it (all top-shelf brass, no steel-case crap). I have a few high-end AR's but this is the only one that has been a virtual safe queen. There literally is not a single use mark on it, it looks brand new. It's an all-original LMT, purchased earlier this year, that I have tastefully upgraded with useful, high-end parts -- a Troy Battlesight rear flip-up BUIS (dead-on co-witness), a Troy Carbine-Length quad-rail, an ERGO grip, Spike's billet trigger guard, a Magul CTS buttstock and B.A.D. lever, a LaRue Tactical buffer tube and Tubb Precision spring, and an AIMPOINT PRO up top that co-witnesses with the Troy BUIS and standard front A2 sight post. I think I still have the original LMT box as well, but will have to confirm that.

At **today's** prices this rifle is easily over $2,000 to duplicate, using the best street prices.

This isn't some cheap Rock River, Bushmaster, Windham Walmart rifle or a Frankenbuild. No, this is a beautiful rifle, and is ready to be YOUR go-to battle rifle. If you're interested feel free to email or call. I'm in Northeast Alabama, and I have my own 150-yard rifle range if you want to come by and give her a test-drive. Just bring your NVS along, and we can talk turkey.

I'm NOT interested in selling the rifle outright, unless you know someone who has a NVS and he's willing to do a 3-way deal.

There was always ammo available for this gun even tru the shortages and I suspect it's easier to find 3 diferent calibers in a desperate situation
I will add pics this afternoon , we need a background Check as required by law

However as the war was starting to wind down - some of this ammo went unused so it was repacked into sealed tuna cans (of 10 rounds each) by the manufacturer in October of 1945. Then some of these ended up finding their way to the surplus market at some point.

This is the correct flare ammo for all those Remington, H&R, and Sedgley flare pistols out there that are chambered for 10 gauge.

You can look, and look and look some more and may never find another sealed can of these flares. They are quite unusual & collectible. 

I obtained some of these in a blind box lot purchase at the estate sale of an old military collector who passed away.

Asking $100 for the sealed can. I see these same flares for sale from time to time on the gun auction sites and asking price is usually about $25 per round.

Pick them up in Brandon and you must be at least 18 to purchase.

p.s. As these flares are packed in a sealed can that has remained unopened since 1945 - I cannot speak to or guarantee their condition. However I feel reasonably sure they are all live and useable. They were canned about 18 months after they were manufactured and this particular can shows no visible signs of damage, tampering, or corrosion, and the fact is that it's in unbelievable shape for being over 68 years old."

Remington 7400  .243 with two magazines. My father in law gave this to me a while ago, complaining would not eject correctly. It sat in the safe for a couple years, because of that. I recently cleaned it and took it to the range (today), and it ejects fine, no,issues. However sometimes the after it loads another round in the chamber it does not close all the way. Leads me to believe is needs a new spring. 

It sat for years with him. So maybe a very thorough cleaning could do it. But I won't say for say.

I just wanted to put up front that may need a new spring or something along those lines. When I did shoot it, it felt great.

However, the new plastic cans must be marked fuel. I have a water marked plastic Jerry can and it will not work on this one. This same fitting will also fit a standard 55 gallon drum opening. It is a gravity flow for the fuel to the heater. It comes with everything necessary to use. Except for match's or a lighting source and the fuel tank. All, hoses, connections, fittings, etc are all brand new unwrapped in the box. It has a coating on the heater to keep from the unit from rusting during long term storage.THE H-45 SPACE HEATER IS 45K BTU HEATER THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HEAT FOR THE GENERAL PURPOSE TENTS (SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE), TEMPER TENTS AND TOC'S. THE H-45 HEATER OPERATES WITHOUT THE USE OF ELECTRICAL POWER AND CAN BE USED IN MODERATE TO ARCTIC CONDITIONS. SEE ARMY OPERATOR'S MANUAL TM-9-4520-257-12&P. The manual is included in the kit."

As far as legality, This particular design was followed by the Spitfire, Commando and Apache Carbines which appeared in the early 1970's. The Spitfire's and Apache's were banned by the ATF and reclassified as ""machine guns"", in effect making this already rare Eagle Carbine the only legal version of this type of firearm.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing.
I live in Puyallup, but I will be in Spokane this weekend for the holidays and can meet in the area if you are on the east side."

216,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2383216,For Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Washington, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 27, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 100 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W.
I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping. I will also be in Spokane for the holiday weekend and can meet there.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

 Model: TAVOR SAR-B16 

 Caliber: 5.56X45mm NATO or .223 Rem.

 The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. 

 The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. 

 Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy 

 Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles 

 Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies 

 Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR parts

 Last round hold open on empty magazine 

 All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance 

 Integral rubber recoil pad 

 Assembled in the Harrisburg, PA from Israeli and US manufactured parts

WITH BLASER RAZ SIGHTS. THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN THE PICTURE. THE R93 LUXUS SPORTS ALL THE FEATURES OF THE BLASER R93 SYSTEM; STRAIGHT PULL BOLT , 360 DEGREE RADIAL BOLT LOCK UP; SEAR FREE TRIGGER MECHANISM; FREE FLOATING INTERCHANGABLE BARRELS AND THE SILENT THREE POINT SAFETY SYSTEM; RAPID SIMPLE TAKEDOWN; ALL OF THIS COMES HANDSOMELY PACKAGED WITH A TWO PIECE UPGRADED STOCK OF FIGURED HIGH GRADE TURKISH WALNUT WITH EBONY FOREND, ACCENTED BY ENGRAVED GAME SCENES ON THE SIDE PLATES. OVER 36 DIFFERENT CALIBERS CAN BE HAD. Incorporating innovations that raise the standards for quality and performance, the Blaser rifles mark the beginning of a revolution in bolt-action design. In fact, these rifles represent the first truly new concept in bolt-action rifle design since the bolt-action idea was first introduced. Foremost among its breakthrough features is its fast, smooth, straight pull bolt movement. Unlike conventional bolt actions, you operate the Blaser action by simply pulling the bolt to the rear and pushing it forward, with no lifting. Its faster, smoother and less likely to affect your aim for the next shot. Less obvious but equally remarkable is the Blaser's Radial Locking System (see details below). It's built around a radial bolt that expands 360? to make full, rigid contact right inside the barrel for a solid lock-up. Also contributing to the Blaser's performance are its patented sear-free trigger mechanism and completely free-floated barrel. Altogether, these design innovations result in a level of accuracy that no conventional bolt-action rifle can match. Dedicated to any single caliber, the Blaser R93 would rank among the best bolt-action rifles in the world. But the Blaser R93 rifles were engineered to allow for barrel and caliber interchangeability. Quick take-down and a replacement barrel and bolt head are all that's needed to provide maximum versatility in the Blaser R93. The technologically advanced Blaser Radial Locking System gives you five distinct benefits: 1) The bolt locks directly into the barrel, not into a receiver, so you get a full-length barrel in a rifle that's 4"" shorter overall, 2) The frame receives minimum stress because the bolt locks directly into the barrel, making the Blaser lighter and easier to handle, 3) Radial lockup means that stress is distributed through a full 360? of contact, for greater system strength and durability, 4) Head space is precisely controlled because the bolt head locks directly into the barrel, and 5) The bolt head is free-floating, so it self-trues into a concentric position in the bore, relieving stress and assuring a higher degree of accuracy. There is no other rifle system with the versatility or pure shooting ability of the R93. Seventeen different standard and magnum calibers, including the new .300 Ultra Mag., ensure that there's a perfect choice for any hunting challenge. Due to its revolutionary straight-pull bolt and radial lock-up, the bolt mates directly to the barrel with full 360? locking contact for superior strength and rigidity. Because the R93's bolt locks directly into the barrel, the R93's frame receives minimum stress which allows the rifle to be both lighter and shorter, so it's easy to carry and quicker handling. The trigger is sear-free, and designed so the ""creep"" is eliminated. Let-off is crisp and precise. Scope mounts directly to the barrel, so that rifles can be easily broken down and reassembled without changing point-of-impact. Barrels are cold hammer forged and are machined to accept detachable scope mounts. They are free-floated, so that atmospheric changes won't affect your point-of-aim. The R93's straight-pull bolt is an engineering marvel and includes a safety which actually cocks/decocks the firing mechanism. There's even a rubber bumper built into the magazine well to protect bullet tips from recoil damage. The list is endless."

I would say it is in very good condition with nice glossy bluing and nice wood. The 1300 will also come with a collection of 20ga shells which consists of the following:

94 Shells of Winchester Super-x 2.75"" 3/4 oz. Slugs (cut one open to explain to a friend how rifled slugs work)
75 Shells pf Winchester AA Super Sport Sporting clays 2.75"" 7/8 oz. 7 1/2 Shot. 
30 Shells of Federal Premium Vital Shock 2.75"" #3 buckshot (20 pellets per shell)
5 Shells of Federal Premium Personal Defense 2.75"" #4 buckshot (24 pellets per shell)
The vital shock and personal defense lines being identical in terms of features (copper plated buckshot with a buffer)

Looking to get $440 for the 20ga package.

Bluing was refinished prior to our acquisition, markings remain crystal clear, all wood & hardware are original, & the Lyman case sight is flawless.  The Model 1895 was the first Winchester rifle to feature a box magazine located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design.  The 1895 was also the last of the lever action rifles to be designed by John Browning.  The model 1895 in .405 W.C.F. is most commonly associated with former President Theodore Roosevelt, who praised the model in his book African Game Trails, famously referring to it as his ""medicine gun"" for lions."

CZ 03050 CZ 527 Carbine Bolt 7.62x39mm 18.5"" Walnut Blue

The Carbine is an intermediate range 'brush gun.' This handy rifle features
open sights, a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds!
It's the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is
chambered for the popular 7.62x39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger
shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as
deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527
Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.
The barrel of the 7.62x39 has a .311 bore, contributing to its excellent
accuracy with inexpensive surplus ammo.

The combination of brass/stainless/wood on this rifle is gorgeous.  

I got this for my daughter for cowboy action shooting but the pull is just too long on it for her to be comfortable (she is very petite) and I would hate to cut the stock on such a gorgeous gun so it has to go.  This has a couple hundred rounds on it and shoots great.  The action is pretty smooth and other than a few light scratches from handling it is in great shape.
