They can also be opened with handcuff or security keys, but I don't have any keys to go with. They are set up for Remington 870's, 700's, and AR's, but you can easily pad and adjust them to fit any gun.

I bought this to try one method of tactical gear carry. It actually worked well, but I still decided to go another route. It’s in excellent (mint, really) condition, and is clean. 

Comfortable, and breathes in hot weather (yeah, you will still sweat, but you probably would anyway in hot weather). You can attach a lot of pouches and other gear to this. Adjustable. I loosened the shoulder straps and was able to get a nice fit, even though this is a regular, and I’m definitely larger than that.

Most of them are Pro-gard, although there are a couple of other manufacturers as well. These gunracks are electric, you can hide a switch anywhere you want and when you flip it they unlock. They can also be opened with handcuff or security keys, but I don't have any keys to go with. They are set up for Remington 870's, 700's, and AR's, but you can easily pad and adjust them to fit any gun. 
If you have ever tried to find a locking gun rack you know they are not easily available, these were the best answer I could find, but I have way too many of them. They're $350-$600 new.

The bike has a NADA value of 3800. I am looking to make a quick cash sale Hopefully in the next 2 days. The only reason I am willing to sell it for so little is because I found a rifle I would like to buy ands I don't want to miss out on it. I know if I could get a lot more for this bike if I wasn't in such a rush to buy the rifle. Ok a little about the bike it is a twin cylinder 1400 shaft driven bike the tires are brand new. It has side bags and a windshield. The bike sat outside under a cover for a little while and it started to get surface rust on some of the chrome. I cleaned a spot on it and it looks like new. It will take a little cleaning to look new again but it still looks great. I started it up and road it around the block a few times. The battery needed to be charged. I don't know how long the battery will last but it starts it up now. this bike is very comfortable and very fast. I will sell it for 2000 or make offer. I was asking 2800 for it but I figured if I want to sell fast I have to lower it. I would also consider a trade plus a little cash for any type of tactical firearms. I will work a great deal if it can be done in the next week or so. After Sept 22nd I wont be selling it if it doesn't sell. But make offers I may just take it but please don't offer 1000 Its worth a lot more than that 240-538-259one

 THE MILITARY KNOWS OF THIS WEAPON, CAN REACH OUT 300 YARDS
 Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 10 and you will not be disappointed.

Something I've not mentioned? Send me an email, worst I can say is ""No thanks!"".

 This is an Iver Johnson TP-22, an 11 ounce alloy framed copy of the tiny Walther TPH that is drop safe. Safety blocks both ends of the firing pin when activated and automatically disconnects when the trigger is pulled . . . extremely well designed. Strips down for cleaning very easily, just like a Walther or Makarov. 7+1 capacity.  Reliable and accurate. Makes a GREAT plinker for camping trips, and is excellent for recoil shy individuals with small hands. Thinner than a Beretta and more reliable than a Taurus. External hammer and true DA with doublestrike capability. 

 Pistol has a low round count and minor pocket wear to finish in the usual spots. Comes with only the one magazine, no box or holster. I will include 400 rounds of CCI Mini-Mags with the pistol, which is considered the best ammo to run in subcompact 22 pistols, although this one runs Federal bulk pack flawlessly.

 Will not ship. Need to meet reasonably close to Denver.  I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone for any reason, or to withdraw this item at any time.  No thugs or bad guys.  All pertinent laws apply.

Made to shoot fast, Benelli SuperSport shotguns are the ultimate choice for sporting clays. True “speed guns,” SuperSport shotguns utilize the ComforTech® recoil-dampening system for fast recovery. Reducing both recoil and muzzle climb, SuperSport shotguns help trap shooters get that critical second shot up to 69% faster than other comparable shotguns! Pair this quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that helps mimimize muzzle climb even more, and it’s doubly fast. Add in the special ComforTech gel recoil pad and comb insert, felt recoil is reduced by up to 48% over comparable shotguns. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport's superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns are almost like having an unfair advantage you will love at the range. comes with  5 factory chokes and factory case

This is more of a feeler ad to see what offers I might be interested in. I have a 1999 Honda CR250r that I am interested in selling/trading. I'm mainly looking to get rid of it because I have no way of transporting the bike any longer. The bike has sat in my garage for over a year and I feel that it is time for it to go to someone else who can actually enjoy it. The bike is bone stock with the exception of the handle bars being replaced a while back. 

PROS: 
Mechanically sound
Runs great
Absolutely no issues with the bike
Comes with both Rear Paddle & nobby tires
Comes with Jack stand 
Comes with Triangle bike stand
Comes with 2 gas cans. One has gas in it.

CONS: 
Plastic is slightly rough on one side.
Fatty pipe has a small dent, but does not affect the bike in any way.
I no longer have the title for the bike. I went to register the title into my name with the DMV and because the bike was previously registered in another state, they required me to take the bike down to the DMV to have them inspect the VIN. Because I have had no way to transport the bike, I was unable to comnplete this and they are still holding the title at this time."

This gun functions perfectly and feels amazing in your hand.  Unfortunately, I find that I don't like a striker fired trigger.  Too used to my Berettas, I guess.  The trigger assembly has been to the smith for a good polish that has smoothed it out but still not to my liking.

The guitar has a Fender brand white pearl pickguard and a Fender tweed 2-point tactical sling (kidding...). I purchased online last year from Sweetwater, so I am the original and only owner; this means that the guitar is in such great shape that you could not tell the difference between it and a NIB one hanging from your Guitar Center's wall. This of course is a USA-made guitar in California and is of very high quality. The action is low, the pickguard still has that factory sheen, and it has that Tele tone that would be expected of such an instrument. It is in pristine condition and has only been gently played in a home setting; the guitar has been well taken care of, and it lives in its SKB hardcase 95% of the time. I am selling to fund the purchase of a Sage EBR chassis, so I cannot take any trades, unless of course it happens to be an EBR chassis. I hate to see this fine instrument go, but I just do not play it enough to justify it's value, so I would rather it go to an owner that would play it and appreciate it's quality. It will come with the strap, hard case, several various extra strings, all original allen wrenches for adjusting the action and such, and a yellow Fender cleaning cloth.

ABOUT THE GUN:
The piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Since I do not need four rails, and prefer the standard hand guard, I decided to swap it out. 

This is in good shape, with just a few minor scuffs and some residual screw locking goop still on it. I did not try to make it pristine. 

All the screws are there, and I have the instruction sheet. 

This is going for around $110 at places like MidWay. I figure $50 is a really good deal for something that is as functional as a new one. 

Should work on most AK-47/74 style rifles, but I am not an expert, so you will have to determine if it is suitable for your rifle. 

I would much prefer a local, face-to-face in the Raleigh area. If you want it shipped, the added shipping charges will probably make this not particularly attractive vs. ordering a new one. Just a thought..."
