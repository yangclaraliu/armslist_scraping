All Stainless and much more beautiful than pictures can show!
I’ve owned this beautiful gun since early 2008. I bought it from a fellow Sig forum member who stated that it only had 300 rounds through it. Therefore, I’d say it has somewhere around 1,500–2,000 through it now.
This gun has been, by far, the most accurate gun I’ve ever shot.

Now, with that being said, I want to disclose that last winter when I took it out to shoot for the 1st. time in almost 2 years, I discovered that I had somehow stripped the hole that held the screw that held the compensator in place. So, I ordered a new compensator($200) with the front sight installed from Sig about a month ago. I installed it and tested it out a week ago.

Continuing on:
First, the original box and papers from the factory are included.

It comes with 10 magazines.
7 of them are 229 original Sport magazines(10 rounds).
3 of them are 229 factory 12 round magazines(shiny) with special made 229 Sport bases (I prefer these!)

Once again:
The price is $1,250. (Although I may consider a small trade)

Thanks for your interest."

I have a Gen 3 Glock 23 modified for concealed carry. It conceals and carries the same as a Glock 27. The grip was ""chopped"" to take Glock 27 Magazines. This is a common practice and it is well documented online. This allows easily concealed IWB carry. The longer barrel and sight radius are great when shooting. Adding velocity and accuracy without taking away from the concealment. I carry a longer Glock 23 magazine as a spare giving me 22 potent .40 s&w rounds.

With a grip extension it mimics a stock Glock 23 for range and bed stand use. The pistol also has a rail for accessories such as lights and lasers. This is not available on the short barreled Glocks.

The gun has a low round count. Around 100 rounds.

Can ship, buyer pays shipping charges

Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments, from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. ceased."

Savage 64 Target rifle. Features a heavy bull barrel and factory scope mounting provisions. I can add a bushnell 3-9x scope for additional cost. 

This thing is a tack driver. Very accurate. It will shoot much tighter groups than a stock 10/22. Replicating the accuracy of this thing with a Ruger would cost $500 in add ons.

Around 150 rounds fired. All target grade Federal. Cleaned after range trips.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

 The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

 With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

For sale is this Bersa BP9CC in Duotone. This is a great carry gun, chambered in 9mm. Holds 8 + 1 and is less than an 1"" wide. It comes with the original box and paperwork,  slide locking key, 4 Bersa 8 round magazines (which are really hard to find and aren't cheap). It also comes with a Foxx IWB holster for right draw. I also kept a Hogue HANDALL Jr. Grip Sleeve on the gun for extra grab.

If you don't know much about Bersa these guns are great quality. Read the article here, http://www.gundigest.com/concealed-carry-news/handguns-todays-top-carry-options. 

Asking a firm $425. Not looking to trade unless it was for a post recall XDs 9mm. I'd add money for that.

The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, the Eagle has a classic scalloped slide with front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight and STI adjustable rear sight. The Eagle comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safety.

Serial number is 186xxx, should be about 2000 - 2005ish.
Paid 1500 for the rifle alone, add in the extra mags, bipod&stud, two stocks, mag latch, springs and you can see Im easily losing more than a few bucks.

Only 400-500 rounds through it.

It now wears the M14 Big Red Birch (last photo) with all the metal from Fred’s. Condition category as stated by Fred “excellent-plus with excellent or better buttplate”; thats the best condition out of the issued stocks. I havnt weighed it but its certainly heavier than the synthetic/fiberglass, makes a great bench rifle. And it fits the receiver nice and tight much better than the fiberglass. Comes with issued/used extra upper handguard(I was going to have it dipped to match the camo or in woodgrain but never did).

The black fiberglass stock had a hairline crack when I bought it which is why I purchased the other stocks. Ive been told one can fix it easily enough and that the fiberglass GI stock is preferred to the commercial Mossy Oak, I dunno-you decide, I like the birch.

It has a Sadlak Tactical magazine latch and has Tubb’s Chrome Silicon springs(hammer spring isn’t installed yet but included). Original spring is included as is the original mag release.

Comes with 10rd and 20rd SA mags and two 20rd kits by Checkmate Ind.
Has a 'Harris Bipod' adapter stud made to fit M14 stocks and a Caldwell 6”-9” bipod.
I'll also throw in a foam lined, hard plastic rifle case for it too!

I never intended to sell this rifle but due to unfortunate circumstances Ive decided to sell it. Get it before I change my mind. Meet in Sac.
No trades - cash only. Thanks."

1895-1911 W. Richards 12 Gauge SxS Underlever Shotgun. You don't see many of these underlevers around. It has a 28.25"" Cast Steel Barrel (un-cut), Functioning side hammers and working double triggers. Walnut stock is in good shape.  No scroll work on wood or metal. Has incorrect bolt for breech pivot pin. Left firing Pin needs replaced to make mechanically functional. Not recommended for shooting, and not to be confused with Wesley or William Richards shotguns.

1966 Rohm RG10 .22short revolver, blued w/white plastic grips, 2.5"" barrel – Excellent+ condition w/original box and 13 rounds of ammo. Box of ammo are likely as old as the gun. Great trainer or novelty piece.

1972 Remington Speedmaster 552 .22 (S,L,LR) tube fed semi-auto, 23.5"" barrel - Excellent working and physical condition. Bluing is strong with some scratches mainly on the receiver. Stock has a few minor dings as might be expected, but looks very good. I've taken this one down and did a thorough cleaning. It is in great shape with a bright shiny bore.

1975 Winchester Model 94 30-30, blued w/wood stock, 20"" barrel – Excellent working and Physical condition. Has some minor pitting, especially on one side of receiver, due to setting for many years. The rust and finish have been removed from the left side of the receiver where most of the pitting is located. Because of the difficulty in bluing this model, it will either need to be sent out for special processing, or one could go the paint route. Brownell's has a product called Paint & Bake that is said to look very nice and is very durable. It was owned by a very elderly man who has passed away. Considering he was up in his years when he bought it new, I would guess it did not get much use. The action and condition also indicate very little use.

1976 Glenfield Model 60 .22LR, tube fed semi-auto – Very good condition with the stock having some minor scratches and thinning of the finish in a couple places. Checkering is in great shape. Also has a Bushnell 4x Sportview 22 scope. Overall a good looking rifle. If the stock were just a little better, I'd grade it excellent.

2012 Bersa Thunder .380 Duo-Tone, DA/SA, 3.5” barrel – LNIB w/extra 9rnd mag, soft case, & holster. Only 3 shots ever fired. Can include some ammo for a good deal. Great CC package. Cash sale of this handgun requires a carry permit or proof of handgun ownership.

This is a retro/classic A2 style riflle.
You can find the specs here:http://www.dpmsinc.com/CLASSIC-16_ep_110-1.html
With the rifle comes the following.900 rounds of .223 Polyformance rounds
Several 30 round magazines. 
A hard case.
A paracord sling. 
This is a ready to shoot package.
A perfect gift with the holidays coming up. 
The rifle only has about 200 rounds through it. Which is not even close to being broken in. 
I was going to put a collapsible stock on it but I thought I would offer it up for sale before that in case someone likes the fixed A2 stock.
1100 obo for everything. Or if someone just wants the rifle $800. 
The only trades I'm looking for is a nice Henry Golden Boy 22lr + cash. A nice 22lr revolver + cash or a nice AR pistol that I can turn into a sbr. 
But cash is king in this world so.....
Any questions or trade requests just ask.

It is a Right Hand belt holster that is actually for a 6 inch barrelled J-frame. This gun works 100% in D.A. mode, but I almost always target shoot in S.A. mode, so away it goes.

Selling a DeSantis Flight Deck Officer holster (RH black leather) for the Heckler & Koch USP Compact (will also fit the P2000 / k). Used just a few times, I'm selling it because I'm not a fan of thumb breaks. Has a slight scratch on the exterior of the holster near the thumb break, but otherwise it's like new. Three slot pancake style, and it's very comfortable and well made. This is a thick leather holster and isn't thin like the Speed Scabbard series. Comes with the bag and literature. $50, to include shipping. Pistol is obviously not included.
