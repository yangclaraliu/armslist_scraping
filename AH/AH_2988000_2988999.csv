Actually a better gun than the old 1887 Remington that it was cloned from, this Norinco / Century Arms Coach gun is all blue steel, very sturdy, with American Walnut stock and forend. We have sold China made Shotguns, Jin An and Norinco, now for over 20 years with excellent service experience, and we commend our Chinese friends on their expertise and workmanship on firearms. We refrain, however, from complimenting their packaging, normally any given one of these shotguns will have some sort of minor cosmetic flaw like the small dimple visible in the photo of the left side of the buttstock near the comb. These factors explain why this shotgun is $300 range, and its Italian competitors twice that much. These fine little shotguns weigh in at a healthy 8 pounds or so. Barrels are 20 inch blue steel, 3 inch chambered so they will accept any shells from our 1 3/4 inch Aguila Mini Buckshot to standard 2 3/4 inch shells, and all the way to 3 inch Magnum. Barrel muzzles gauge at .730 wide open cylinder on the right barrel, and .725 vicinity skeet or improved on the left, so light recoiling steel shot loads will work just fine; a person can even duck hunt with one of these if he is so of mind. Buttstock length of pull including their 3/8 inch thick rubber recoil pad is the standard 14 inches. While these are immensely popular in cowboy action shooting circles, they are also a fearsome weapon in their own right, always have been. In a current market climate where 8-shot Mossbergs are inflating to the $500 range, these are not only an excellent value, they are not only respectable competitors since the first shot, after all, is the most important in any scenario. These are also downright attractive. We're offering the one in the photo or one of its identical mates each for only	 $ 289.00.

The 1887 Remington Coach Gun was the most feared shotgun in its century. To this day, no weapon has a more calming, better petrifying, effect than a short barreled double. Chamber that device in .410 gauge, though, and it gets considerably tamer. Here is one of our all time favorites, successor to the Stoeger Arms coach guns of the 1970s, and possibly fatal competitor to the pricey Italian made Cimarrons. This is not an Italian Shotgun; it is manufactured in the world’s most populous nation by Jin Xing Machine Works. This Centurion Coach Gun model 2028 double barrel shotgun is imported by Century International Arms in Vermont. We’ve always called it a Norinco, and that is what was stamped on the first specimens we got 25 years ago. This is a Remington-type traditional Rabbit Ear or double hammer side-by-side, 3 inch chamber, 20 inch .412 Modified and .416 Imp. Cyl. tubes. It is, of course, brand new in its original rice-paper box, complete with instruction manual. These are well fitted shotguns with strong actions. Buttstock and forend appear to be light, blondish American Walnut. Factory specs are 35.75 inches OAL, 20 inch barrels, and 6.5 pounds empty. Loaded with 3 pellet buckshot, it is quite formidable. Own this fine shotgun, the one in the photo or one of its identical mates, for only $ 369.00

This is a beautiful 30-30 in great condition. Manufactured in 1999, it has a 20"" barrel with a shiny bore and strong rifling. It does have a few smudges from use but no major dings.  The stock is 95%. I have been told and have read that the Marlin rifles made in Connecticut like this one are better quality then the Marlin rifles now being made in New York. (Known as “Remlins”)  The “JM” proof mark is on the barrel.  I have never owned/shot another 30-30, so, I can’t attest to that.  Please do your homework BEFORE you school me about the “new” blued Marlin 336 you can buy below $500. Visit a few Marlin Forums and learn like I did. I hesitate to call this one rare, but, you will find only a few for sale anywhere in the US. (There are plenty of new ones to choose from; go get one if the quality doesn’t matter to you) The scope is a cheap Tasco Silver Antler 3X9 40WAST that I mounted cause it looks good with it and the scope does OK for my old eyes. It is mounted with Leupold base and rings I paid $45 for.  Finally, I will throw in 40 rounds of Remington Core-LOKT 170GR and 40 rounds of Federal 150GR soft points. I have moved on to a higher capacity .308 for Hog Hunting, which is the application I bought it for. Since I am selling my only 30-30, this is a package deal and everything must go. I will be happy to sell you the rifle only, but, the price will not change. I will meet you anywhere within 30 miles of Ohio Stadium only. I paid $800 for the rifle and put a handful of rounds. I bought it used from a friend out west.  The ammo, mounts and scope were almost $200.  I will part with it for $850 or best offer over $800. My son’s son will own it before I sell it for less than $800.  I need the cash for another project, so, NO TRADES of any kind. Look for it elsewhere, then come see if I still have it.

""Hard Fitting"" means the upper lug and lower lugs of the barrel are hand fitted so tightly to the slide and slide stop that when in battery, the gun locks up with zero--and I do mean, ZERO--movement between the frame, slide and barrel. It's like a single block of steel. This is one of the hallmarks of a Les Baer 1911.

Baer is also the only manufacturer to offer an accuracy guarantee. His standard guns are guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards using standard (not target) ammo.

This model, the Monolith, is less common than other Baer models. This particular Monolith is even more special since it is a Carbon Steel gun (Carbon Steel is much harder than stainless, so it can be fitted tighter, stay tighter longer and is more durable than stainless) which has been finished with Industrial Hard Chrome.

Industrial Hard Chrome is not like decorative chrome (mufflers, bumpers, etc.) because it is much, much harder. Industrial Hard Chrome is to used to coat tools such as bits and cutters that need to withstand much more use and abuse than normal tools. The finish is impervious to all chemicals and so durable that even after tens of thousands of rounds the finish still looks like new. The added cost of this finish vs. standard bluing is $350.

Further, this particular Monolith has the Front Cocking Serrations omitted and a single side safety only. This Monolith was a custom order. If someone were to order a Monolith like this one it would currently take Baer 14 months+ to deliver the gun.

I have exactly 300 rounds through the gun. Since Baer recommends a 500 round break in, this guns isn't even broken in yet. The gun is less than a year old. Comes with the original Baer cardboard box, Bear Certificate of Authenticity, two magazines, bushing wrench (you'll need it) and a nylon gun case.

I also have a gorgeous set of Stag grips that I can add for an extra $75.

The original cost of this gun was $2,500. 

I would also consider trades for equal value or trades for lesser value, plus cash.

Items I'm interested in: DSA FAL, Arsenal SAM7 (milled receiver), Bulgarian/Chinese Milled AKs, Springfield SOCOM. If you have something else, just ask, worst I can do is say no.

From the former Soviet Union comes this excellent descendant of Commander Kalashnikov’s invention. This is the Russian Saiga, named after one of their principal game antelope, because we surely don’t want to shoot any of Saint Nicholas’s reindeer. Manufacturer is Izmash Arms Factory of Izhevsk, Russia. Construction is entirely steel parts with black polymer buttstock and forend. Importer on the photo specimen and its mates is RWC Group, Tullytown, PA, one of a dozen or so in a succession of importers. Type, of course, is Kalashnikov action gas operated semi-automatic centerfire rifle. Model is simply Saiga, but this variant, chambered in 7.62x39 Each Saiga Rifle comes with a 10 round detachable magazine, using AK magazines will require some modification to the trunnion area. Barrel length is 16.3 inches; and overall length is a compact 37.3 inches. Weight empty is a solid 7.93 pounds, so these are exceptionally light recoiling rifles. Sights are conventional windage and elevation adjustable, and stock and forend are durable black synthetic, equipped with integral sling swivel studs. Bore, chamber, and gas tube interior are all chrome lined for maximum durability. These fine rifles were designed for steel case ammunition; they’re every bit as tough as the Ruger Mini 30. Replacement pricing for the Mini 30 is upwards of $800 apiece in our area. We’re offering the lighter, rugged Saiga in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 539.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, Chicago, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, or any other jurisdiction where Kalashnikov Action Firearms are restricted to law enforcement only. ProMag is in production on 30 shot magazines for these rifles.

Here is the original M-16 trainer introduced during the Reagan Era, and wildly popular during the Bush Sr / Clinton Ban Years. This M-1600 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Sights are correct aperture rear and post front with authentic carry handle and gas housing replicas. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting AR-15 type housing. Extra 10, 15, and even 25 shot magazines are in production, and we stock them when we can get them. Forend and buttstock are classic Colt SP-1 Vietnam Era styling black ebony stained hardwood with removable vertical pistol grip. The forend configuration allows barrel exposure for better heat dissipation. Shoppers note that the pistol grip installs easily with furnished bolt, same way with the sling. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is blued steel as well. Weight empty is a well balanced 6 1/2 pounds. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition. This is a good little rifle, but it is NOT a garbage-mouthed Ruger 10/22. Own the rifle in the photo or one of its identical mates for only $ 199.00. Not transferable to civilians in Chicago or New York City.

Here is the original AK-47 trainer introduced during the Reagan Era, and wildly popular during the Bush Sr / Clinton Ban Years. This AK-22 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Action is not at all Kalashnikov, so this rifle is not proscripted by anti-AK State and Local laws. Sights are correct elevation adjustable square notch rear and hooded blade front with authentic pistol grip and faux gas tube assembly. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting short curved AK type housing. Forend and buttstock are classic dark stained AK Vietnam Era styling. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is anodized alloy. Weight empty is a well balanced 7 pounds. Sling is 1 1/2 inch black military style, and it attaches easily to the permanent swivels. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition. This is a good little rifle, but it is NOT a garbage-mouthed Ruger 10/22. Own the rifle in the photo or one of its identical mates for only $ 199.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Chicago Cook County IL. This rifle is not a true Kalashnikov action, of course.

Here is the immediate ancestor to the current production Mossberg 590 A1, the blue and anodized receiver 590. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Original sku was Mossberg number 50667, and that is what its box label reads. We have subbed, however, an ATS, Advanced Technologies full length combat type buttstock with pistol grip so that this Mossberg is closer to the 50645 factory variant. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, and internal parts with lightweight alloy receiver and polymer trigger group housing. Capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, or 7 + 1 on 3 inch magnums. Barrel is 20 inch Police Cylinder with perforated Trench Gun type heat shield. Front sight is Hex based solid brass, threaded into place. Forend is traditional serrated Corncob configuration polymer. Buttstock is manufactured by ATI, DuPont® Extreme Temperature Glass Reinforced Polymer with stippled pebble surface pistol grip, and measures for a 14 inch length of pull including the 1 inch super absorbent scorpion recoil pad. Overall length is 41 inches. Metal is matte blue steel on the barrel, magazine tube, and double steel slide arms, with black matte anodized finish to the lightweight alloy receiver. Safety, as the photos show, is traditional Mossberg top tang, polymer construction and user-friendly for southpaws. This shotgun is also equipped with a bayonet lug that will accept an M8A1, M16 / M4 Bayonet or similarly equipped accessories. Weight empty is 7.2 pounds. Magazine capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, and 7+1 on 3 inch shells. It and its mates are brand new shotguns, shipped as cruiser grip Persuader type. We changed their stocks to ATS, and had to rebox them. The original box label is taped to the instruction manual envelope. Current pricing on the 590 is upwards of $700 apiece in our area, and they’re scarce. We’re offering this 590 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 439.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of New York, or any jurisdiction where pump shotguns with 8 round magazine capacity are restricted to Law Enforcement Only. Add $19.00 for a factory Pistol Grip kit, but note that pistol grip kit inclusion requires a consumer age of 21, and residence in the jurisdiction where the consumer receives the shotgun.

For many years, when young people grew up wanting to hunt, the Marlin 336 overshadowed its arch competitor 1894 Winchester as the most popular firearm in our inventory. Due to electronic devices and a leisure culture that have taken the place of a work and hunting ethic, this rifle’s marketability has suffered. We can only hope that our growing female hunting and cowgirl operatives take up some of the slack. Photo shows the first specimen we received of the Marlin 336Y Compact Lever Action Rifle. Manufacturer is nominally Marlin Firearms of North Haven, CT, and the barrel is so marked. Actual production, however, is at the Remington plant in Ilion, New York. Type is lever action repeating rifle. Construction is entirely steel, weather resistant matte blue finish. Buttstock and forend are laminate construction hardwood, also weather resistant and incredibly strong. Pistol grip area and forend have machine cut checkering that is both attractive and ergonomic. Barrel is 16 1/4 inch, 1:10 Micro-Groove twelve groove rifling, hooded screw-on steel front sight with classic step-elevator adjustable buckhorn folding rear sight. Forend to barrel band is equipped with a QD swivel stud, and so is the buttstock. Receiver is flat topped blue steel, 4 position drilled to accept Weaver 63B type bases, 336 and 1894 type see-through scope rings, or best, Leupold steel 49987 one piece Redfield JR type base. Marlin anodized alloy hammer spur is included for mounting the scope low to the receiver. Caliber, of course, is .30-30 Winchester, and the short trapper length magazine holds 5 rounds, 5+1 total capacity. Trigger is .275 smooth faced blue steel, and the photo specimen gauged at a stiff but safe 8 pounds with minimal creep. A competent gunsmith can smooth it and get it down to half that, perhaps even less. We, however, are neither competent nor gunsmiths. Length of pull from the trigger face to the end of the buttstock is 12 3/4 inches, and overall length is 34 inches. Weight empty is 6 pounds 11 ounces, with the center of gravity at the lever bolt. Hammer is 3 position serrated spur type, with half cock position. All Marlin levers had lever safeties since their invention, the little protruding tab directly behind the receiver; all Marlin levers manufactured since 1983, like this one, have a cross bolt safety as well. This is a classic little rifle.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges Here is a very powerful weapon, one that the operator should keep well away from his face. Not a comfortable shooting weapon, unless someone is doing varmint control with Super Light 2 3/4 inch shells, but a powerful one. For a good balance between firepower and felt recoil, a 3 inch Magnum load with 1 1/4 oz. BB Steel Shot delivers 90 Pellets at 1400 feet per second from the muzzle and that figures the rough equivalent of 2 boxes of .17 Mach II bullets all in one shot. Consumers must be at least 21 years of age to own one of these, any shotgun with a pistol grip has Federal Status as a hand gun for age requirement purposes. This is Mossberg's JIC series Desert Sandstorm Cruiser, the Persuader 12 gauge pistol grip variant of the tried-and-true Model 500 slide action with tang safety, easily employed by Left Handed Shooters. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but collectors, departments, and dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. JIC, as one suspects, stands for Just In Case. The Persuaders are virtual duplicates of the proven Mossberg military 500 and 590 models. Factory specs are: double slide bar pump shotgun; 12 gauge 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells; 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore Barrel; Desert Sandstorm special purpose dip type factory camo finish, with matching high impact desert polymer forend and pistol grip; weight 5 3/4 pounds empty; capacity 5 + 1 with 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 + 1 with 3 inch magnums; overall length 28 3/4 inches. This specimen is what we call a factory demo, a showpiece for Mossberg’s sales team that has been in Mossberg Corporate custody until we got it. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 JIC Cruiser comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. It does not come with any extras besides the added heat shield. We have even outfitted it with a matching trench type heat shield. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. In its tubed form, replacement pricing is $540 on mossberg com. We’re offering the Mossberg shotgun in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only$ 289.00. Buyers must be at least 21 Years of Age; the Cruiser grip gives this shotgun Other Weapon status on the 4473 form. Local pickup by a civilian non dealer has to be a Tennessee Resident. Dealers in one state cannot transfer over-the-counter to a resident of another state on cruiser grip shotguns.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a very attractive specimen of Mossberg’s All Purpose 12 gauge 500 series. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 All Purpose. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with weather resistant, recoil absorbing black synthetic stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel 28 inch Ventilated Rib. The Barrel is marked Modified, probably under the influence of waterfowl pressure. Muzzle diameter, however, is actually a .715 vicinity Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. This is a fixed choke barrel, it will not accept choke tubes. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is upwards of $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only $ 199.00.

I sent it to Springfield to get the recall work done on it months and months ago and just received it back recently.  I decided while waiting to get this gun back that I would prefer a 9mm subcompact so I purchased a Glock 26.  I don't need both of these subcompact handguns as I have a Sig Sauer P250 also in the Subcompact size.  However, I do not NEED to sell it quickly so my price is about as low as I can go on this firearm.  I do have other handguns that I am also either selling currently or would be willing to sell if the right person is interested.  The details of this handgun and the extras that come with it are listed below:

1) One Springfield Armory XDS handgun in .45 ACP caliber.  Color is all black.
2) Recall work has been performed and I tested it once it was returned to me and it is just as smooth as it was the day I bought it.  Since Springfield had it tied up in the recall backlog for the majority of the time I have owned it, it has less than 50 rds through it!  
3) Original box/case
4) Springfield dual mag holder
5) Springfield handgun lock
6) FOUR (4) standard 5 round mags and ONE (1) extended 7 round mag
7) One Pearce Grip Extension (installed as new floor plate on one of the 5 rd mags).
8) Like New IWB Versacarry holster.  See Versacarry.com for more info on this fantastic holster).  This holster was never used but removed from original packaging.  (I paid $30.86)
9) NEW ""Leather by Don"" custom made Shoot Through Premium Leather Pocket Holster (I paid $42.95).   I ordered this holster from Don directly and he made it custom specifically for this XDS .45 ACP (so this is NOT a holster that fits other gun models as well).

ASKING PRICE FOR HANDGUN AND ITEMS #1-7 = $475.00
ASKING PRICE FOR HANDGUN AND ITEMS #1-8 = $495.00
ASKING PRICE FOR HANDGUN AND ITEMS #1-9 = $525.00

Again, this handgun is LNIB with less than 50 rounds total through it.  It has been cleaned meticulously and if I told you it was brand new, I doubt you could tell the difference.  In addition, I have also kept the original sales receipts for all the items listed as well as the paperwork returned when I received the gun back from the recall.

I am asking a VERY FAIR price as I paid exactly $635.63 for ALL of the above.  The handgun, case, lock, paperwork, etc (Items # 1-7) costs me $561.82 exactly.  If you add the $561.82 I paid for the handgun etc., the $30.86 for the Versacarry holster, and the $42.95 for the Shoot Through Pocket Holster...I have exactly $635.63 in this awesome handgun ""package""."

Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. If this shotgun didn’t have a heat shield, we have added a trench type black polymer heat shield for the barrel, that will be obvious from the photos. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Our photographer zooms close when he sees any detractions. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean.This 500 Special Purpose comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. We’ve sold Mossbergs now for 60 years, and Mossberg Demos for 10 years. Out of 1000 some odd demos, we have sent fewer than 20 back to the factory, and service was always prompt and excellent. Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only $ 239.00.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges This is not a comfortable shooting weapon, even if someone is doing varmint control with Super Light 2 3/4 inch shells, but a powerful one. For a good balance between firepower and felt recoil, a 3 inch Magnum load with 1 1/4 oz. BB Steel Shot delivers 90 Pellets at 1400 feet per second from the muzzle and that figures the rough equivalent of 2 boxes of .17 Mach II bullets all in one shot. Consumers must be at least 21 years of age to own one of these, any shotgun with a pistol grip has Federal Status as a hand gun for age requirement purposes. This is Mossberg's Cruiser Grip shotgun, the Persuader 12 gauge pistol grip variant of the tried-and-true Model 500 slide action with tang safety, easily employed by Left Handed Shooters. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. The Persuaders are virtual duplicates of the proven Mossberg military 500 and 590 models. Factory specs are: double slide bar pump shotgun; 12 gauge 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells; 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore Barrel; blue finish metal with black polymer trigger group housing, and with matching high impact black corncob type polymer forend and pistol grip; weight 5 3/4 pounds empty; capacity 5 + 1 with 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 + 1 with 3 inch magnums; overall length 28 3/4 inches. This specimen is what we call a factory demo, a showpiece for Mossberg’s sales team that has been in Mossberg Corporate custody until we got it. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 Cruiser has a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. We have even outfitted it with a matching trench type heat shield. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. We’re offering the Mossberg in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only$ 259.00. Buyers must be at least 21 Years of Age; the Cruiser grip gives this shotgun Other Weapon status on the 4473 form. Local pickup by a civilian non dealer has to be a Tennessee Resident. Dealers in one state cannot transfer over-the-counter to a resident of another state on cruiser grip shotguns.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a pristine specimen of Mossberg’s model 500 All Purpose 12 gauge with water resistant qualities. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 All Purpose. Factory sku is 56420 vicinity. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with weather resistant, recoil absorbing black synthetic stock and forend. Finish is weather resistant matte black steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered parkerized steel, 28 inch Ventilated Rib, with 16 ports for reduced felt recoil. Choke tube is marked as modified, but it measures .715 vicinity, something we call Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. Accu-choke threads on the 500s are the same as old style Winchester Win-Choke and old style Browning Invector. This barrel will accept any Accu-choke or either of those two. It will NOT accept an Accu-Mag, or a Browning Invector Plus, or a Rem-Choke, or the exhaust pipe of a 1940 Briggs & Stratton WMB Muffler. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean.This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is upwards of $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only $ 219.00. This shotgun comes with only one Accu-Choke tube, and no wrench. A quarter works well enough. Accu-chokes are two slot tubes, 4 slot Remington wrenches won’t work.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges.The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is an excellent specimen of their very traditional and very attractive model 500 All Purpose 12 gauge pump. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 All Purpose, factory sku is 50120. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with cut checkered semi gloss finish hardwood stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced gold plated trigger. Safety is top tang type. Chambering is 12 gauge; Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel, 28 inch Ventilated Rib, with 16 Ports for recoil reduction. Choke tube is marked as modified, but it measures .715 vicinity, something we call Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. Accu-choke threads on the 500s are the same as old style Winchester Win-Choke and old style Browning Invector. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch brown rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean.This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only $ 229.00. This shotgun comes with only one Accu-Choke tube, and no wrench. A quarter works well enough.

It was made in 1981 before they shortened the barrels. It has the 22 inch barrel and holds 18 rounds of .22 Long Rifle ammo. The magazine tube has the Brass Rod. Others had the steel rod that was prone to rusting. I put  a brand new Simmons 3/9/32 scope on it and it shoots great. Cycles all types of .22 ammo from high velocity to standard velocity as well as all brands. I stripped the stock and put hours of labor into a hand rubbed boiled Linseed Oil finish. It has the squirrel engravings on both sides of the butt stock and the maple leaf engravings on both sides of the forearm. I  installed sling studs on the butt stock and forearm for a sling or bi-pod. I'm retired and did this gun over for a fun project. The gun looks and shoots beautiful the only blemish is a few spots on the left side of the barrel that had started to rust, see photos.They were steel wooled with 2000 steel wool and oiled. The bluing is all original. The muzzle crown is excellent as is the bore. This gun has the Marlin Micro groove rifling which is 16 lands instead of the standard 8 deep cut lands. The 16 lands are not cut as deep and the theory is accuracy is improved since the bullet is not as deformed by the deep cut lands and as a result is more stable and accurate. The gun had sat for years in a closet and had been fired very little when I acquired it. It's received many compliments and now it's time for me to find another project gun. I can only download 3 pictures to this site. I have over 20 pictures of the gun. Should you want to see more send me your email address and I'll forward them to you."

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives. 

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better. It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it.

It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is only slightly larger than the typical .25 automatic pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.

Construction and operation of the COP 357

The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 is unique in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

The weapon has appeared in numerous films, including Blade Runner, The Matrix Reloaded, and Bad Boys.

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

To answer most commonly asked questions. The gun was purchased by me from b&t January 2012. I have not kept track if rounds shot, easily 1500. Very shortly after purchasing it I installed a titanium firing pin, plunger and corresponding upgraded springs. Those items I am keeping. The stock firing pin plunger and corresponding springs have been 're installed, of which have seen very few rounds. I meticulously clean all my weapons, if it's not white glove clean it's not clean. I use CLP products. The night sights are meprolight and are 1 year old. The trigger kit is was installed about 6 months ago. It has never had a malfunction of any kind. everything it came with is included. Box papers lock etc.

I will not take less than 450 don't ask. I may trade but trades must be realilistic. No black powder, bows or wall hangers. 

I am a honest person and expect you to be the same. I will not sell to anyone under 21 weather your in the military or not. Yes it's Bullshit you can risk your life for our country but can't own a handgun. I love my country and truly appreciate your service. I'm a family man not a criminal. That being said there will be a legitimate bill of sale and if you don't have a carry permit (which you should) I'm probably not going to sell it to you.

(Why buy a new 1911 and then have to modify it was my thinking) 
Features include a forged receiver, a forged steel slide, a forged stainless steel barrel and a forged steel slide stop and Lowered and Flared Ejection Port. 
Front and rear slide serrations, make it easier to rack the slide 
The 3 dot Novak sights on it are awesome, and make lining up your aim a breeze. 
The Colt Upswept Beavertail Grip Safety with Palm Swell and enhanced cut under the trigger guard allow for a secure hold on the pistol. Ambidextrous Safety allows for either right or left handed user. The addition of a one piece, full length guide rod rounds out a pistol suited perfectly for the match grade shooting enthusiast or the personal defense user. It even has an adjustable trigger to set it as heavy or light as you like.
I know I am probably forgetting some of it nice features but you get it.

I have for sale an Egyptian Maadi-Misr AK-47 for sale.  This rifle was bought from a police auction and missing parts were added by myself with original Egyptian Maadi parts.  The only thing missing from this firearm is a firing pin retainer.  I have a brand new firing pin, but have not yet ordered the $3.00 retainer pin.  

The firearm looks to be in overall good condition (minus the chip in the stock).  It was my intent to sand the furnishings down and re-finish them this summer, but the boss (my fiancé) says it needs to go.  Apparently ""Do what you want"" means do NOT do what you want haha!

Anyway on a serious note, this is a firearm built by Maadi in Egypt.  The receiver was built on Russian machinery and is the closest to a Russian AK as you can get so I hear.  It was imported by C.A.I.  This is a post ban AK and has a thumbhole stock which is easily replaced.  I have found numerous sites that sell a variety of stocks for this model.  I would be happy to assist any potential buyer in finding parts if they would like.  I have been informed that these Egyptian Maadi rifles are VERY dependable firearms and are well sought after.  This particular model being the ""Misr"" is on the lower end of the collectibles due to the fact that some people say the finish wasn't up to ""collector standards"", but that doesn't mean this firearm won't live up to the dependability both Maadi (and AK's in general) are known for!

I also have an extra pistol grip and gas tube that I will throw in with the lot."

The Walther PPS (Police Pistol Slim) is a semi-automatic pistol made in Germany by Walther Sportwaffen. It was first shown in 2007 and is a slim polymer framed weapon of similar size to the Walther PPK. The 9mm version is to feature magazines of 6, 7, and 8 round lengths so the shooter can customize the grip to their hand size and concealment needs. 

It will feature a partially cocked striker system like the Walther P99 Quick Action model. This particular variant is called QuickSafe and the primary change from QA is that removing the pistol's backstrap will disable the gun for safe storage."
