This is a perfect mountain rifle, my Colorado elk gun for 9000-12,000 foot country. But my legs went out earlier this year and I won't be doing that kind of hunting again any time soon. MSRP new is $1400, so I guess $750 on this would be pretty fair. Has a Bushnell Elite 3-9x scope on top; $100 more if you want that. Those are really under-rated optics, in my opinion.

Only 3,542 Irwin Petersen M1 Carbines were produced, and all of the original guns were not accepted. Saginaw was awarded the contract to take over production and moved into the Irwin Petersen facility. They used the IP components to build guns that saw action. It has an Underwood barrel stamped UNDERWOOD 4-44 with the flaming bomb, as neither Irwin-Petersen nor Saginaw produced their own barrels. The gun has the correct adjustable rear sight and bayonet lug. Most importantly, it has a correct serial number, placing it squarely in the low end of the 1,762,520 in the 1,875,039 range that is correct for Saginaw's IP guns.

It's in great condition and only has maybe 75 rounds through it.  I purchased this gun for backpacking while I was deep in the woods (though I never got to take it - It's lived all of it's life in my safe or in my car.)  I have a CPL and since it is technically considered a 'Pistol', I was going to also use this a firearm as a locked and loaded gun while in my vehicle.  As you couldn't do this with an AK-47 rifle in my state.

This is an awesome gun.  It has a Tru-Glow red dot sight on it as well as an upgraded rail for mounting an optic as well as the original upper cover.  You can co-witness the iron sights at the same time underneath.  Also, it has a sling mount and a sling.

There is also a new product on the market that let's you put a BATFE approved shoulder stock/forearm grip so you can turn this into something that resembles a SBR, as there's a new version for AK's.  All without needing a tax stamp (check your local laws.)  

Comes with two steel magazines.

I have to sell it to get caught up on some bills.  Sorry no trades.

Good Guys only - I'll need a WA State License and a CPL or WAC card.  Please do not purchase if your legally not able to do so.  I'm digging the whole freedom thing.  Washington State Firearm Transfer DOL form available if you would like it.

Say you want a pistol for self defense, home defense or lawful concealed carry. There are so many choices out there. You want a pistol that could be a carry gun as well as enjoyable to shoot and chambered in a caliber that can knock down an assailant. Get a Witness in polymer. Compact or full size or even better yet, get a Witness P Carry to give you that added advantage in a carry/defense pistol while keeping the fun of shooting a Witness pistol. Witness Polymer Pistols can be converted to 9mm, .40SW, .45ACP"

The Standards - In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its' customers, the firearm's industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features.  With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….Loaded Chamber Indicator....Striker Status Indicator....Grip Safety....USA Trigger Safety....The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA™) Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, reward pressure is applied.
So What's New??
Personalization - Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. The XD(M) gives you more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case....(M)ould-Tru Backstraps......(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System......(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case......With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.  A triple-position Picatinney rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.  Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.
Innovations - The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M).  From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be....(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release......(M)inimal Error Disassembly......(M)ega Capacity Magazine......The modified contour of the new XD(M) grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.  Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during assembly, we've made the process easier and faster.
Technology - Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) to a whole new level in precision.  With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory®....(M)elonite®......(M)atch Grade Barrel......(M)inimal Reset Trigger......Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.  The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.  Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.  The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.
Design - Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level....(M)odel Contour Frame.......(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations......(M)ega-Lock Texture......The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.  Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.  The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.  The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Around 700 rounds fired, unfortunatly 5 guns and a 1 hr time limit at the range doesn't let each gun get enough love.

 This is one of the most customizable guns you can buy since its been around for more then 50 years. You can change EVERYTHING about the gun if you wanted to (bolt, trigger barrel stocks budget is the limit) Also things like Magazines are reasonably priced because of it, Unlike ARs in 22lr or other 22 rifles that are more plastic then anything.

 The Rifle is great and works flawless if you run mini mags but it will also run other ammo if your in a pinch. I installed a new ATI adjustable stock it also folds to the side. I currently have the ATI stock just configured for a sling and my streamlight (that is going back on my Glock and is not included) but you can add more rails if you want, and i am including all the rails. (you can run whatever you want if it can go on a picatinny rail a light, laser, fore grip or a Bi pod as the rails come on and can be replaced with flush inserts like i have right now.) The Rifle will come with both stocks, Three factory 10 round magazines, Three butler creek 25 round STEEL LIP magazines. (I would not trust a plastic feed lip magazine) Also a Simons scoop, i don't have it on because the iron sights are a blast to shoot. $425 for all of it, $450 and ill throw in 300 rounds of Mini mags and +100 rounds of Agila so for $450 your set to go to the range

Don't NEED to sell it to survive so don't low ball me, i am leaving for the Air force in Feb so I don't need the gun sitting around I would rather sell it and let someone else enjoy the rifle.

Includes Hip belt and Lid

GEN II - Tan Buckles and Trim

VERY GOOD Condition - Main Pack does not show any defect affecting the functionality or use of the pack. All zippers, snaps, and buckles are working perfectly. May show slight soiling and/or wear due to previous use to include the possibility of small nicks in the material.
Manufactured in the USA by Propper International for the US Military
The Improved Load Bearing System (ILBE) backpack was created for use by the United States Marine Corps based on feedback received during initial combat actions that took place during the first US involvement in Iraq. The system was created by Arcteryx Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF) program and was intended to replace the ALICE and MOLLE systems currently in use. Arcteryx used the noted design flaws in the previous two systems to create a more efficient load bearing pack without increasing the volume of the pack and maneuverability it allowed for. The ILBE system consists of three main parts, the Main Pack, the Hydration System, and the Assault Pack. This listing is for the Main Pack only to include the hip belt and lid.

There are three main configurations for the ILBE system, the Existence Load, the Approach March Load, and the Assault Configuration. Both the Assault Configuration and Existence Load utilize the Assault Pack component. Since the Approach March Load is designed more for extended survival than combat situations, the Assault Pack was not required. Both the Existence Load and the Assault Configuration are designed to be used in combat ready scenarios making the Assault Pack an essential piece of the configuration.

The ILBE Pack is designed to carry a load of up to 120lbs but at the same time it distributes the weight so it is comfortable to wear. The key features to the packs comfort is in its internal frame with 2 metal ribs on the outer sides and 2 larger spars in the middle. These spars are already shaped to fit most peoples backs but can be custom bent if need be.

Next the pack includes soft padding on both the hip belt and shoulder straps. With the wide hip belt it displaces the weight around your body with fewer pressure points. Both straps can be adjusted to custom fit your body and has a sternum strap that can be raised or lowered to fit both men and women.

To keep the pack snug to your body you will find several compression straps along each side. These can be adjusted for different size loads and keeps your gear in place throughout your hike. Both sides of the pack also includes pockets which makes a nice resting spot when carrying longer items such as trek poles or holds extra water bottles. You will also find heavy duty zippers on both sides for access to your gear in the main compartment.
The back of the pack offers the ability to customize your pack with MOLLE accessories by using the MOLLE webbing and includes a compartment to help hold a hydration system or the ILBE Assault Pack which can be buckled down and tightened to keep in place. If you choose not to use the Hydration compartment or are strapping a larger MOLLE accessory to the back you can roll down this flap and snap it in place.

The main compartment is protected by a corded dust cover and can also be clipped closed. The main compartment provides storage to hold enough gear for a multi-day adventure. With zippers on both sides of the main compartment, you are able to access the bottom of the pack without having to pull everything out from the top.
Great for Hunting, Backpacking, Camping, Hiking, Tactical Operations, Bug Out Bags, or any other outdoor activities.
These items are priced to sell and typically are at better rates than most competitors on EBay or elsewhere.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

It has never been used to cut anything and has never been sharpened, however, I may have touched up the edge with my ceramic V rods, I can't remember.

This is the 6"" model with the aluminum frame.  They make a less expensive model with plastic grip panels but the aluminum one is by far, in my opinion, the best.  Should someone want to use this as a defensive tool it's weight and strength makes it just as effective with the blade closed.  

This knife is big, very big and extremely impressive when open.  Whether you are a collector or the kind of person who fights ninjas in your spare time this is the knife for you!  Keep in mind this folding dagger is very big so if you decide to carry it (check your local laws) you'll need really big pockets!

This is a great price for this particular model!  I'm actually surprised this hasn't sold already, this is the perfect knife for a collector or just for someone who likes to have unique knives.  This will be the only price drop on this knife since I really prefer to keep it otherwise.  I'm fighting the urge to take the ad down already lol.  I love this knife despite never using it.

I came to the conclusion that there's no sense in having two of the same gun, especially when I don't know a good gunsmith. The one in my area sucks pretty hardcore, so I'm trying out this other gunsmith a long way away from me but he's very busy and hasn't worked on the one I turned in yet so I can't judge him yet.

If you know a good gunsmith, then offer me a gun you don't want and we'll trade.

I'm looking for any conceal and carry type gun, and I see a lot of these rugers floating around. I'd love an s&w j frame with the exposed hammer but that requires money I don't have right now. I'm definitely in the market for a 22 pistol like a heritage revolver.

Oh and I've got the box, papers, two magazines, some hogue swelled palm grips on it and the original grips come with it (I didn't like the feel of the hogue grips, and they don't look any better than the original grips)

I don't know about a price tag, I paid $700 for this guy not knowing about it's fail to eject issues. Maybe a new magazine will fix it? Male an offer"

It is 100% new and in unfired condition.  There is the slightest visible drag line around the cylinder and I mean slightest.  There are no other marks on this revolver.  This is not a fake ad for a revolver that does not exist.  I'm not selling it for a friend and it's not locked up in my dad's safe...  I have this Colt and I have everything it came with new.  I took it out of its bag only to be photographed and then it was put back in the safe.  I will only show this Colt and all of the content in the case to the prospective buyer when an agreement has been reached and the revolver is to be inspected prior to its purchase.  Sorry to be like this but I'm not going to let anyone see or handle this pistol that is not serious about purchasing it.  I am asking $2850 or best reasonable cash offer.  I would be willing to trade this pistol for a Colt MK-II or MK-III National Match Mid-Range .38 Special Wadcutter that is New in The Box (They were built from 1961 to 1971) or take a partial trade with a shooting grade 4"" or 6"" Python or King Cobra.  I don't need to sell this pistol so please don't think I'll be moved by a low-ball cash offer.  I would consider a Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911's  (First Series, Series 70 or Series 80 made between 1957 and 1990) in trade with value to be determined by condition.      

Send offer and/or question through the ""Contact Seller"" link with your name and phone number.  If you are not willing to give a name and phone number I am not willing to reply back.  

Sorry if this sounds rude but there are a lot of rude people out there and I'm not interested in engaging with them and just block their email addresses. 

Note to potential out-of-town buyers...  I will ship this revolver but you must know your local laws in regard to receiving it.  My FFL will ship to Californian on occasion and extra fees may apply.  You as the buyer will be responsible for 100% of the shipping, transfer and insurance fees.  I am making this revolver available to locals in my area first as I prefer a face-to-face deal unless you have a Colt Mid-Range National Match then we can talk right now...

With Kindest regards I thank you for looking!"
