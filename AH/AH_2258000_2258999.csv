Windham Weaponry Ar 15 5.56 or .223 Sight Ready Carbine Stock  Less than one year old. Its Like new, mint condition, it still looks brand new.





Got it on a package deal and have to sell 2 of my 3 ar's I have.  NO LOWBALLING.......dont need to sell, but wife wants me to put some cash back in account.





The scope is not included in price.  If you want it, I would sell for an additional $600.  Its a Carl Zeiss 3,5-10 x 44 MC Conquest Assembled in USA and cost $900 new!!!  Its like new, less than one year old and still perfect condition.  NO box though.  Its an amazing scope.



Listed info below on gun I pulled off website. Best thing here is it has a transferable lifetime warranty, so you don't have to worry about anything like all the other brands.  Spike's is the only one in this price range that does the same.  So you can buy without any worries at all.





I'm Asking $$975 for the Rifle only and one mag that came with it.  I can throw in a soft case too and depending on deal I might have a few other things I could add.

It MSRP's for $1050 appx plus tax and FFL and background.  





Only trades I might consider is a 2 x $400-550 glock 9mm, 40 or possibly 45, or one glock and cash.   Maybe a Sig P238 or P938. $500-550 value only.  If you have other handgun only trades, they have to be new or like new and a very good deal on my side as I would just sell them and need room to negotiate, so I cant pay retail for them.  I prefer colt, smith, kimber and some sigs........but need at least $450 cash with the deal minimum unless its just too good to pass up.





I have ammo and extra mags that I will sell to buyer at lower price than without gun purchase.





Email me your number if you want a pic, I'll text it to you.  Will only deal with you if we speak on phone.  



If you have a trade, you must send me a model, condition and price for me to consider it and respond to you.

Smith M&P Magpul Edition AR 15 MINT Black





Got it last Thursday and then found several other guns I wanted and bought, so now I would like  to sell 2 of my 3 ar's I have.  NO LOWBALLING.......dont need to sell, but wife wants me to put some cash back in account.





Listed info below on gun I pulled off website.  



I'm Asking $$1100 for the Rifle only and one mag that came with it.  I can throw in a soft case too and depending on deal I might have a few other things I could add.

It MSRP's for $1259 appx plus tax and FFL and background.  


Only trades I might consider is a 2 x $400-550 glock 9mm, 40 or possibly 45, or one glock and cash.   Maybe a Sig P238 or P938. $500-550 value only.  If you have other handgun only trades, they have to be new or like new and a very good deal on my side as I would just sell them and need room to negotiate, so I cant pay retail for them.  I prefer colt, smith, kimber and some sigs........but need at least $450 cash with the deal minimum unless its just too good to pass up.





I have ammo and extra mags that I will sell to buyer at lower price than without gun purchase.





Email me your number if you want a pic, I'll text it to you.  Will only deal with you if we speak on phone.  



If you have a trade, you must send me a model, condition and price for me to consider it and respond to you.         



Must be legal and show ID. I'm a private seller. FTF only.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
 The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
 The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
 2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
 located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
 4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
 an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
 5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
 6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
 misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
 7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
 8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

 9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
 dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
 10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
 11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

The opportunity to own a commemorative pistol of this quality is rare and this model will only be available for a limited time. Since its adoption by the US Army on March 29, 1911, the M1911 pistol design has proven timeless. Remington's experience with the pistol design started under the UMC moniker just before the end of World War I. In 2010, more than 90 years later, E-RPC, LLC re-introduced the Remington Model 1911 R1 pistol to a new generation of handgun enthusiasts and collectors.

Model 1911 R1 Centennial Limited Edition features exclusive anniversary scrollwork engraving with a 24-kt. gold banner on the slide and is finished in a rich Carbona blue. It is further accented by a 14-kt gold bead front sight and exhibition-grade smooth walnut grips.

This new Raspberry PT 738 will appeal to the ladies. It is a different shade than the pink PT 738, and looks a lot better to me. It shoots great, is lightweight, has enough power for personal defense, and is easy to ALWAYS have within reach. It has the Taurus Security System internal key lock, a loaded-chamber indicator, and comes with one six-round magazine. Even though it is light weight, the PT 738 is easy to control. The trigger pull is smooth, requiring about four and three-quarters pounds of pressure. The PT 738 is reliable, accurate, and made in the USA.

I assume it's black powder when it comes to a Damascus barrel.  Needs some smithing because it will not open up, something is stuck; other than that, it's in pretty good shape for its age, low serial #, I looked down the barrels on the other end and they look to be in great shape.  Never fired it.  

Asking $100 but would be up for a trade such as a mosin nagant, simple single shot break-action shotgun, etc.  Give me a shout and let me know if interested!

I believe it is considered an antique, but with NJ I never am ever sure lol, so please make sure to have your Firearms ID card and matching DL.  Feel free to give me a text at REDACTED or shoot me an email.

I have already had more opinions, guesses, and shit I think, answers to my question.

I have bought, traded, sold, guns in many states as I have traveled this great country of ours. In nearly every case all the state law required was to verify the other person had a US issued drivers license to indicate citizenship.
All this other bull crap about Bill of Sale, CCW licenses, copies of drivers license, etc, is just that, bull crap, not required by any law when the exchange is between two private citizens.

So, I'm going to be in Virginia for a short while with returning visits over the next few years.

At first glance, the Model 70 Ultimate Shadow, with its flowing lines and integrated, rubberized, oval-dot gripping surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end looks very different from other composite rifles. When you pick it up, you’ll know why. The stock immediately gives you a comfortable, secure hold even when wet or cold. It feels tight in your hands and gives you better control from any shooting angle. The Ultimate Shadow is also lightweight. You can carry it into remote, rugged country without worrying about any extra weight, or dinging up the rifle when the hike gets rough. The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy and its classic, Controlled Round Feed action continues to make the Ultimate Shadow’s receiver the most reliable and smoothest cycling in the industry.

It was made on 7/30/13 according to the casing envelope. I took delivery on 8/7/13, so it is only a few months old. Has only had 200 rounds put through the barrel. I purchased this because I planned on carrying it however I feel my Glock 19 fits me better personally. This pistol is in pristine condition, and very accurate I put 10 shots inside a hole the size of a 9mm casing at 10 yards I have a picture to prove it.Has been cleaned extremely well inside and out, every inch has been cleaned not half assed. Pistol looks unused. I can provide more detailed pictures of anything listed if need be.

Comes with case,paperwork, and two magazines one of which has a pearce pinky extension. $475 pistol only stock sights.


Also for sale is a carbon fiber kydex inside the waistband holster right hand carry, which are molded to specific model. Cost me $85 new. The retention is amazing. You can literally hold the holster upside down and the pistol will not come out even if you shake it.Holsters very nice also. Very nice piece. Will include for $60

I also have a Blackhawk Serpa for $30. Or I will include it free if you buy either the other holster or the sights.

I also have installed a set of night sights. They are Ameriglo Pro series. The rears are yellow and the front is green. Makes for much easier pickup versus the all green dots. They are brand new I purchased them Oct.3rd and received them October 8th 2013. These were $125. I have the receipt with the price I paid and date. Many consider these some of the best night sights. They glow very bright at night. I will include these for $90 and I will also include the stock sights. If you do not want them I will install the stock sights and keep these.
 They can be seen here.

Along with the pistol comes four magazines, the original box, manual, pistol specific tools, and practice caps. The original fired round and ballistics information is included.
This pistol was manufactured in 2003 and has been owned and stored for most of its life. It has received use and much care the last two years as my carry pistol and favorite range shooter.
This pistol has had less than a thousand rounds through it in its lifetime and is a pleasure to shoot. I have cared for it and have found it very comfortable and surprisingly accurate for the barrel length (3.5 Inches). The ""Light Double Action"" trigger by Para is exceptional. The pull is clean and reasonably short, the break is crisp with a defined reset. The light pull created by this trigger makes it very consistent and easily controllable. The Para Carry 12 features 3-dot night sights and frame mounted safeties.

Along with the pistol comes three holsters:
A Galco Deep Cover In-The-Waistband holster with injection molded kydex clip - (My personal favorite as it is so comfortable).
A kydex custom formed ITW holster.
A Bagmaster nylon holster with magazine pouch.

This pistol has just had a complete tune-up by Para Ordance factory, deep cleaning, bench and range testing. They updated and replaced:
New Recoil Spring Guide
Recoil Spring
New Trigger Return Spring
New Slide Stop

Outside of some minimal carry wear this is like getting a brand new pistol for over $200 less than they retailed for, plus all the extras.

I would prefer Face-to-Face, but am willing to ship if necessary. If you buy it in person I will include a box of target rounds or two for free. Just need to see a Concealed Carry Permit and Driver's License.

Hey everyone, 
I recently got this little Walther PK380 (380 auto) and would rather sell or trade it for another 9mm. I took it to the range today and it shot great with no problems and was very consistent. It does have some carry wear on the slide, but nothing that wouldn't happen from you carrying it for a while. Also included are the take down tools, one mag, lock/keys, and the factory case. Ammo can be included for the right price or offer. I am a bigger guy and this gun feels great in my hands, just would prefer a 9mm. I would consider other calibers, but more preference on the 9mms. I really am wanting a 1911 9mm (any brand really, just be reasonable on your price), but open to most. Just ask, worst I can say is no. I could trade up or down for the right gun, but it will need to be balanced on both sides either with cash or extras. I would even do partial trades for certain ammo, or for some 22LR pistols plus cash (really looking for a pink SR22 if possible). I also need to meet around norman if possible due to my schedule. If you have any questions please message me and I will respond as soon as I can. I can send more pictures that way if you prefer as well."

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.
