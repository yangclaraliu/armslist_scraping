Really a strking piece, and we bet it was made in the late 70's by an extremely skilled smith. All parts are Parachmyer, including the rare and extremely visible sights. The gun itself is crazy tight, and the only, out of hundreds of 1911's I have fondled over the years, no-take up trigger I have ever felt. They would have had to bend the bow to achieve this, and I have read a feasible project for a competent smith but never felt one done so well. Otherwise, the bluing is great, the engraving is deep and the inlays are silver. Everything else is pachymer. What else do you need to know? What do I want? $850 or trade. Trades can be almost anything and can include other items I have listed (or just ask, I will be listing a ton of em pretty soon. I could be swayed with a carry pistol, a meprolight red dot, a rds or similar high end micro dot, law tactical folder, or etc. I am very easily swayed off target by nifty cool things I never knew I needed.

This Browning Hi-Power isn't a new age Glock, or a SIG, or a CZ 75 or a S&W, or any other modern 9mm. It is a refined and well fitted semi auto pistol. It has a great history, tradition and modern performance. Similar to a 1911 with manners and style. It just feels great in the hand and is real confidence builder.

It has been given new life with a professionally installed Krieger Match barrel (1:10 twist, 24"") and has been drilled/tapped for a scope mount. The listed price includes the Leupold base/rings as well as the Illuminated Sightron 3-9x42 scope. (No iron sights on this rifle) The scope has a duplex reticle and is crystal clear. I can't swear to a round count but I personally have put 50 rounds down range with it and it has a lot of potential. Chrome on the metal parts is in very good to excellent shape. There are assorted Elmer Keith stamps on the stock but I don't believe these to be original. Most likely someone was testing out their stamps before trying to fake Elmer Keith inspected rifles. (I don't believe he'd stamp it this many times with this many different stamps, especially on a former drill rifle!)This is a fantastic shooting 03A3 that you can shoot and not feel bad if you happen to get an accidental ding. I've spent a bit much in the reloading room lately so looking for a new home for this beautiful and fun to shoot rifle. I'm afraid I am not looking for any trades unless you happen to have bullet swaging dies or supplies."

Not like most on this website that always have to feel like ""they talked you down""!I am looking for the honest guys.  If I cant find any then I will just put it on Gunbroker like I have with most things and usually end up getting more money.Please no trades, I am selling this to help my mom financially after my step-father passed. I am also well aware of all the fees that the Bottomfeeders try to scare me away from listing on Gunbroker.  I have been a member for many years.Thanks for looking and email me for more pics.  For a faster response if I am home, text or call me, I dont check my email all the time.Dan 734.three09.nine242Obviously were are not interested in trades.  If you are reading this then it is still for sale."

The innovative and patented Dura Safe safety concept is the only direct firing pin safety worldwide that perfectly, ergonomically operates as a slide on the locks extra quiet and, in addition, is protected against unintentional releasing. And the fact that one can unload in the safe condition finally underlines that the Sauer 101 completely redefines the standards in this discipline.Ever Rest - Spectacular Innovation The patented Ever Rest System bedding provides the superior precision of the S 101. The bedding element is bonded into the stock, the system is attached therein by two bolts. A special double fitting provides maximum decoupling of the shooting system from the stock, so that external influences have no effect on the position of the impact of shooting performance.Heat Lock - No Tension and StableDue to the new Heat Lock procedure, barrel and sleeve are connected completely without tension. Together with the extremely rigid sleeve and locking with six nipples directly in the barrel, the S 101 shines in precision at the top level.Ergo Max Stock-Air Face Up / Recoil DownThe Ergo Max stock differentiates itself by the air face inclining to the rear. The thereby improved position of the head behind the telescopic sight allows calm sighting. In addition, the recoil felt is considerably reduced.Smooth Chamber ActionAs with all its predecessors, the S 101 captivates by the legendary silky smooth chamber action of Sauer Rifles. And that means, quiet loading and lightning quick repetition.950 Gram Trigger-Deliberate FiringWith its extra wide and shaped trigger, as with match rifles, it provides direct firing, shooting comfort of the extra class.

The rifle started life as a complete rifle factory built by Noveske. The previous owner purchased a different upper so he could shoot suppressed. I purchaseed the factory built upper from him and went to Rainier Arms, bought a Gen 3 Noveske lower and sent it for cerakote before I even picked it up. Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero rounds thru the lower and less than 100 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired.

I built this over the winter and have NEVER fired it.The upper is a Bravo Company SOCOM profile with a full auto bolt group. The SOCOM profile is a highly desirable addition; the barrel is much thicker underneath the hand guards which aids in preventing premature heat build-up and blowouts. The entire upper was made to order by Bravo Company. It has a Midwest Industries drop in picatinny rail, Magpul Pro metal case hardened flip up rear sight, tan magpul furniture, ALG trigger, Daniel Defense parts kit and a GG&G bibpod ($200 alone). This also has a H3 tungstun buffer for the carbine length gas system.  The lower is also a great choice; a spikes tactical ""crusader"" lower. These are just cool for what they are, and very well made to boot. Spikes makes some great gear, and their lowers are no exception. This rifle comes with one tan p-mag and TWELVE standard GI 30 round aluminum magazines. These are worth about $10-13 apiece and I would imagine in an election year all magazines will be hard to come by as the months proceed. Cash only, $1100."

This item is listed as an 'Enhanced' model because it is drilled and tapped for a scope mount and it has the recessed muzzle, larger cylinder release latch and rampant colt stamp to the far right on the left side of the frame. This revolver has never been fired other than factory as we stand by our assessment of this King Cobra being as good as if you step back in 1998 and bought it from a firearm store. It is 99.5% or better and has absolutely no marks or distractions. Please judge from the pictures and let us know if you would like a picture of any part of this revolver. Comes in original Colt blue box from 1998. This a truly a special King Cobra that will make someone very proud to own and be the center of attention in any collection or at the range. King Cobras like this one don’t come around very often because Colt quit making them a long time ago and people that obtain them are firing them rather than preserving a King Cobra like this one. Don’t let this one slip by if you have ever wanted to buy a King Cobra. Shipping is $25 and free for all military, veterans and law enforcement. Please visit and like our FB page at: DCF FB Page"
