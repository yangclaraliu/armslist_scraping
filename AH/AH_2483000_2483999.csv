Stoeger’s new Double Defense side-by-side shotgun is a straightforward, rugged and reliable home defense shotgun. Ideal for use in tight quarters and tense situations, the Stoeger Double Defense with its traditional break-action and short, efficient design is easy to load and quick to deploy in an emergency.

A double-barrel shotgun has been the defensive firearm of choice for generations, but Stoeger has added practical, up-to-date features to the “tried-and-true” double gun. The Double Defense is chambered for 2-3/4- and 3-inch shells, in either 12- or 20-gauge. The tactical-length 20-inch ported barrels feature fixed, improved cylinder chokes. The fast, single-trigger design and convenient, tang-mounted automatic safety makes the Stoeger Double Defense ideal for home security use.

The Double Defense gun is outfitted with a green, fiber-optic front sight and comes standard with two Picatinny Rail accessory mounts: one on the receiver for red-dot sights and a second factory-installed rail under the barrels for attaching targeting lasers or tactical lights. All metal surfaces are finished in matte blue and come complete with non-reflective matte black hardwood stock and forearm."

Beware of profuse compliments that will inundate you upon taking ownership of this weapon. A mere 20 rounds have been fired in this hand cannon, and I have thoroughly cleaned and polished each cylinder with Breakfree Cleaner Lubricant Preservative. MSRP from Taurus is over 1000 dollars on this elephant revolver. It is no longer in production. The only reason I'm selling is to try to get out of credit card debt. Needless to say, after you depart with this beloved firearm, I will certainly pour out an abundance of tears. Perhaps before you depart from my abode. Just promise me you'll treat her well.

Dakota Safe Company, gun safes, tough enough to hold up to the most determined thief or fire. A Dakota gun safe is built with the same specs associated with most of the higher end safes, but at a price nowhere near that of its competitors. With its hour and half fire rating, 11 gauge body, true composite door construction, re-enforced lock plate, slip clutch and pry guard features, not to mention it’s reinforced shelving, 4 way bolt works with massive 1.5” bolts and a continuous weld body. These safes have no match in their class. Get the best value for your money with a Dakota Safe and take solace in the knowledge that your valuables and guns are protected by one of the fastest growing names in security.



featuring:
59x30x24
670 lbs.
90 minute 1200 degree Fire Rating
4 way bolt works with massive 1.5"" locking bolts.
Beige Carpet Interior with versatile adjustable reinforced shelves and a
22 gun rack capacity.
5 spoke chrome handles standard with a Manual Dial lock.
Electronic lock available by request. (additional $119)
The door feature a 4 way bolt system.
Dakota safes are built with heavy 11 gauge steel and come in one color, Textured Black.
And of course, all safes come with the Dakota logo emblazoned on the front in silver.
All Dakota Gun Safes have Anti-Pry tabs. Very few safes have this feature included in the design of their safes and it is usually upper end safes.
All safes have hardened steel plates to protect the vital parts of the safe. Making it so no one can just come in and drill the locks. All safes have a re-locker, a spring loaded pin. This pin is tripped, if tampered with, and locks up the whole mechanism. This feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.
All safes have a handle design that utilizes a slip clutch to disengage the handle and keeps it from engaging the bolts. This feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.
All safes have under shelf support bars on all big shelves. You can load your shelves with ammo and a year later they will still hold their rigid form. Again, this feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.
All safes have four bolt down holes so you can anchor them in place. Each safe comes with a bolt down kit.
All safes have fire rated gypsum interior linings with a 90 minute, 1200° fire rating. This makes the Dakota Safe the most secure fire resistant safe in its class.
Fully continuous welds throughout. You will never see a spot weld on one of our safes. This is one more way that we will provide the best value for your dollar. And yet again, this feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.
All safes come with expanding door seals made to expand at higher temperatures to better seal your valuables from smoke and water damage.
All safes come with beige fabric interiors, including the gun and storage shelving. You can add light kits or pocket door systems to your safe for a nominal fee, call for details.
We inspect our safes to guarantee that they are the highest quality safe in its price range.

I am taking a $190 loss. My stupidity is your gain. I have all the invoices and papers to show I picked up the gun from Turners on December 21, 2013, paid $1,090 and is legally registered to me.

The Para USA Tactical Target Rifle, TTR-XA is a semi-automatic rifle that’s made in the U.S.A, 5.56mm caliber (can also fire .223 ammo) and features a 16.5"" chrome lined barrel, a Rapid Deployment Stock (RDS) (LOP adjustable from 11 3/4"" to 14 3/8"") and an overall length 34 3/4"" to 38"" (27 3/4"" with stock folded).  One of the great things about this rifle, is the Delayed Impingement Gas System (DIGS), which puts the recoil system up front, above the barrel, which pushes the muzzle back down for quicker follow up shots and reduced felt recoil.  Because of the DIGS, the rifle can be fired with the stock folded and the stock locks up nice and tight!  not only does it have a full length Picatinney rail at the 12 o’clock position and full length forearm rails at the 3, 6 and 9 positions.

The rifle also features a Manifold Injection System (MIS), which expels gases through the bolt carrier, making this the cleanest running auto-loading rifle in the world, plus it can be field stripped with not tools.  These rifles were manufactured by Para USA in Charlotte, NC.  This is the high end model and rarest of the three models Para made.  Features a Command Arms Accessories G-27 grip with finger grooves, contoured backstrap and storage compartment.  Made for less than 2 years, but still under full warranty from Para.

Everything comes with original box and paperwork. I'm not looking to make a buck on the other optic or ammo, I have receipts of everything I got. Don't waste my time. Feel free to email with any questions TO MAKE AN OFFER. I will not split the ammo and the rifle until the rifle gets sold. I like trades too, let me know what you got, long guns and general gun stuff only worst I can do is say no."

 You're more than welcome to give it a thorough look over prior to the sale or trade. I haven't had time to buy a rear sight or any ammo, so therefore it is technically still new and unfired.

Description:

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Comes with booklet, cleaning rod, ect... Only 1 mag has been shot through this rifle for testing and function. Perfect AK!! AR accuracy with AK reliability!! Got this rifle mainly to SBR, however work in the oilfield keeps me away from home a lot, so I can just never get around to it.  

Arsenal did announce that that their SLR-106 rifles are discontinued, so if you want one that is mint, now is the time before they are gone!! Price will obviously go up on the SLR-106 line of rifles, and the price for Circle10 mags with it!!  Anyway, text for more pictures!!

To recall the important jubilee, the company has treated the market with launch of the special edition of CZ 75 pistol, their absolutely top best seller of all times. The resultant product will be the copy of this legend from 1970´s. The numerical tricks are hidden in the 75th anniversary of the company, as well as the name of this legendary firearm – CZ 75 - and the last but not the least is the quantity of firearms in the limited edition - 6 x 75 pcs within the limited edition of pistols with reference to six continents supplied by exports from Ceská zbrojovka, plus 1 x 75 pcs of the World Class version guns. “The conjunction of 75th anniversary and the very CZ 75 pistol in its initial version were apparent from the very beginning. Therefore, we named the pistol in the spirit of this event - CZ 75th Anniversary“- said the Product Manager of Ceská zbrojovka, Richard Velísek, one of the authors involved in realisation of the anniversary pistol model. By manufacturing this limited series, Ceská zbrojovka is referring back to the break of 1960´s and 1970´s, when the trestle board of design engineer František Koucký saw the evolution of the first draft of the famous “seventy-five“. There have been numerous pieces of the first model of CZ 75 preserved all over the World, excluding the cock safety lug and shorter frame and slide grooves. These pistols now represent unique vintage pieces held in private collections. With the limited series of 525 pcs of 75th Anniversary, Ceská zbrojovka is offering the option for purchase of this legend even in the year 2011, which is approximately 40 years since its evolution and 30 years following its upgrade to CZ 75B. The shape of CZ 75th Anniversary resembles pistols from 1970´s, yet its equipment and features would match it with contemporary pistols with sufficient safety elements.
