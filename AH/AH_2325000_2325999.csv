It is in 9mm Makarov caliber, and comes with many ambidextrous safety-magazine release, single or double action (both very smooth) This pistol is very accurate, reliable and high quality. I would say it's in very good + condition. Seeing it in person you can make your own grade determination. There is no rust or pitting anywhere on this pistol, but the grips have several nicks and dings and overall are in very good shape. There is finish loss on the magazine floor plates and some holster wear on the muzzle which is to be expected for a gun that was made and seen service use since 1986. All of these issues are considered normal wear and tear. The front sight has a white vertical line in it for visibility and the rear sight has two white dots. The bore of this pistol is Polygonal rifled, and although it may look like the rifling is gone, it is not. Once you fire it you will be able to see the ""twist"" in the bore after it is unloaded and the slide opened. Google ""Polygonal Rifling"" for info on this procedure. I have fired about every brand of 9x18 Makarov ammo through this without any failures of any sort, and it functions 100% with both magazines. This pistol has the typical CZ accuracy, reliability and durability.

This would be fine, if we were all the same with exactly the same needs and circumstances. The knife that one person chooses to openly carry might be the same knife that a different person wants to conceal, wear upside down or strap to their calve.
You buy the equipment that you feel is best for you and we will make a carry system that applies to your particular needs.
We make sheaths for knives, holsters for handguns, belt mounted sleeves for clips and flashlights, and products for just about anything else you'd want to carry.
KYDEX sheet is an acrylic-polyvinyl chloride alloy produced by. Engineered for thermoforming fabrication, KYDEX sheet, combines the advantageous properties of both the acrylic and the polyvinyl chloride components. From acrylic, it obtains superior rigidity and formability; from PVC, outstanding toughness, chemical resistance and good interior finish ratings.
The combination of strength properties of KYDEX sheet places it at the highest level among thermoforming materials. Its modulus of elasticity in flexure is 330,000 psi - 50% higher than many other sheets.
Parts formed from KYDEX sheet will be much more rigid and will deform less when loaded. This is of particular importance in deep formed parts with thin wall sections. KYDEX sheet offers rigidity along with a high degree of toughness and resilience.
KYDEX sheet is a relatively hard thermoplastic with a hardness of 90 on the Rockwell R scale. This hardness, combined with its grained surface, increases its abrasive resistance .
KYDEX sheet has a UL classification of 94 V-0.
KYDEX® V sheet is a recycled grade of a proprietary thermoplastic sheet that is cost competitive with other grades of thermoplastic sheet while offering improved performance.



For those who like the more original carry methods such as leathers and nylon we mold our products the same way as the KYDEX to make you're favorite/high end products protected and held in place the way it should.



All products we make are custom so as for the pictures are just samples and to give you an idea of what we can make for you. Anything you think we can do it, from belts, bags, holsters and even adding or modifying something you already have and want it to be better.
Prices all depend on what you would like to do so cant give an exact estimate over phone or email.

We also repair anything you already have that might be broken.

Included with this pistol are 2 boxes of factory fresh .380ACP 95gr FMJ ammo. Additional boxes are available for purchase. 2 are shown for example.  (6 boxes are factory fresh Blazer and 2 boxes are factory reloads.)  Both brands are 95gr fmj. I have fired about every brand of ammo through this gun with absolutely zero malfunctions.

Ultra rare Pre Ban Norinco Model 86S factory Bullpup. This one is serial number 808. Has factory supplied 20 round magazine and factory 86S bayonet and sling. Also have a copy of the original owners manual. This rifle has been rarely fired. I am the second owner, purchased from the original buyer. The Type 86S design departs from the usual AK-47 in several ways. The trigger-sear-hammer group is housed in a rear extension of the receiver, well behind the pistol grip. The operating mechanism is exactly the same as in the standard AK-47/AKM, with the exception of a connecting rod between the trigger and sear. The selector switch/safety is quite different than the sheet metal lever found on the standard AK-47/AKM. The Type 86S selector/safety is thumb-shaped and located on the right side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip. The cocking handle is located under the carrying handle. A vertical, spring-loaded, plastic folding fore grip is mounted on the front of the receiver. When not in use, it folds forward beneath the barrel. The magazine well is located to the rear of the pistol grip and will accept 10-, 20-, and 30-round magazines as well as drum magazines. The rear sight is an aperture/peep sight mounted on a cam. Turning the adjustment knob sets the rear sight for 100-, 200-, or 300-meter ranges. Both the front and rear sight are mounted on the combination gas tube and hand guard which clamps tightly onto the receiver."

Type IV (Armor-Piercing Rifle)
This armor protects against 30 caliber armor-piercing bullets (U.S. military designation APM2), with nominal masses of 10.8 g (166 gr) impacting at a velocity of 868 m (2850 ft) per second or less. It also provides at least single hit protection against the threats mentioned in lower levels.

Original bluing. Shoots great, action locks up really nicely. Has been well taken care of. Trigger is silky smooth in both single and double action. Everything seems really mechanically sound. No rust, no significant scratches. Wooden grips are a little worn on one side and there is a small, small piece missing on the lower part of one grip. I assume they are the original grips.

Bore is in really good shape. This model should not have P+ rounds put through it.

I also have about 100 rounds of Winchester ball to thrown in.  

I got this on a trade a few years ago out in Oklahoma.  It was built by Ken Hallock...  Author of Hallock's .45 Auto Handbook.  I HAVE NO PROOF of that, but don't value it at some ridiculous price anyhow.  He added a different mainspring housing, adjustable sights, trigger and hammer...  Besides that I'm really not sure.  I had a gunsmith in South Carolina add the Wilson Combat ambi thumb safety.  I still have the original if you prefer.  I will tell you that I'm not happy with the work he did on the safety and I would replace it if I was going to hang on to this thing.  IT DOES WORK, I just expected perfection for what he charged me.  

It really is a nice gun and a great shooter!  I keep ""trying"" to love 1911's but it's just not happening for me.

606,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2325606,"For Sale:  Anti-Personnel 44 Mag. Ammo - 200 gr. Hard Cast Wadcutter (1,300 fps) - 20 Round Box","Azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 12, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=283

This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms. We prefer to establish advertised velocities from real-world firearms and not from extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities. You know what you are getting in the real world, where it matters, with Buffalo Bore ammunition."

This lower has quite a bit of money into it and can include an umbrella stripped upper (blem in black) for a reduced cost as well or include in the trade. 

I am looking for a nice quality O/U 12 gauge only or will entertain trades on a Glock 29 + Cash or will sell outright.

Lower is a Pistol Lower and must go through FFL

This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more.

This is for trade consideration only as I'm not interested in selling it outright, rather trade only. I really like it, however my other handguns are all chambered in 9mm & 45acp, so I'd entertain trading it for a different, quality handgun chambered in a 9mm or 45acp; or a nice S&W Revolver. Feel free to send me an email with a phone number and I'll respond promptly. If I'm not interested, I'm happy to say ""no thanks"". I just thought I'd throw it up here and see if anything pops up that I don't know I ""need"".

This was the NRA 'Handgun of the Year' in 2005 and I can see why. I have put less than 500 rounds through it since I bought it a couple years back and it's gone bang every time, regardless of what ammo I've fed it. The grip feels great in my large hands and it's a very solid gun. I originally purchased it to CC, but it's ended up being primarily my range gun due to the size.

Comes with everything from the factory: Hard case, (2) 15 rd. magazines, bore brush, sight adjusters, lock key, owner's manual and warranty card. I'm also including the remaining 25 rounds of Magtech .40 as I've switched to a 9mm and no longer need them, as well as (2) IWB/OWB holsters one by Akar, one by ACE that are specifically made for this gun.

The gun itself is in good used condition. Slight wear on the safety lever and the top of sights. This is a great firearm that will serve someone for years to come.

Windham Weaponry MPC


Description

The Windham Weaponry MPC is a semi-automatic carbine chambered in .223 Rem. or 5.56 NATO. Long story short, Windham Weaponry used to be Bushmaster Arms. The owner of Bushmaster sold the company to Remington and then in early 2011, he bought it back and renamed it Windham Weaponry. The MPC is one of three AR-15-style rifles Windham produces. If one were to compare the MPC to the other models (SRC and HBC) they could call it the standard model. It has adjustable military sights and a standard barrel.

The MPC uses a gas impingement operating system, meaning the propellant gases that push the projectile out of the bore are captured in a tube near the muzzle. The tube directs the gas backwards toward the bolt and ultimately push the bolt back and cycling the action.

Features include 6 position telescoping buttstock, which allows shooters
 to adjust the stock to his or her liking, and the receiver is made of
 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum, which is a corrosion resistant alloy. The
 material was originally designed by the Japanese in the 1940s for
 fighter jet frames. Now it’s commonly used to make bikes, planes, boats,
 cars and firearms
