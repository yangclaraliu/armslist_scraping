***Call REDACTED or Email with subject ""RUGER SR9c""


I purchased this Ruger SR9c just about 2 months ago and it is still in great condition. This gun has only about 300 rounds through it so it's just barely broken in. 
This gun comes with the black Ruger gun case, all paperwork, black/red Ruger brand gun lock, 2 magazines (10 rd, 17 rd), thumb loader, test shell from factory etc.

This is a GREAT all around concealed carry or home / personal defense handgun. The SR9c conceals VERY well due to it's size & since it is all dark black. You can't even tell it's there with the compact 10 round magazine, and if you get it just right, you can conceal it with the extended magazine in as well. Here are the specs:

Slide Material: Alloy Steel
Grip Frame: Black, High Performance, Glass-Filled Nylon
Barrel Length: 3.40""
Height: 4.61""
Weight: 23.40 oz.
Twist: 1:10 RH
MA Approved & Certified: No
Slide Finish: Black Nitride
Sights: Adjustable 3-dot
Overall Length: 6.85""
Width: 1.27
Capacity: 10+1, 17+1
Grooves: 6
CA Approved: No
Suggested Retail: $529.00

This Ruger SR9c comes with one 10 round magazine with a finger extension butt plate & a flat butt plate & one 17 round magazine with a magazine sleeve (gives the appearance/feel of a full size 9mm. 
SR9c has a visual/physical loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety, + ambidextrous manual safety, ambidextrous magazine release, dual-recoil spring/plastic/metal guide rod. 

The back of the frame has a rubber back strap insert that can be taken out, turned around, put back in and then the frame will allow for a better grip for a bigger hand. You get an extra rubber back strap insert just in case anything ever happens to the one in the gun.


**(stainless steel dual spring guide rods are available for this gun online for around $40 with a stainless mirror front or a black front. I would get the stainless, it would really ""pop"" with this all-black gun + stainless barrel). This gun has a fantastic trigger, very nice solid reset, and if you prefer you can order a trigger connector online to adjust the trigger to your preferred weight (NY style, 3.5lb, etc)."

The Rifle is not in 100% condition but it is very nice nonetheless.  It's not so nice that you'll be afraid to take it out and use it.

When I broke in this rifle, I removed the gas block/tube and hand guard, and used break in loads w/ guilding metal jackets loaded over 80% case filled with IMR Trail Boss Powder, for the first 20 rounds I cleaned the bore of all copper and carbon fowling between every shot, for the next 20 rounds i did the same as a redundancy as there was no more copper building up in the bore. The result is a barrel that needs fowling removed very rarely, and during breakin the barrel never got warm, This gun shoots the same point of aim, the same groups, hot or cold. I built this rifle to be a short to mid range combat ready rifle. the action is so smooth you have to feel it to beleive it, after the lube burns off it stays slicker than melting ice. This rifle weighs 10lbs but the balance makes it feel very nice and effortless to shoulder the weapon. Also at night with 5.56 loads there s such a low muzzle signature and the kill flash on the aim point won't give away your position cause it eliminates optic reflection

The Price is Non Negotiable, and I am not interested in Trades at this time, The STI 1911 and theBenchmade knife is not included. However I may be interested in a nice FN Scar+"

This pistol has been sent to Springfield for the safety recall, fixed and returned as indicated by the roll pin on the grip safety (see pictures). Before the recall I only had the gun for a couple of weeks and fired about 200 rounds through it.  After it was returned from Springfield on 11-4-13, I test fired 100 rounds to verify functionality then thoroughly cleaned it. The pistol is in perfect condition.  The firearm comes with the case, original manuals, all XD gear it originally came with (holster and magazine pouch), Interchangeable backstrap, cable lock, cleaning brush, two 5 round mags and three 7 round mags (the pistol originally came with just the two 5 round mags).

While it was at Springfield for the recall, I grabbed another carry gun.  As it happens the new gun fits my hand better, so I'm selling the XDS. I'm asking $625 and am not interested in trades.  The pistol with all accessories is shown below.

First, there is no Federal law what so ever on private sales of firearms in state regardless if its a long-gun or handgun, you do however have to follow your local and state laws. And if the sale is between state lines it must go through an FFL.

Both Party's In NC:
North Carolina Law does not require a private sale of a Handgun nor a Long-gun to be ""Transferred"" through an FFL. All that is required in NC is that the Seller collect a Pistol Purchasing Permit from the Buyer OR the Buyer must have a Valid NC Concealed Carry License if buying a handgun. If you would like to copy the license for your records that's fine but it is not required. Also a bill of sale is a good idea for any future problems, but is not required. The above is applicable whether Military or a Civilian.

One Party Out of State:
If you are in NC and they are in lets say SC, if you are the buyer, you must have it sent to an FFL because the firearm is crossing state lines from another state, this is a Federal Law. If your the Seller you can do it two ways:
A) Personally mail your handgun/long-gun via UPS or FEDEX 2-Day Air to the buyers FFL of choice. You must go to a FED-x or UPS facility, not a mailing center.
B)Take your weapon to your local FFL and have them mail it to the Buyers FFL, but you will have to pay a bullshit transfer fee for them to transfer it to the Buyers FFL even though all that is involved is recording your name, number and gun info in a book. The only benefit to doing it this way is now its a Business dealing with a Business so its a little harder for you to get ripped off.

The above is NC State law. Anything that a seller or buyer does beyond this is there choice. If you want to do a private sale through and FFL then that's fine, but its not required and your wasting money."

Ambidextrous handle detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion. Non-reciprocating handle only engages when the operator charges or clears.

* Patented ejection port dust wiper on carrier (See Below)

* Gas piston system with multi-position regulator - (Patent # 065111.00128) A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel.

* Free-floating barrel - For increased accuracy

* Two-piece keyed quad rail system

* Tool-less field strip design

* Magpul BUIS

* Chambered for 5.56


ADCOR patented their Full Auto BCG's exclusively. They have a special, one of a kind dust plate that keeps the inside of the AR's clean, even with the dust cover open. The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier’s return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. Withstands temperature extremes because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield.

In 2010, H.P. Laboratories ran the ADCOR AR's through a torture test that included being submerged in water, buried in sand and 6,000 rounds were fired in 120 round cycles, and the guns were lubricated and allowed to cool after 600 round intervals. During the tests, no parts had to be replaced and there were no jams, stoppages, or malfunctions of any kind. Following this, the B.E.A.R. was able to shoot a .88 MOA group at 100 yards with 69-grain match ammo.

B.E.A.R. (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-floating barrel for increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel. Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. With a tool-less field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The piston's cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper, hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and action.

Two 20 rd mags, case, strap and cleaning tool. The AR6720 represents a new generation of Colt rifle, which comes standard with an optics ready rail and a flip-up rear iron sight Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most unobscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade. Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor. The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones. The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine).

I bought it new over a year ago as my first carry pistol/range toy. Comes with the original box, lock, a leather Looper OWB 3 slot holster, a leather/kydex Looper IWB holster, a kydex mag holder, 2 17 round mags, 2 33 round mags, and 129 rounds of Federal ammo (68 rounds of American Eagle 124gr FMJ, 50 rounds of Federal 115gr Hi-Shok JHP, and 11 rounds of Federal Premium 124gr Hydra-Shok JHP defense ammo).

I also have (not pictured) factory speed loader and instruction manual.

Shows normal holster wear, less than 500 rounds fired through it. Functioned flawlessly for every round. It's bone stock in every way. I've only ever field stripped it for cleaning/lube.

I'm selling because it's the only 9mm in the house. My wife shoots .380, and I've gotten into .45. I steer clear of .40, so getting rid of this one will add simplicity to my life, and a little bit of cash.

Sold as-is, where-is. Everything goes together. I'm not going to part it out. It's easy enough to go out and buy a G17 by itself. I'm hoping that the extra mags, ammo, and holsters will make my G17 a more valuable deal than just the gun to somebody.

Asking $600 for everything.

NO 40's though
I am listing a 357 revolver that I would be open to other trades though.

Gun is in really good condition.  Some slight wear on the muzzle and safety from holster, but other than that in perfect shape.  Not shot a lot, but has been 100% reliable and very, very accurate. Comes with two 13rd mags, backstraps and box.

The only reason I am wanting to trade is I now have a Bersa which is going to become my EDC (I rather carry single stack).  This gun is my nightstand gun and I am looking for the slightly bigger compact model.

I live in North MS (Olive Branch) but travel to the Grenada Area on occasion.  Willing to meet a reasonable distance.

 I did a close up of the only holster wear and as you can see it is minor.  Gun is in excellent shape, also when I got the box out I noticed it comes with interchangeable back straps I forgot about"

NO 40's though
I am listing a 357 revolver that I would be open to other trades though.

Gun is in really good condition.  Some slight wear on the muzzle and safety from holster, but other than that in perfect shape.  Not shot a lot, but has been 100% reliable and very, very accurate. Comes with two 13rd mags, backstraps and box.

The only reason I am wanting to trade is I now have a Bersa which is going to become my EDC (I rather carry single stack).  This gun is my nightstand gun and I am looking for the slightly bigger compact model.

I live in North MS (Olive Branch) but travel to the Grenada Area on occasion.  Willing to meet a reasonable distance.

 I did a close up of the only holster wear and as you can see it is minor.  Gun is in excellent shape, also when I got the box out I noticed it comes with interchangeable back straps I forgot about"

the pistol case has been pretty well used and doesn't have a product number on it anymore, but i believe it's the old style 1400 which means the handle is stationary and doesnt fold ($40)

remember.. the cases are used if you want a picture i can text or email one to you the only one that's got some scratches and wear is the pistol case as it's seen some action.

Been expanding my Swedish Mauser collection pretty fast recently (and I don't plan on stopping any time soon!) but I have this one I'd like to put up to have something different in the safe. It's a Swedish M96/38 C.G. made in 1900. All matching except for the rear barrel band and floorplate (which isn't numbered; just has the crown stamp). Has the Vasteras rear sight. The bore is shiny with good rifling. It'll need a taller front sight post for 100yd shooting, but I had it out the other day and just holding low I got a 1"" group with surplus 139gr M/41 ammo, bench rested. Have bayonet for it as well, bayo and scabbard match each other but not the rifle. Can include ammo to even up a trade as well.
