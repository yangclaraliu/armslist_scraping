I bought this weapon as a home defense gun, but my girlfriend was never really confortable with the AK platform so I switched to a different rifle. This is a Bulgarian made new production gun with a cold hammer forged barrel and factory side folding stock, nothing but the best. The 107CR has a gas block with integrated front sight, reducing the swing weight of the AK, making it quicker to target. It has a faux conical recoil booster that covers up the 16 inch barrel, but if you want to remove the booster I threaded the barrel to accept a muzzle device (standard AK threads). I changed the sights for meprolight tritium sights, they were installed a year ago so the tritium is very bright. The weapon has a Solar Tac MFER mag well, which helps speed reloads up considerably by propperly aligning your mags during changes. I changed out the pistol grip for a US palm grip, which helps you get better leverage on the gun than the standard AK grip to more easily manipulate the weapon. I also installed a Krebs custom safety lever, which has a bolt hold open notch and allows for one handed manipulation of the safety. The front forend was replaced with a Russian made grip, which has 1913 rails for adding a light. I worked very hard to keep the weight down, unloaded this rifle is only 7 and a half pounds, it has very little recoil in firing and is already set up to be the ultimate fighting Kalashnikov. This is the real deal, not some cheapo WASR with some Tapco crap bolted on to look cool, this gun will carry you through the Apocalypse.

If you would like, I also have a Russian made PK-A sight for sale that I will sell for 250$ in addition to the cost of the rifle. The gun will come with the original 5 round factory magazine, but if you need more mags with the gun let me know, I have a ton of AK mags of various types and I will cut you a deal on the mags of your choice."

This gun is in new condition. It was manufactured in 1968 (based on colts web site).
This is the aluminum frame model so it is very light for a 6 shot revolver.
If it has been fired it has not been shot more than a few times. 
Bluing is bright with no wear. I would guess it has never been in a holster. Grips are original to the gun and show no wear or staining.
I do not have the box or the paperwork. This gun is great for a colt collector but would also be a great carry gun.

Has Magpul foregrip, A2 front and flip-up rear sights, and a quick detatch sling mount. 

-One complete Delton upper assembly, Mil-Spec. Has had 300 to 400 rounds through it and has been very well cleaned and taken care of. The upper receiver is forged 7075 T6 aluminum, A3 type flat top. Receiver is hard coat anodized. Bore's surface is coated with dry film lube. Carbine length. The carrier assembly is phosphated 8620 steel with a Carpenter 158 type bolt.

I've always owned guns, just never been familiar with this platform. I had been considering buying an Ar for years, then the scare happened last year and I freaked out not knowing if I would ever be able to get one, so I set out looking to buy anything and everything Ar related. I bought all this stuff as a lot from a guy that works with my friend because I work a lot and I don't have time to go wait on stores to open so I can get ammo, mags, and guns. I knew I was probably paying too much, but given the circumstances, I bought this stuff anyways. I bought this lot of exactly as I'm selling it, except for putting approximately 200 rounds through the Delton using a friends lower and throwing in some ammo. I'm in over my head trying to pay for it with accumulating bills and Christmas approaching, so I'm selling in hopes that once I pay everything off, I can buy a complete rifle that I can afford."

ATN started by improving the optical configurations which lowered the F-stop factor and increased optical resolution. By doing this, more light travels through the lens to the tube. More light and better resolution simply means brighter and sharper image. Then ATN added their precision ""Red on Green"" aiming system, easy push button operation, reticle brightness adjustment and detachable most powerful in the industry 450 mW Infrared Illuminator with dedicated windage and elevation adjustments. The ATN MK 390 Paladin weapon sight is the best 1st Generation scope on the market. The ATN Aries MK 390 easily mounts onto any U.S. standard 7/8"" weaver or Picatinny rail.

I took a stock M&P 15/22 and upgraded it with Magpul furniture (ergo grip, stock, rounded fore-end grips, and B.A.D. lever).  For the optics, I used a Leupold Mark IV CQT (close quarters tactical) illuminated red dot scope in 1-3 x 14mm.  I added the Leupold 1-Piece Picatinny-Style Scope Base (ARMS) with throw levers in a matte finish so the optic can be installed and removed without losing your zero.  I know you're going to tell me that the Leupold is too much optic for this .22 rifle, and in truth, I originally purchased it for a standard AR.  For fun, I tried it on this rifle, and with the ""both eyes open"" design and 3 power magnification, it was perfect for 22lr.  I'm offering the rifle and Leupold (everything pictured) as a package for $1,100.00, or just the rifle for $550, or just the Leupold and ARMS base for $650.

Included with the rifle for $550 are three 25 round magazines, one Black Dog Machine 50 round drum, and an NC Star 3x9x42 scope without rings.

Most these days are missing various pieces, usually the rear sling mount or the folding portion of the sight.  This one is in better shape than others I have seen, but I haven't seen many.  This one still has a light honey color to the stock.  These were originally produced starting in 1891 and on through WW2.  This is Italian (Beretta) made, and this one I believe was made in 1940, and is still in the original caliber.  The Caliber is 6.5 x 52 (Carcano)  Ammo is still in production.  It uses a 6 shot En Block clip similar to a Mannlicher Clip.  I have one of these clips and maybe 1.5 boxes of ammo that I will throw in with.  Bore is in good shape and I was able to get about a 6"" group at 100 yards.  Some cleaning of the bore may improve that.  Using better ammunition would make a vast improvement also.  This is the Carbine model, and as far as I can tell is the original 38 design.  Carcano Rifles have a rich history, and is also the model rifle used in the Kennedy Assassination.

Has Tang safety and gold trigger. This is the 7mm WSM NOT the 7mm REM mag. This rifle is in excellent condition. In case you're wondering how I cam up with this price, well, here it is:

I took the MSRP for this rifle from Browning.com, which is $1029.99 (Here's the link: http://www.browning.com/products/catalog/firearms/itemdetails.asp?item=035012349&cid=035&tid=012), then I knocked off $100 because we all know that MSRP is always overpriced. After that, I took 25% off of the new price to get the used (but still in excellent condition) value, which comes to $697.49. The Simmons Aetec 3.8x12x44mm scope costs 159.99 on Midway. I dropped the price to $102.51 because I am cool like that. For the 2 20 round boxes of Fusion 150 grain ammo, those run $32.99 each on midway.com, but I'll discount it to $32.50. For the Bipod, I am asking the low, low price of $10, and I'll throw in the reloading dies, sling, and extra brass for free because I am such a nice guy. Here is the adjusted value:

Rifle = $697.49
Scope = 102.51
Ammo = $32.50 (2)
Bipod = $10
Reloading dies, sling, and brass = $0

Here is the formula:

$697.49 + $102.51 + 2($32.50) + $10 + $0 = $875"

 35% Shorter Stroke Trigger Bar for Ruger LC9
 SN 320-321 Trigger Bar and required Reduced Power Firing Pin Return Spring

 The much awaited LC9 and LC380, NOT LCP, trigger bar is here, no more machining your hammer and bar we do it all now with our custom trigger bar. This new drop in bar is the design the gun magazines, CCW school instructors and customers have asked for in addition to our wildly popular 50% short stroke trigger system upgrade to CUSTOMER SUPPLIED STOCK PARTS. This bar is ready to drop in no fitting required, we have eliminated the possibility of reset or disconnect issues that sometimes came with the old conversion when factory component tolerances stacked up on the high side. 
 -This bar WILL WORK WITH THE SHORT STROKE II trigger from RTK making for the most impressive setup out there.
 -This bar is not compatible with the RTK Slim trigger. 
 -The 35% bar allows the use of a reduced power hammer spring, add it to your trigger bar order below, includes the lighter firing pin return spring.
 -Drop in design, made of high alloy tool steel and heat treated for long life and rigid quality control from step one on.
 -Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%, add a Short Stroke II for even more reduction.
 -It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected.
 -After the early break it will stop about 10mm from the back and break about 14mm from the back, it will still reset only at the front like normal though. 

 Reduced Power Spring Kit for Ruger LC9
 These are the reduced power springs that have been asked for to help eliminate the stacking at the end of your LC9 trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring.

 Reduced Power Hammer Spring for Ruger LC9
 This spring will pull about 1.5 pounds out of your trigger pull weight and provide full ignition on standard primers."

 35% Shorter Stroke Trigger Bar for Ruger LC9
 SN 320-321 Trigger Bar and required Reduced Power Firing Pin Return Spring

 The much awaited LC9 and LC380, NOT LCP, trigger bar is here, no more machining your hammer and bar we do it all now with our custom trigger bar. This new drop in bar is the design the gun magazines, CCW school instructors and customers have asked for in addition to our wildly popular 50% short stroke trigger system upgrade to CUSTOMER SUPPLIED STOCK PARTS. This bar is ready to drop in no fitting required, we have eliminated the possibility of reset or disconnect issues that sometimes came with the old conversion when factory component tolerances stacked up on the high side. 
 -This bar WILL WORK WITH THE SHORT STROKE II trigger from RTK making for the most impressive setup out there.
 -This bar is not compatible with the RTK Slim trigger. 
 -The 35% bar allows the use of a reduced power hammer spring, add it to your trigger bar order below, includes the lighter firing pin return spring.
 -Drop in design, made of high alloy tool steel and heat treated for long life and rigid quality control from step one on.
 -Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%, add a Short Stroke II for even more reduction.
 -It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected.
 -After the early break it will stop about 10mm from the back and break about 14mm from the back, it will still reset only at the front like normal though. 

 Reduced Power Spring Kit for Ruger LC9
 These are the reduced power springs that have been asked for to help eliminate the stacking at the end of your LC9 trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring.

 Reduced Power Hammer Spring for Ruger LC9
 This spring will pull about 1.5 pounds out of your trigger pull weight and provide full ignition on standard primers."

In addition to the (2) that I'm keeping, I've got (2) left over. 

In my experiences with the drums they have treated me well. Took a couple full drums ran through my G19 to get the bugs worked out, but after a few times they seem to cycle pretty reliably. Occasionally I've had to pull and drop the slide, as it must have a little more resistance than the normal mags.

We paid $100 each in the craziness, I'll let these go for $75/each. Looks like there still at the $90 mark online, and these have never been used.

Sound too good to be true? Probably is. 

BE CAREFUL BUYING OPTICS SECOND HAND ON ARMSLIST, CRAIGSLIST AND EVEN AT GUN SHOWS!!!

There are very, very ""similar"" knockoffs of AIMPOINT, TRIJICON, and EOTECH that are BEING made by foreign companies. They look just like the similar thing, and you might not even be able to tell the difference holding them side by side. It's to the point where they are getting scarily close at reproducing the look and feel of a product. 

However, the quality of the functional components will always be off. Trijicon Acogs, for instance, will not have tritium in it and will not glow in the dark like the real ones. 

Buy from a reputable dealer, ask for a serial number before buying, bring your real one for comparison, etc. Do whatever it takes but, whatever you do, be very, very careful."
