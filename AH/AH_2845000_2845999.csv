I am in need of cash right now.. that is the only reason I am selling. My collection has been meticulously cared for and is in top condition. I store each rifle or pistol in a silicone impregnated woven cover that is imbedded with VCI before placing them in my safe. There are no handling marks on the weapons. No bump marks from them touching in the safe as is normally seen with many collectors. I am very careful when firing, cleaning and storing my weapons. (except for the AK which has lost much of the finish due to the low quality finish the factory used). The guns what are described as Like New are just that.. they are very difficult to tell from new. The M&P 15-22 MOE and Mossberg 590A1 have never been shot, they are BRAND NEW. The round counts are all accurate. The Ruger SR 556 is almost impossible to tell from new. There is no wear on the rifle... Everything is Like New or New Unfired unless described otherwise.

Lightly used and never abused Springfield Socom 16, american walnut stock, tritium front sight post, 4 factory 20 round magazines, 1 factory 10 round magazine, 1 factory 5 round magazine. Springfield 4th gen aluminium scope mount, factory cleaning kit, original springfield manual and M14 manual. It also has an aftermarket gas plug that for the life of me I cant remember the companies name. Claims to lighten the recoil, I didn't notice a difference. The original gas plus is included. Also about 100 rounds of american made ""tactical ammunition"", I think they're out of Utah. 

The stock has one or two blems, the worst of which i tried to photograph, but no gouges or cracks. I use my toys, and it gives this rifle charachter. No box. I think the price is fair, make me an offer if you think otherwise.

More information on these rounds.
Russian 7n1 sniper ammunition. With the development of the Dragunov sniper rifle, the Russians felt the need for something more accurate than mass-produced machine gun ammo. Their answer was the 7n1 round. This ammunition is match grade and produced in extremely limited quantities for military use only. It is the most accurate ammunition available for your PSL/Dragunov rifle. Not only was the round designed for hair-splitting accuracy, but it was also developed with steel core and a hollow spot in the nose of the bullet with a lead knocker behind it. This means that upon impact into a person that knocker moves forward into the hollow spot, destabilizing the bullet and causing it to tumble into the target creating massive injury.

http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinAmmo030.htm

This excellent quality ammunition was almost unknown in the United States and very expensive when found until April 2006 when a small quantity became available. Interestingly a significant amount is dated 1997 which is extremely recent for ""surplus"" ammunition. However, the 7N1 load was replaced in 1999 with the 7N14 load which has an armor piercing bullet and is also designed for sniper use. Other than the packaging this ammunition is indistinguishable from standard Soviet steel core light ball unless the bullet is sectioned to expose its unique structure. This ammunition was designed specifically for use in the SVD semi-auto sniper rifle but should perform well in any type of rifle chambered for 7.62x54r due to the close tolerances and high quality control exercised during its manufacture.

It is the aluminum frame, steel slide version. Very light for a full-size .45 at about 30.5 ounces unloaded. 

I bought this pistol in mid-2013, and it only has about 350 rounds through it. 

It has the Hogue, OD-green finger-groove grips, which are uber-comfortable. Sorry, the original, plastic factory grips are gone. Those are only about $25 straight from Sig if you want to go back to factory grips. The barrel is a brushed stainless. The finish wears off the barrels on Sigs pretty quick, so I took it down to a brushed stainless finish. It looks great. 

Included are the 2 original 8-round factory mags. In addition, there are two, factory, flush-fit 7-round mags, an extra factory 8-round mag and a factory 10-round mag. This is about an extra $150 worth of mags. 

Also comes with original Sig hard-case and manual. 

This thing is accurate and shoots like a dream. Zero malfunctions. It's a good one. I am only selling to fund some other gun projects. I will be sad to see it go.  

I also have about 350 rounds of quality, factory ammo in 230gr FMJ (Fiocchi, American Eagle, Remington UMC) if you are interested.

This is a very rare model 39 carbine made in 1964 of which less then 10000 were made. This rifle is described as the ""Cadillac"" of 22's and I agree. The rifle is functionally flawless however it does show some wear in the bluing. I have been fortunate enough to acquire 2 of these awesome rifles so I am going to pass the opportunity on to someone else. I am only interested in cash unless the trade greatly benefits me. In other words if the trade is less than $1000 I am not interested. May consider trade for a chrome or titanium desert eagle mk 19

If you think the price is out of line then shoot me an offer and we can negotiate. Worst 1'll say is no."

Gun comes with Hard case and all paperwork that was originally purchased with the weapon. And as previously mentioned I have never put a round through it, however the test fire casings are included a small envelope as well as a warranty card. 

This was intended to be my EDC however it is a bit too bulky for my frame and ended up riding in my vehicle holster rather than on my person."

It is about as loaded as you can get, with the built in tactical light, eotech 512, and hinge pin qd sling adapter. I thought I would never even think about getting rid of this rifle. I have only shot MAYBE 200 rounds through it. It has been very well taken care of. I color filled the vector logos (as seen in the second picture, the first pic was before I color filled it). It comes with 2 13 round mags and one kriss 27 round mag. I am only considering selling to pay for the motor I just had to buy for my truck.  I am not looking for any gun trades, as the vector is at the top of my list of ""dream guns"", and I am extra firm on my price.  I have the price set at $1900, which is about $400 less than I paid for it less than 6 months ago.  The only trade I may consider is for a newer fuel injected sportbike like a gsxr or cbr or r1, etc in the $2500 value range."

 - Phase 5 Slant Nosed fore end on 7.5"" Barrel with SB-15 Brace = $1,250

 These are being built on PHNX-52 receiver sets. The PHNX-52 lower receiver is an enhanced lower receiver with an integrated oversized all seasons trigger guard, a slight beveled mag well for faster reloads, 3M Pictograph on BOTH sides, and a Bolt Catch screw not a pin. The upper receiver is a Gen 2 Upper with a beefier look and feel to them that compliment the enhanced lower.

 Custom Builds are accepted and usually can be completed within 30 days unless custom finishes are included in the request then add another 30 days but we aim to surprise you and be faster if we can.

 AR-15 Pistols.... WHY would you deal with the hassle of NFA paper work and get a SBR ever again! The AR-15 Pistol is a great platform to run and have fun with and the recent ATF Determination Letters about Shoulder firing an AR-15 Pistol seals the fate of this great item. Why deal with the hassle of registering your SBR everytime you move, if you want to travel out of State on short notice and want to take your SBR - it wont happen, and why wait the length of time to get a response & tax stamp required in order to even purchase a SBR?

 SOoo I have become a fan of the AR-15 Pistol platform and what it now offers.

 We also build Competition Ready rifles with precision 18"" Hvy SS Fluted Barrels and...
 a Designated Marksmen Rifle with a precision 18"" barrel as well.

Here it is gents. A hi point c9- this is not just any regular, run of the mill 9 mm pistol- This is ""The"" Cadillac of shit guns.... Now don't let that discourage you from owning this fine piece of weaponry. 
I have personally shot one box of the finest steel cased dirty-garbage junk ammo that the Russians could ever produce though it- in rapid fire, tack tack as well as single round placement shots and it ate all of it w ithout a single hiccup. 
Not only did it eat it like Rosie O'Donnell eating cake out of Ellens underwear but it actually held a consistent group while doing so.
 To be honest I was rather surprised by the accuracy as well as reliability. 
Dont let the ugly pot metal slide and poorly ergoed plastic frame fool you- see that rear sight??? That's a peep sight my friends- snipers use peep sights..... 
Why would someone put a peep sight on a hi point you ask?? Well, I don't know- maybe to compliment the sheer badassery of this piece of state of the art American iron, or maybe this was owned by Vasily Zaytsev himself.... I honestly don't know, but it infact does have a peep sight. 
I won this firearm in an armwrestling match. 
It belonged to the manager of the ford road trailer park..Just so you know-Not just anybody be can be the manager of this trailer park-
 Well, I kicked his ass... Broke his arm in 36 places, he then asked me to be his son. 
If you've never heard of the ford road trailer park, it is where chlamydia was introduced to north central Ohio.
 I had to get a tattoo of my favorite nascar driver with a guitar string jailhouse gun sterilized in four loko before they would allow me to claim my first place- arm wrestling prize ( said hi point 9mm)
 Picture camaros with duct taped t tops, kids with 4 day old kool aid mustaches lighting things on fire, pregnant 13 year olds, pool tables in the front yard, stripper poles in the beds of pick up trucks etc. That my friends would be the ford rd trailer community.
If your interested in being the next owner of this firearm and the legacy that comes with it you can call or text me at REDACTED. The price is $125 and it's firm.

Most items were purchased new ranging from 3 to 5 years ago, the few older items are notated as older.

Everything is in either great, excellent, or new conditions.  None of these items were used much and what was used was well taken care of.  Some items (including parts of die sets) were never used.  There is nothing wrong with any of this equipment, I am selling because I no longer have the availability to reload.

I have the original paperwork (instructions/owner's manual) for all items if they came with them when purchased.

List of items available for sale:

RCBS Rock Chucker Supreme press

RCBS Pocket Sager Combo

Scale & shell holder set not shown in pictures, but they are all there and excellent condition.

Referencing Cabelas, the RCBS set that I originally purchased retails for $350 (press, scale, primer tool, & some misc items).  The trimmer retails for $115.  The die sets retail for $34-$40 each.  When you add in the bullet puller, caliper, shell holders and other items, this set-up would retail at over $850 plus tax.  Even if you could find it all on sale, it would still be over $700 plus tax.

Please:  Cash only.  I will not break up the lot at this time.  Price is firm.  Call or text 612-three nine zero-6 three 2 zero, or email me through the armslist link.

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
 Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
 The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.
