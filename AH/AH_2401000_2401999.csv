Again - this rifle is in near new condition - and fire flawlessly. The ONLY reason I am selling it is because I am transferring to UC Irvine and I need money for school and moving out. I have taken ideal, pristine care of this rifle, as if has only been used once at the range. Save money, buy a rifle that is of the same quality as a new one - and purchase a colt, the closest to military specs a civilian can get with a base model AR15.

Hi,

I would like to sell both of these rifles (or trade them). I've tried to research the values and it's all over the board so I am going to post them for what I think is a fair price.

1) Winchester 1890 (Model 90-22 w.r.f.) pump (or slide action). From the serial number it appears to have been made in 1918 (serial #838XXX). It has a 23.5"" octagon barrel and may be a ""take down"" model but I'm not sure. Don't want to start unscrewing things to find out. It is in good condition with obvious bluing issues due to it's age. All wood appears original and I see no cracks or defects. $650.00

2) Remington Model 14-R .30 caliber pump. Not sure when it was made (serial # 743XX). Last date listed on the barrel is 1913 if that means anything. In good condition with signs of wear due to it's age. All wood appears original and no cracks that I can find. I actually hunted with this rifle when I was a kid (1970's) and it was old then! $450.00

Sorry the photo is not better, but if you are interested I can text better pics if you want a close up of one or both. Call or text me at REDACTED.

Thanks,

PS... In no hurry to sell so please do not make a really low offer or ask to trade for something that is junk."

This revolver is called a 'Colt New Pocket' and was made between 1893-1905. I am unable to ascertain whether this caliber is 32LC or 32S&W long.
I haven't fired this gun but it seems to function properly, although you may want to check with a gunsmith to make sure that it is safe to fire since it is over 100 years old.

I have 2 of the same revolvers listed on the site.

I is in like new condition, and I was the first to fire it after it was manufactured behind the iron curtain, at the start of the cold war.  It is a fantastic gun chambered in 7.62x25 Tokarev, I plan on keeping it unless I can trade it + some cash for a gun on my watch list.  If I don't run across a good trade or enough cash to buy a gun I'm looking for I will be happy to keep it. :) It has 4 33rd magazines, a TROY sling and 500rds of brass cased 7.62x25 Tokarev which sell for 50 cents per round.  If you are looking to buy it with cash, I will entertain offers, but I love this thing.  It is one of my favorite guns to shoot.

This gun has a serious history starting with the siege of Leningrad in WWII and the Red Army's need for a lighter, shorter, and easier to manufacture SMG for its special troops (Tankers, Airborne and Recon).  This was the final design, replacing the famous PPSH-41 and first saw action in Leningrad, during the siege, where it was originally designed and manufactured and became a favorite of the troops of the Soviet Arny during the march to Berlin.  It hung famously from the backs of Russian soldiers raising their flag over the Riechstag and was proven reliable again and again, in many conflicts to come.  

This particular gun was made in Poland in the early 50's, after the war and was converted to semi-automatic and imported into the U.S.as a pistol. The folding stock is fixed in the closed position, but after proper licensing can be easily converted to full functionality."

These are pretty easy to finish, you can do it with a Dremel but a drill press is recommended.  Use a #115 Dremel bit or 3/8"" or smaller end mill bit to route out the center section, then drill the hammer/trigger pin holes, the selector hole and the trigger hole to finish your receiver.

Instructions are available online along with numerous youtube videos for additional support.  If you go slow and steady it's almost impossible to not finish with a working receiver.  These are going for $65 plus $10 shipping from the manufacturer, I'd like the same or trade.

The only issue since new is it has a tiny dust spot on the inside of the lense Only at 1.5 power, size of a pen dot. It is at the VERY EDGE of the glass and again ONLY at 1.5 power. It doesn't show in your field of view unless you look for it at the edge. It never bothered me so I didn't send it to Burris. Burris will clean the dust spot off for free if you want and I have the return form to do it. However, I just never seen the need since it's only at 1.5 power and on the edge. It has a no questions asked Lifetime Warranty. It is in great condition and this is NOT a cheap scope. It sold at $400 new.

This weapon is like new with less than 500rds down the pipe. I purchased it less than 11 months ago and kept it in great shape. I have everything that came in the box and the original receipt to prove the purchase date/warranty. The only reason I'm selling it is because I need extra money for Christmas gifts and a upcoming vacation. Also, unlike some of these other adds on Armlist I believe I'm asking for a reasonable price, so please don't low ball me or try to trade me a tractor or something.

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.
