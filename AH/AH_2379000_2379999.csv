Has matching numbers. Finish is really excellent plus, except for a very few minor scratches and handling marks. Internals are like new. This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. Gun has a new Ironwood Design/made buttstock (like new/mint, cost around $100), and has U.S. made wood handguards. Sorry, I don’t have the factory thumbhole stock. I traded the gun with a regular stock that way. Also comes with a sling. Upper handguard latch tip is broken. But the latch itself is still functional. Imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90′s. Sorry about the pictures. Not really that good. I used my camera phone, and it doesn’t really take good pictures. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. You must be at least 18 years old or older to buy this gun. Local sale only. Kentucky residents with proper ID only. Thanks for looking.

 - $800 cash firm (more on trade, originally priced at $1,100), or trade/s -

 * No lowballers and tirekickers please. This gun is worth what I'm asking for. I have at least $1,000 on the gun alone *

 * This is a repost. Previous buyer changed his mind in the last minute. Sale fell through *

 Gun comes with:

 3-30rd mags, all new (1-Polish, 2-Tapcos)
 2-30rd mags (Chinese), used but in very good condition
 1-20rd Hungarian, like new
 1-sling
 100 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (not pictured)
 1-Polymer/plastic pistol grip, like new
- I'll throw in extra parts (pictured) to make the gun like a AKM-63. Which includes an extended muzzle brake. You can do a google search on Hungarian AKM-63, there are several websites and info on that particular model on line. The extra parts alone cost around $75-$100 -

* Package deal. Will not separate mags and ammo *

*** Update: I received several emails/responses, offers which I really appreciated. Some are bad, and some are good. But please don't email me and insult me by offering a lesser value gun/s as trade even to my gun, or lowball me. Don't want to be rude, but it's a waste of time ***

**** Want to trade to one of the guns listed below only. Your gun plus boot my way if you have a lesser value gun. I will not, I'll repeat, I will not going to do an even trade with your Kel-Tec 9mm pistols, Taurus pistols, or Rock Island 1911s ****"

If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action restrike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on restrike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

Love this upper and don't want to let it go. It's been a safe queen for three years and I need the money.

Just pull the pins on your old upper, swap it with the Stealth, and begin shooting one ragged hole.  Answering the demands of today's precision AR-Shooter, we designed the Stealth Sniper System with ¾"" 100-yard shot groups in mind. Exceeding our expectations, the Stealth has earned a great reputation for it's sub-MOA accuracy, with reports of consistent hits on 4"" plates out to 400 yards with 77 grain Mk262 ammunition.  Assembled using our CNC-machined Stealth Billet Upper (LT-007) as the backbone, complete Stealth Uppers are available in 12"", 16"", 18"" & 20"" barrel-lengths with the LT handguard length of your choice. Complete Stealth Uppers come expertly-assembled and tested with Receiver, Free-float Handguard, Barrel, Low-Profile Gasblock and Tube, Mil-Contract M16 Bolt Carrier Group and Charging Handle. Recommended barrel length / handguard lengths: 20"" Barrel: 13.2"" & 12.0"" Handguards

Upper Receiver: The LaRue Stealth receiver is an improved-version of the currently fielded mil-spec flat-top receiver. Machined from billet 7075-T6, the Stealth is designed with more of material in critical areas to alleviate past issues of weakness and to stiffen the receiver, maximizing the weapons overall accuracy. Barrels: LaRue Stealth Barrels are Stainless Steel, Wylde-chambered in 5.56mm, 1-in-8 twist polygonal rifling in medium-weight contour.  Free-Float Integrated Rail System: CNC-machined out of aluminum, LT handguards are available in 7.0"", 9.0"", 10.0"", 11.0"", 12.0"", and 13.2"" lengths. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once the rail is properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. Everything locks into place rock-solid. This is vital when utilizing lasers, optics and other hardware. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. Special cuts on each rail's end are designed to work with both mil-issue and standard rail covers. LaRue handguards also include a QD sling-swivel socket integrally-mounted at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures. M16 Bolt-Carrier Group: Assembled to TexasSpecTM our Bolt Carrier Groups use the same mil-spec hardware used military-wide. Additionally, LT assembly enhancements greatly minimize bolt-related failures. Mil-spec gas-key contact areas are precision surface-ground flat for zero gas leakage and then max-staked to eliminate all chances of vibration-induced failures.  Assembly and Testing:  Every LT Stealth Sniper System is precision-assembled and as part of the QA procedure, goes through a final 10-round live-fire function test before being tube-packaged."

I am one of those, not mark everything up kind of people. This price is extremely fair considering I have seen the same firearm on here, without the upgrades, and they are asking $300 -$500 more.  I bought this firearm in August for $849.00, I have $200 in upgrades in it, not including the brand new $170 Vortex.  So with 20 rounds down the pipe, $700 (with upgraded furniture) or $900 with Vortex is very fair asking price."

a perfect condition vintage Browning firearm is a same as New and Unfired
Browning BDA 380. which is chambered in .380acp.  Manufactured in 1979 by
Beretta for Browning Arms Company who imported and sold the pistols within
the U.S.A.

First produced in 1977 and discontinued in 1997. Resurrected I believe
in 2000 and produced possibly through 2009 with most being in a bright
nickel finish. The newest production years is only a guess and based on
the fact I have owned several with two that had serial number date codes
of 2000 and 2009.

This BDA .380's bright blued finish is virtually flawless and looks as
new as the day it was manufactured. Note the Browning ""B"" Medallion on
the wood grips which was commonly used up through 1985 and then
discontinued and replaced by the well known ""Buckmark"" logo. The pistol
comes in the original Styrofoam box with factory outer box and has its
original 13 round magazine along with a factory supplied bore brush (Not
seen in photos and located in a cavity on backside of Styrofoam box) as
well as the owners manual.

If you are a collector of Browning firearms and wish to have a pristine
addition to your stable, I believe you would be hard pressed to find a
superior specimen.

Armslist is limited on the number of photos that can be displayed.  I will gladly send additional pics if requested.

Asking $825.00, cash only transaction - NO TRADES AT THIS TIME.

Here is a recent auction sale - http://www.gunauction.com/buy/12247717

Private party sale, no sales tax or transfer fee.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

It is used, but well taken care of, cleaned regularly.
If you don't agree with the price, I don't care. Look elsewhere.
Don't text or call me asking 50 technical questions because I probably won't know the answers. I'm not a gun expert. 
What I do know is this is an AK-47, chambered for 7.62x39, 
*has quad rail, 
*foregrip,
*one telescoping stock, one side folder stock, 
*nice scope, 
*four 30 round clips, 
*hard case, 
*and about 1,000 rounds of TulAmmo. 
Cheaper ammo but does the job. Never jams. Nice gun. I'm not broke so don't low ball me. Only thing I MIGHT trade for is a decent mpg vehicle because I commute or Saiga 12 with accessories, or a couple/few other firearms. No trash, please.

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Christmas is getting close. Transforming your loved ones gun into a custom creation they have always wanted would be a great gift. 

I offer quick turn around time (as long as it does not compromise quality) so two houra after I heat cure it I can reassemble it. 5 days after that you are ready to fire it. Other products takes 6 weeks to fully cure and have less than a quarter of the durability. 

I painted high end cars for ten years before getting into this. Some people think you can go get a $30 paint gun and go at it. Cerakote is very particular on how it is prepared for paint. It takes specialized equipment to make the final product be perfect. I have all that and have tons of references to back up my skillset. I even offer a money back guarantee on a problem I cannot repair.

The SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, meaning it can be calibrated to cycle either semi-automatically or through pump-action. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button under the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forward. This is one has a 1987 date code. These guns are pretty rare and hard to find, only 1,850 were imported. 

I have placed Talon grips on the fore grip to help when in pump mode, it can easily be removed."

I painted high end cars at a very high end body shop for 10 years before I got into cerakoting firearms. Cars are much easier. Many people think you can buy a 30 dollar paint gun and sand the gun and paint it. Not even close. Cerakote takes very specialized equipment to get that one of a kind finish it provides. Ive spent thousands upon thousands on the newest and best equipment on the market. 

Cerakote, when provided properly, provides an almost indestructible finish while maintaining  a beautiful finish in which there are over 150 colors to choose from. 

I can do any type of pattern such as skulls, snakeskin, carbon fiber and even your own custom logo or pattern. If you can dream it we can achieve it. 

Im not trying to get rich off this. It is more of a passion for me than a job. Once it becomes a job its no fun. So I offer the most competitive prices around and guarantee satisfaction. Email or text me day or night for a  price quote. Be detailed in the descriptions of what color or colors you want and if you want patterns. If you are not sure I will be glad to help you work your way through that process.

Yugo type M59/66 Millitary variant SKS in Tapco furniture with all original furniture included (no box mag), as well as a 40 round promag and 20 round tapco mag.

Breakdown is simple and well maintained this rifle will long outlive you. Chanbered in 7.62x39 it is not only a threat stopper, as well as a hunter, but is cheap to shoot. Throw on a muzzle brake and a bumpfire stock, and this rifle will fire at full auto speeds without issue.  Thie yugo's are by far considered to be the most robust of the sks variants, and are the only ones that come stock with a threaded barrel, and gas system shut off valve.  After-market parts are absolutely plentiful and will allow you to build this rifle to suit ANY purpose (you can even get a bullpup stock for it!).

From the Northwoods to the Texas hill country and in every deer camp and lodge in between, the .30-30 rifle remains the perennial choice of whitetail hunters. More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it's a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America's most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. 

Like every Henry rifle, it's 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing.

I have had no issues with this rifle, shoots accurately (assuming most inaccuracy is related to me).  Ammunition is cheap and readily available.

I am trying to avoid shipping this rifle, so local purchases would be ideal.  If it were to ship freight and transfer is paid by purchaser and it will ship to an FFL dealer. You must have state/government issued ID preferably a NJ license or Passport.  You also must have the required NJ firearms ID card.  No sale will be made with out any of these items, I will have all necessary transfer paper.
