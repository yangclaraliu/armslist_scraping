Additional Details:
I purchased the gun ~2.5 years ago, since then I would estimate 1k rounds through it. After half a year, I replace the original magazines with chip mccormick magazines. Gun was used when I purchased it previously as ""like new in box"". I purchased it from the LGS that sold and then reacquired it from the original buyer. I do not know exactly how many rounds that original owner fired with it but it was 'very lightly used'."

Manufacture Description:

TAVOR Assault Rifles

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

    Bull pup configuration.
    Optimized ergonomic design.
    30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
    Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
    Detachable barrel.
    Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
    Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
    100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
    Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
    Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
    Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
    Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
    100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
    Equipped with a  last round stopper.
    All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
    Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing. 

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability."

This Hornady Custom pistol ammo is loaded with the famous Hornady XTP
(Extreme Terminal Performance) bullet. All are supremely accurate, and
deliver maximum knockdown power. Hornady produces most of the brass for
Hornady Custom pistol ammo. All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets
our unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance,
proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.
Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and
consistency from lot to lot. Like the powder, each primer is carefully
matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to
quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge.

This is a perfect first gun starter kit! Gun has very slight holster wear on the slide but otherwise is perfect. I've had the gun since 2005 and never had a single malfunction, it has been my concealed carry weapon. I just bought a P30 in 9mm so all of this stuff is unnecessary for me now, but it is a fantastic gun.

I don't know exactly what variant it is, but it is DA/SA, no safety, and has a de-cocker.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Vet- Made is owned and operated by Veterans in a small town outside of Nashville Tennessee. Vet-made ammunition was initially started to create jobs for local Veterans in need of work, but progressed into a major local manufacturer after quickly building a reputation in the firearms community as a reliable source for ammunition. Each round is hand inspected before packaging to ensure every box of every case contains nothing but the highest quality of ammunition.

Take part in supporting these Veterans by purchasing their quality ammo. The price may not always be the lowest out there, but quality is an endless price tag and your supporting a Veteran owned company thus supporting Veterans and this country.

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Rifle has a low round count and is in excellent condition. The 6.8 round can fit into regular ar mags but due to it being a wider round it can only fit around 15 before the mag starts to bulge. The spc was developed by the military for special forces who needed more knock down power than a 5.56 but less than a 7.62. The round is excellent and the only down fall of it is that it's only been around for 10 years so the rounds aren't as cheap as a 5.56 but then again it's in mine and most others opinion a much better round! If u have any questions about it just let me know and I'll try to answer them the best I can?

 CZ USA 455 American Bolt-Action .22lr Rifle, 22.5″ Barrel, Walnut Stock, Detachable Magazine, No Sights- CZ 02110

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

Ruger’s newest addition, the SR45 pistol is perfectly sized to be comfortable and controllable with slim, ergonomic grips and narrow slide. A short reach from the backstrap to the trigger creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. It’s structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and stainless steel slide combine to create low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handgun. A unique reversible backstrap (flat or arched) allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools. High-visibility 3-dot night sight system features a raked-forward front sight for easy removal from the holster. Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. Integral Picatinny rail for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. The SR45 is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. This is a great home defense or concealed carry gun and it is California approved.

I just bought this last week and it is essentially new, only put 80 rounds through it. Has great sights, zero recoil and would make a great plinking/recreational gun, home defense gun, and even an interesting hunting carbine, with Kansas' recent change in hunting laws you can even hunt deer with this, power is comparable to a .41 magnum coming out of the 16in barrel. 

Say what you will about the Hi Point handguns but the carbines are almost universally well reviewed and considered to be very reliable. Will come with its box and all the factory stuff, papers, lock, tools, folding foregrip, and two ten round magazines.

I love it and hate to see it go, but I'm needing something small for summer carry, I love my Beretta 92 but its too big to carry all the time. I'm wanting to trade for a pocket sized or subcompact handgun, I have a strong preference for .40, but will consider other guns in 9mm, would also consider a .38 special snub revolver. 
I have cash that I can add for the right deal.
Dont really want to sell it, but if you arent interested in trading I will sell for $300.

These awesome carry guns feature a short 2.75″ barrel, sub-one pound weight with a loaded mag, and 6-round magazine plus one in the chamber, making this one extremely useful carry gun.



 I only have TWO in stock, and they are priced to sell quickly for only $639.00 each (cash price).



Colt Mustang PocketLite .380 acp Pistol, Stainless Steel Finish, Black Grips, 2.75″ Barrel, 6-Round Magazine, Colt O6891

The Colt O6891 Mustang Pocketlite Pistol in .380 ACP features a 2.75-inch barrel, stainless steel finish, electroless nickel alloy frame, black composite grips, front ramp sight, rear dovetailed sight, single action trigger, an overall length of 5.5 inches, an unloaded weight of 12.5 oz, and a 6+1 round capacity.

The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite is small, lightweight and boasts enhanced durability, reliability and accuracy, making it an ideal handgun for personal protection.
The precise machining process, use of high quality materials and improvements in design make Colt’s new .380 Mustang Pocketlite one of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the market. The aluminum alloy receiver, stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. “Machining solid stock is certainly a more involved manufacturing process,” said Joyce Rubino, Vice President of Marketing, Colt’s Manufacturing Company, “But it is that process, combined with our engineering specifications, expertise and demand for perfection that allows Colt to deliver one of the highest quality products available to today’s marketplace.”

With a loaded magazine, this handgun weighs less than one pound. It measures 5.5 inches long and has a 2.75-inch barrel. The minimal weight and length of the gun, combined with the short single action trigger, grip design, frame design and firing pin safety block, make this firearm ideal for personal protection.

The magazine holds six rounds. Improvements in powder and bullet design have increased the velocity and terminal performance of .380 caliber ammunition, adding to the viability of the Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite for personal defense.

“Accuracy and reliability was a top priority as we looked at what improvements could be made to make this classic backup even better,” said Rubino, “Though the changes may seem subtle to the untrained eye, every Colt employee takes great pride in knowing that their dedication has helped bring a vastly improved and enhanced firearm to market.”

The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite descends from a famed line of pistols, including Colt’s Government Model, and improves upon the best that each had to offer.
