I have a Mosin Nagant I am looking to sell.  It comes with sling, dual oil/solvent bottle, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, multitool, pouch for the kit, twin ammo pouch, and bayonet 

I have a rubber buttstock add on that will go with it as well (shown in picture).  I will remount the original before selling.  And 8 stripper clips + 40 rounds of 7.62x54r, which is enough to fill the ammo pouches.

I'm not a huge surplus guy, but if you have questions let me know and I will try to look them up.  Manufacturers date is 1943, so it is a WWII model, and while the manufacturers hallmark is kind of faint, I believe it is a Izhevsk model.  I don't know how they rate these surplus guns, but my personal rating would be good, its not pristine, but looks decent enough and shoots well enough that I was happy with it the way it was.

I've gone through the tedious process of getting all the cosmoline (or what ever the russians call theirs) off of the rifle, to include the chamber, so it doesn't get sticky after a few rounds.

I've taken this out shooting probably three times, shoots well enough with iron sights, but I cheated on my other Mosin and have mounted a scout scope so I can see out a bit farther.  They shot roughly the same before the scope, but I think I am more consistent with the scope on the other one now.  So this one is a bit of a duplicate for me.

I not much interested in a trade, but I might consider trading this Mosin Nagant for a Hex Receiver model, or a Russian Carbine model, since that would allow me to have a iron sight mosin that wasn't such a clone of what I already have.

Based on my read of the new law, this falls in the category of old enough to not have to bother with the mandatory background checks.  If you believe differently, please include the text of the bill that passed the legislature and highlight the relevant portion.  Sale would be face to face with Colorado ID, in Monument, or far north end of Colorado springs.  Preference to LEO or Colorado Conceal carry holders."

This gun has been very well kept.  There are a few minor scratches on the stock.  All metal is in great shape and has always been well cleaned / oiled.  The pump action is smooth and cycles like new.  It gives a nice shot that let's you know you just did something great, but doesn't throw you across the woods just to prove it.

I am wanting a direct sale for cash, but can accept PayPal, if you are willing to let things clear before finalizing the deal.  I am also open to a partial trade for a semi-auto shot gun.

While I might not agree with all of it, we have to do this by the book.  Buyer pays for the transfer...should be around $20.  If we do a trade, each person pays for their own transfer.

The slide is Parkerized, not blued. This is a P1, not a P38. The frame is ""Duralumin"" or Aluminum Alloy.

The gun is in nice shape and has been cleaned regularly. It was originally purchased to get my son into trap shooting.

From Win AA's to the cheapest out there, no issue with FF or ejections.

It was manufactured by High Standard. I got this in a trade and while it is perfect in every way, I just got an ak and am about to get a 45 so I won't be needing it and thought it would be good to let someone else enjoy it.

For an affordable revolver I was very amazed with the double action trigger pull and with 9 shots it makes for a great range gun. Since getting it I have put about 300 rounds through it without a hiccup. Two were recently sold on various websites, one for $300+fees on guns america and another for $275+fees on gun broker; both had more wear than this one does.

Although it is worth more than I am asking, I am willing to come down on price to a point.  Asking $275obo or trade. I will include the subsonic hollow points and leather shoulder holster if I get my asking price.

A little history... this was originally a single shot rifle that shot a black powder 10.4 mm cartridge. A repeater magazine was added in 1887, but these were replaced by the M91 Carcano in the 1890's. In World War I, there was a shortage of rifles, so the Vetterli-Vitali's were sleeved to shoot the 6.5 mm Carcano round, and were given to reserve and home guard troops. This rifle looks to have had the stock refinished, but some of the cartouche is barely visible. I have not fired this rifle. It is from the Torri Annuziata arsenal and is dated 1889, making it an antique. I will include 50 rounds of 6.5 Carcano ammo. $325 OBO."

Regardless, this is a sweet rifle and I was intending to get a muzzle break and a nice optic for it but my gun collection is lacking in the handgun department so I was looking to sell or trade this rifle. It is 100% new in the box, nothing was opened or touched since it left the gun store.

Its basically a savage model 11 heavy barreled action with a 1-9"" twist 20"" threaded heavy barrel with high iron sights to see over your scope bases and suppressor/barrel device. It has an internal magazine, large bolt handle, accu trigger, and a thread protector to protect the 1/2x28 threaded barrel. Takes standard 1/2x28 muzzle devices just like an AR15.

When I bought this rifle I wanted it in .308 which was on sale for 399 but they only had it in .223. The .223 version was not on sale, so I paid 469 plus tax for it, so keep that in mind with trade offers.

Keep it local. I don't want to drive across the state."

Condition:  The Holster is in excellent shape marked 42 w /eagle and S**stika, clean tight stitching. No krazing of the leather...very clean!  The pistol is fully functioning with a bright clean bore and only showing finish wear on the back/front strap and on the leading edge of the slide from holster wear rated 75%-80%.  Both magazines have strong springs with one looking to have very little use at all.  I believe this is an early wartime production pistol not pre / post war.  SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY"

For sale is an AR 15 upper assembly from Palmetto State Armory.  It’s in like new condition, with under 50 rounds being fired through it.  The barrel is 16” long, chrome lined, and it has a 1/7 twist.  It’s in pristine condition, absolutely no stories.  It’s for sale, because I have a ton of AR 15 equipment. I’ve decided to sell a few things that I really haven’t used much.  It was purchased in November 2013, and has always been stored within a safe.
 
The price is $250.  This is for pick-up only.  I’m not open to trades.  Please serious inquires only.  If it’s posted, it’s still for sale (no need to ask if I still have it).

From Glock:
The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

Milled from a solid block of 4140 steel, milled receiver includes a rear trunnion as well as pre-drilled holes for the axis pins and the selector switch. 

The barrels are manufactured by O.F. Mossberg & Sons, better known as Mossberg. Barrel comes with a pre-drilled hole for the gas port as well as pre-cut notches for the handguard. 

The AK-47 milled receiver and barrel is ""in the white,"" meaning that they have yet to be finished with any sort of treatment for resistance to corrosion, pitting or wear. This allows you to finish your receiver and barrel in any manner you want, whether it be bluing, parkerizing, Molykoting® or anything else you deem fit.

Because the receiver and barrel has been handled with hands there are brown spots due to the oils on your hands, its not rust. (its in the white) Its been inside a box in the back of a safe all its life.

This is what your build could look like:

For sale I have my BNIB, never fired Taurus PT709 slim. Comes with 1 mag. Still have the plastic it was wrapped in in the box even, and factory case and the little key thing to take it apart. Nice little gun, great trigger pull, slide goes back easy (unlike the Kel tecs). Perfect for concealed carry. Id suggest googling and seeing all the positive reviews this gun gets.

Im not by ANY means desperate to move this, so if i dont get the right offer, or get lowball offers, they will be ignored. Not trying to be a jerk, but im not trading a $300 + gun brand new for a $150 scope, a $200 flashlight, or set of used tires. Lets be reasonable please

avoid the IL tax, FFL fees, shipping costs, etc for the $300
