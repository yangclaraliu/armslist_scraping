MICRO-COMPACT PISTOL w/3-DOT ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.
A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Slide finish: Stainless Steel
Frame: Black polymer
Capacity: 6+1 Rounds
Weight: 11 Ounces

These were made in the states and then exported to South America during the 1930's and then imported back into the country for resale.

This particular model is a great shooter and has had all the internal parts replaced with Wilson Combat parts.  The trigger and barrel are still original and this has had trigger work done by a local gun smith and has a 3.5 lb trigger pull.  

It will come as shown in the photos with the Colt grip installed and will also come with original parts as well.

This is the original finish as you can tell by the photos the finish is worn off but rest assured that it shoots great and will last.

It's perfect for concealed carry.  It has a small frame but packs a big wallop with 10+1 rounds of .45 ACP.  Nothing beats it for size/firepower: not the mini-Glock, not Kahr, not Kimber Ultra or the little Springfields.  How they get 11 rounds into that little space is amazing, and the grip doesn't feel fat or unwieldy.  It has less felt recoil than any gun in its class (in my limited testing), including several other .45's and the 9mm and .40 cal versions of this same gun.

This model has the loaded chamber indicator, a visual check that you're 'hot', and a 1911 style thumb safety.  It has the smoothed stainless steel slide, so nothing will hang up when drawing it from concealment.  The dull anti-reflective matt finish of the stainless and the flat top of the slide assure a glare free sight picture.  It features the 2-dot straight 8 sights for quick target acquisition and the built-in rail for hanging accessories.  Stick a little railmaster laser on that rail and you'll get on target even quicker. 

This gun has a very low round count, less than 200.  It comes with the original hard case, magazine loader, two safety lock keys and the original manual and paperwork.

The gun is like new.  My price is fair.  I'm not a dealer. I don't charge delivery, tax or FFL fees {if we meet face to face}, and I don't fill out the BATFE sheet and call it in on you.  My preference is a face to face meeting, but if you need it shipped, we can discuss it.

I'm not interested in trades or lowball offers.   If you're reading this, the gun is for sale;  I will deactivate this listing immediately when the gun is no longer available.

PLEASE

Read this listing carefully.  I will not respond to inquiries like "" Do you still have this gun?"" or ""what's the round count?"" or  ""I can buy this gun from XXXX for $XXX"".  If you consider everything and find a better deal all the way around, take it; This is a great little pistol."

This is my prized possession but i need to part ways with it. I have owned 2 PSLs and this one is in close to factory condition. I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

This is my prized possession but i need to part ways with it. I have owned 2 PSLs and this one is in close to factory condition. I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

(I've seen them called enhanced, embellished, and premier) This gun is amazing for an 870. Claro walnut stock, engraved receiver ( I've read that they were cut engravings, not rolled) gold trigger. As I understand it these were available one year only to Remington Premier dealers and most of the guns ordered were in 12 gauge. I bought this gun from someone that inherited it. It was only displayed, there has never been a shell across the feed ramp. I unfortunately don't have a box and paperwork for it. Shoots 2 /34 and 3"" shells. You won't find one nicer and the wood grain is unbelievable for an 870. Truly a special gun. 
You know how 870 collectors are, and this gun has a lot of collectible potential. I believe these were made in late 07- mid 08. Here's a link with some info, just copy and paste it into your browser window.

220,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2177220,For Sale:  Model 1917 Eddystone .30-06,"Bellingham, Washington, United States",$ 650,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 2, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a really nice Model 1917 made by Eddystone. Three manufacturers made these; Eddystone, Remington and Winchester. It fires nicely and is in quite nice condition. The stock matches the serial number (you will see this in the pictures) and the magazine plate matches the serial number as well. There are various markings on the stock and stock hardware identifying this rifle as made by Eddystone. Only the bolt is not matching (which is very common) and it is made by Winchester.

The Model 1917 shoots a 30-06 round, the British version shoots a .303 and before the U.S. entered WWI, a few American companies manufactured these rifles for England in that caliber. When the U.S. entered WWI, they chose these rifles for their battle rifles.

They remained in service through WWII and the Korean War as sniper rifles. Overall, they are quite well designed and very valuable when they are unaltered from their original issue state. This Model 1917 has its ladder sights, original stock, and front sight. This is a very sturdy and heavy duty rifle. It is (when loaded and if it had a bayonet) 4'11"" tall and close to 11lbs.

Overall it is a great rifle and collectible, but a good shooter too. I have about 50 or so rounds that go with it too. The serial number dates it to a September 1917 manufacture date."

This is a great firearm. Comes new unfired from the factory with factory hard case and all factory paper work. Comes with one 30 round magazine. From the factory: The Para Ordnance Tactical Target Upper Assembly features the DIGS (Delayed Impingement Gas System) which makes it the Smallest, Big Rifle in the World. PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner.

Ruger Mini-14GB rifle in .223 caliber (5.56 NATO). Hardwood stock. Green nylon carry strap. Semi-auto. Safety. Clips included.

RARE MODEL: Mini-14GB 
Stainless steel
GB (government bayonet) lug 
bird cage style flash suppressor

Works great! This rifle is a lot of fun to shoot at the range. Two clips included (one 20 round and one 30 round). The licensed dealer who I bought this rifle from several years ago told me he purchased it from a law enforcement auction (this was the ""go to"" tactical rifle found in most SWAT-type patrol cars before the AR-15 became popular). Google it.
The agency was selling all Mini-14s and moving to the AR system. 

The Mini-14 employs a heat-treated receiver and a version of the M1 rifle locking mechanism with a self-cleaning, fixed-piston gas system. It has a simple, rugged Garand-style breechbolt locking system, with a fixed-piston gas system and self-cleaning, moving gas cylinder. It is essentially a smaller version of the M-14. If you've ever used an M-14 or Mini-14, you know how smooth the action is.  

There are some dings and scrapes on the wood stock, (but there are NO marks on the metal parts of the rifle) likely caused by the mounting bracket from the car it was mounted in. It is a beautiful weapon. Normally you can only find the blued ""rancher"" version without the GB lug. I RARELY see this model at gun shows. Check your favorite website; odds are there are only a few of this model (and often none) listed for sale at any one time. Why hassle with blued when you can have easy-to-maintain stainless? This would make a great Christmas present for a range shooter. I bought it as my Christmas present to myself several years ago. 

 $750 or best offer. Questions are welcomed.

Sorry, no trades.

Must be 18 or older. MS residents only for cash and carry sales. Sorry, it's the law. Buyers from another state must have me transfer the weapon to my local licensed gun dealer, who can legally ship it to the buyer's out-of-state licensed dealer. Check with your locally licensed gun dealer for details."

AR15,"Arlington, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 250,"Listed On: Monday, November 11, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Knightâs has mastered the art of the perfect trigger.

154â diameter pins, new unfired. Local pickup or free shipping upon cleared funds.

Info:

The KAC two-stage trigger groups offer a substantial enhancement of semi-automatic accuracy potential over factory single-stage triggers for AR-15 Series rifles. 

The factory single stage trigger mechanism releases the hammer (firing the weapon) after a steady squeeze is applied by the trigger finger. This trigger squeeze requires steadily increasing pressure to overcome the sear spring and mechanical resistance. The ""creep"" inherent in the factory single stage trigger requires that the shooter take time to ""walk"" through the trigger pull and find the ""let-off point"" in order to achieve accurate fire. In the semi automatic mode the KAC two-stage trigger mechanism release the hammer (firing the weapon) after two distinct amounts of spring and mechanical resistance are overcome by the trigger finger. The Initial stage of resistance encountered with this design feels light and is relatively long - approximately I/8 of an inch. The second stage of resistance feels noticeably greater but is of very short duration. The result is an extremely predictable, consistent, ""crisp"" trigger pull; semi-automatic fire is both quicker and more accurate because the first stage is quickly overcome and the second stage is crisp and predictable. 

Most Highpower shooters who have used this trigger say it is the best feeling trigger they have every used  and it is also the easiest for the average shooter to install and adjust.  And if need be it can be changed to be a Match Trigger. Note the pin holding the two part disconnector in the trigger body.  This is the key to the easy installation.  This whole assembly (trigger with two par disconnector pinned in place) is dropped into the lower, and the normal trigger pin previously removed is re-inserted.  The normal pin pushes the Stoner half pin out and your are done! (well you do have to put the hammer in, maybe 30 more seconds... tops!)  This trigger normally needs no further adjustment.  You can tweak the Allen screw shown near the front of the trigger if you want to adjust the creep on the second stage."

I purchased this new about a two months ago, and never got to break it in simply because I'm not a fan of paddle holsters. With that being said, this holster should be concealable if that's what you're looking for, but I can't say with 100% certainty that it is. You are more than welcome to see if the fit is comfortable for you, in fact I would suggest it. This is made for a Glock, but can be used on other platforms.This holster was just short of $60 including tax, but since its doing nothing but collecting dust, it can be yours for $35.

Also collecting dust is a basic kydex iwb holster made by ""Outbags"". This holster is very functional and did its job well until its replacement was no longer on back order. These sell from the ~$15 price range, but I no longer have a need for it, so for $10, it can be yours.

If you are interested in both I will throw in the kydex holster at no charge."

The price reflects the fact that it does have(had) rust on various parts of the gun (which I have rubbed off with fine steel wool and then oiled). Pitting is evident where the rust was.

This is NOT a safe queen and has rust pitting on the following parts below..... Some severe. Note that there is NO rust or pitting on the working parts of the bolt and inside the receiver.

- On the bolt cocking knob
- On the bolt handle
- The nose tip of the upper part of the barrel cover
- The butt plate
- On the barrel (near the stamp marks)

The stock is in great shape though and the rifling looks very good. It has not been counter bored and has all matching numbers, but a couple of force matches. This rifle was arsenal refinished in Russia in the 70s. So if you want a great WWII era rifle to shoot and are not concerned with cosmetics, then this one is for you.

I put about 30 rounds through this gun last weekend and it fires and extracts without issue. I did not sight it though. It was then cleaned that evening. 

It comes with a couple of the cleaning tools and the firing pin measurement gauge only.  There is no bayonet, sling, pouches, or oil can.

I can send additional pics upon request.

The price is firm.  Any offers for less than the asking price will not be responded to."

For weeks now, I've been seeing S&W stainless steel 9mm 5906 semiauto pistols for sale and no one is buying them? These firearms are 80's and 90's quality, accurate, used by law enforcement until the plastic gun craze began. They will only increase in value. Shoot one and you will agree, they are top quality. Sorry for giving a history lesson here, but a lot of people don't realize what they are missing out on. Go to youtube and check out the smiths. Then get yourself a piece of law enforcement history, that's as deadly today, as yesterday. Enjoy! Yes I have two of them. Please don't thrash this listing. I only meant to educate, and I sell things on this sight all the time. Peace! Rick"

Product Information

 Lee Precision customed design a cast bullet that would not only function from a suppressed AR-15 in 300 AAC Blackout subsonicly, but would not have problems feeding from a magazine and stabilize with the fast twist barrels. This bullet has a smaller meplat leading to a long gentle rounded tangent ogive to ensure that the bullet will feed from a magazine and be less sensitive to bullet seating depth. This bullet also has a boat-tail design to help increase the ballistic coefficient, reducing drag helping the bullet to overcome air resistance in flight. Some reloaders have even reported that they can seat gas checks on the boat-tail to help reduce leading when loading this bullet in other calibers. The tumble lube design of this mold is perfect for shooting subsonic loads out of the 300 AAC Blackout. 

Lee Bullet Molds are a great choice for reloaders looking for a quality mold at an affordable price. Lee machines their mold blocks from aluminum making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds and good bullets can usually be produced only after a few casts. In addition, aluminum blocks are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks offering the bullet caster less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block are CNC Machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Weights given are Lee's weights with suggested alloy; actual weight may vary due to the alloy mixture used. 

Technical Information:

Material: Machined Aluminum Mold Blocks and Hard Anodized Sprue Plate
