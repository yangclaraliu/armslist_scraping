This gun is extremely accurate for a sporter-weight barrel consistently shooting under MOA (see the 100 yd. target).

This gun fires 2 22 magnum rounds from its 2 barrels and automatically switches between barrels.  It is a beautiful gun that is great for concealing.  It can easily fit in your pocket, an ankle holster, a phone case or a ladies purse.  It is great for girls or guys because both need protection in today's times.  Don't confuse 22 magnum with 22 LR, these are a lot longer and the velocity is much faster.  It has great stopping power for any size person and almost no recoil on this double barrel weapon.  A great defense weapon and it looks great too.

The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well.



CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.
•All steel construction
•High capacity double column magazines
•Hammer forged barrels
•Ergonomic grip and controls
•Unparallel accuracy
•Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control
•3 dot sighting system
•Smooth double action and crisp single action
•Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials
•Firing pin block safety

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along.

The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding! MSRP $352"

It has the arsenal conversion to accept the 8x57 mauser (spitzer round), having the ""S"" marked reciever, grooved rear of receiver, and plate clip on bottom of the magazine well. I had bought it as wall hanger, so if you want to fire it, then do some research as I'm told that you'd want to fire lower pressure 8mm mauser. It has German army unit markings on the barrel bands, which tells me it saw service in the German army before being sold to Turkey at some point."

This is the most awesome version of the.500 S&W made. This 6.5 inch barrel is close to the size of Dirty Harry's model 29 revolver. I have owned the 8 inch which was too heavy to carry. I traded it on the 4 inch which was not nearly as accurate since it's 3 inches of barrel and 1 inch of compensation. I ended up buying two of the 6.5 inch .500 mags. I'm moving to Hawii and no longer need them. Sold the one that I carried this one is a new in box that I bought for a spare. Bought it a few months ago when I saw that the 2 inch was discontinued. I ended up selling the 2 inch for a large profit and love the 6.5 so much that I bought a spare. Since S&W tends to discontinue my favorite guns then they jump in value. 

This is the best defensive gun against dangerous game made. My other .500 could hit a pie plate dead center at 50 yards. Recoil is not all that bad since this model has an awesome rubber grip. I switched from a 4 inch model 29 S&W after I was charged by a black bear. It took all 6 shots of Buffalo Bore heavy hard casts to drop it. After that I would never again enter the woods without a .500. The bear wasn't that big and it took 6 shots to bring him down. If you spend time in Black or Brown bear country do yourself a favor and strap this to your chest. 

Can't take any trades at this time as i'm moving. This gun must be transferred through an FFL dear no exceptions.

412,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2442412,For Trade:  Home Bar Set,"North-east Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, Indiana",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, December 20, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking for a dependable home defense weapon (shotgun, smooth-bore preferably) in trade for everything. I'm open to any offer you'd like to make, but for now I'm not taking cash offers for individual pieces or interested in other types of trades.

Up for trade is a home bar / man cave upgrade stuffed with more than enough products to either get your man cave started or fill out your den enough to truly call it the home bar you've always been looking for. These are all display pieces that I've taken (with permission) from my work over the last seven years or so that I don't have a place for in my own home bar right now. Lots of glassware and bar sets are included. Every piece has been treated respectfully... it has first been displayed in a store set, and then spent some time in my own home bar set, so they have some general wear and tear but are in good condition.

I would like to keep the set together so I will give preference to those trade offers.

A few important things I'd like to point out are:

The Camel neon is one of the old models that are built to last - These old models are built like a brick sh*thouse and as long as you treat it with respect, it should last you as long time. I can send you as pic of the transformer if you want to take a look.

Some of the signs are vintage (none of them are reproductions), such as the bud tin and the cigar clock. I have no idea on ""value"" but they add a nice old school elegance... the cigar clock runs on batteries (two AA's), and must be plugged in to light up. It keeps fairly accurate time with fresh batteries and I've never had to replace anything, but I've added more neons to my home bar and don't have room for it anymore.

If there's anything else you feel you need to fill out your bar, let me know and I can probably dig something up from my collection."

Bash, shine and stun. Guard Dog Security introduces the world’s first combination of metal baton, tactical flashlight and concealed stun gun all within the Titan.

Often attempted, yet never perfected, the metal baton stun gun has finally been engineered in a type III aluminum, aircraft grade body. With a firm rubberized grip handle, the Titan transforms into an 18.5” heavy duty clubber and emergency glass breaker.

With a quick slide, the Guard Dog Titan shines a blinding 260 lumen tactical flashlight with three light functions: blinding high, battery conservation low and emergency strobe. The far-reaching, and concentrated, light allows for everyday use or as a defense device in the event of an emergency.

The Titan’s front end boasts Guard Dog’s exclusive Concealed Inner Stun Technology™, firing off a thunderous 7,500,000 stun gun. With no visible probes, the stuns emit a loud electrifying shock with the push of a button.

The shockproof body allows for durability and longevity while the car and wall chargers permit flexibility in recharging capabilities. Whether you’re on guard or just using the Titan as a personal safety device, you’re in good hands with the industry exclusive Guard Dog baton, tactical flashlight and concealed stun gun."

(also in Minnesota) for a brief time until they got the pants sued off them and went out of business.  Quite frankly, I like this version better because (1) the overall quality of the aluminum and finish is nicer than the Nordic, and (2) unlike the Nordic version, the rail on the receiver is the same height as the rail on your handguard. This ""chassis"" consists of 5 panels of high-quality, milled aluminum that house the receiver of your 10/22 rifle and allow you to attach any mil-spec AR-15 component parts, such as a buffer tube and adjustable stock, a barrel nut and/or delta ring for hand rails, and any AR-15 pistol grip. This is a great training tool if you'd rather not spend tons of money on 5.56 or .223 ammo for range practice. $100 is the firm cash price for the chassis only. I also have quite a few AR parts laying around that I'd be willing to sell if you are interested. Email me for pricing on the AR parts. Thanks for looking!"

Rifle comes with a 5rnd mag and a 10 rnd mag from Magpul, a J-mec standoff scope mount(allows for co-witnessing of iron sights), and a CP 4-20x40 scope that great to really zoom in on targets at the range.  The bolt has been turned down and re-welded to accommodate this scope.  Barrel rifling is in excellent condition.

The polymer stock is outstanding.  It completely changes the feel of a mosin with its  ergonomcs, recoil, and magazine capabilities.  Its takes an oldie like the mosin and pulls it into the present.  The mags feed very well with an occasional jostle needed on the rare event.  

Rifle fires the wonderful 7.62mmx54R bullet with similar ballistics to the .308 but at 1/3rd the cost.  Nothing like getting 440rounds for $120 that happens to be environmentally sealed to resist time and the elements.  Great way to shoot some power for cheap.

 The MSA Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) delivers advanced ballistic, fragmentation, and impact head protection, with unsurpassed comfort for long-term use. The helmet's low-profile design reduces the risk of interference in target acquisition and ensures compatibility with NVGs (night-vision goggles), MSA's CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) Gas Masks, and MSA's communication devices.

The sized pads conform to the shape of your head to distribute the helmet's weight evenly and comfortable. Simply adjust and move the absorbent pads for a flexible, personalized fit.

 The MSA ACH, based on MSA's original MICH helmet, was developed for the U.S. Military Special Operations Command, meeting stringent requirements and unprecedented demands , and setting new performance standards. Named a Best Invention by U.S. Army Materiel Command, the U.S. Army was so impressed that MSA's ACH was adopted as the standard of issue for all troops deploying to the Iraq/Afghanistan Operations Theatre.

The pads are easily attached, removed, and reattached to the inside of the inside of the helmet shell via a hook and loop fastening system in order to facilitate user comfort and integration with other equipment. The pads remain firmly in place when attached and provide the user with the ability to attach the pads where the wearer desires (i.e. in a variety of locations) and permit accommodation among different size and shape heads and some equipment.

Its a rock solid all American made all steel 1911, without spending over a grand, and I have only put maybe 200 rounds through it with no problems to speak of.  I have cleaned it after each range use which I believe as only been 3 times, and the rest and really most of the time it just sits in a moisture controlled safe.  I am selling it because I wanted to get a smaller 1911 that would be easier for me to carry.  Anyways I am asking 800.00 OBO I recently reduced my asking price,  it comes with 2 factory 8 round mags along with 1 Chip McCormick 8 round power mag, and a wilson combat replacement recoil spring and shock buffer.  If you have any questions just shoot me a text or give me a call I am usually pretty good about replying quickly, and if you have a number in mind just let me have it, your not going to offend me or anything worst thing that happens is I say no, I am negotiable and motivated to sell.

This listing is for a NEW black Kel-Tec Sub 2000 G17 folding carbine, chambered in 9mm S&with a 16.1"" barrel. It accepts all Glock Model 17 magazines, and comes with one mag. This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 17 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4

It has the side bolt release installed. Timney trigger factory set around 1lb. It comes in a Manners T5-A with Harris BRM-S bipod with LaRue mount,  Near scope base ,4 AI magazines, custom muzzle brake(honestly has less kick than a .243, closer to a 5.56). It is topped off with a NightForce ATACR and NightForce rings. It also comes with almost 16 lbs of H1000 over 500 projectiles, a redding dies and around 1900 primers(Federal 215 Match). It has a Pelican 1750 rifle case. Probably around 150 extra brass mostly new factory primed Federal. I also have a a few boxes of factory ammo, including two and a half boxes of factory loaded Mk248 Mod1 army/Navy sniper ammo(very hard to get). All together I have well over $7000 in everything but it was worth every penny. It shot  7/8"" @ 300 yards with factory ammo, less than that with my hand loads . It has been fired 65 times if my brass count is right? I am interested in HK rifles/pistols, PS90's, the HK MR762  or true 14.5"" 416 upper to be exact. I do expect cash or trades to make a more fair trade. The third photo is the 7/8"" group at 300 yards...  No expense was spared in building this rifle. 

I will not ship, I will drive to meet but must be in person. Please don't ask and don't low ball me. I have all of the AR15's I need, the 416 upper was the exception."
