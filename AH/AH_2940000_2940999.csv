Description:
""USP9 Compact V1 DA/SA 9mm. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reductions in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot """"two-finger grip"""" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceal ability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Specifications: - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame - Grooved target triggers - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes - Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel - No snag, bobbed hammer - Flared recurve trigger guard - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories - Ambidextrous magazine release lever - Contoured, extended slide release - Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator."""

Chosen by U.S. special operators as the next generation assault rifle platform, the MK 17 provides the range, reliability, accuracy, safety, ergonomics and modularity to meet any operational challenge. A selective-fire, semi- and full-auto 7.62x51mm NATO rifle using a short stroke gas piston, the MK 17 can be quickly configured by the individual operator in just minutes for close quarters combat (CQC), tactical and long-range engagements. Unlike many currently fielded 7.62x51mm rifles, controllability under recoil is a hallmark of the MK 17, allowing the operator to readily engage targets with multiple well-aimed rounds. The MK 17 has been tested and fielded with U.S. Armed Forces. It adds the same innovation, modularity and adaptability as the MK 16, only in a larger caliber.

This rifle is NOT in immaculate condition. I bought it and tried to clean it up as best as I can. It's an old gun but still looks pretty good. It's not rusted up or anything. The stock is in good shape and the wood is much heavier duty than the other SKS variants (Russian, Chinese etc)The gun has a decent bore, not shiny but not pitted or rusty either. I have shot it up to 50 yards and it shoots pretty accurate.

THE ISSUES:
When I bought the rifle and tried to shoot it, it would not cycle the rounds so it was basically a bolt action rifle. I suspected a gas leak since the gas valve switch was pretty beat up and the gas tube wobbled so I purchased a brand new CNC Warrior stainless steel gas valve/switch. It helped a little bit with the cycling but still has issues and stove pipes/jams.

Also not a huge deal but the front sight ring seems to have been broken by the previous owner (see pic). It's only the brace and not the sight so it is only a cosmetic issue.

I suspect the gas tube is the culprit since it wobbles a little still. I just can't seem to find another original one available to try it out so I'm getting rid of the whole rifle. I'm letting it go for $200 cash if anyone is up to the task of making this thing run again. SKS are pretty simple in design so I don't think the problem would be too difficult to fix. I imagine the worst case scenario is you have to buy another gas cylinder. Sorry the cheap sling is not included since it's broken.

$200 cash only. Price is firm. Do not bother with lower offers as they will be ignored. I don't need to sell this gun. MUST HAVE AND SHOW PTP OR PTC TO PURCHASE.

I am available to meet in public M-F after 4:30pm or weekends after 3pm. I can only meet in the metro area, preferably around Saint Paul. I am not willing to drive to the outer suburbs due to flakes.

Bought it for wife as a surprise and we fired 50 rounds and she decided she doesn't like it.
So, I am hoping to get my money back or trade for something I want: 
A Springfield XD XDM or XDS  9mm or .45
Obviously, I am willing to throw in some cash ($200-$300) depending on the trade. 
If you're buying, I will need to see a Military/LEO ID or CC.
If we're trading, I want to trade at a range, so I can shoot it and make sure it works. 

It comes with an Uncle Mike's CC holster and about 100 rounds"

Basically like a 3/4 scale 1911, with an external extractor.  

I removed the slide (done just like a full-size 1911); not sure it's ever had a single round down the pipe.  Since I don't know the history of this pistol, I can't be sure.  But looking at the barrel, I'm not sure that it's ever had anything down it other than the dust bunny I chased out!

This gun's really, really nice.  And the PRICE has been DROPPED to $300.

You really need to see this pistol in person.  It looks much, much better than the pics.  I've taken a bunch... unfortunately, I took 'em with my work phone - it makes colors look funny and makes every tiny blemish look HUGE because the finish is so shiny.  

Unfortunately, this has already collected the 'idiot mark' on the slide from the safety, and the little screw head on the mag release.  A couple minor blemishes on a gun that's really, really nice and clean.

But, I'm allowed 3000 words worth of photos here, and am happy to email you a whole bunch more.  Or, meet up and check it out in person.  

As far as trades go, I'm looking to raise cash to fund the purchase of a Geo Metro, so money - or 3 cylinders of fury for my gun and some cash - is what I'm looking for.  But, I could be interested in an exceptional deal on a small carry pistol or inexpensive Euro guns like  FEG, Makarov, Tokarev, CZ, etc.  

I also have a friend who's looking for a 9mm pistol - may be able to work something out if you've got one of those.

Still, cash is king.

Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

Rifle comes with 11 mags.  Three 42 round mags and eight 30 round mags.  Not willing to separate the gun from the magazines, so make sure you include their value in any trade.  I can include the optic as well but if you don't want it no big deal.  It is a PA fixed 3x CQB style scope for $150 on top of the mags and rifle.

Looking to trade not sell outright.  Guns I am interested in.  20 ga over/unders or side by sides, brands like Beretta, Browning, Caesar Guerini, and Fox.  Winchester Feather weight in 300 Win mag or 338.  Will consider other hunting bolt action rifles in 300 Win mag or 338.  C93's, 20"" A2 or A4 AR 15 rifles.  AK's in 7.62x39, Arsenal or kit builds with original import barrels.  No Yugo Ak's please.  Sig 226's or 229's (no DAK please).  FAL's.  Nor C&R rifles please.

This gun has been a safe queen.  I am in no rush to get rid of this gun, if the right trade doesn't come along I have no issue keeping it forever.  If you make a trade offer make sure and include what you think your gun(s) are worth plus any cash you plan on adding to the deal or what cash you expect in the deal (if applicable).  If you expect full retail for your gun, I will expect retail for mine.
