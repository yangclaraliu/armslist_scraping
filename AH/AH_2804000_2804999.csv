Both the lowers are Mil-spec forged aluminum with Mil-spec internals, made by Anderson Manufacturing. For those of you who may not know, Anderson Manufacturing is one of the premier names in AR15/M4 style rifles. As a matter of fact, several ""big name"" AR15 manufacturers have, and still do, use re-branded Anderson lowers on their products. The finish and tolerances on these lower receivers are 2nd to none.  

Both lowers are .223/5.56 caliber. One has the Blackhawk adjustable butstock, pistol grip, and a single point sling mount. The other lower has the PSA adjustable butstock and pistol grip. They are ready to mount to any .223 or 5.56 upper and head to the range. Both lowers are brand new and unfired. The pic with the hammer up and the selector on ""fire"" has the Blackhawk equipment. The other has the PSA equipment.

I also have 1 PSA 16"" complete upper WITH charging handle and Bolt Carrier Group. Below are the specs for the upper; it was factory installed and tested at PSA. Other than being tested at the factory the upper is completely new and unfired. It still has a coat of factory oil on it.

If you buy the upper and one of the lowers, I will throw in a brand new P-Mag 30 round mag, 40 rounds of brass cased .223 ammo, and a single point bungee sling...giving you a brand new complete and fully functional quality AR15 (with some cool extras), for less than you can buy a ""cheapo"" AR15 for.

This is an LN blue label Glock 31 .357 SIG caliber with factory applied nightsights.  It comes with 3-15 rnd mags, cleaning rod/brush, box and papers.

Also included in the package is a seperate case with:
1. An NEW unfired Glock 17 9m/m COMPLETE upper assembly (slide, barrel, recoil spring guide rod), a NEW trigger mechanism housing w/3.5 connector, a NEW Glock 17 magazine and a Glock Armorers tool.
2. A factory Glock 22 barrel in .40 S&W caliber.

That makes these modular weapons packages a real multi-caliber deal. It has everything needed to fire .357 Sig, .40 S&W and 9m/m. This is an opportunity to own a G17, G22 and a G31 in one package. They are not aftermarket conversion kits. All parts are factory Glock and can be interchanged by using the Glock Armorers tool that is included. They are 'drop-in' parts and require NO fitting. I am a Glock Armorer and I can show you how to change calibers in less than 2 minutes. 
Buyer will need to produce a purchase permit or a CCW permit. The only trade offers I am interested in is an upper tier UNMODDED factory Colt AR. No low end ARs please.
These are a unique package deals that were extremely difficult to make due to the availability of componants. This is the 3rd and final combo kit that I have assembled."

“I am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.”

“I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class. The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.

Thank you again for the class.”

This press is in excellent shape and I have had great success loading with it, but im upgrading and need to sell it to pay for the new press. This is great for a beginner, intermediate or even a well seasoned reloader. I also have a salter brecknell cb50 powder scale. accuracy is +/- .3 grains. it has several modes and a case cover. Also, i have a lee safety powder scale. its simple and zeros nicely and accurate to .1g or less. For the press, priming system, rcbs powder measure, powder measure stand, lee scale, shellholders, and all accessories, im asking $250.

Up for sale or trade is my YUGO SKS.  Gun is equipped with bayonet, flash suppressor, and grenade launcher sites.  Has 10rd fixed mag (recently removed), sling, war time trench art on stock.  The only issue with the gun is the safety lever is a little loose.  It does work, but not exactly the safest safety.  Im not sure if i didnt put it back together correctly after I last field stripped it.  The numbers are not all matching.  The stock and receiver are matching but the bolt, trigger guard are different.  The barrel is stamped ""YUGO 7.62x39 CAI Georgia VT""

Since the numbers arent matching, I removed the fixed mag so I could use sks duck bill mags.  Currently has a tapco 20 round mag.  If this makes the rifle less attractive to you, I will gladly put the fixed mag back in. 

Gun is in great firing order and is a blast to shoot.  Bore is great as well as the bluing. Receiver and bolt are in great shape.  Stock has normal wear and tear.  Lower end of butt stock has ""MIRSO MICA"" lightly carved. 

Price is $350 

This will be a FACE TO FACE transaction with no shipping or FFL.  I will need a PA Drivers License and a Bill of sale must be signed.

If it doesn't sell or trade this week it's going back in the safe for good. 

For trade is a new, never fired Serbian Zastava OPAP AK47. Have all paperwork it came with. It is not an NPAP, PAP smear, or any other kind of PAP that you may see at _______.com for XXX amount of dollars....The OPAPs are not being imported any longer and are built on a thicker 1.6mm RPK receiver with actual double stack bolts. Just look up reviews on youtube for OPAP to get more info or visit AK Files.com if you are not sure what all the variations are.  Although you can't see it in the picture, a correct AK rear sling swivel has been added to the left side of the stock where you would normally see one.

The Yugo M70 is definitely one of the better built AK47s and are practically indestructible. The build quality on these is exceptional. I have had three in the past few months. This is the last one. I had originally planned to keep it because it has the Serbian crest on the stock and that only seems to appear about one in every ten that were imported. As luck would have it, I am in the market for an AK74 instead and this one needs a new home. 

I can POSSIBLY also add up to 1000 rounds of ammo and 10 surplus mags or 75 round new Romanian drum mag for the right price or trade.  Any questions just ask. Thanks."

SpeedSafe: Assists you to open any SpeedSafe knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.
Liner Lock : Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knifes steel liner, the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.
Reversible: Predrilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

This is my last .40 I'm consolidating down to .45ACP and 9mm only. So I'm looking to trade it as a package. It will come with the pistol, hard case, paperwork, two larger back straps, cleaning rod/brush, four 15rd mags one of which is marked LE/Gov only for you glock buffs about a $50 value. I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol. Due to this being my last .40 I am also adding 100rds of FMJ and 55rds of quality jacketed hallow points. I am putting the specs from glocks web-sight below. I'm valuing the pistol and one mag alone at $600 and $120-$150 for the extras.

Im not an expert on these rifles and I haven't taken a magnifying glass looking for every little marking on it. Having said that, this is one of the best looking originals I have seen. Nothing has been refinished or re-blued or re-parkerized. There is some wear on the usual areas of the bolt, as to be expected from a rifle that has been loved on for many decades. But it presents very very well.

This is a beautiful rifle with a shiny bore and strong rifling (2 groove). I don't have  a fancy measuring tool for the muzzle or throat wear but it passes the ""bullet test"".
Bolt is very very smooth, you can close the bolt on a live round with one finger. The trigger is fantastic for a military rifle, crisp and light.
Scant (semi-pistol grip) stock.
Nothing has been modified that i can tell. No trigger job, no bedding, etc. So basically ""non-bubba'd"".

It's a beautiful wartime rifle that shoots great and would look fantastic hanging on someone's wall.

The only reason I'm selling is because the urge to modify this rifle is overwhelming me, and this one doesnt deserve that fate.

Prefer to trade, but will entertain cash offers.

I put a significant amount of time into researching the individual components that went into this build.  The rifle has approximately 75 rounds through it.  That includes operation testing, breaking in the barrel, and then zeroing the scope.  The scope is a Millett 4x16x50mm MilDot scope with Red/Green light up reticles.  The barrel is the crown jewel of the build.  It is a Lothar-Walther 20"" Varmint AR-15 1:7"" Twist barrel.  This thing will sing.  The buttstock is MagPul PRS with adjustable cheek weld and length of pull.  The fore grip is a free floating Troy 13"" Alpha Battle Rail.  The Lower is from USA Tactical in Statesville NC and the upper is from DPMS.  There is no rattle in the mating of the upper to lower!  It is a nice firm fit.  The rifle has a standard Rock River Arms trigger.  You can upgrade that to your favorite specific trigger group if you want.  The rifle comes with a 30Rd PMAG hydro coated in ATACs-AU similar to the scope, grip, and trigger guard.  All coating was done by SexyWeapon.com  None of this was cheap.  I am selling it to fund my next build.  If you have any questions or are interested please feel free to contact me.  I have records, receipts, and the location where everything was purchased.  Thanks for checking it out.  The quote on the lower receiver is from Thomas Jefferson and reads ""One man with courage is a majority."""

Item Description:
This is a brand new in box Springfield Armory XDm-40 semi-automatic pistol chambered for .40 S&W. This pistol features a 3.8"" match grade barrel, delivering the accuracy serious shooters demand. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDm's match grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a level unrivaled in the firearms industry. The forged steel slide has an attractive satin silver finish for a classic two-tone look. Aggressive front and rear chevron-shaped cocking serrations allow confident operation in any environment. The ideal grip angle offers intuitive point-ability, and the comfortable contours and high tech texturing are designed for maximum control. Interchangeable backstraps are included to customize comfort for the shooter's hand. The frame has an integral Picatinny rail, readily accepting tactical lights, laser sights, and other accessories. Three white dot sights are fitted.

Springfield's USA, or Ultra Safe Trigger, system guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. This trigger also has one of the shortest travels of any currently available polymer framed pistol, along with a similarly short reset, keeping you on target with greater ease, for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. A visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow the shooter to be completely certain whether the pistol is loaded, and whether the striker is cocked. A standard grip safety, unique amongst polymer frame pistols, ensures that the pistol can only be fired when gripped at the ready.

Two ""Mega Capacity"" 16 round magazines are included. The XDm series has the highest factory capacity magazines of any production polymer framed pistol. A holster, speed loader, safety lock, and magazine holder are also included. This pistol ships in a padded hard case.

904,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2804904,For Sale:  Calico M-100 Round Carbine - RARE,"Scottsdale, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 500,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 12, 2014",Rifles,Calico Weapons Systems                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Calico submachine guns are somewhat mysterious and quite notorious in both design, concept and appearance. The key properties of Calico firearms were extremely large magazine capacity combined with slim profile and ambidextrous handling. First designs, introduced by the US based company Calico Light Weapon Systems (LWS) circa 1990, were intended for both Law Enforcement and Military markets (in either semi-auto or selective fired form, in 9mm) and for civilian market (semi-auto only, in pistol or carbine form, in 9mm and .22LR versions).Sales of these guns were not so bright, and the US Assault Weapons Ban of 1994,which limited magazine capacity for civilian guns to 10 rounds, further impacted the future of this weapon. Apparently, military and police sales during late1990s were insufficient, and it seems that the Calico LWS company went out of business.

Original design of the helical, large capacity magazine was invented by theMichael Miller and Warren Stockton by the 1985, and refined by the 1988. Calicocompany produced 2 basic designs, one in .22LR (models 100, 105 and 110), and another in 9mm Luger (models 900, 950, 960, Liberty). 9mm models could be easilydistinguished by the ejection chute, located just ahead of the triggerguard, and opened to the bottom. .22LR models, on the other hand, have trigger guards withslim front edge, and ejection ports on the side of receivers.

Technical description. The 9mm Calico submachine guns were delayed blowback operated, selective fire weapons. The action is based on the two part, roller delayed blow back bolt system, initially designed by Ludwig Vorgrimler at the Mauser Werke by the end of WW2, and latter refined and promoted by the Heckler & Koch company in itsG3 series rifles and MP5 series submachine guns. One interesting feature of Calico submachine guns is that the spent cases are ejected straight down,through the ejection chute at the front of the trigger guard. This, along with the ambidextrous safety / selector switch, located at the front of the trigger guard, make the gun ambidextrous, but bottom ejection caused danger to the shooter in the case of improper two-hands grip - if the supporting hand will come too close to the trigger guard, ejected cases can cause burns and damage to the holding palm. The charging handle is located at the left side of the gun,just ahead and above the trigger, and does not move when gun is fired. It also must be pointed out, that the .22LR versions of the Calico guns had the ejection port at the right side of the receiver, above the pistol grip.

The most interesting feature of the Calico firearms is the top-mounted, cylindrical magazine of impressive capacity. Made mostly of plastics, this magazine contains a helical guide grooves at its ""inner"" cylindrical wall, with the rotating central ""follower"", that causes the cartridges to follow the helical track inside the cylinder. The follower is operated by the spiral spring, located at the rear of the cylinder. Magazine is equipped with winding handle, so it can be stored loaded and with unwound spring, to avoid loss of spring tension during the storage time. When required, magazine spring could be quickly wound up by rotating the handle to prepare magazine for fire. Magazines for Calico guns can store 50 or 100 rounds in relatively compact packages.

Another interesting feature of all 9mm and some .22LR Calico guns is that while the adjustable front sight is mounted on the trapezoid block on the weapon itself,the rear sight is formed as the part of the plastic magazine shell. Calico firearms in submachine or carbine form could be fitted with retractable butt and/ or forward pistol grip."

Time to make some room.
Here is a description on the Weapon as these are VERY RARE .  Comes with 4 Original Magazines which normally go for $250 each.

Optic is NOT Included. 

The Valmet M62/76 series of rifles are updates of the AK-47 design. Beginning with a licensed version of the AK-47 receiver, Valmet set about upgrading the design at every point. Tolerances are much tighter than the Soviet bloc AKs while still being generous enough to assure outstanding reliability in all climates. The gas piston included small “fingers” near the piston to ensure smoother functioning inside the gas tube, which helped to increase the inherent accuracy of the rifle. Another move toward increased accuracy was the upgraded sights.

The front sight is mounted on the gas block which makes for one less attachment to the barrel, adding to the mechanical accuracy. The front sight is fully adjustable in the field by the soldier. There is also a flip up tritium night sight that covers the front post for low light shooting.

The rear sight is an aperture on a sliding tangent affair adjustable to 600 meters and a “battle sight” setting of 150 meters. The rear sight is located toward the rear of the top cover. The rear sight also has tritium inserts for night shooting by flipping the sight all the way forward (upside down). Once in this position, there is a square notch arrangement with two tritium dots on either side. In this position, the rear sight is adjustable for elevation via a set screw under the sight arm.

Another feature of the Valmet M62/76 series rifles is the flash suppressor. It resembles an enlarged version of the suppressor on the original M16. Directly under the flash suppressor is a bayonet lug to accommodate the knife-style bayonet manufactured by Fiskars and Hackman. The flash suppressor has some sharp edges along its longitudinal cuts for wire cutting. A soldier slides the barbed wire into the flash suppressor and simply rotates his rifle around until it snaps the small gauge wire. For thicker wire, the soldier inserts the wire, gives a half turn and fires the rifle, which will snap the wire. On the M16 the prong type flash suppressor was abandoned for the bird cage type because the prongs tended to snag on vegetation in the field. While this is still a problem with the M62/76, the sharper edges help to cut through some of the vegetation.

There are both solid and folding stock versions. Folding stock designs may become troublesome in that eventually they tend to become loose. This is not a problem with the M62/76 series of rifles as the hinge and lock design are very robust. Both feature a trap door in the butt to store a cleaning kit. So as not to freeze a soldier’s face in the often frigid temperatures of Finland, there is a thin plastic sleeve over the tube section of the stock that typically contacts the shooter's face.

All variants of the M76 are finished with an industrial grade Parkerizing throughout.

The muzzle velocity depends on the ammunition used; the NATO round being 900 m/s while the Kalashnikov round is 719 m/s.
Variants

The Valmet M78 is a heavy-barreled light support variant of the Valmet M76 assault rifle. In addition to firing the 7.62x39mm Soviet cartridge, variants firing 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x51mm NATO were also produced. It is a similar weapon to the RPK light machine gun and serves in the same tactical role."

(This is my eighth conversion, I am no stranger to these.) This is for use, not a frilley-lame ass mall warrior setup you see all over the place. (God I hate those tools...)

Purchased rifle, moved trigger group forward, modified trigger group and polished. installed new Hogue Overmolded pistol grip with casing plug on grip for batteries/etc. Installed the new ARSENAL SAW style front hand guard. Lastly installed a reliability setup to shoot low brass reliably along with the good stuff.

Take a look at Arsenal's Saiga-12 in the LE configuration. Same thing except without a quad rail on mine. (I don't need 2 lasers and a light etc etc on my shotgun...)

This particular model has the bolt hold feature which I retained during the conversion. This is especially nice on a full magazine. Comes with original 5 round magazine and a 10 round ProMag stick mag.

Everything is quality with no gimmicks or extra junk unneeded slapped on the gun. About 100 shells have run through her to break her in and verify everything was functional as I dialed in for low brass usage. Puck and plug is ready from 1-6 and can handle 3 inch shells without issue either. (Amazing fireballs I may add!)

I wasn't going to sell, but I am itching for something in .308/7.62x51 in a semi-auto form factor. Let me know what is available!

And for the right items $ or items? I have easily 500-1k rounds of shells for the right deal."
