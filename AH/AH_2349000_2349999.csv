This is the only high quality original old school style jacket with hidden armor pockets. This is truly a top of the line USA made jacket. Fox Creek leather is hand made in america with a lifetime guarantee. This is the best protective jacket in the market. It vents in the warm weather, keeps wind off in the winter, and will protect from injury. This is a very heavy substantial jacket.

Bought this and now have to sell my bike. My loss is your gain! Wore this jacket less than an hour and it was amazing in the cold weather. Totally blocks the wind and the removable liner keeps the warmth in.

Men's Classic Motorcycle Jackets are the most emotionally volatile and historically rich leather jackets we have. When I put one on I can't decide if I am going to ride a motorcycle, vandalize a town or give someone a ticket. Like any piece of great art it means different things to different people.
In 1953 at the age of seven, inspired by Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"", I asked my parents if I could get a Men's Classic Motorcycle Jacket I. I did not understand the social implications of this leather motorcycle jacket. My mother looked at me like I had asked her if I could cannibalize my infant brother. She began to cry softly, ashamed that I was drawn to such evil.
I went on to become a small time juvenile delinquent and performed many reprehensible acts but none of them elicited the reaction this simple request did.
In addition to parental alienation, the leather jacket is well suited for motorcycle riding. It's cut extra long in the back with a padded kidney panel. Dual front and rear vents move the air easily through a mesh shell while an internal wind flap stops it cold at the zipper. A zip out full sleeve insulated liner completes the climate control package.
Side lacing enables you to contour the motorcycle jacket to your body and an inside snap pocket is set in the leather facing where it won't rip out. Leather is 1.4 to 1.6 mm soft, thick and supple with a dull luster.
The difference between the Men's Classic Motorcycle Jacket I and Men's Classic Motorcycle Jacket II is that the Men's Classic Motorcycle Jacket I has a watch pocket and breast pocket on the left side and a half belt in front. Outside of that they are the same leather jacket.
Please read How Your Motorcycle Jacket Is Supposed To Fit if you have any questions on sizing.

This is not your average polymer 80 lower, in fact, The JMT polymer 80 is fully engineered using current finite element structural analysis for reliable, long-term high performance.

POLYMER 80 versus ALUMINUM
After much research in polymer 80 AR15 lowers, JMT has created its own formula of hybrid polymers and fibers with additional reinforcements in high stress areas to bring you the best AR15 lower on the market today.  All of the JMT polymer 80 lowers are engineered to Mil Spec tolerances and because it is fashioned from extremely durable fiber polymer materials there are no concerns about corrosion as you may find in aluminum AR15 lowers.

IN FIELD DURABILITY
JMT uses only the best high quality hybrid fiber/polymer materials, advanced engineering, precision manufacturing and stringent quality controls.  This way you can trust it not only in the harshest field environments but for personal protection as well.

PARTS INTERCHANGEABILITY
The Polymer 80 AR15 80% lower is designed specifically to Mil Spec tolerances for a high level of interchangeability with other Mil Spec AR15 parts and accessories on the market today.  This is achieved through current technology and computer aided manufacturing processes combined with exacting quality control procedures.

How you decide to defend and protect yourself and your family is a personal matter.  No one wishes to experience a personal breach of your safety or a home invasion but it does happen.  The mission at JMT is to give you the assurance in a product you can trust.

Built the gun for competition use and to be completely honest I cannot shoot it as well as my Glocks and M&Ps. So I want to sell it or trade it. Comes with everything shown and the only trades I will entertain are Glock 17 L or 34, M&P 9 CORE or pro full size or extended slide and maybe other 9mm competitive style guns.

Has 2 Pistolgear magwells, laser cut grip tape, pistol gear extended magazine release, pistol gear heavy SS guide rod, Powder river precision sear, 10 pistolgear slam pads (removable), 5 mags, competition/OWB Bladetech holster (DOS adjustable stingray loop), serpa holster, the box with original extra equipment, the original parts taken off for upgrades in case you want to go back to 100% stock and aftermarket striker double wall roll pin to prevent the most common breakage found on these pistols.

The gun was shot once at the range, about 100 rounds that day and it was also shot on the day of this post at a steel challenge match, about 250 more rounds. Not a single malfunction and it felt great. I just could not hit shit with it!!! Other shooters ran it great, the issue is the gun and SHOOTER interface. I suck! lol.

Will consider trades mentioned above, will go as package deal, no parting out and the trade value will be around 800, sale 750 OBO. This is a ready to go competitive package or can be simply turned back to stock if that it your preference. Located in Jacksonville. Will put cash on top if trade is worth it. 

Please no Glock 19s, 23s, 30sf, or other compact handguns. I need a long sight radius or a slide milled for an optic."

I've really had a wonderful time with this gun, but I'm a college student, and for the moment, it's a lot smarter to just plink around with my Ruger .22

Since I bought it about a year ago, I've put maybe 200 rounds through it, and it's functioned pretty well throughout my ownership. It lost a couple parts last summer, and I had them replaced to get it back into shape. 

This pistol is hard to come by! I hate to get rid of it not just for the great carry pistol it is, but for the classic nature of the item. It's the James Bond gun!

Included is all the ammo I've collected in the last year!

I'm looking to sell this thing quick, I need the money. Keep in mind if you send me an offer that the whole kit is worth more than 900. I'm willing to go as far south as Everett on a weekday, but I'll go farther if necessary. 

The rifle has about 350 rounds through it, and the action and receiver have very minimal wear. Good (2MOA w/7N6) groupings at 100m, and I've had only 2 stovepipes (surplus ammo). The stock set is B-Grade, but $30, a trip to Fred Meyer, and some elbow grease could change that. I'm sad to let it go, it's a fun rifle. 

What you are buying includes:
-Rifle
-approx. 350rds 7N6
-Buttstock cleaning kit and sight adjustment tool
-AK MOE grip installed w/original grip included
-Steel-plate handgrip sling attachment 
-6 different colored front sight posts, including the original steel post

All items on this gun are brand new within the last 3 months.  I put this gun together thinking I would get into long range shooting.  It hasn't worked out.

Gun: Savage Model 10, FCPXP, 308 Winchester,  heavy bull barrel, accutrigger, detachable box mag, comes with single shot adapter for the range, less than 100 rds fired, shoots .5 MOA at 100 yrds- excellent condition

Accessories: 
Choate tactical aluminum bedded stock with large palm swell
EGW one piece picatinny rail
Burris Xtreme 30 mm rings-low
Butler Creek lens caps
Bipod- only item that is not new- but in good condition

Scope: this is the crown jewel of this set up
Bushnell Elite Tactical 6-24x50 illuminated reticle- Amazing
Mildot reticle
FRONT FOCAL PLANE- please do your research- this is the most important thing about this scope- a front focal objective means that the reticle grows with the magnification therefore the mil calculations remain the same no matter what magnification setting you are in- most scopes, even some of the expensive Leupolds don't have this feature.  It spares you from having to be a math genius at the range.  It also allows you to range your target with the reticle.  An amazing feature
Large military style target turrets- .1 Mil per click- this means that the mildot reticle and the mil adjustment turrets match- most mildot reticle scopes have MOA adjustments, which means you have to be a math genius again and have a whole other set of numbers at different magnification levels- this scope takes the difficulty out of long range shooting
30 mm main tube
Perfect Tracking- you can adjust the windage and elevation up to 1000 yards then return it to zero and it will be spot on
Do your homework on this scope- watch the youtube videos 
Costs $1000
This scope is new- unlike the Bushnell models of a couple years ago, this scope has enough elevation built into it to shoot 1000 yards without a MOA rail
This gun is ready to shoot 1000+ yards right now


I have over $2000 invested into this set up.  I will sell for $1500 bc I need the cash.  You could never build this gun for that money.
I will sell the scope separately, its new with the box, for $800
- I will include over 100 rds of match quality ammo in a MTM ammo dry case if you buy the whole set up

Fabulous tactical training for law enforcement, special forces, or those just wanting to have fun.  The FATS system allows you to become part of the situation and use the whole array of weapons: verbal commands, pepper spray, handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, and sub guns to control the bad guys.  Think of it this way; you are crawling inside a life-size video game and engaging in gun fights with the enemy with weapons that you will probably never get to shoot in real life.

In the 1990's, when I was the firearms instructor for my city police department, I would rent a system like this each year.  Every city officer & county deputy got their turn on the FATS.  Even with tight budgets, the bosses knew that this trading was cost effective and tactically sound; it helped keep our officers alive.

Everything besides the storage container and 2 of the 4 mags are unused. I recently sold my AR15, and therefore no longer have a need for these items. 

The ammo is steel cased and is excellent for home defense and/or hunting. I shot approx. 1200 round of this stuff thru my Colt M4 rifle before I sold it, and it cycled perfectly and was very accurate and dependable. I can say the same for the TAPCO mags as well, although the 4 that are included area essentially brand new. 

The AR15 scope mount is made from a single piece of aircraft aluminum, therefore it is very light and strong. It fits a 1"" scope and has 4 picatinny mounts for additional equipment (such as flashlights, lasers, etc.). It is brand new, unused, factory sealed. I can send additional information if needed. I paid about $60 for it a few mouths back and never installed it. Also come with an Allen key and other accessories.

The price for the entire package is $325. This is pretty much the cost buying just the ammo and getting everything else (approx. $150) for free. I am really not looking to separate this package.

The truck does have rust over the rear wheel wells, on the rockers and the drivers fender. The interior has a musty smell from were it use to be used as a farm truck an will need tires. The head liner is a little saggy also. The gauge cluster stopped working at a little less than 200k, but replaced with a working cluster. Mileage is a little less than 200k. But the truck runs great, starts with a turn of the key first time. It has the 5.9l magnum gas engine, with the nv4500 5-speed, has 4.10 gears and does have the limited slip rear end. Does have a goose neck hitch with removable ball. The dash is un cracked in perfect shape only a small tear on the drivers seat. It has a fresh tune-up with oil change. The clutch is strong and ready to go. Heat works great. A/C does not work. An it may need a new turn signal switch, it wont click off turning left. An the steering is a little loose but not bad. It does look to be leaking a little oil around the valve covers and there are a few exhaust manifold bolts that are missing from the previous owner trying to remove them, but they don't seem to be leaking. The truck has been used but not abused so its not perfect but there is a lot of life left in it! A lot of new parts Skyjacker shocks front and rear, new water pump and new trac bar. Like I mentioned at the beginning I really don't want to get rid of the truck I just don't feel like shifting gears anymore, so I'm looking for an automatic.

But, it comes with everything that you would get if you purchased it new including the stock extenders and choke tubes. This gun has never been fired. Price is firm. No Trades! 

I've received a ton of responses that say... I'm interested in the gun, is it still for sale. It's funny that all of those people seem to miss the part about the firm price. I work, I have a family, I'm busy... If $265 is too much for your budget please move on. If you are ready to buy the gun at the firm price then by all means... send a message.

Oh, the other thing is questions about this model of gun. I'm not a shop and my gun knowledge is limited. I'm just a guy who impulsed bought a gun for his son. So, if you have questions about this model of gun it would be best to look it up on Google (or preferably some other search engine who are not liberal commie gun haters).

I have fired around 200 rounds with this and its a beast.  Loud and fun to shoot.  People around you stop shooting to see what the 'hell' you are shooting!!!!   Comes just as I bought it!



The 5.56 PDW Tactical Evo 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

People were not all created equal in size and shape, that's just a fact. This being true, why do manufacturers try to make you change to fit the stock? We think the stock should change to fit you. Our INTRAFUSE® AK T6™ Stock allows you six positions to work with so that it always feels as if it was custom made for you. On top of this, we've made sure that the stock and the tube are both constructed of the highest strength composite available so any worries about damage can be cut to zero. So next time you pick up your AK and realize that it doesn't feel quite as comfortable as it should, do yourself a favor and get an INTRAFUSE ® AK T6™ Stock."

It has a positive mechanical firing pin block for safety, and the twin action bars and striker action result in a very smooth and relatively light trigger pull. The square profile slide and disassembly system give the DB380 a Glock-like appearance. (It looks like a baby Glock.) The DB380 has a locked-breech action, and a striker that is set by the retraction of the slide. The trigger is made of steel, and has a smooth face for comfortable operation.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device
