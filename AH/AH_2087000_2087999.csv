If you know DE, these are near impossible to find, as is the ammo. If you do find one online, you have to pay shipping, maybe tax and an FFL fee. This model new goes for anywhere between 1350.00 to 1699.00 online, again if it is in stock. It took me 2 months to find the magazines at 45 bucks a piece. The ammo if you can find it online goes for 1.50 to 2 bucks a round.
 Price is not negotiable, as this is a good price for all you are getting. Just put a motor in my Jeep and need to offset the cost, so I am not interested in trades right now.

A North Carolina Concealed Carry permit or Sheriff Pistol Purchase Permit is a MUST.  Face to Face only.

The harness retails for $199.95 and the back panel another $65.95. I am asking $175 or $200 trade value. I am specifically looking for a TC Pro Hunter or a semi-auto turkey gun, but I am open to other offers as well. I have a few other adds that can be combined for the right offer.

According to TYR's website, all products are currently made to order. Standard lead-times are between 45 and 60 days from order placement.

This bow is unusual in that it has a aluminum arrow rest assembly that is machined to accept the two arrow guide strips that form a slot to accept the fin adapters and arrow. The string of the bow travels down the center of the rest. Also attached to the rest is an arrow holding spring to keep the arrow in place at all times before the shot. The release is a dual caliper model with a pistol grip handle and trigger. When the bow is drawn the release, rest, string and arrow are all in equal motion. At release only the string and arrow move forward. The rest is mounted to the bow using an aluminum fixture equipped with five rollers. These rollers allow the rest to be drawn with no noise. The attachment fixture is also hinged to allow the bow to be placed in the stored/resting position.

Serial number gives it a manufacture year of 1946. This gun was definitely a shooter, not a safe queen, but it is still in very good condition for its age. Bore is shiny and rifling is good. Everything on this gun functions properly. These guns are hard to find. This would be a great first rifle for a new shooter/hunter, or a great historical piece to add to your collection.

I am asking $200 OBO. I would prefer a cash sale, but I would consider trading for the right gun. Guns I would consider are listed below. It doesn't have to be in the best condition. In fact, I wouldn't mind trading for my next project gun(s). Here are the guns I'd consider:

- Revolvers (S&W's are my favorites)
- All metal semi-auto pistols
- Lever action rifles
- Semi-auto rifles
- Bolt action rifles
- Shotguns

Like I said, I wouldn't mind trading for my next project gun (I'm just about done with my current project) so feel free to shoot me an offer with what you have, regardless of condition."

Its a solid gun, no rust or pitting, beautiful walnut stock. The stock was refinished, has a few scratches, chips in forearm.  The work needed is that I found out the front sight wasn't on and the screw hole was drilled through into the barrel.  So I don't know a lot, but think it messes up the rifling.  Thought about having barrel cut down and making a neat carbine, but thought maybe someone would be interested and have the money to make something of it.  Also one screw on receiver was stripped and buffed smooth so it took the blueing off in an area about size of thumb nail. I can send pics to anyone interested.  Please tell me of your trade, not interested in anything that needs fixed. It is still very solid like a pre-64 and looks to be not shot much at all, I can send pics.  Thanks."

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced.
The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety. 

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

I bought a couple of these a few months ago at the height of the gun and ammo shortage hysteria when the Leftist gun-grabbers in Congress had a scary amount of momentum at their backs, and seemed hell-bent on outlawing every decent semi-auto on the market. But now that things seem to have calmed down, I realize I over-purchased in the midst of all that craziness, and just want to unload a few unnecessary items. This gun has sat in my home for months, it's never been fired, I never even loaded a magazine, all I ever did was dry fire test the trigger the day I picked it up. Other than that, it's not been touched and is in brand new condition just as the day I bought it. Comes with all the original paperwork and carrying/storage case. I have other items for sale as well including surplus ammo, tactical and target rifles, just inquire.

The WRS Level 2 DUTY HOLSTER was designed to mimic the traditional style thumb break used on our standard Level 2 Duty holsters. The WRS Mechanism is extremely fast and perfectly suited for high stress situations such an armed encounter when seconds count and a quick and natural (second nature) draw stroke is needed. The WRS feature allows the user to re-holster their weapon and lock it down with level 2 security quickly and easily by simply rotating the hood back to the locked, upright position. The WRS holster comes with the standard Duty Dropped and Offset belt attachment to make it compatible for carry with most types of body armor while still allowing for a “Full Combat Grip”.

Wanted one of the Khyber Pass Enfield knock-offs as a souvenir.  When I got back and started doing some research it seems this is not a knock off but a real one.  ""Enfield"" was spelled correctly and I couldn't find any of the typo's, mis-marks or other details normally hosed up on the knock-offs.
577/450 caliber, I have two rounds for it that will go with it.
Needless to say, I haven't fired it and would never consider doing so unless a gunsmith said it was good to go.  Picked up the rounds to display with the rifle.    

Neat rifle for the time, though my shoulder aches at the thought of firing it.  Pretty good condition all things considered.

Obviously you need to make your own assessment on this - heck, I thought I was buying a knock off.  So I really am in no position to make definitive representations.  And a real Enfield doesn't carry the same sentiment for me that an Afghan knock-off would have, so I am looking to clear out some safe space or trade.  

Thanks for taking the time to look."

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light—more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X300 Ultra is also versatile and can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X300 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon."

I would consider some trades, but mainly looking for cash. They're not in flawless condition, but since one was made in 1922, it's kind of expected. Let's face it, John Browning designed these things to last. These two guns have been in the family a number of years and it's time to find them a new home. 

Serial# 7212XX

Made in 1945 (barrel code dated), 2 3/4"" 12 Ga. w/ modified barrel, Sportster model. This gun is in fair shape. Most of the bluing is intact and the scroll work is in great condition. Downside, there's some rust and some wear on the stock. In good working order otherwise. I will take somewhat less for this gun than the one below.

Serial# 2424XX

Made in 1922 (serial number dated). 2 3/4"" 12 Ga. w/full barrel. This gun is the older of the two and is in better condition. That said, it's bluing is probably about 85%. No rust, some small dings, but in good working order. Considering the thing in 91-years old, I'd say it was built to last. This has the old saftey (inside the trigger guard), which some refer to as a ""suicide safety"" so, I'd probably keep my finger off the trigger. The barrel isn't original and was made in 1945 (barrel code dated). Also, some joker in my family installed some gel recoil pad that exploded. I uninstalled that thing, but didn't put a new one on. Original screws are in the butt.  If you want this gun, you're going to have to make a good offer.

If a good buyer wants both we'll come to a good arrangement. 

If you're interested in one and not the other, state the serial number in the email. 

If you're confused about the pictures, the one with the scroll work is the 7212XX.

It's a great weapon with a tough and manly feel (for lack of a better description). its .40 cal, that comes with two grip back straps, a few mags, and a paddle holster that is easy to get on and off when needed. I included these three pics so you can get a good look at it. As you can see there are no real scratches or anything like that. It doesn't get used because frankly I prefer to carry my XD. I received this weapon on a trade from another Marine, but have never shot it because I'm disabled and mostly bed bound so I very rarely get out to shoot. But even though the Marines have taken my back out of commission, they could never (nor could anyone else) take the Marines out of my heart and spirit. Part of that spirit comes with a love of firearms. So I'm looking for another weapon to love. 

One small thing though;  I can't drive because of my injury incurred in the Marines makes it difficult to do so. So whoever I trade with or sell to has to be willing to come to me in Belfair.

I'm selling the bow with a bone collector series sight and everything else pictured. The bow can be set between 60-80lbs which is what makes this such an incredibly fast shooting bow. Comes with everything pictured. I have to sell the bow so make me an offer I just moved into a new home and need the money...I hate to part with the bow but I need money. Contact me fastest by texting 419-419-948one. I am open to offers such as an SKS AK or AR. Like I said make me an offer I've got over $1700 in equipment. Bow has been tuned every season so twice now.
