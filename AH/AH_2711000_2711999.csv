I no longer need this truck and am looking to sell or trade it.  It's in excellent running condition and has been well maintained, but it has some minor quirks.

New fuel pump, water pump, and upper control arms, good tread on tires, fairly recent VA inspection, about 157,000 miles, automatic transmission with overdrive, rear wheel drive, no power accessories.  Removed the radio and was planning to upgrade but never got around to it.

The stakeback conversion made this truck ten times more useful than it was before!  The rails and lockable box are attached with bolts and wing-nuts, and I take them off whenever I want to have a flatbed or flatbed with tool box.  When it's just a flatbed, it has a loadable area about 5'5"" wide and 8' long.  (Why do truck makers insist on making beds slightly smaller than a standard 4' x 8' sheet of lumber?!)  I've loaded some significant stacks of drywall and plywood, and the truck is happy to carry it.  The overall cargo room that it has with the rails and box made it so much bigger that I've moved twice with it and it saved me from renting a truck.  We've also moved an old player piano with it.

The quirks are little nuisance quirks, which I simply learned to ignore, but if someone is interested and wants me to get them fixed, I'm sure I can take care of them.  The windshield wipers sometimes go on their own when they feel like it.  (A common Chevy truck thing.)  The ignition cylinder sometimes doesn't hit the starter the first time you turn the key, but just turn again and it'll work just fine.  The dashboard lights flicker like a heavy metal concert.  If the engine hasn't been started for a long time it appears to burn rich for a few seconds, but the motor seems to be in excellent shape anyway.  (Could be a slight oil leak around the valve stem seals, but it doesn't seem to use any fluids between oil changes.)  The side mirrors are loose and need re-aim often.  A screw to tighten it is missing, and I've just never looked for one.  There is a little bit of wheel-well rust.

It's a super reliable truck that has never let us down.  I am now using a car as my ""work truck"", because of my unusual job requirements.

Sorry the truck is so terribly filthy in these pics.

Edit: Oh, and a new battery and oil cap.  May be a good idea to do a front-end alignment since it has new control arms, but that's up to you.  Also the small up-turn in the rear bumper is from my friend borrowing my truck and then backing it into my Shelby.  >_>

Edit: Dropping the price from $999 to $850, thanks

Edit: Final price drop, now $750 (or equivalent trades)."

I refinished the wood myself, red mahogany. The last picture is what it looked like when I bought it. I satin clear coated it so it's not overly glossy. Has the actual Romanian brown pistol grip instead of the black one. I've got three 30 round magazines, a 75 round drum mag, a bayonet, and 280 rounds to go with it. Sights, gas block and all that are straight. I'll trade for a Colt single action army or clone. No redhawks or stuff like that. Vaqueros are fine and ubertis, Cimarron, Pietta, beretta stampede, and such. Will take cash and gun for mine if you've only got a Uberti Cattleman to trade. I need a .45 Colt and I prefer the shorter barrel lengths. If you don't have an SAA then I would trade for an AK74 variant. Preferably a side folder but beggars can't be choosers. I really prefer wood over accessory rails. Will add cash where it is due for a single action or AK. I've got $1000 into this and that's fair with rounds, furniture, and magazines and all. If you've got a bulgarian AK74 or some type of Arsenal (I'll take an Arsenal side folder in any caliber), we're pretty even. If you've got ammo, I'll buy as much as I can with it. No tantals.

The performance of the AimPoint CompM4s Red Dot Sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for generation 3 night vision. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd Gen Night Vision.

Hi Everyone, 

I'm offering a few services:  

1)  Pencil Drawings:  Preferred subject matter is Military/LE/2ND Amendment, but I'll draw a family member, dog, etc...  Price depends on size/how complex it is.  All drawings are pencil on Bristol.  Must provide high resolution photograph for picture.

2) Polymer Stippling:  Just started.  I've only done P-Mags so far.  I'll do custom designs (see Vader Mag)

3) Paracord:  Just started dabbling in this as well.  Could do a sling, belt, bandolier, or even a combination of the three."

For Glock 22.

You may not realize it yet, but you've stumbled upon a great find. Up for sale is a Dvorak Air Recoil System for a Glock 22 Generation 3.

This is the training systems professionals use worldwide. It simulates recoil and cycling of the slide by using pressurized CO2. The cartridges required are your basic variety used in paintball guns (12 gram, I believe) and can be picked up locally at nearly every major retailer or discount store. Each cartridge will give you about 30-50 shots of real slide movement and simulated recoil. If you use this product in tandem with your regular dry fire practice, it is possible to eliminate recoil anticipation and perfect your shots. The system also maintains the weight of your Glock (unlike 22LR conversion kits, which modify the slide and barrel, making the firearm lighter).

There is an integrated laser which is non-functional. It may just be a case of needing fresh batteries or something else. If you wish to get this part working, you may need to contact the manufacturer.

This item is sold AS-IS without any express or implied warranty. All issues are to be directed to the manufacturer. To our knowledge, this item is out of warranty and the manufacturer may refuse or charge for service.

This is not a toy. No firearm is included with this kit. CO2 cartridges must be purchased separately. This product was tested on a Glock 22 Gen 3.

The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and
control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.

Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.

Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Just installed a NOS Weaver one piece #74 Scope Base on it, as well as a Razorback Sling, it is ready to scope and hunt with. Very accurate even with the iron sights, and the matte finish makes it harder to see in low light conditions. Both barrels fire. Uses Mossberg 500 Accuchokes, so chokes are plentiful.

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

This kit will convert your Glock 20 (10mm) or Glock 21 (45ACP) into a Glock 22LR. It is a wonderful kit for practice using lower cost ammunition. It has adjustable sights, last round open, and a firing pin safety. And the trigger feels exactly the same as your service Glock.

This kit is new to like-new in box. Only thing is that is sat on the shelf for quite awhile, and the bottle of Break Free (lubricant) leaked out into the box, which was ultimately a good thing (keeping the parts clean and preserved) if it wasn't a little bit of a mess to clean. So, you will need to buy another bottle of Break Free or use your own dry lubricant.

Will include case, holster, mag pouch and FOUR magazines. Gun and mags are mint, very low round count. Holster and mag pouch have been ceracoated blue and then repainted black. They've seen better days. I owned four xdms at one point, and this is my last one so it ended up with the worst holster from the bunch. Also, I don't have the additional backstraps for this one.

This is for 52 rounds. This is the deepest penetrating .380 on the market. Would carry this as your last two rounds in your .380 for maximum penetration. 

380 Auto +P Ammo - 100 gr. Hardcast F.N. (1150fps/ M.E. 294 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto +P loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame.

Item 27A/20 is a 100gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,150 fps out of my 3.75 inch BDA (Browning Double Action). We've used a flash suppressed powder for all three of our 380 auto loads so that you wont be blinded by your own gunfire if you have to shoot in the dark and since around 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, the chances that your own gunfire will blind you while you are trying to save your life, are good - we've eliminated this variable by using flash suppressed powder. We've also chosen a flat nosed solid bullet. The flat on the nose ensures that the bullet will cut/smash its way through flesh and bone and do much more destruction than typical round nose FMJ bullets. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities recorded from my personal 380 auto pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not exaggerated speeds produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo, is truly what you get in the ""real world"", where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight-line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 380 auto pistol and the trade-off is that you are now going to have to stay alive with that pistol and over penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family."

I went through my safes and ammo. I have about 3000 rounds of 22 long rifle I am willing to  get rid of. I have recently gone to an Academy and Bass Pro Shop to look for a holster and some camping gear and was made aware of the 22 long rifles are pretty well non existent, due in part because of some Regular Gents that are showing up and scarfing it up and gouging the price on here and taking it to the Gun Shows and raping people for 12 to 15 cents a round. I went and seen it for myself after seeing photos of them posted on OKShooters and sure enough that is what is going on. 

Anyways, I have little over 3000 rounds that I would sell to whoever needs any for kids to shoot. I figure with time, gas and such after this stupid scare goes by, I will probably spend 7 cents a round to replace it in the future. 

So 7 cents around and would like to see it sell at Max 500 rounds per person for your kids to shoot with or will sell in smaller quantities as well. 

I help flag off the gouged up prices on here. I hope 7 cents a round is not considered gouging as I think it will cost me that much to replace it, in the future. 

 And I am telling you now, you gents that have been showing up at Academy and BassPro Shop, I know your faces, so don't come to buy any. I want it to go for the kids. If this goes well, then I may even let go of another 3 to 5k rounds.

What makes Hornady dies better?
Hornady reloading dies represent the finest in machined craftsmanship. Articulated details offer more precise reloading, by offering easier adjustments, better alignment and smoother functioning. With one of the finest internal finishes in the industry, Hornady Custom Grade and Match Grade Dies provide a lifetime of reloading. They're so well crafted that they're guaranteed never to break or wear out from normal use.

Zip Spindle™ Design
The Zip Spindle™ design on all full length size dies positively locks to eliminate slippage. A series of light threads cut on both the spindle and spindle collet allows you to make incremental adjustments by turning the spindle or you can easily “zip it” up or down for larger movements.

Smooth Finish
Internal die profile is precision machined and polished to a smooth finish that delivers reliable functioning without case sticking or excessive friction.

Lock Rings with Wrench Flats
The Hornady Sure-Loc™ lock rings clamp around the entire die applying constant pressure across the threads to hold the ring in place. The locking screw tightens the ring without ever coming into contact with the threads, eliminating possible damage from pliers.

Elliptical Expander
Superior to “ball expanders,” this Hornady exclusive provides extremely smooth neck sizing and significantly reduces friction and case neck stretch. Internal threading prevents it from pulling loose and the elliptical expander also eliminates the need for a separate expander die for necking-up to the next caliber.

Seater Adjustment Screw
Seater adjustment screw easily adjusts for bullet seating depths.

Retainer Ring
Locking retainer spring removes in seconds for easy disassembly and cleaning of the die.

In-line Bullet Seating System
Our seating system holds the bullet, the case neck and the seating stem in perfect alignment in the sleeve BEFORE the bullet enters the neck of the case. The system includes a floating bullet alignment sleeve, a floating steel seating stem and a built-in crimper for benchrest precision. Bullets are aligned in the sleeve as they enter the die for optimum seating and enhanced accuracy.

Built-in Crimper
The built-in crimper gives you the option of crimping without the need for an extra crimp die thus saving a station on your press.

Easy Access Die Boxes

The box is not included.  This was the basis for a long range project that just isn't going to happen.  My loss your gain.  Asking $700 for all.

You can change to 9mm, .40 S&W or 45ACP with a couple simple changes, even allowing the shooter to customize grip size. 
Along with the pistol are two holsters. One right hand IWB Old Faithful Holster and one left hand OWB Kydex paddle Blackhawk holster.
I will negotiate the price, only because I have mounting medical bills.

The rifle was built a few years ago by a gunsmith as his own. I purchased it with zero round count and have only shot about 70 rounds through it to break in the barrel and a few for groups.  It groups between .5 MOA and .9 MOA depending on the ammunition.  Included with the rifle is 1 Box of Weatherby factory ammunition, a partial box of Federal 180 gr partitions, and about 40 handloads I have loaded.  I have probably about 80-100 peices of brass for it from Nosler, Weatherby, and Remington.  I will include RCBS full length dies as well.  If you'd like more pictures I can supply those as well.  I'm sure I have missed something in the description. I would like to trade for an AR-15 and cash on your end.  I will also entertain trades for other firearms I paid $1,650 for the rifle by it self with no scope, rings or bases and probably have easily $400.00 in reloading supplies and ammunition that goes with it.  I will not split any of this up.  Shoot me an offer, cash or trade, on here via email and I will get back with you as soon as I can.  Thanks for looking.

This listing is for a NEW black Kel-Tec Sub 2000 G22 folding carbine, chambered in .40 S&W with a 16.1"" barrel. It accepts all Glock Model 22 magazines, and comes with one 15-round G22 mag. This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 22 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun.  The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range.  The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.  This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.  

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle.  The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear.  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.  The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

This listing is for a NEW black Kel-Tec Sub 2000 folding carbine, chambered in .40 S&W with a 16.1"" barrel. It accepts all Smith & Wesson Model 4006 magazines, and comes with one 11-round magazine. This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available S&W 4006 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.
