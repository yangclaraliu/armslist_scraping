FAQ

Q. How do I buy?

www.preciseshooter.com -> FAQ -> How to buy, read the requirements, and make the
appointment to pick up.

Q. I am interested in your gun. Is it still available?
A. If you see this ad, most likely. The firearms are reserved for pickup on my web site,
by making an appointment to buy. Someone could be doing it right now, and first person
to reserve the firearm wins. Go to www.preciseshooter.com -> FAQ -> How to buy,
read the requirements, and make the appointment on the site. If someone has made it just
before you, I will notify you within a short time (usually, an hour), otherwise - see you
shortly.

Q. I am interested in your gun. Call me @ xxx-xxx-xxxx
A. Excellent. Go to www.preciseshooter.com -> FAQ -> How to buy,
read the requirements, and make the appointment to pick it up.

Q. Where are you located?
A. Queen Anne neighborhood in Seattle.

Q. Can we meet in Burien on Monday morning?
A. No, FFL requirements are that the transfers happen at a licensed location. Also, the only
times you can come over are the appointments that you can reserve on the site. No other
time slots are available.

Q. I see you carry Savage rifles. Can you find me MKII FV-SR?
A. No. Please see here for what I can or cannot do: http://www.preciseshooter.com/NotInStock.aspx

Q. Do you take trades?
A. Sometimes. However:
a) firearms only,
b) they need to be our of current production (I can get new ones at wholesale prices), or you have to
offer them to me at well below wholesale
c) I do not resell the trades, so they should fit my personal interests (which only include military
as well as highly accurate, competition guns - no self defense guns like Glocks, M&Ps, XD*, and the like)
d) the exchange rate should be fair (see

Description

The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 is a bolt-action rifle chambered in 7.62X54mmR. The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 was introduced to the Russian/USSR military in 1891 and stayed in service until the end of World War II. In fact, it became the standard issue service rifle beginning in 1930 to all Russian soldiers and, during WWII, commonly used as a sniper rifle. It has standard features for a military rifle of its time such as iron sights, wooden stock and bayonet stud. It was mass-produced and often rushed through production, however, it was still surprising accurate

THE RIFLE SIMPLY FEELS BETTER WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.

FORGED UPPER & LOWER RECEIVERS

Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.

Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.

REDUCED WEIGHT, YET LIGHTER RECOIL

Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.

REDUCED MASS, FORGED, MONOLITHIC BOLT CARRIERWITH FORWARD ASSIST

New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension.

BEVELED MAG WELL

The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes.

IMPROVED BOLT & BARREL EXTENSION

An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.

IMPROVED EXTRACTOR & ELASTOMER EXTRACTOR SPRING

Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.

DUAL EJECTORS

The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.

STEEL FEED RAMP

GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types.

ENLARGED EJECTION PORT

Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.


Ohio residents add 7.25% sales tax. Can be picked up in person by appointment or shipped to an FFL in your area for $8.99 if needed.

excellent durability. The monolithic frame which supports cylinder and

and 38 special LCR models. The powerful LCR-357 model is made from
blackened 400 series stainless steel. The LCRx model features an external
hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode. The Crimson Trace
models allow for fast and positive target acquisition, and offer the
advantage of a laser sighting system in a more compact grip. It also
includes a soft case."

excellent durability. The monolithic frame which supports cylinder and
barrel, is made from aerospace grade, 7000 series aluminum in 22LR, 22WMRF
and 38 special LCR models. The powerful LCR-357 model is made from
blackened 400 series stainless steel. The LCRx model features an external
hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode. The Crimson Trace

The Marlin 56 is a classic. It's a very unique rifle, this is one of the originals that has a steel receiver that has a serial number and a solid walnut stock. I believe only a few thousand were serial numbered because at the time it was not required and actually cost more to do. Later models were made out of aluminum and didn't last long. What's really nice about this rifle is it uses a cam and roller system so the lever only has a 25 degree throw, meaning you can fire and load the next round comfortably without losing sight on the target.

The new SIG SAUER Homeland Security Pistols are the same models we build for the Department of Homeland Security. When the government needed new pistols to protect America they turned to SIG SAUER for the SIG SAUER P229. Now, a limited production run of 1,000 P229 HSP pistols are available engraved with the American flag and “Homeland Security 1 of 1000”. Additionally, each is engraved with serial number barcoding just like the pistols we ship to DHS and the U.S. Coast Guard. Each HSP pistol also features the new DAK trigger, a stainless steel Nitron slide topped with SIGLITE night sights, and a light weight alloy frame with integral Picatinny rail.

The pistol is finished off with presentation walnut double diamond grips. This full sized, long slide pistol is a full sized frame and 6"" stainless steel match bushing barrel. The pistol was manufactured as one of three produced this year! The 6"" bushing barrel has a high polish steep reverse crown and a two piece guide rod inside a donut plug. The grip is blended in with a slim competition speed chute, for smooth, quick magazine changes. The front strap checkering is a special checkering we worked with Vic Tibbets to implement. It provides excellent grip while reducing abrasion during heavy shooting. The front sight is a classic gold bead with a U notch serrated pyramid adjustable sight. The pistol comes with two ten round ETM mags in the factory logo bag with manuals and documents! If you want the superb accuracy of a Wilson long slide pistol with the exceptionally low recoil of the 9mm, this is the ideal, top of the line Wilson pistol for you! The Patriot series pistols capture the historic relevance of the 1911 pistol is traditional and elegant finish combinations with modern technology that bring back the memory of a time in our country's history where the USA was at the top of its game, people cared about high quality at any price, and we all celebrated freedoms that our founders and so many millions have fought for in the past and today."

This was my grandfathers backup pistol he carried while on duty years ago. The firearm has been fired less than 5 times and has been sitting in a closet in his house for years. Its in beautiful condition with no scratches, pitting, etc. Functions extremely well with no known issues whatsoever. The handle has normal handling ware but the metal is in pristine condition. I inherited this firearm from him after he passed and am looking to sell it because I simply have to many pistols. Colt .38's are known for their dependability and reliability especially in sticky situations which is why it was traditionally used as a backup weapon.
