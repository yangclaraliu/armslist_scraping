 Original owner, factory storage case, manual, and packaging included. This revolver is in near new condition. The outside is free of scratches and the cylinder and bore look perfect. The size and shape work excellent as a pocket carry gun. With the option of using .357 Magnum ammo there is a lot of stopping power for such a compact piece. You can't say that about the little 380 auto loaders out there! 

 From manufacturer website:
 If traveling light is the order of the day, look no further than the Taurus Protector. Featuring a fully shrouded zero-profile hammer that can be manually cocked/decocked in single action operation when needed - and five rounds of .38 Special +P or .357 Magnum ammo, the 851 revolver is the perfect choice for concealed carry when every ounce counts. The Protector features the Taurus Security System built in at no extra charge.

Chambered in 7.62x39

This is an all numbers matching SKS in nice condition. When I got it, it had not been shot and was still fully packed in cosmoline. This Paratrooper also has an original metal ""cheese grater"" gas piston cover. This option is very uncommon.

The Paratrooper is a shorter barreled, shorter stock version of the standard SKS. All the action components and frame are identical so standard SKS upgrades will also fit the same. For reference, here is a photo of the different variations of SKS available, the Paratrooper is on top:

History:

The Smith & Wesson Model 59 was a modification of the S&W Model 39 pistol that had a double-column magazine. It was one of the first generation of Smith & Wesson semi-automatics.

It was designed for the U.S. Navy as a large-capacity version of the S&W Model 39, the basis of their Mark 22 ""Hush Puppy"" silenced pistol.  The Model 59 went on the market in 1971.  It went out of production a decade later in 1980.

Design:

The Model 59 was manufactured in 9mm Parabellum caliber with a wider anodized aluminum frame (to accommodate a double-stack magazine), a straight backstrap, a magazine disconnect (the pistol will not fire unless a magazine is in place), and a blued carbon steel slide that carries the manual safety. The grip is of three pieces made of two nylon plastic panels joined by a metal backstrap. It uses a magazine release located to the rear of the trigger guard, similar to the M1911A1.

This rifle is brand new, still in the original factory plastic, only removed for pictures. It is unfired and absolutely unused in anyway. I purchased this rifle new from Gander Mountain not very long ago for an upcoming hunting trip. Well, the trip fell through and I really have no need for this rifle. That said, I don't NEED to sell it either so please don't waste my time or yours with low ball type offers. 

Some fun facts about this rifle, most of which is why I end up deciding on this model:

- It can shoot both 5.56 and .223 ammo (unlike most .223 bolt actions that can only shoot .223 ammo). I have several AR's and have a lot of 5.56 ammo accumulated and t's nice to know I can shoot the 5.56 with this rifle as well.
- It has a fully adjustable trigger, as in the owner can adjust it in about 5 minutes without needing any fancy tools or an expensive gunsmith. 
- The barrel is 1:9 twist, meaning is can properly stabilize up to 69 grain ammo. Many .223 bolt action rifles are 1:12 twist meaning they cannot effectively shoot anything higher than 55 grain ammunition. This is important for distance shooting and accuracy.
- This rifle is designed to use standard AR15 magazines. Yup, you read that correctly. any size or form of standard AR15 magazine fits fine (ex. 5/10/20/30 rounders, polymer type like Magpul or metal type like issued by the military...all work in this rifle). No more trying to hunt down specific hard to find magazines, only to pay through the nose.
- Military spec bolt (meaning it is both durable, lightweight, and effective)
- Fluted barrel (20"") for reduced weight and heat dissipation. 
- Integral Weaver-style 2-piece bases for such things as optics

Here is a link to the rifle I purchased from the place I bought it from:
http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Mossberg-MVP-Varmint-Centerfire-Rifle&i=721783&r=view&from=grid

I am willing to take a bit of a loss, within reason, after all it is still brand new unfired. Price is $550. I also have a nice unused rifle butt-stock pouch and cheek pad that holds extra ammo and other stuff as well. I will include this in the deal (paid $45 for it).

To purchase - must be at least 18 years of age with a valid government issued ID. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the Akron area. CHL/CCW holders preferred."

The plug in is a 4 pin flat,nice and simple. Trailer wheel fenders are aluminum with the drivers side on hinges to allow you to open the drivers door to get in and out. Low riding trailer so it pulls straight and true. The only reason i,m selling is i,m looking for a heavier trailer that will haul my compact tractor with backhoe and bucket.

They have to build them idiot proof for obvious reasons.Tires are true UHAUL trailer tires not auto tires and are in good condition. The trailer weighs 2000 pounds empty.This is ready to haul now! I pull frequently from Maine, New York, Mass and Conn. . I would consider many different items in partail, full trade or for the right item i can kick is some greenbacks! What i,m looking for is a Dump trailer, or a flatbed factory built (no homemade) trailer that has a GVW of 7000 with ramps or a tilt bed for my compact tractor.

384,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2777384,For Sale:  Browning BPS Deer Hunter 20 ga slug  Like New,"Southern Maryland, Maryland, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Saturday, November 15, 2014",Shotguns,Browning                                                                                ,20 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Offered is my Browning BPS Deer Hunter 20 ga slug gun in Excellent Plus Condition. It has a very nice matte finish on the steel and the walnut is beautiful with a low luster oil finish. I bought this for my wife but she didn't much care for 'sitting in a tree' as she called it, so here it is. The shotgun is  zero'ed in and ready to hunt right now; it is very accurate and has mild recoil, perfect for youngsters, ladies, or anyone tired of getting beat up by 12 ga slug recoil. The Burris Signature E-Dot series scope and rings are included. This scope is a high quality Made in America Burris E Dot Signature Series 1.5-6x32 scope with a small electronic red dot in the middle of the crosshairs, you just put the red dot on the target and pull the trigger, very intuitive for anyone to use, especially for anyone who may not know alot about hunting but grew up playing video games. The red dot has a variable intensity switch and the crosshairs are still there with or without the red dot being turned on, so you dont have to have batteries for the scope to function, it is mounted in matching Burris Signature scope rings and it zero'ed in to this shotgun. This shotgun also accepts a standard Browning BPS bird barrel, making it useful for wing and small game hunting as well.  This is a current production model Browning and you can see a better picture and the specifications at Browning's website. Will meet buyer in Southern Maryland from Annapolis south for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public setting during daylight hours, buyer must be legal Maryland resident and not prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms; active duty Military stationed in Maryland ok. You can find a cheaper 20 ga deer/slug gun, but you will never regret buying a Browning. Great gun for wild boar and black bear as well as deer, home defense too. Price is firm. There is no sales tax or paperwork on this type of sale."

 I've had this gun for 8yrs and it looks new. However, it has locked up with the bolt in the open position and it will not move. Holds 1 in the chamber and 7 in the tube. I think its a 20"" barrel and it is all stock no mods. I really hate to part with it, but its doing me no good.  Great deal for someone who can fix it.

Additionally, it is olive green instead of light grey.

Waterproof and accurate to ± 10 mils with a 0-6400 mils ring, the  M2: 6050 model features an induction dampened needle for quick and accurate readings.  And the gear driven magnetic declination adjustment allows for east or west declination settings to 180 degrees.

The vertical angle scale featuring 1 degree increments has a range of ± 90 degrees or 100% grade scale with an accuracy of ± 1/2 degree.  A percent grade scale features increments of 5%.

Other special features include the precision aligned mirror with convenient ""see through"" sighting capability, short and long sights, composite body material with minimal thermal mass, jeweled bearings, and bubble levels.

An absolutely superb pistol! This was my first SIG and it is a gem. It's the same as the standard P220 .45, with the exception of the shorter barrel, shortened grip and the addition of night sights, and a beavertail non-bite system.  My glove size is Medium to Large, and the pistol fits me nice.  I was first concerned about the short grip, but lower part of the butt fits right in to the heel of my hand, and is very controllable under recoil.  Double action first shot, and able to safely carry one up the spout... and subsequent shots are with the SRT trigger, which lets you get them off FAST! (you could cock the hammer and do all shots with the SRT if you like)  Like all Sigs, it's very accurate too, even with my marginal reloads (softballs - lead).  Suggested Retail for this model is around $1100 (who ever charges that?) but I have seen them for about 1K retail - new.  Round count through this one is around 200 or thereabouts.  No taxes, no shipping, no other fees - $750 cash on the barrel.
Note: 6 round magazine in gun is pictured - 2nd 8 round mag next to pistol!
Please take in consideration that I answer e-mails from my desktop usually only once or twice a day.
I might consider a p232 (black) as partial trade or perhaps a M11-A1 or p239nitron.  The only other Non-Sig I might consider is an HK P9s .45 or a Kimber Solo
Thanks for Taking a Look.  You can't go wrong with a SIG!"

This is a brand new gun that has never been fired by me and still has the tag on it.  It comes w/ 5x 30 round magazines, a magazine pouch, bayonet w/ scabbard, and a sling.

If you don't know anything about the VZ models I highly suggest you look them up.  These rifles are hard to come by, and people usually jack up the prices on them.

I'm more interested in a trade rather than a sale, but If I did sell it I would be asking $575 for it.  I don't price gouge like 99% of gun sellers nowadays so don't try to low ball me.  The price I'm selling it for includes the transfer fee I paid, so I'm just trying to get out of it what I put in.

For a trade I have my eye on a S&W M&P 9.  The model I'm looking for is a 5"" Pro, but am willing to talk about any M&P 9 model if we can agree on a mutual trade.

It is an original Series 1 gun so no Schwartz safety like the current versions. I am the original owner and would estimate that the gun has had maybe 400 rds fired through it. 

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim a bit. I had a magwell on it at one time and put a set of blue Carbon Creation grips on it. Magwell has since been put on another of my 1911's and in it's place is a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have thr factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included. I'm not sure where the factory wood grips went.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

I dont have any particular trades in mind but know what it is worth. Any trade offers +/- cash should include the cash figure.

Mainly interested in other handguns, I have enough hunting bolt actions but may consider a smaller caliber rifle or custom rifle of equal value with +/- cash as needed.

It has 20rds through the barrel to test both mags and dial in the dope.  It's an extremely accurate AK (better than my Arsenal, same as my VEPR, the VEPR gets 2"" groups at 100yds with irons on surplus ammo effortlessly).  You should have no problem with easily achieving the same accuracy.  

It has been upgraded tremendously.  It comes with a Midwest Industries AK-SS Extended Handguard with a custom ordered Midwest Industries Yugo upper section, and Troy Industries Vertical Grip.

It has also been coated with KG Industries 2400 Series coatings (this is not the Brownell's junk).  KG 2400 is far more durable than Cerakote and holds up much better to abuse, I have tested it extensively.  I coat firearms professionally and use KG's products on all personal firearms as well as my customer's with dramatically better results over Cerakote.  When we meet I can show you a pre-80's series Colt Combat Commander that has had 540rds through it since it was coated.  The only way you can even tell it's been fired is if you strip it and look at the carbon build up on the inside of the frame.  The coating also makes it extremely easy to clean the rifle, just field strip, and wipe it down.  No need for oil either.  KG 2400 is self lubricating and very convenient.  This AK is rustproof.  The whole rifle has been coated; external barrel, receiver, internal receiver, Tapco G2 trigger, gas tube, piston rod, bolt carrier, top cover, everything.  It sheds water and debris like no other and is extremely smooth.  It's shoots very smoothly as well.     

This whole rifle is top-notch.  Buy with confidence.  It has been thoroughly inspected by me for all the most common AK issues.  It is 110%.  Windage on the front sight is dead center and dead on, only adjustment ever needed is elevation in the rear sight for range.  It is dialed in at 25yds currently.  

It is ready to go for any 1913 pic-rail optics you could ever want to put on it.  

Only one reason I'm even considering selling this rifle:
1.  I have the opportunity to buy three more AK's for the price of one and I gotta do it quick.  

Solid and ready to rock.  The Zatstava rifles are a cut above.  Far, far above the WASR crap out there.

The case itself is still in ""functional"" order. Hinges are smooth, lock still works, the keys for the lock are in the original zip loc in the storage compartment. There is some slight finish wear on the headstock from sliding the tuner on and off. The guitar sounds amazing to this day. It's in excellent shape, no dings or scratches or busted out holes. It is, however, missing the high G string, and if you know anything about high G strings, you'll know they're the thinnest of all the strings and have to be tuned to the highest note. This is a great package for beginners and experienced players alike. Now you, too, can play like John Denver or Jimmy Page

Lone Eagle / SSP86 Single Shot pistol, chambered in the rare and very effective and very efficient .357 Herrett. 12"" barrel, cannon breech. Pretty nice trigger.  INCLUDES SCOPE, RINGS, MOUNTS, RELOADING DIES AND ABOUT 100 CASES!  Includes a Burris 2X pistol scope with target turrets (with the rings and mounts). I bought this new when they first came out. I can't see worth a damn any more, so away it goes. I think it is about the perfect hunting pistol. It's short enough to carry on the forearm of my left arm, and is instantly available to shoot. I normally carried mine uncocked, and cocked just before using it (easy) which was easier than disengaging the safety. It's small enough to slip into your hunting jacket while on a stand or in a snowstorm. I have taken a number of whitetails with mine, and none went anywhere after the 1st shot. The .357 Herrett has .35 Remington Rifle performance in a slightly shorter case. I use the 180 grain pistol bullets and AA1680 powder at about 21-2200fps (not bad out of a 12"" barrel). Recoil is manageable, and the pistol is not that heavy. You don't need a big honking flash hider/muzzle brake, which keeps the package smaller, and won't blow out your eardrums quite as fast! I also have RCBS dies and some formed brass that is INCLUDED!! Feel free to ask questions; Thanks for looking. Note: This is a handload only proposition! No factory ammo is available! Note: I forgot to mention that the pistol is easy to handle and to control under recoil due to the balanced location of the grip. The Lone Eagle series are really nice pistols."

Price is slightly negotiable, but again, this gun is brand new so you are saving good money over retail.

It was purchased as a personal defense arm, but the owner was unable to keep it in the house because of an anti-gun democrat Obama voter in the household. This little guy is a political refugee seeking asylum and the warm loving hands of a dedicated owner.
