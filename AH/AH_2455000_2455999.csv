This is a 6 1/2' barrel, long slide with adjustable rear sights.  This is another firearm I was allowed to purchase from a quality private collection belonging to an elderly gentleman whom I am proud to say has become my friend. This firearm is marked IAI for Irwindale Arms Inc. From my research and the weapons serial number I believe this is a Pasadena gun manufactured early in IAI's manufacturing days, which would make it DOM early 80's. It can be said that IAI/AMT did not fare well in the business world and in 1995 they declared bankruptcy. Their trademark was sold off and was passed from one manufacture to the next until it was acquired by the High Standard Manufacturing Company in Huston Tx. This is a GREAT opportunity to own a rare firearm, in a unique caliber."

The common thinking is that all of this series rifles were produced in 1945. This example has a matching bolt and receiver.The pictures included with this listing show a fair and accurate representation of this weapons condition. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have about this or any of my firearms. 

As the war progressed, more and more cost saving measures were  employed to reduce the demand for raw materials and increase production speed. First introduced in 1939, the Type 99 Arisaka included several interesting, albeit functionally unnecessary features such as a folding mono-pod and anti-aircraft sights. However, the Type 99 also employed features which were very beneficial as well as useful to the infantry soldier and included a chrome lined barrel, a first for a production military weapon, as well as adjustable sights. As the tides of war began turning against the Japanese in 1943 and  resources were becoming increasingly scarce, production and the design of the Type 99 began to change dramatically. The mono-pod and anti-aircraft sights were the first features to be eliminated. The full length cleaning rod was replaced by a much shorter version designed to be pulled through the bore. Later production design changes saw the shortening of the hand-guard to reduce the need for wood, as well as the metal butt-plate being replaced by a simple thin wooden plate which was held in place with nails. Next to go were the  dustcover, adjustable sights and the protective ears surrounding the front sight. The checkering on the safety knob was also eliminated and by the end of WWII the Type 99 Arisaka bore little resemblance its original design.

	So many changes resulted in the rifle being referred to as the ""Substitute Standard Type 99"", now simply referred to by collectors as a ""Last Ditch"" rifle.

 The Arisaka rifle was never imported into the U.S. in great numbers and as a result most of the rifles which are now in collections, were brought home from the Pacific Theater by Marines and Army Soldiers who fought during the Pacific Campaign."

Mags actually hold 24 rounds, not quite sure why they are always advertised as 22 round mags, but they certainly hold 24 rounds without a problem. This is a GREAT gun and I am sad to sell it, but I desire another shotgun. I ALWAYS clean my guns after the range, and this GSG has only seen the range two times. This would be an EXCELLENT Christmas gift for that gun owner in your life! Possibly a total of 300 rounds down the tube, it has very little wear and tear, and is in perfect working order. It comes with a Barska scope and 4 Hi-Cap 22 round mags and approximately 700 rounds quality 22LR. Also comes with the bolt/screw upgrade kit but I have not taken the time to install it yet. I have also installed the HK Push Pin upgrade so that removing the stock is simple and only takes seconds.  These go for $479.99 New on Gander Mountains website, and I am including about $300 worth of extras! Thats a value of over $700.  This is a STEAL for you!  I just want some cash to put toward another gun I more strongly desire.  Thank you for your consideration.  Open to trade for Mossberg 500 w/ Breacher Barrel (I will add cash if necessary). $295 OBO.

So the good is that the action will clean up very easily,no rust/pitting and has a 2 position beuhler safety in it and it has been drilled and tapped for scope use. The bad, is the .219 cartridge is based on the 30-30 win case head which will limit cartridge selection when putting a new barrel on.The rifle is currently a single shot, so there is no magazine follower or spring. It is a complete rifle and even will come with a set of dies for the .219.

This weapon was copied by the Russian's and produced as the PPSh 41. However, the accuracy of the Suomi was superior to the mass produced PPSh, thanks to a longer barrel.

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

Bayonet  production by Nagoya itself are early models dating to 1936-37. After this time period, greater demands were made for weapons of all types. To answer this call for increasing the weapons needed for WWII The Nagoya Arsenal began acting as a supervising/quality control entity for a number of other subcontractors who were also producing bayonets. This particular bayonet bears only the Nagoya Arsenal mark, identifying its DOM in the 1936-37 range. During this time period Japan was preparing to invade China and began laying the ground work for WWII. While I have no confirming provenance proving this bayonet was actually used in WWII, given its DOM and the events surrounding this time period, I believe there is a very good chance this weapon did indeed see action in WWII.

Overall this bayonet and scabbard are in good to very good condition. The blueing on the bayonet itself has been replaced by the patina of time, the blade itself has NOT been sharpened and the wooden handles remain tight. The pictures included with this listing show a fair and accurate representation of this weapons condition. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have about this or any of my listings."

LaserLyte®, innovators in firearms laser technologies, have developed a new interactive target system with dual modes for reaction and training; the Reaction Tyme Target, TLB-RT. This new laser training system comes with two (2) targets for more realistic training scenarios. Each target works independently of each other providing the user a variety of scenarios from near-to-far or left-to-right shooting.



The interactive system works in two modes; reaction and training. The reaction mode features random LED signals in intervals of three to seven seconds that can be shot with any of the LaserLyte® Trainers. When a hit is made the target celebrates with two beeps and a LED flash. The training mode allows the user to practice trigger control and accuracy with an always-on and ready-to-be-shot mode. When a hit is made, the target sounds two beeps and the LED flash.



The LaserLyte® Reaction Tyme Target allow for new and experienced shooters to gain increased levels of confidence and skills in the comfort of their own home while saving money on ammunition. The twin targets provide an active training session that can be set-up in a variety of ways. Any of the LaserLyte® Trainers work with the TLB-RT including the LT-PRO, LT-1 and the LaserLyte® Trainer Cartridges in .223, .380, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

--Pistol
--(4) 10-round S&W original magazines
--Apex Duty Carry Action Enhancement Kit ($90 kit) installed (new striker block and spring, new sear and sear spring, new trigger return spring) with all original parts included.

--1 box (20 rounds) Federal Hydrashok 230 grain defense rounds
--Original case, papers, test casing, etc...

I'm not going to be one of those people that claims ""only 25 rounds fired..."".  There are several hundred rounds fired through this gun, I didn't keep track.  Never any malfunctions, shoots like a dream.  Ask around for opinions on the Apex kits in these pistols.  It was cleaned after every use.  Internals and barrel are in excellent shape.  Cosmetically it is in very good shape.

If you add up the retail value of the whole package, we're at around (new) $800 worth of gear.  I don't think I'm out of line asking $525 cash OBO. I love this pistol, only reason I'm selling is to fund a 1911.   Please no lowball offers, I won't respond.  No trades, please.

all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)

the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

All that is pictured is what's with it. Mount,Allen tool,Manual/Installations instructions. Those of you who maybe unfamiliar with UltiMAK,most agree they're the best when it comes to optic mounts for the rifles that are notorious for having many options that all FAIL! Such as the many different AK variants, UltiMAK has em all covered. The M-12 is still considerably new,but what's not new is other M1 Garand optic mounts. Installing this is that easy as it simply replaces the Garands top hand guard. Step by Step verbal&pictured illustrations for easy installation! Fantastic setup this is and works great! I'm not selling it because of dislike but rather to get fast CASH for rifle that's more rare that I'll always be able to buy again this mount. 100$ is deal and my paper work shows I bought it in March'13 and it's price is 180$ NEW!

Browning’s vest pocket pistol was essentially a miniaturized version of the Model 1903 with a striker to ignite the cartridge (in place of the hammer used in the earlier design) and with no manual safety. Browning offered the diminutive pistol to Colt’s as early as 1904, but they turned him down, so he took the design to FN, who manufactured it as the Pistolet Browning 6.35mm. FN received Browning’s prototype in 1905, and the first production pistols went on sale in July 1906. 
The first variant of the FN Browning Model 1906, like Browning’s prototype, had no manual safety and featured only a grip safety. There was no mechanism to hold the slide open, either for reloading or for disassembly.  The early trigger was a narrow, flat piece of machined metal, curved in front to fit the finger, with a smooth surface. Approximately 130,000 of the first variant guns were manufactured between 1906 and 1909. . This was made by Fabrique Nationale in Herstal, Belgium. The barrel is 2"" long.
These guns sell for over $500 if you can find one. This one has very nice bluing and would make a great collector pistol or use.  Fires fine. Includes hardcase and ammo (2/3 box). Hard to find in this condition and price!

Cash, face-to face. Proof of age (DL) and bill of sale. Would consider FFL to FFL transfer.  Sorry not interested in trades at this time."

Armslist Classifieds are just that - intended to be classifieds; not a discussion forum (I believe Armslist actually has a forum though) for letting the world know what you think of everything. Personally, I really don't care, nor do most people care what you think of people's asking prices or different Gun Shows that you don't like!

It seems that these classifieds are getting more and more polluted with annoying crap posts like this. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but there are appropriate places to voice them - the classifieds section of AL is not one of them!

If something is priced to high in your opinion; simply don't buy it and move on with your life...nobody has authority to regulate what someone can ask for something and if something is higher than you feel it should be priced; it's the potential buyer's decision and responsibility to educate themselves - It's not your responsibility.  

Please take these kinds of annoying posts to an appropriate place and leave the Armslist Classifieds for classifieds ads."

Chambered for .38-200, (not a 38 special) a cartridge specifically designed for military use, the Enfield No. 2 Mk 1 was the standard British sidearm in the Second World War. The No. 2 Mk 1 was born when British authorities began searching for a double-action revolver with less weight and recoil than the Webley they'd been using, that could be quickly mastered by a minimally-trained soldier and gave him a good probability of hitting an enemy with the first shot at extremely close ranges. The .38-200 round was created by combining a .38 S&W catridge with a 200 grain bullet. By using such a long, heavy, round-nosed lead bullet in a .38 caliber cartridge, it was found that the bullet, being minimally stabilized for its weight and caliber, tended to tumble longitudinally when striking an object, theoretically increasing wounding and stopping ability of human targets at short ranges. This double-action-only revolver features a fixed blade front sight with a rear groove, grips, and a saddle ring. Its metal is in fair condition and its bore is in good condition.
Cabelas & GM both listed their gun for over $500 (have copies of ads).
Includes vintage LH leather basketweave holster and box of shells.
Asking $295.00

If you ever watched Lawrence of Arabia-he had a sidearm like this.

The bolt of the pistol features protruding “ears” at its rear which are grasped and pulled rearward to feed the initial round and cock the action. Using the basic blowback form of operation, the Standard model originally came with a blued carbon steel finish and was equipped with a 4.75-inch (12.1 cm) tapered barrel.

the 7 digit ser# starts with 44 so I believe it is a 1967.  This gun is in awesome condition with few handling marks.  I am not an expert but if I was collecting guns this one would be hard to beat. Bluing is great and appears to have had little use.

Comes with new soft-sided holster, 2 clips and manual (original but not original to this specific gun). This is not your ""average/worn"" Mark I. This pistol is way above average. Plus the extra mag and holster cost around $60. (have you tried to find a mag in a store for a Mark I or Mark II?).  The holster is made for this pistol (new).  You may find one cheaper but it would be hard to find one nicer. My price is firm.

I am selling because I live so blessed and have never been without food or shelter, but for many they don't know what they will eat each day let alone get a present for Christmas. It seems unfair to own several guns while others can't feed themselves each day. So ALL the money from this sale will be donated to feed hungry people.
