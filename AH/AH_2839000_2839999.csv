I just bought this last week and it is essentially new, only put 80 rounds through it. Has great sights, zero recoil and would make a great plinking/recreational gun, home defense gun, and even an interesting hunting carbine, with Kansas' recent change in hunting laws you can even hunt deer with this, power is comparable to a .41 magnum coming out of the 16in barrel. 

I know its not a Kel Tec Sub 2000, but its the next best thing. Say what you will about the Hi Point handguns but the carbines are almost universally well reviewed and considered to be very reliable. Will come with its box and all the factory stuff, papers, lock, tools, folding foregrip, and two ten round magazines.

I love it and hate to see it go, but Idlike to trade it for a mid sized revolver in .357/.38 special.  Prefer something in .357 magnum but would be okay with a .38 special as long as its +P rated

If not interested in trading I will sell for $300.

Low round count (40) through this handgun. Comes with two magazines (one 6 round one 7 round with grip extender)  all original paperwork, box and cable lock. Was purchased new from Allen Arms about a month ago and after shooting it a bit my wife has decided she would rather have an M&P 9c or compact or micro compact 1911 frame. It fires quite nicely and is more accurate than I expected for such a small handgun. I find the trigger quite heavy but I shoot IDPA and most of my personal guns are set to about 3.5lbs triggerpull, I would guess this one is closer to 7 or 8 but for CCW I imagine that's intentional to prevent accidental discharge while unholstering the weapon.

This gun is an original Circle-10 Bulgarian military kit built on a Nodak NDS-2 receiver, NOT a Century build that uses a non-chromed US-made barrel that's vulnerable to the corrosive primers of surplus. The Circle-10 armory is famous for quality and still operates today as the privatized company Arsenal Inc. Unlike many cheaper Century AK-74s rifle that use a less-effective clone with fewer features and thus less recoil reduction this also has a true 74 brake with expansion chambers, chamber vents, and top/left ports. Barrel is original military surplus and includes chrome lining for corrosion and fouling resistance.

The kit the gun was built on appears to be serialized and all-matching. The serial matches on the bolt, extractor, bolt carrier, dust cover, and front trunnion (according to the AKFiles forum there are surprisingly no serials on Bulgarian surplus barrels, only journal size numbers for final assembly.)

Comes with four mags, three of them appear to be plum Russian Tula mags (all have sanitized markings on at least one side and one has been painted black) while the fourth is a newer Promag. Also comes with a sturdy surplus leather sling. I have 10 more mags available (sanitized and marked Tula, Bulgarian surplus in various colors, and one steel Romanian) if you're interested in them, but I need to sit down and figure out the current market value first.

As you can see in the pictures below I've taken extreme care to keep it clean after firing surplus, there is no visible rust or pitting anywhere that I could see on the gun. As is the case on these surplus Bulgarian kits (and other guns that use it today like Saigas) the enamel paint they used as finish shows some wear on some of the sharp edges of the gun, in the normal places they tend to occur. There are also some marks on the gas block and front sight block that appear to have been made by the jaws of a vise, not sure where they came from as they were there when I received the gun. They're a little unsightly upon close inspection but are purely cosmetic, if you ever refinished the gun they could be smoothed out with a minimal efforts from a file or small disc sander and should blend into the new finish well. Front sight looks to be nice and straight, no tilting like is common on AKs like the SAR or WASR series while the actual bore is bright and shiny. Reliability has been flawless for me with this gun so far, as it should since it was a complete de-milled gun that was simply placed in a new semiauto-only receiver. 

Here's an imgur album I created which contains higher-resolution zoomable versions of the pictures I uploaded to Armslist, along with additional pictures of the internals and barrel to show they're rust-free. Sorry about the carbon buildup on the piston- I didn't remember to scrape it off when I cleaned the gun for pics but it is NOT corrosion:

do a little reading so you know the true difference between wingmaster/870/870 express. when you find out that it's all about the internal finish...IE machine marks, rough or high friction rub areas etc.. you'll be happy to find this gun has none of those negatives. its as smooth as any wing master and a great find."

In trade I have a  super sweet turnkey package for entry level interest in extreme long range tactical/hunting precision shooting OR A NICE EDITION TO A SEASONED SNIPER/HUNTER'S collection. Free Top shelf ammo--VERY UNIQUE SENDERO RUM!!!

The package is based on a like new heavily customized/upgraded .300 RUM Sendero perfectly broken in, accurized/tuned up by Score High in ABQ and sitting pristine and unfired since. 26"" fluted heavy barrel and proprietary Score High Hunter's Break. Truly master craftsmanship. Close ups of work sent for serious inquiries. Glass pillar bedded, trigger smoothed and at a crisp 2.5lb candy cane break with action smooth as a newborn's butt cheek. 

This thing will drop an elk where it stands at 1200M with factory ammo. One shot. Expert Marksman with quality load development--more like a mile. YouTube it if skeptical. 

Have Vortex Razor HD 5x20x50 full of features and accessorized with extras (kill flash, bubble level, flip up sites) with an illuminated EBR2 MiliRad reticle. Mounted with rings sold separately for $200 but also FREE with package. Scope has never seen the out of doors and is without a scratch. Whole rig looks brand new... Pristine. Perfect

Had a training accident and have to let a year of study of science of extreme LR precision tactical, and careful bargain hunting (my $6000+ cost could easily have run more than $7000 without meticulous and strategic shopping for every component in the order in which I learned about it in my studies.) just can't take the sustained recoil with half a neck. 

Not including time spent on research, procurement, shipping costs and taxes OR the hard to find top shelf ammo, custom Score High work, and other platform goodies which are MUSTS for sending it out to a mile with dead on accuracy...the package still comes to ($5015) I'm asking $4k FIRM OR...trade for a great quality AR 15 low round count and superb brand name AND an AR10 of sufficient quality to honor the real value of the work and time put into the platform, not the cash asking price. One plus cash or both guns for even trade.

Below is H&K's website for the P30 if you don't know what it is.

http://www.hk-usa.com/civilian_products/p30_general.asp

If you don't know much about H&Ks, consider this: during a 2009-2010 endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. That is most likely more rounds than most of us will put through a single firearm in our entire lives. Are there people who shoot more? Sure, but most of us don't come near.

My price is $850. That is about $100 less than you can find it around the web (a true Variant 1, not one that has been modified to be a Variant 1). The way I look at it, this gun is basically new, and when buying from me you don't have to pay taxes, ship it, transfer it, do a background check, have the ATF know you have it, etc, etc, etc... 

That said, I will not sell it to anyone who I know cannot legally own it. You must provide a current Ohio DL (prefer CHL) if you are going to buy this face-to-face. If you buy this from afar, it must go to an FFL licenced dealer and will be shipped by my FFL licenced dealer. You must pay shipping. If bought from afar, you will have a 3 day inspection period with no firing (you would still pay original shipping AND return shipping) After that, or after you fire it, there will be no refunds."

The BANSHEE QD (Quick Deployment) plate carrier is an advanced professional/operator grade plate carrier that takes the Banshee to another level of comfort and performance. BANSHEE QD is the second version of the Banshee family of plate carriers. Made to accommodate those that do not need a full traditional cummerbund but still want the ability to run front and back rifle plates. Ideal for Law Enforcement, Military, and Sniper operations. This BANSHEE QD plate carrier is Ultra lightweight, low profile, and has great load carrying capacity. Designed for protection, utility, mobility in a compact lightweight design. One major difference with the BANSHEE QD plate carrier is the cummerbund which now is a hybrid type. 

 The hybrid cummerbund was designed with comfort and mobility in mind, and made with advanced materials. This new cummerbund comes standard in the Banshee QD, runs through the carrier, and is fully adjustable (one size fits most). It is low profile and the interior of the cummerbund is padded and on the exterior has 2 rows of PALS webbing. This cummerbund attaches on both sides to the front of the plate carrier with 2 quick release buckles. Super-fast Don and Doff capabilities, say good bye to the sound of Hook/Loop ripping open. Upgrade and try the Banshee QD You will not be disappointed."
