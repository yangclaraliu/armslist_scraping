It has a 1:15 twist for standard and high velocity .22 ammo.

 I purchased the barrel new fitted it to my 10/22, and broke it in with 100 rounds of good .22 ammo.  I follow a break in procedure for stainless barrels, cleaning with Bore Tech Eliminator.  I haven't fired it since, so a total of 100 round count.  

After waiting 2 months for this barrel (last spring) it arrived with a ding on the muzzle end.  The ding was not on the crown, only the outer edge of the muzzle, so I didn't bother sending it back as I didn't want to wait another 2 months for another barrel.  I was going to clean it up on my lathe but never got around to it.  You can see this on the last picture at 12:00.

The barrel is very accurate and basically creates on ragged hole on the target.

It is even vented so you can pipe the oven out to prevent smoking / fumes in your basement or shop. It will hold whatever temperature you set it at all day. Anyone that has researched these knows how expensive they are to purchase new. This oven is in great shape and can be used to make a ton of money. Much better than trying to convert a home oven as it sits on your benchtop, takes up less space, can be vented, etc. I'm interested in all kinds of firearms, and am especially looking for items such as Saiga 12s etc. Feel free to make a cash / trade offer but do me a favor and don't waste my time with lowball bs.

The CZ SP-01 Shadow Target is a competition ready USPSA Production Division pistol. Starting with a trigger job by world champion Angus Hobdell’s CZ Custom Shop, this version of the SP-01 Shadow gets the competition treatment including a TRT rear sight, CZ Custom aluminum grips, competition springs, and a CZ Custom stainless guide rod. The custom shop has tuned the pistol up for anyone interested in competing.

The Target version of the CZ 75 Single Action was designed by Angus Hobdell and brought to life by the CZ custom shop. The custom shop has tuned the pistol up for anyone interested in competing or who wants to do some serious paper punching with a single action 9MM. Modifications made by the gunsmith at the CZ Custom Shop include a trigger job leaving all safeties intact, installation of fully adjustable rear sight machined into slide for low profile, fiber optic front sight, competition springs, CZ Custom aluminum grips, firing pin, drop free magazine brake and competition hammer. The Shadow Target is a competition ready USPSA production Division pistol, but this model has single/double action and also includes Angus Hobdell design and extras.

I'm offering this service because I genuinely love teaching people how to improve their shooting.

My background:  U.S. Marine Corps veteran and life-long firearm enthusiast.  I have competed extensively with pistol, rifle, and shotgun.  I'm intimately familiar with all laws regarding firearm ownership and self-defense.  I have trained shooters of all ages and skill levels and every person I train shows improvement after just one session, regardless of their shooting background.  Helping an experienced shooter realize their full potential is incredibly rewarding.  My training style focuses on mastering the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced principles.  This is not the state-required training to attain your CHL. 

I train you with your own firearm(s).  The goal is to get better at shooting what you currently have available.  If you are seeking training with the goal of buying your first gun (good job!), I will be happy to train you at a facility that offers gun rentals. You will be responsible for the costs associated with range fees, ammunition, and gun rentals.

I offer training on revolvers, semi-automatic pistols, and every type of rifle.  Rifle training can include medium range, long range, or close quarters depending on type of rifle.  All training will be done on a range that you choose.  If you need help finding a range, I can offer options for you.

-Individual private session for handguns:      $60

Has installed Ghost 3.5 lb trigger connector and stainless steel Guide rod (both originals will be included). Zombie Response Team slide plate and grip plug.  All original packing and accessories included. 

- 9mm Lone Wolf conversion barrel and 2 G17 magazines. Never fired (paid $119 for the barrel and $20 for each mag)

The sleek SpecOps Folder takes the pain out of shooting magnum buckshot and slug loads even when the stock is folded.

Shooters testing the SpecOps Folder with magnum buckshot loads found that there is virtually no muzzle rise and that recoil was significantly reduced in both the open and folded positions.

It has been stored in the exact 55 degrees conditions and has a storage life of at least* 28 years left, even longer but the nutritional value is said to degrade beyond 30 years yet still be nutritious and safely eaten without worry. We are having to move pretty far and shipping and transporting this large of a food supply is just impractical for our situation. So, we are having to sell it at a steep discount to move it in a timely manner. 

This kit has enough meals for four meals per day for one adult to include real meals like eggs and bacon and desserts after dinner such as ice cream sandwiches and cakes. 
As you can see, this food supply cost us $5,169 BEFORE TAXES. 
http://www.survival-warehouse.com/food/long_term/1-year_imperial_freeze_dried_foods.htm

We also have a 10+ cases of Military Style MRE's just like the military uses that costs about $100 per box after shipping. That cost us around $1,000 Check this link below, it is the best priced MRE's we have found anywhere and it's the company that makes them for the military also. You need MRE's in case of a water shortage or contamination because unlike mountain house and other dried stored goods, these do not need water. One MRE is designed to sustain someone for an entire day and there are over 140 meals in these cases.

 Then we have another 500lbs of dried foods in vacuum sealed bags to include nuts, dried fruits, cereals, grains, rice(s), beans, corn meal, I could go on and on and on. This kit was purchased from a site that I cannot remember but it cost us $789 before shipping and taxes. 

All of this is stored in a dry, cool, dark 55 degree basement for maximum life and freshness. We've only had this stuff for two years. 
We are not nutty wacky ""doomsday"" preppers. We are college educated professionals with good paying jobs who just want to be responsible and have some things in place in the event of an emergency. 

Here's the deal. We need to sell this, and you need to have it ""just in case"" to feed yourself and family in the event of an emergency. Our price is firm, so unless you are willing to pay this price, do not email us. We will give it to family, in addition to what we've already given them if we don't sell it. We are very nice people and you will have a pleasant, professional, and private transaction, just be sure you 1) Want to buy this at this price, 2) are willing to pay cash and bring a good size vehicle to transport all of it. 
The least we can accept is $3,900 for all of it. Consider the bulk dried foods and MRE's free, and the 1 year mountain house kit heavily discounted. 
Email me with ""just in case"" in the subject line. Leave your phone number and that's it, I will call you. No point in trying to meet me just to see where this cache is because we are moving so it won't be around long; don't waste our time. I've included the actual picture of all of the stuff you will get for $3,900 CASH ONLY.

It holds 6 shots in the tube and will handle the big 3"" magnum loads without breaking your wrist.  Heck, if you missed an intruder with this beast you'd likely set their clothes on fire and make them deaf for life!  This Mossberg 500 is used quite a bit in the military and is the ONLY pump action shotgun to pass all of the very stringent Mil-Spec 3443 standards!  So, if you buy this, rest assured you are getting an EXTREMELY durable shotgun.

If you're looking for a .22 pistol for home defense, this is NOT for you!  If you're looking for something that will stop the biggest, most drugged up maniac on earth with one shot and not have to suffer a broken arm from shooting your defense weapon, this IS your perfect home protection weapon!!  Here is an example of someone shooting 12ga shells from this shotgun that I think demonstrates well how little recoil it has with the HUGE muzzle break. Be sure and note how little the massive 12ga moves this guy's arm when he shoots it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2KOvbwCqcU

This will be the last go around for this shotgun and, if it doesn't sell, I'll just keep it.  For a mere $400 cash, this beast can be protecting your home tonight!  This price is a STEAL for this beast!  A valid IN driver's license for ID is required and a LTCH is preferred."

ALL ORIGINAL. THE ACTION ON THIS GUN IS ""BUTTER SMOOTH"". Single action pull is about 1.5 lbs. This gun is VERY NICE.

Model 66 is a double-action six-shot revolver that can also be fired single action. This revolver will accept and safely shoot both 357 Magnum and 38 Special ammo, including extra-hot 38 ammunition known as ""plus-p"" (+P) and ""plus-p-plus"" (+P+). 

Gun has a red ramp front sight (sight is built integral with barrel and has a red plastic insert), ramp up frame and barrel, and adjustable rear sight. Pinned barrel and recessed cylinders (no longer made like this, as the process is too expensive). 

I have honestly never fired it. The gentleman who bought it new fired it less than 50 times (according to his widow). I bought it from her. 

This particular revolver has the ""target trigger"". The hammer is the S&W target hammer with a spur that's 1/2"" wide. The wood grips (called ""stocks"" by Smith & Wesson) are original made of goncalo alves wood, and are of the ""target"" type with the original S&W medallion imbedded on both sides. THE WOOD IS BEAUTIFUL ON THIS GUN.

THIS IS A COLLECTOR GRADE GUN. These guns are getting hard to find, as collectors are not selling them. This gun has not been fired very much, very little cylinder ring marking. 

Here is your chance to have the best of both worlds; a COLLECTOR GRADE GUN THAT ALSO CAN BE USED AS A SHOOTER.

It has plenty of power, especially in the higher RPMs and the shifting is solid. It cold starts with a shot of starter fluid and 2-3 kicks(or a few more without the starter fluid)  or 1-2 kicks if its warmed up. The tires are decent, about 75-80% tread. There are a couple of minor cosmetic blemishes but you can expect that from a dirt bike from 1978.  The dust cover on the left fork needs replaced and the back fender has a small crack in it that has been repaired. Im willing to throw in the sweet kickstand for an added bonus. Just slap the dust cover on and a tank of gas and this thing is ready for the trails this spring (or now if you don't mind the cold)."

The lead nosed ones that I am selling with it have feed problems every 6-10 shots but the CCI & Rem had no problems in the 200'ish I shot through it.  Fun to shoot and looks really cool.

It comes with:

4 mags (3 factory and 1 is kinda crappy and I didn't use it). 
Sight Mark dual shot laser/reflex sight (4 reticule).  I didn't get a chance to try it out.  About 800 rounds of those Blazer 40 grain 22lr lead nose.  
UTG soft-side padded case with 5 mag pouches.

If you are interested in checking it out, please email me and we can discuss.  Asking  $400"

The picture also shows an Eotech XPS on the rifle, that will NOT be included in the sale; however, for another $50, I can include an Aimpoint clone with it. They usually sell for $100. You can see it attached to the HK MP5 in the second picture (rifle not included :p)

These rifles are selling for $750-800 new. This has around $200 in magpul parts alone included with it, as well as a couple mags I could throw in. All said and done it's $850 for a fully dressed rifle with optic that needs absolutely nothing, I think that's a heck of a deal and I don't see anything else lower on Armslist locally right now. I just need to get it sold THIS WEEK so I can move on another rifle.

This is the Gen 2 C15 with dust cover and forward assist. Excellent shooting rifle and I would not consider selling it under normal circumstances. I'm the original owner, purchased it new in 2012.

This IS NOT A BASIC, SURPLUS BUILT AK!!! These rifles are made from brand new parts in Serbia/ US!!! Important changes to this rifle over the basic AK are: improved trigger and the PAP is made from all new parts, including the U.S. made compliance parts. That means you aren’t shooting a pieced together parts gun that was disassembled in another country and put back together here on a US made receiver. Everything, including the barrel and every last little spring and pin, is new. The stained maple stock is longer than a standard AK stock, with a 13 1/2 inch length of pull similar to most deer and sniper rifles. Zastava made the famous Yugo M70, and these rifles have forends the same size. It is bigger and beefier than a standard AK.   I can group 3inches  @ 100m with this rifle. The Rifle is gorgeous, no scratches and has extra magazines...3 to be exact. The rifle has had 20 rounds through her, typical reliability and high power!!!
