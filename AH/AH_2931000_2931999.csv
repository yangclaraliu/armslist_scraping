Some history of the military variant of this rifle:
The RPK is a 7.62x39mm light machine gun of Soviet design, developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1950s, parallel with the AKM assault rifle. It was created as part of a program designed to standardize the small arms inventory of the Red Army, where it replaced the 7.62x39mm RPD light machine gun. The RPK continues to be used by the armed forces of countries of the former Soviet Union and certain African and Asian nations. The RPK was also manufactured in Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania.

This listing is for a NEW black Kel-Tec Sub 2000 G17 folding carbine, chambered in 9mm with a 16.1"" barrel. It accepts all Glock Model 17 magazines, and comes with one 17-round mag. This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 17 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

Specs:

Manufacturer: Kel-Tec Model #: Sub-2000 Rifle (GLK-G17) Type: Rifle Finish: Black Metal Stock: Black Synthetic, Cerakote Finish Sights: Open Sights Barrel Length: 16.1"" Overall Length: 16.1"" Closed, 30"" Open Weight: 4 lbs Caliber: 9mm Action: Semi-Automatic # of Mags: Features: Uses Glock G17 Mags, Folds in Half for Transportation Caution: Do Not Use Aluminum Cased Ammo

Recieved over 50 emails in the first couple of hours on this gun which was a red flag that I was selling it too cheap, then a dealer emailed to tell me that this was a collector gun and ask if I was stupid.  I am still willing to be reasonable, but clearly $400 showed my ignorance.  If interested make me an offer.

This is a great example of a well cared for pistol.  My grandfather bought two of these pistols brand new way back when JC Penny sold guns and this pistol stayed in his night stand for 20+ years and has had maybe 12 rounds fired through it ever.

Only selling because I have the other one, plus another SW .357 with a 6 inch barrell and it looks like Dirty Harry has moved into my gun safe.

The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

                    REVIEW:::  By the Guns and Shooting Online Staff
Our friends at SIG SAUER (www.sigsauer.com) were kind enough to consign a new P232 Stainless .380 for this review. Our test pistol came nicely packaged in a padded, lockable, polymer hard case with one magazine, an instruction manual larded with useless safety warnings, a small tube of ""cleaner/lubricant"" gun grease and a gunlock. It is a very complete package, except for the lack of a second magazine, an expensive oversight. (A spare magazine costs $66 from SIG SAUER as this is written.)
The P232 Stainless features a satin stainless steel finish with Hogue black rubber, wrap around grips. These have the usual Hogue deep finger grooves that we dislike. However, for once, the grooves approximately fit our fingers. If you are not a fan of Hogue finger groove grips, they can be easily replaced by the smooth SIG polymer grips that used to be standard equipment. We made this change immediately after the shooting portion of this review and are pleased with the result, both aesthetically and functionally. One of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by most law enforcement agencies today.
We think this is an exceptionally handsome pistol.The P232 is petite, but it is not a subcompact pistol. It is about the length, height and weight of a Glock 19, Baikal IJ-70A (Makarov) or Walther PP. We'd call it a compact pistol. SIG has gone beyond those excellent pistols by simplifying and improving the Walther PP concept to produce the finest pistol of its type. This is a bold statement and we do not say such things lightly.
The SIG P232 is a streamlined, double action (SA/DA), blowback operated, fixed barrel, autoloading pistol with a single stack magazine retained by a heel clip. The Sig P232 is a very handsome, accurate, well made, reliable pistol that is chambered for the .380 ACP (9mm Kurz) cartridge.
Why do we say the SIG P232 is the best? Because SIG has gone farther to improve the basic concept than anyone else. Here are the notable improvements incorporated by SIG engineers. They eliminated the slide mounted, dual function, safety / decocking lever and replaced it with a single purpose, frame mounted decocker. It is conveniently located at the top of the left side grip panel. This is a better, easier to operate design and there is no manual safety to fumble or forget in moments of high stress. The P232 has a very clean shape with smooth external contours and rounded edges for snag-free draws; the decocking lever is its only external operating control. Simpler is better.
The P232's hammer has a smooth shape with a small, conventional hammer spur that is partly shielded by the rear of the slide, rather than the exposed burr hammer used in the Makarov and PP. Not only is the SIG hammer design snag-free, it is easier to thumb cock.
The P232 has a wide, smooth-faced trigger and a useable out of the box SA trigger pull. (The specification is 4.4 pounds, although our test gun's trigger actually measured lighter.) It is, in fact, one of the very few modern autoloading pistols that does not require a trigger job before being pressed into service. The mechanism incorporates an automatic firing pin block and a rebounding hammer for increased safety.
The P232 is built on a one-piece frame/trigger guard. There is a small, flush mounted, takedown lever instead of the pinned in place, pull-down trigger guard used to release the slide for removal in the Makarov and Walther pistols. It has the wide, easy to grip SIG SAUER slide serrations, which are particularly important on an inherently hard to rack blowback pistol.
The P232 comes with high visibility, Patridge type sights that are far superior to the sights on most competitive pistols. (SIGLITE tritium night sights, as supplied on our test pistol, are a popular option.) Here are the P232 specifications as reviewed.

The P232 is a .380 pistol, but it is not tiny. At least for us, it is too big and heavy to carry in an ankle holster, vest pocket or pants pocket, as one might carry a mini-revolver or .25 auto. Most users will probably choose to carry it in a suitable belt holster, shoulder holster, fanny pack, purse, briefcase or other sturdy container that fits their lifestyle.
To field strip the P232 for cleaning, remove the magazine and ensure that the chamber is empty. Cock the hammer and then rotate the frame mounted takedown lever 90-degrees downward. (This is the small lever inletted into the forward left side of the frame.) Pull the slide all the way rearward and lift the back of the slide off the frame's slide rails. Then, run the slide forward off the fixed barrel. Pull the tapered recoil spring off the barrel. (Note that the larger diameter end of this spring is forward.) That is all the disassembly required for cleaning and normal maintenance. Reassemble in reverse order.
From the operator's perspective, the P232 is one of the easiest to use autoloading pistols on the market. A good  suggestion is to cock the hammer before attempting to pull back the slide. That way you are not fighting the recoil spring and the hammer spring. (Both springs are substantial in the P232.)
After the first (DA) shot, the pistol will self-cock and subsequent shots will be fired single action. In other words, the trigger does not have to cock the hammer, so the trigger pull is short. The trigger pull of our test pistol measured 3.75 pounds per our RCBS pull gauge. Single action is how the pistol will normally be fired and the only way to take advantage of its better than average intrinsic accuracy. First shot, manually cock the hammer, as you would a SA autoloader or a revolver.
The rebounding hammer is partially shielded by the shape of the rear of the streamlined slide to avoid catching on clothing, but enough of the hammer spur protrudes to make thumb cocking for the first shot easy. If you lack faith in the 
The .380 ACP cartridge should not be belittled for self-defense purposes. Contrary to those who call the 9x17mm a ""mouse cartridge,"" it is not. Nor is the SIG P232 a mouse gun. In fact, with appropriate JHP ammo, the .380 ACP has a proven one-shot-stop record on a par with .38 Special snub-nose revolvers and .45 ACP ball ammo. 
We did test fire the Sig P232
Unlike subcompact .380 autos, the Sig P232 is a medium size and weight gun with a full size grip that aids accurate shooting. We have already mentioned the pistol's fixed barrel design, decent SA trigger and highly visible sights. The sights were factory regulated to hit about at point of aim at 25 yards, unusually good and accurate performance for fixed sights. 
With the heel clip that is on the Sig magazine, you cannot inadvertently drop the magazine by pushing the wrong button. We have seen that happen many times with push button mag releases. While we are mentioning magazines, the stainless steel magazine supplied with our Sig P232 fed cartridges perfectly.

Similar sets sell for over $2000.  This set was a gift to my wife for her first wedding over 20 years ago and was purchased for over $1500.  Retail, this set would go for about $1000 in an antiques place.  We're putting a trade value on it of $800-1000.

Willing to travel within the state for the right deal.  For my end, I can't put any cash into the deal (we're broke!) but am willing to sell outright for $800 or comparable trade of firearm(s), and/or ammo, and/or cash.  My wife would like to get rid of these, so we're willing to bargain a bit.  We also have a large assortment of Mikasa stemware and other crystal to sweeten the deal if you have an item(s) worth more.

This is an 'I love you' gift for the wife (girlfriend, mistress, whatever) that brings 'class' to your home (note: these have never been used), especially during the holidays or special events.  So, if you're interested and have a firearm you're willing to trade, please e-mail me or call (501)-five-nine-zero-9-4-2-6 and ask for Bill."

I need cash is the reason why I'm selling the gun but not that desperate to sell. everybody knows about the H&K brand and sure they are pricy but you get what you pay for. I would put it up against any handgun out there and I am pretty sure it would out do whatever you put up against the P30. I've had the gun for almost a year now and took care of it pretty well, cleaned it after i used it. probably under 200 rounds through the gun but i dont know exactly how many but i am pretty sure its not more than 200. never carried due to not being licensed, the handgun stayed right next to my bed almost its entire life aside from when it was at the shelf of where i bought it from. I'm selling it as a bundle, the gun along with the case and everything thats in the case palm swells from small to large and backstraps from small to large as well, ammo mix of HP's and FMJ's and a TLR3 tactical flashlight attachment. if you have questions or if you are interested just send me a message or you can call me at REDACTED"

It also includes an extended 15-round mag with XD extension for a full-size grip, for three mags (comes with two 13-round mags from the factory).  This is a great concealed carry gun with a large magazine capacity still.

The sights have been upgraded to Tru-Glo Brite-Site Tritium/Fiber Optic sights, so they provide the best vision outdoors or indoors, day or night (they glow in the dark at night), but the original white dot sights are also included.  They're less than a year old, so still have plenty of tritium life left.

I also have a brand new Streamlight TLR-3 that I only removed from the box to mount for pictures.  

The gun has seen approximately 250-300 rounds at the range.  $500 without the light, $600 with it.  If you want a bill of sale so you can prove ownership, I can draw one up if you let me know before hand.  Price is firm (and well below what I have into it)!  NO TRADES."

489,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2931489,For Sale:  VZ-24 Rifle + Bayonet-- 1939 Czech Lion Crest  -- Mauser Bolt Action (VZ 24),"SARASOTA, South West Florida, Florida",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, April 19, 2014",Rifles,no type,8mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a fun old rifle with bayonet in the Mauser 98 tradition made by the State armory of Czechoslovakia at Brno and accepted by the Czech army in 1939.  (Tiny second rampant lion followed by ""39"" side of receiver.). ""G5"" leading the serial number designates the production lot and factory. (See detail at the bottom of the pics.)  ""G"" is for the 7th lot within a production cycle for that time frame.   There were 5 cycles in all before the German annexation.  1939 would be the last cycle.  ""5"" means it was made by the factory Povaska Bystrica in Slovakia. At that time  Czechoslovakia had the largest small arms industry in Europe and had huge exports to various armies worldwide.  This Mauser style rifle was one of the favorite service weapons through WWII.  This one is in good condition and works even though it has seen a lot of history as the pictures show.  The rifling in the bore is a little dark but quite strong and crisp.  It sure has a lot of sling mounts.  My favorite feature is the bold lion crest of the armory.  The exports and those impressed into Nazi service do not have the crest.  My  second favorite is the sighting system which appears to be designed to minimize damage from rough handling and yet preserve precision.  This same sighting system is still used in some Czech guns being made today.  Of course the Mauser type bolt action is great and so simple to remove.  

Included with this rifle is the VZ-24 bayonet, marked CSZ followed by ""L"" on the blade with a 4 digit number on the wooden hilt.  Judging from marks on the wood this bayonet has seen its share of history.  Working spring loaded mechanism locks the bayonet to the rail under the rifle muzzle. 

Rifle is very sturdily built but surprisingly not very heavy.  Overall length with bayonet is 54 3/4"", 43 1/2"" with it detached.  Barrel length is 22 1/2"", chambered for 8mm.

Hard to find a VZ-24 with this visible history.

A footnote to history... After WWI from 1918, Czechoslovakia developed into a healthy democracy in Central Europe. But it was in the shadow of what became Hitler's expansionist Germany which occupied it piecemeal and finally annexed the country entirely in 1939 as western Europe watched and Neville Chamberlain signed peace with Hitler. After WWII in 1945, it was nearly independent until 1948 when Stalin installed a puppet government and closed it behind the iron curtain. The VZ-24s like this one for the small Czech army were a part of the production preceding 1939... those not exported to earn hard currency. After 1939 the factories were appropriated for German or Soviet arms. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, CZ was organized as a company, and once again it is producing the renowned VZ-24 rifles. The rifle listed here was produced in the tiny flicker of hope in 1939. This one was not used by the German troops, those had Nazi marks. Perhaps it belonged to a partisan? The Czechs had an active and organized underground in those years all the way to the end of WWII.

Federal ammunition is some of the hottest, highest-quality ammunition available today, which is loaded to NATO specifications. Each Federal XM855F3 cartridge contains an SS109 bullet – signifying the fact that each bullet is a 62gr full metal jacket with a steel penetrator and a lead core. Each reloadable cartridge is non-corrosive and is suited for use in any AR-15 chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO.  This is the same ammunition used by the United States Armed Forces.

Online stores sell three hundred rounds of Federal XM855F3 5.56 ammo for $249.16 plus shipping, so those of you who keep flagging this because it's ""too expensive"" can stop.  I'm only asking $180 per box of 300 rounds, which is exactly how much I paid for it at Cabelas.  If you can get it cheaper elsewhere, feel free to do so without informing me.  I'm only looking to get my money back out of this.  If you buy all three boxes, I'll knock off $40 (total)."

But it will handle birdshot or buckshot equally well in 2 3/4""  

Made by Franchi in Italy you know it is a quality weapon that will last for years to come.  It does have some normal wear from field use as a bird hunting and trapshooting over the years.  My 10 year old daughter used this gun for dove season back in Sept 2013.  Fires and cycles perfect.

I am only selling this gun because I lost my job last week and I need the cash.  I would prefer to keep it but that's not an option today

Please locals only.  Cash only no trades.  $265
You can email or send me a text to REDACTED.   I will not hold for anyone.  First one to actually show up can buy it.  Please don't waste my time if your ""just looking""."

The Beretta comes with the hard carry case, three 17 round magazines, lock, and all literature. 

The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.

The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.

Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round stainless steel magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target.

The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.

For those looking to pack some real punch in a revolver configuration, the Raging Bull is a potent package offering impressive firepower with the mighty 454 Casull cartridge. With hotter loads exiting the muzzle at nearly 2000 fps with around 2000 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle, the .454 Casull is an impressive cartridge. This is a VERY POTENT handgun!
 To give you a comparison of how powerful it really is, the venerable .357 Magnum has around 500 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle. The Taurus Raging Bull 454 really is like holding the power of a raging bull in your hands! Capable of releasing 5 of these powerful rounds in a matter of seconds makes the Raging Bull a formidable weapon. To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull. The rust resistant stainless steel matte finish helps ensure good looks for the life of this revolver."

It has the original’s 6+1 capacity. With the beavertail it is only about 5.5 inches long, four inches tall and empty weighs a mere 13 ounces. The Mustang XSP Pocketlite's frame includes a 3/8"" accessory rail. Much like Colt’s famous 1911, the Mustang has a Commander-style hammer and manual thumb safety. The grip angle is similar to the 1911, but unlike the design of the 1911 the safety of the Mustang does not block the slide’s movement. Due to the size of the Colt Mustang Pocketlite, the manual safety is small. The Pocketlite has no grip safety, and it can be fired with the magazine removed.

The top of the Mustang Pocketlite's blackened stainless slide is bead blasted matte to reduce glare. The square-notch rear sight, which is drift-adjustable for windage, is dovetailed into the slide’s rear. The front sight is an integrally machined fixed ramp. A pair of coil recoil springs, one inside the other, surrounds the black polymer guide rod, which rides under the barrel and extends through the hole in the slide’s front as the slide moves rearward. A steel washer between the springs and the guide rod’s base prevents them from removing material.

For those looking to pack some real punch in a revolver configuration, the Raging Bull is a potent package offering impressive firepower with the mighty 454 Casull cartridge. With hotter loads exiting the muzzle at nearly 2000 fps with around 2000 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle, the .454 Casull is an impressive cartridge. This is a VERY POTENT handgun!
 To give you a comparison of how powerful it really is, the venerable .357 Magnum has around 500 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle. The Taurus Raging Bull 454 really is like holding the power of a raging bull in your hands! Capable of releasing 5 of these powerful rounds in a matter of seconds makes the Raging Bull a formidable weapon. To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull. The rust resistant stainless steel matte finish helps ensure good looks for the life of this revolver."

SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.
