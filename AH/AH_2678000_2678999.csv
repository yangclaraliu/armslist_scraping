These tanks have a dimension of 40""x48""x52""(tall) and are a cubed shape. These tanks are once used and are being recycled. The product previously was water based and very easy to clean out. The tanks have a galvanized steel cage around the tank and has a HD plastic or metal pallet/skid that it sits on (sometimes the pallets are wood but rarely). 

These tanks weigh approximately 130 pounds empty. The tanks of a 6""/12"" fill cap located on the top of the tank and a 2"" ball valve at the base of the tank. These tanks are solid and will not leak. 
There is an infinite usage list for these tanks; storing water for livestock, storing water for a garden or orchard, catching rain, using for a reservoir for a cabin or outhouse, to use for aquaculture or aquaponics, a one person hillbilly hot tub, use to transport liquids, store liquids (just make sure that they won't eat through polypropylene), store waste oil, store de-icer, etc... The sky is the limit. 

You can start a seal coating company or use it to move water around for a power washing company. I have people making bio diesel and black diesel in these tanks as well. 

1 Tank for $60 and 2 tanks for $100. 

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to email me or call me at REDACTED ask for Andrew. I can deliver for a reasonable fee.  

Notes: You can easily put two of them in a full pick up and three of them in a full pick up if you put the tail gate down. You can put one tank in a 6' bed and two tanks in a 6' bed if you put the tail gate down. 

The photo is tanks from a previous shipment though my current tanks are very similar if not the same.

Carry handle edition. Came with one 10rd mag.
I have 2 more mags that are 25rd.
The 25rd is shown in the pictures.
Gun has had a few hundred rounds through it.
As with most of the brand new extended mags, every now and then you will get a failure to feed or a jam. Cheap ammo tends to do this more.
Also included will be a CoiTac 4x32 scope. 
Both the gun and scope are in Great condition and have been taken care of.
Just looking to see what's out there. Asking $250

Send me an offer. 
I'd rather have the cash but if you have a trade I like, I'll consider it.

Frank Gallaghers ancestor, one of the first wooden Indian carvers, started carving his Indians in the 1840's. His great, great grandson Frank is known to be one of approximately 12 true full-blooded Man-Dan Indians still living. Unfortunately, the Man-Dan village was infected by small pox which practically wiped out the entire tribe. Frank's ancestor however, was away from the village at the time, working for a furniture maker. The furniture maker's name was Samuel Gallagher. Following the custom of Indian laborers of that era, Frank took his employer's last name as his own. One of the original Wooden Indians are on display in the Smithsonian Institute. The Gallaghers continue the art of carving as their ancestor would want it; the old way - the right way - by hand.
You've seen them at Trading Post, you've seen them at souvenir shops, now you have the opportunity to own your own Cigar Store Wooden Indian. Carved by the same family that carved the very first one for a man that owned Gallaghers Furniture Store, back in the 1800's. A truly unique conversation piece, for home, office or store front. Own a piece of American heritage, a Frank Gallagher original sculpture."

I'd prefer to sell it, but will consider a trade, depending on what you have.  

This rifle has about 200-300 rounds through it flawlessly.  It is an absolute dream to shoot, with little to no felt recoil.  The entire rifle is rated for full auto (including the BCG).

If you haven't heard of Patriot Ordinance Factory weapons, I suggest looking them up; if you have, then you know the kind of quality AR-15 this is.

**Note:  This rifle will not come with sights.  It WILL come with one (1) standard GI magazine (more can be negotiated).  Also, pictured on the rifle is a Magpul XTM Hand-Stop that will come with the weapon.  A Magpul Vertical Grip (Black) can be substituted if desired.

If your offer is in the ballpark, I'll respond to see if we can work something out.  Any low-ballers will be ignored.

I'd really like a 3inch nickel model 60, a model 36 or a model 29 with 5""and under barrel, but I will entertain all smith and wesson no lock revolver trades, with cash on my end if needed.

The wooden furniture was taken off an 870 police and the butt stock has a lim saver recoil pad

Hard to price the action job and trigger job as its roughly 6 hours combines of buffing and polishing small parts. Very tedeous job but improves action and trigger pull 200%. I will say gunsmiths charge around $80 per hour or flat rate fees for trigger jobs and action jobs so id guesstamate it would cost you at least, at least, $150-$200 for the job to be done. 

Everything on this rifle is in brand new shape with the following brand new:
AKARS-Bushnell-Midwest-Case-Ammo

Stock Wasrs are going for $700-$800 used with just a mag!!! The SAR-1 is steps well above the Wasr so id hope it would go for well above that amount due to the $1000+ in upgrades."

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Chinese Type 53 Carbine with folding Bayonet date 1954.11 Era Built At Arsenal 296
After WWII the Soviet Union shared much of its weapons technology with its satellite countries, including the Mosin rifles and carbines. T53s were produced in the 1950s by China and other than minor differences these follow the same pattern as the post war Soviet M44s.
 NC23GUNS offers you rare examples of Sino-Soviet cooperation from a bygone era! The Type 53 is a copy of the famous Russian M44 carbine, and like its predecessor is chambered in 7.62x54R. We were able to locate a cache of these carbines where they have been preserved for decades just waiting to be re-issued. Needless to say - these won't be around forever. If you are a collector of Mosin-Nagants, this is a fantastic opportunity to add a hard-to-find carbine to your collection. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 20.25"", Overall: 40"", Weight: 9 lbs. Condition:  FAIR TO Good.

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a very light paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. 

Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 I am located in Marysville but willing to travel a bit as needed.  Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records. WA ID and Completed Bill Of Sale and we are good to go.

From Manufacturer:

 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

I just recently got this together as I have been slowly buying parts so everything is new. There are some marks from assembly but nothing that affects performance. I’m only putting this up as I could use the money instead, will sell it all for $1300. I am willing to sell just the AR with the flip up sights and 2 PMAG's for $1050. This AR is all ready to go, no need to buy anything extra! I can probably include a box of ammo if you buy everything.

Chinese Type 53 Carbine with folding Bayonet date 1955 Era Built At Arsenal 26
These rifles haven't been available for awhile due to china's tightly closed door policy and who knows how much longer they will be available!  Get yours while you can!
 NC23GUNS offers you rare examples of Sino-Soviet cooperation from a bygone era! The Type 53 is a copy of the famous Russian M44 carbine, and like its predecessor is chambered in 7.62x54R. We were able to locate a cache of these carbines where they have been preserved for decades just waiting to be re-issued. Needless to say - these won't be around forever. If you are a collector of Mosin-Nagants, this is a fantastic opportunity to add a hard-to-find carbine to your collection. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 20.25"", Overall: 40"", Weight: 9 lbs. Condition:  FAIR TO Good.


After WWII the Soviet Union shared much of its weapons technology with its satellite countries, including the Mosin rifles and carbines. T53s were produced in the 1950s by China and other than minor differences these follow the same pattern as the post war Soviet M44s.
