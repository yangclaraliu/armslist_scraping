Has matching numbers. Has threaded barrel. Chromed bore. Gun has a few minor scratches and handling marks. Comes with 3-30rd magazines (1-new Polish, 1-new Tapco, and 1-Chinese, used but in good condition). This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. It has new Ironwood Design/made upper and lower handguards. However, upper handguard has split in the middle (pictured) but glued back together. The wood furniture has an iodine red finish (like a red orange finish). In addition, I'll throw in a matching Ironwood pistol grip, including the hardware (metal ferrule and grip bolt) with it. Thumbhole stock is not original to the gun. I took this gun on a trade and had a regular buttstock on it, and decided to install a thumbhole stock for compliance with the AWB/922r. The gun also comes with an extra new set of handguards. Upper handguard latch tip is broken. But the latch itself is still functional, and won't affect the gun function wise. Brand new handguard latch is included with the sale. This Hungarian SA-85M was imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's. Sorry about the pictures. I’m not a good photographer. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy this gun. Thanks for looking. Happy Holidays everyone.

 --- $750 firm. Sorry no trade. Price is firm (was asking $950). I got more than $950 on the gun. Losing money on this sale. My loss is your gain! ---

 * No tirekickers and lowballers please *

Note: I do not have the factory wood thumbhole stock and the matching wood handguards. As stated on my posting/ad, I took the gun on a trade without the factory thumbhole stock furniture set. I had the Ironwood Design furniture set lying around. And decided to install them on the gun. I just like the red orange finish wood better. Of course, the buyer can install the other wood furniture set if he/she choose to do so."

The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The over-sized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market.

Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

Specifications and Features: American Tactical Imports GSG 522 Semi Auto Carbine .22 Long Rifle 16.25"" Barrel 22 Rounds Retractable Stock Textured pistol grip Intergrated weaver rail 33.6"" overall length Black Finish 

I will sell the gun and 3 mags the stocks the lockable case and the CP Tactical Red/Green Dot Scope. All for the $475 

RATINGS (out of five stars) Style * * * * It’s hard to beat the looks of an MP5. I’m going to take a point away simply because ATI added weird looking dots on the pistol grip and equally unnecessary horizontal lines on the trigger group. My understanding was that these cosmetic changes were made in order to get to get Heckler & Koch to drop its lawsuit against GSG. If the non-authentic look really bugs you, you can shell out $50 for the retrofit kit. The fake suppressor looks cool, but be prepared for guys to approach you at the range asking about your can: they get a disappointed look on their face when you tell them it’s just a barrel shroud. 

Ergonomics * * * * * Feels like a slightly lighter version of a real-deal MP5. The safety, charging handle, and mag release are in the right positions. The weight and balance are comfortable. What’s not to love? 

Reliability * * * * 1/2 The GSG 522 experienced a few hiccups running through the first few mags, but then ran smooth as silk. On the last two range days of the testing, we put roughly 1200 rounds downrange with only one cleaning and only experienced one malfunction (and even that may have been ammo related). 

Customize This * * * * While this ain’t no Ruger 10-22, there’s a fair amount of factory “tacticool” that you can buy for the GSG 522 including dual mag clamps, flashlight holders, folding stocks, high and low scope mounts, laser mounts, etc. From the internet lore I’ve read, it seems that some of the stuff made by various air soft manufacturers will fit as well, but I can’t vouch for that. 

Accuracy * * * * 

The GSG is not quite as accurate as a bolt-action Anschutz or a CZ 452, but it’s going to embarrass your stock Ruger 10/22. Overall * * * * 1/2 The GSG 522 is a lot of fun if you are looking for a low-cost range plinker with the added benefit of sexy looks and historic provenance."

This is the M96/38, a model 96 that was retooled by the Swedish military to shorten the barrel to more of a carbine length to reflect the need their military had for more maneuverable (and lighter...) rifles for their ground troops.
Barrel is 24 inches long where the M96 was just a  hair over 29 inches in length.

The bore on this is rated a ""1"" which means their armorers thought it was in great condition, not as new, but pretty close.  The nominal bore diameter was 6.50 mm, nice tight fit giving good contact between the bullets surface and the lands/grooves in the barrel.  If you've read anything about these  you know they're known for their accuracy and their dependability.  Added bonus, they have great stopping power (these were/are caliber of choice for a lot of folks from anything from deer up to moose).  Accuracy with iron sights is fantastic, ask any number of board members here who shoot these, the rifle is typically more inherently accurate than the shooter...  I know that's true for me.

Now to the issue of ""which numbers match""?  Easy, the only number I can find that does not match is the butt plate.  Yeah, I know, the butt plate.  The receiver, all parts of the bolt, the magazine floor plate, EVEN the front and rear barrel bands on this specimen match.  That, to be honest, is quite unusual given that refitting of important but incidental parts didn't focus on or worry about matching numbers."

Im in college now and i need gas money more than i need these airsoft guns. I used everything maybe 20 times tops. It has been sitting under my bed gathering dust for the past 2 years. It all works, and everything except a battery for the rifle is what you need to play. And safety glasses of course. My battery crystallized, and thats when i stopped playing. a new one will run $35 dollars. I can bring my brothers battery to show that the gun works if need be, but it won't fit, and its not mine so i cant include it. this would make a great christmas gift for any kid looking to get into it, and they'll have a lot of fun.

For sale or trade is one Red Pelican flange bunker box.

The foam has been cut on one side in a rectangle, but its so thick it can be cut on the clean side for firearms or whatever you’d like such as prepping, zombie preparedness, etc.
Internal box measurements are 34.25”x24.25” and about 10” deep with the lid closed.
I have two boxes, I’m only trading/selling one unless the offer is good LOL.

For sale or trade is one Red Pelican flange bunker box. This box can be used as a range box, shipping container or even a cooler if you remove the foam. 4 external pop up handles and wheels on one side to roll heavier loads. The foam has been cut on one side in a rectangle, but its so thick it can be cut on the clean side for firearms or whatever you’d like such as prepping, zombie preparedness, etc.
Internal box measurements are 34.25”x24.25” and about 10” deep with the lid closed.
I have two boxes, I’m only trading/selling one unless the offer is good LOL.

Thanks for looking.

They were custom builds by a company I hadn't heard of previously, Evolution Gun Works, (EGW) in Doylestown, PA. One was a race gun and the other was a really good looking tactical piece. Doylestown wasn't all that far away at that time, so I took a Combat Commander that I recently acquired to them along with that copy of American Hangunner, and asked them to recreate the same work on my pistol. It took a few months but was worth the wait. I then put 50 rounds through it without a hitch and put it away and haven't fired it since.

Stippling around the base of the trigger guard. 30 LPI on the bottom and front of the trigger guard. Flat topped and serrated the slide. Lowered ejection port with rollover groove. Dovetailed front patridge type sight. Beautifully executed adjustible Bo-Mar rear sight. Serrations on back of rear sight, slide and extractor. Perfectly machined high swept beavertail which matches the S&A mainspring housing, extended thumb safety, and barrel bushing. Extended mag release button. Matte finish on the frame and top of the slide with a satin polish on the sides. Ultralight carbon trigger. One piece guide rod. Original Colt barrel. Great looking double diamond wood (Cocobolo?) grips. Etc. etc. I still have the build sheet and will send it along when I find it. Remodeling the house at present so nothing is where it used to be. I remember that the total for all of the work they did on this came to around $1200 (and that was in 1993 dollars). When you consider what you'd spend for that work today, this pistol is a bargain. I'm not a dealer so ask yours if he'll accept a shipment from a private seller. I can go through a dealer here if needed. Shipping and insurance is included in the sale price.

They have been fired and still have the primers.  You will need to clean and deprime them yourself.  I try to pick out pieces that are Berdan primed or are bent to the point that they cannot be reloaded.  However, some of these may get into the bags.  I add an extra 10 pieces for every 500 to ensure you have quality pieces.  I hand count each bag and get rid of any aluminum or steel casings.  They are all brass or nickel coated brass! These are mixed headstamp and the .45s have not been sorted for primer size.  These can be fixed with a cheap pocket reamer.   You will find a lot of Lake City and Remington in .223 as well as a 5.56 once in a while.  In the pistol cartridges, the majority are blazers, remingtons, winchesters, and federals.  There are also the military rounds (less than 1% of the rounds), aguila, hornady, cor-bon, and speer to name a few.

You can meet me for the brass at M6 and 131 for Grand Rapids residents.  Or, I can ship the package nationally, including Alaska and Hawaii in flat rate boxes.  I will accept cash or paypal for all transactions.  I charge $7, $14, and $18 for 3 sizes of flat rate boxes.  A very small handling/paypal fee is included in those shipping prices to help cover my expenses.  No fee for paying with cash.  The $7 box can take very small packages while the $14 and $18 boxes will be more common for most orders.  

I will try to keep my inventory updated and add to it as I sort out new calibers.  You can come see me at the Grand Rapids gun show in January.  I will have a lot of different oddball calibers or calibers where I don't have enough to sell in bulk quantity.   Email me to get a quote on my listed inventory or possible other calibers you are looking for.   Thanks for looking.

All variations of the pistol include ambidextrous decocking levers and a reversible magazine release, as well as an integrated tactical accessory rail. In addition, the FNP-45 offers an ambidextrous slide release.

According to FNH USA, the FNP line of pistols is the only polymer-framed autoloading pistol on the market (as of its introduction) with fully replaceable frame rails; this allows the pistol to be rebuilt after extensive firing, thereby extending service life.[6] (Steyr M Series pistols also have this feature, and were released in 1999.)
Design and operation

The FNP series weapons are hammer fired weapons utilizing a Browning cam system with an external extractor. The trigger module is housed inside the polymer frame as an individual unit connected to the hammer. The magazine release button is held in place by a retention pin which can be removed to allow the magazine release button to be reversed. The trigger pull for the FNP-9 variant is generally 8 pounds while in double action and 3–4 pounds while in single action. While the lower frame is made of high-strength polymer, the slide is made of stainless steel. Generous magazine wells make reloading the weapon easy.

I also have extra FNH magazines and two kydex holsters, on for the pistol, one for 2 magazines.  Gun has custom stippling as well."

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.

The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. 

The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.

It doesn't fit my hand well.  Total run time has been less than five (5) minutes.

The P2X Fury uses a high-efficiency, virtually failure-proof LED to deliver your choice of either 15 or 500 lumens of perfectly focused light, the latter qualifying the Fury as a pocket-sized searchlight. The 15-lumen level is excellent for general work at close-to-medium distances, and also lets you greatly extend the runtime per set of batteries, a valuable option when you're miles from civilization. At either setting the high-strength polymer micro-textured reflector delivers a smooth, comparatively wide beam with a brighter central area and generous peripheral light. The Fury is activated with a click-type tailcap switch: press for momentary-on low, press further to click constant-on low; return to off and press or click on again within two seconds for high. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and is hard anodized to military specifications for extreme resistance to scratches, abrasion, and corrosion.

Pretty much everything you need to start reloading 9mm except the powder. I also have other bullets, primers and a manual powder scale as well for the right deal. I'm asking $650.00 or trade. I'd trade for quality firearms. I'd prefer revolvers, semi auto pistols or AR-15 Uppers and AK-47s. No shotguns or hunting rifles. You must have a Foid card for the primers. I will not seperate, this is a package deal. Email or text me at REDACTED"

Designed by Emile Flues.  I have contacted the former 28yr. lead gunsmith for Ithaca Gun Co. to inquire about a crack in the barrel.  I have a pic of the crack from a before picture if you need to see it.   After Ithaca was sold off he started his own gunsmithing right in Ithaca, NY, it is called Diamond Gunsmithing (www.diamondgunsmithing.com).  He specializes in vintage firearms restoration and repair.  The short and sweet of it is that my gun had a crack about 7""-8"" from the choke, on the side of the barrel.  He advised me that is was not repairable, but he may have barrels to replace them but it requires custom smithing that I was not financially prepared for.  I opted to ""coach"" the gun and cut the barrel to 20"".  It is perfectly legal under the 18/26 rule.  I also reblued the barrels.  I know how much value was lost in this procedure but it was lost when the crack happened before I got it.  I also didn't want to break up a numbers matching set.  All numbers match.  It has a different buttplate on it than it should.  It says ""Winchester Repeating Arms Co.""   This is a nice quick take down shotgun, literally 3 steps!  With the barrels shortened it will pack nicely into your gear.  I can negotiate on the price and I only sell face to face. I will not ship, sorry.
