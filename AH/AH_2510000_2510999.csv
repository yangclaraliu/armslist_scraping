The overall circumference of the grip-frame is carefully reduced.  The back-strap is re-contoured to a flatter profile, and the grip angle is altered to produce a feel more like that of a 1911.  This provides a more natural feeling grip and improves ""pointability.""  The hollow area at the rear of the grip, which is basically a trash collection area, is filled, smoothed, and beveled which enhances smoother reloads.  The rear of the trigger guard is relieved where it meets the frame, allowing the middle finger to move up a bit higher.  This will give you far better control and reduces the tendency of the pistol to twist in the hand under recoil.  The grip area of the frame is completely encircled in a custom tactical stippling selected to provide an excellent grasp under virtually all environmental conditions without being so raspy like the unreliable sand paper stick-on grips that cheese-grate your fingers.  Our innovative grip mods are an actual part of your firearm, extremely durable, and will last the life of your firearm.  This means no more wasting money on rubber or sticky replacement grip covers.  All jobs are customized to the owners preferences and current needs. Prices vary upon customization. Call now to place your order REDACTED m-f (9-5) sat (10-4) or email REDACTED with any questions.

It is not a collector's piece but more of a very well-kept shooter.  I think of it like this:  It's not pretty enough to be a safe queen, there is some blueing wear at the muzzle.  But, the rest of the blueing and case hardening is gorgeous so it is almost too pretty to shoot.   So I am making room for something I don't feel bad about shooting.

Serial number marks it as made in 1974 according to Colt web site.

The only reason I didn't list as BNIB is because I did shoot 1 mag with it this past weekend. It is truly brand new special ordered from Colt. The Series 70 models are very hard to find as Colt takes their sweet time making them. I have had this firearm for less than a month but I just purchased a Colt 1911 Gold Cup National Match so this one unfortunately has to go!!! The price is firm and I wont travel far and I only deal in face to face transactions. I have everything that Colt sends with a new gun plus a new wrap around Hougue grip. Don't wish you had a Colt...Buy this one

This one has the black slide with the black frame which has been proven to be the most effective color combo. If you are looking for the perfect gun for daily carry or Neighborhood Watch duties, this is it! (Signs and cool orange vest not included)

This one has several nice touches to set it apart. The barrel has been polished to a mirror finish, along with the feed ramp. In addition the areas on the frame where there was flashing or rough spots have been polished out. It also comes with the Kel-Tec Belt Clip that is currently not installed, but I can put it on if needed.

This has a very low round count, and comes with the original box, trigger lock and two magazines. It feeds every type of ammo and is perfectly reliable. 

The Arizona Watermelon and Skittles will go with the pistol. I keep telling the pistol it doesn't need to follow them, but it seems to have a mind of its own. Weird.

Please make Respectable Offers. I will not even answer Lowballers.
I won't lie to you about ""Round Count"" because I shoot my guns and have no idea how many rounds I have shot through them. But, I will tell you that they shoot well, with great accuracy, and have been cleaned and oiled properly after every outing. Don't listen to what your friends tell you. Think for yourself and you will see here that the offer contains approximately $600.00 in trade value. I can add ammo or some cash for the right trade offering.

I know what people say about Sigma's but they actually shoot very well (once you get used to the trigger) and this one eats whatever I feed it. I think they just got a bad Rap, because they tried so hard to copy another company. I like all Handguns, New and Old

Will meet you half way with the driving for the right trade offer. Thanks for looking and Happy Trading.

Head on down to Gregory's Sporting Goods in Farmington, because only a sucker gets a fair deal on a used gun.  You're not a poor person are you?  Then prove it by throwing away your heard earned cash!"

Was re-chambered at some point to 356 Winchester.  What this means for you is your probably going to want to be a hand loader, there is factory ammo available still, but only one flavor, and its not cheap.  the good news is I have the dies and around 100 cases that would come with the rifle (as well as a grab bag of various components, not a ton, but enough to get you started loading for it).  Also has original wood stock & for-grip.  Previous owner added is own checkering to them, their kind of cool, but I lightened it up with the composite set for packing around the woods.

Shoots very accurately, will clover leaf at 50 yards (with optics mounted).  Comes with xs rail & ghost ring sight.  Action can become finicky while shooting, but has always ran, but could use a little tinkering to fine tune; but it does run pretty well.

Looking for mostly trade offers, would be interested in:
Other lever action rifles, preferably in pistol caliber
pistols (a 10mm revolver would certainly catch my attention)
rifles
ammo
Optics
in to all sorts of firearm related offers, or the right amount of cash

Veridian Green Laser/light X5L - Brightest green laser on the market
Assembled in The U.S.A by CZ Custom

New Veridian X5L Laser plus light
Manufacturer's Description:

Introducing the leanest, brightest, tightest X5L, ramped up to evaporate darkness, subdue opponents and optimize a full-sized pistol like nothing else.

The blinding 154 lumen taclight is bigger and brighter, with beam intensity and explosive strobe that give aggressors nowhere to hide. The brilliant Viridian green laser is visible day or night, indoors and out. The leaner, aluminum-body profile fits your pistol as tight as a tattoo. An arsenal of custom modes lets you pre-program your tactics, then adjust on the fly to keep the advantage on your side.

You put a lot of thought, time and training into mastering your skill with weapons and tactics. The ultimate X5L makes sure it pays off when it counts.

I live in the country and this green laser can be see for on mountains that are at least 20 miles. from my house. Need a telescope to actually see it.  It's 10X brighter than what you would expect.  Best Green Laser/Light on the market.

I paid $1100 for the postal and $410 for the Viridian XL5 Laser/light and $175 for getting it into CA with the single shot exemption law, plus $35 for shipping, My total investment was $1720 plus tax. I fired this gun once with 50 rounds. Needs 1000 rounds through it before CZ says it is broken in. I hate to part with this gun but I need the money. 

Would consider selling X5L Veridian laser or pistol separately, but prefer to sell as a package. 

Shadow alone: $999
Veridian X5L Green Laser/Light alone $399
Sold as a package $1398

I have a lot of pictures of the gun, so if you want to see more let me know. Armslist.com only lets you attach three pics."

Rifle fires the 5.45 x 39 round which is inherently more accurate than the 7.62 x 39 cartridge. It has been fired very little and is in excellent condition with a mirror bright bore. 

The CUR2 model is the first AK74 style rifle ever imported to the USA and is said to be the best AK rifle of any kind that ever came from Romania right up to present day. It's also quite hard to find because the CUR2 was only imported for one year - 1997.

The stock and hand guard appears to be made of laminated wood and they have a shiny varnish type finish much like the old style Russian AK furniture but without the reddish tint/color. This one is more of a light blond color. Metal finish looks to be a black phosphor. 

I outfitted this rifle with a real PSO-1 scope that was made in Belarus in the 1970's. The PSO-1 was said to be the most advanced military scope of it's time and it was originally designed specifically for the Dragunov sniper rifle. The scope has a magnesium body and is 6x magnification with a 24mm objective lens. It also has an red illuminated reticle, however the special sized Russian battery that came with it expired years ago. I'm told that there is an inexpensive adapter for the PSO scope available on line today that allows the use of readily available American made lithium batteries. The scope is fully functional without the illumination feature which is typically only used in very low light conditions. 

Scope is in excellent shape too and has a silver/gray hammered metal finish. It comes with an original soft rubber eyepiece, a tool to change the illumination diode, khaki green canvas cover, and a winter battery adapter. The PSO-1 scope commands a higher price than the later POSP models and they sell for $300+ no matter where you look.  

Additionally the rifle comes with an original AK74 style web sling, three TAPCO 30 round black polymer mags, and two original military Orange Bakelite 30 round mags. These Bakelite mags are E.German and are very desirable today selling for $50 on up apiece. 

Finally 400 rounds of Romanian 5.45 x 39 MATCH ammo is included - (17) unopened 20 round boxes, and 30 rounds loaded into each Bakelite mag. 

Asking price for everything is $1100 with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old. 

ps: going through a box of gun stuff I found 2 additional brand new Tapco 30 round
mags and they will be included with the rifle. So total mags are 7 - 2 German Bakelite &
5 Tapco black polymer.

Thanks for looking."

This gun is ideal for anyone wanting a rifle that they can carry with them just about anywhere without it being noticed this guns for you. I have put this gun in a Camelback H.A.W.G. (not included) which is a very small pack and it was not even noticeable with the scope on the rifle. The barrel removes and replaces within seconds. This is the ideal travel companion. It uses Glock pistol magazines wich as you can see it is not picky. It will take any Glock double stack magazine chambered for 45acp no matter how short or how long. So it makes a great rifle travel companion for your Glock pistol. Thank you

There were only 8000 ever made making them one of the more rare production rifles ever made. My research indicates that only about 2000 were ever imported into the USA. 

This is one the nicest example I've seen in 37 years of collecting military firearms. Most of these are pretty rough because of the service they saw in harsh conditions.This one rates an honest very good to excellent in all respects - metal finish, wood, bore and mechanical function. 

It fires the same standard 7.62 x 39 cartridge that the SKS & AK47 does. It's designed to be top loaded with stripper clips just like the SKS. There are after market detachable mags made that offer higher capacity, and I see them on GunBroker from time to time.

Marked with ""S.N. & W.T.C. FOR MASSACHUSETTS"" on the lock plate, S. Norris and W.T. Clement of Springfield, Mass. produced approximately 11,000 of these on direct contract for the State of Massachusetts in 1863-1864. The rifle is completely intact with all original parts and is in really good shape. This is the 3-band, 40"" barrel version.  All cartouches and marks are still clearly visible - even on the stock.  I took a chance on figuring that the rifle could still be fired and dipped it to clean off the rust so it could be fired.  It has not been cleaned with a wire brush, you will not find any evidence of that.  In fact, I recently had a gunsmith in Bend, OR inspect the barrel and verify that it can be fired using correct procedures and black powder for this weapon.  For those of you who are familiar with the correct procedures, if you wanted to purchase this rifle, I would definitely allow you to fire it before purchasing it - with me present of course. There are some scuffs/scratches on the barrel where the bayonette had been fitted in the past, but I do not have the bayonette. Everything works properly - even the sights fold up and down as they should.  This is a great looking, functional piece of history.  I'm asking $1500, or reasonable offers."

I held the gun yesterday for a guy and never heard back so my assumption is he was not serious.  I have no idea what people play such games!  Again, this gun is unfired and still in the box.

I am looking at getting a revolver or else I would not sell.  I am now in my 70s and it is a little tough for me to load the .45 or otherwise I would not even consider selling.  In fact, I will not be upset if I don't sell.  I will accept cash only and will not accept checks.  If you want or feel you need a Glock 30 you will not beat this bargain.  I may trade the gun for a revolver at the gun show if I find the right gun.  I want the Taurus .327 model 601 with the long barrel if you have one.
