35,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2677035,For Sale:  Tango Down ACB-4 Bipod,"St. Peters, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 170,"Listed On: Monday, February 10, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very serious bipod. No pictures because it's off rifle. The brand name is stamped into the bipod to verify it's not a clone. It moves in every direction, including following a moving target to lead the shot and corrects cant all without any locks or weird stud fasteners, just a 2-bar pic rail fastener. It does lock the legs backward and can only be installed in one place - a carbine quad rail probably won't work but I have never tried it. I use a rifle-length Troy battle rail. Has 3-position height settings, wrench and bipod - sells from manufacturer for 220 US. I'll sell this (in perfect condition) for 170 US (that's 50 plus shipping off new) or best offer. My trip location changed and I had to go to a diffferent setup for very long rifle carry times. Again, don't call unless you're a  serious shooter, since this is designed for such - It is DOD-approved for combat purchase/use. (one of only 2 commercial bipods that have this approval). See http://tangodown.com/shop/tangodown-acb-4-bipod/ for what I am selling.  It's worth it and took me almost 2 months to decide to sell instead of keep in reserve. Call 636-219-7267. Near Spencer and Mexico in St. Peters."

accuracy in a pistol its size.

ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

The GLOCK 21 gives you everything you would expect of a .45 pistol. Countless law enforcement units swear by this superior pistol for more than just its above-average magazine capacity of 13 rounds.

Trigger Safety
Safe and ingeniously simple: Contrary to conventional, the trigger is the only operating element. All three pistol safeties are deactivated when the trigger is pulled -and automatically activated when it is released.

Tenifer Coating
Unique GLOCK hi-tech surface refinement for barrel and slide. Apart from optimum corrosion protection and anti-reflective finish, a degree of hardness of 64 HRC - close to that of a diamond - is achieved.

Polymer Frame
Corrosion resistant, tougher than steel and still 86% lighter. More than 20 years ago, GLOCK pistols were the first industrially manufactured handguns with high-tech polymer frames.

In designing the new Beretta A400 Xplor Action our objective was to make the world’s most versatile shotgun even better. We retained all the features that have made the A400 series such a success in a lightweight shotgun. The result?

Enhanced pointability, balance and ease of swing. It’s the semi-automatic you can use with absolute confidence regardless of game, target or season. The receiver also comes with scope mount grooves to accept optics and other aiming systems.

From the fore-end insert to the trigger guard and over to the kick-off interface, each component of the A400 Xplor has been conceived to optimize form, weight and functionality.
The finishing of the A400 Xplor Action’s receiver is an absolute innovation in the world of hunting shotguns and represents the union between the protective characteristics of anodizing and the exclusive brown-bronze color that renders the A400 Xplor Action truly unique.

Second, I have a WWII style 1911. It has a Remington Rand slide matched to an Essex frame. It shows holster wear, but the gun doesn't look to have been shot much. I believe it was a 70's build.  It's an accurate, nice shooter and will come with (2) 7 round mags.

East Germany
The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows. If you can get them for a good price, these are the ones to buy."

I am selling some of my 22LR, selling at 8 cents a round in bulk qty. $800 for the lot.

Min qty for sale is 2500 rounds for $200. I don't want to have to make more than 4 trips to sell it. 

It is a mix of new in box Federal AutoMatch (325), Winchester M22 (500) and Federal Bulk(525). I have some Remington as well.

Trades considered would be for bulk factory brass 223 or 556 ammo in half case/case qty, let me know what you have. 

I am a shooter who bought cheap and stacked deep and my price reflects a current market not set by gunbroker or gun show tables, so I think its a fair price considering no tax or shipping and I expect the same from trade offers.

The M4SD II is CNC machined, and fully TIG fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the M4SD II is manufactured from 316L stainless steel, with heat treated 718 inconel baffles throughout.

Put it on your ar-15 lower and you are ready to go.  I have a complete lower to add to it so you have a complete rifle for $900 and this include a 30 round magpul pmag.  Face to face in the Des Moines area.

Specs


This Adams Arms AR-15 A3 Base Carbine Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This Base Carbine upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle, picatinny rail gas block, delta ring assembly and a set of polymer M4-style handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a carbine length gas system. 

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

The gun is in 98% condition. I say that because it has a slight nick on the forend from clay due to a fast break on lo-eight.

It's a very good setup for playing around at the range or hunting. I am no sniper by any means, but I can consistently hit a 12"" steel plate at 300yds every time and with low wind I can hit a target at 600yds with proper compensation for bullet drop and distance. It's an awesome rifle, but I don't use it much and looking to add a lighter rifle to the collection.

Comes with one 20rd Pmag, it fits better when you're shooting from a bench.

This neat little carbine is harder to find than your standard Marlin Model 60.

This is a 1971 model and looks great for it's age.  It has lost a little bluing on the front sight and on the scope rail but otherwise the bluing dark and clean (rust free).

The stock still wears the original finish, and has a few dings and dents but is also in good  condition.

Made in a time before plastic she's all wood, steel and aluminum. The rifle is clean as a whistle and operates perfectly.

This handy little 16"" carbine with it's 9 shot magazine tube and built in sling swivels is a lot of fun, so check it out.

Also included is a 50 round box of CCI Stingers."
