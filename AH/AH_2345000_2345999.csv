The bluing is good, only a couple small pitting areas under the handguard and there is some, only cosmetic, pitting on the bolt. other than that the gun is in great shape and shoots great. I spent several hours cleaning the cosmoline and stripping and re-oiling the stock, which now looks pretty nice, I didn't go to far with it so i left a lot of the original dents and color in the wood so it didn't loose its age. this is a really cool little carbine, it is much shorter than the original mosin and more fun to shoot in my opinion.

Magazine fed, semi-auto machine!
* Has gas plug changed to a 6 postion (meaning you can shoot any type / brand of shotgun shells and she eats anything you put in her from slugs to birdshot - really like OO Buck). Original plug is included as well
* 24"" barrell (not the often seen 19"") that allows you to lay down fire from a greater distance (she has put a tight group of slugs together at 120 yds - open sights! and noticable patterns of 00 buck at 50+ yds). 
* Multi use - She can be a self defense beast - imagine 12 rds of OO buck (108 pellets) heading towards a bad guy within 4 seconds. That would make you think! Can be used for hunting, target or fun... lots of fun!
* Chrome lined barrell and built on the AK platform. Durable and easy to maintain.. that is an understatement. All you NEED is motor oil and shoelaces!
* She comes with her original 5 rd mag and 2 completly smooth feeding (which, if you know anything about Saigas and drums - all the work has been done for you) 12 rd drums.
* Original box and manual (yes, it is in English, as well as Russian)
* She has had @ 300 rounds through her and cycles like a CHAMP!
* Lots of 'elbow grease' went into making her a reliable beast. The work has been done for you, so you don't have to do anyting but load her and pull the trigger... over and over again!

This IS the shotgun that will make your friends go WOW! This is the shotgun that would make your enemies go OW! You can modify her all you want (you can change the furniture for about $100), but as she is, she is a force to be contended with... a beautiful beast!"

I fired about 50-75 rounds through it just to see how it shoots since it was my first Sig. This is a Special Configuration Model, before purchasing the firearm I called Sig Sauer customer service, gave them the serial number of the firearm and asked them what makes it a ""special configuration"" model. Sig customer service informed me that this pistol was specifically ordered by the military (branch of military is unknown) and Sig Sauer either made more then what was requested by the military, or the military decided they didn't need as many as originally estimated. Due to this mistake sig sauer labeled these type of firearms as Special Configuration Model's meaning their military surplus. This model is very hard to find especially in local gun shops due to the special configuration label and because it does not have a rail (keeps the classic look). To my knowledge Sig Sauer stopped producing the p226 without the rail, the only p226 that can be purchased now come standard with the rail.

As you can see in the picture this firearm is flawless, there is absolutely no scratch on this thing at all. I have kept it in great condition fired just a few rounds out of it and mostly its been sitting under my bed. It comes with two magazines (original), box, and lock. Night sights came with the firearm out of the factory. The firearm also comes with E2 grips meaning they are interchangeable if you have larger or smaller hands you can find a grip that will fit you. It is chambered in .40 S&W.

I will also be including in this price TWO custom made holsters by TTgunleather. I payed over $300 just for the holsters. ONE holster is custom made for the firearm the other is custom made for the magazine. Both holsters have been crafted from genuine Cayman Lizard and look amazing. I have included pictures of the holsters in natural day light. I received the holsters on the 8th of September so they are brand new, it took 4 months to complete. 

The reason I'm even considering selling this firearm is to upgrade to a .45. On the other hand I am in no rush to sell it, the ad will stay up until the firearm is sold or until I change my mind and decide to keep it. My price is FIRM. I'm not interested in trades, I will not sell any of the items here individually they will all be sold together in this package.

This is an incredibly accurate, full power 44 Mag., lead free load. The long-for-weight all copper bullet uses up the limited powder capacity of the case and keeps us from driving the bullet any faster than we are currently doing.

This 44 mag. load will work great and give adequate penetration for hunting big game species up to about 350 lbs. Since the bullet weight is relatively light, this load only generates moderate recoil.

At Buffalo Bore we always use real over-the-counter firearms to develop our published velocities. We believe the long time industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to achieve exaggerated published velocities is unfair to the customer as he/she will never be able to duplicate such laboratory type velocities in the real world, where it matters. Note our real world velocities below.

I have an offer of $500 from a store and no hassles. So, now is your chance.

I decided that i do not need two of the same gun chambered in different calibers. Note the ""9"" written on the magazines in sharpie to keep confusion to a minimum. The sights are the Sig Tritium Night sights and the trigger is Double Action/Single Action (DA/SA).  We have put thousands of rounds through this gun and it still feeds and shoots flawlessly. It is the number 1 reason i bought the same gun in a .40.

This gun is a great carry gun and still very shootable as a range gun. My better half learned to shoot with this gun and now we have both changed over to .40 S&W.

Price is $650 and includes both mags and all of the original box and paperwork.
(price reduced to $600 and I found a third magazine.)

Now for the hard part. I will sell this gun to two different types of people:
1) You have a CURRENT concealed permit and we can meet where ever is convienent.
2) You do not have any kind of concealed permit and we will meet at Cabela's in Springfield where YOU will pass a background check just like buying any other gun at which point I will get the cash and you get the gun. YOU will be responsible for the $10 fee and if you choose a different gun store, you will pay ALL fees.
Pretty easy, eh?"

I'm looking for a few new pieces for my collection, and I'd like to send some current pieces on to new owners.  A dab of cash here or there can be given or accepted to make things equal if necessary.

Here's what I'm looking for:

1. A Remington Sendero in 7mm Rem Mag, although other calibers will be considered.  Looking to learn 1,000-yard shooting, and my hunting rifles aren't up to the task.  Other heavy-barreled / custom rifles on the Remington 700 action may be considered, but no calibers below 6.5 mm please.

2. A stainless / laminated Ruger No. 1 single-shot.  Don't much care which caliber it's in, but I've wanted one of these since I was a boy.  Will consider blued / Walnut models also.

3. A Marlin 1894FG lever-action in .41 Magnum.  Not too many of these around, but I'd like to find one someday.  I don't know of other rifles in .41 Mag, but if there are any, I might be interested.

4. A shooter-grade .25-20, either a Savage 219 single shot, 23B bolt action, or a Stevens 44 single shot.  Bore must be in good shape.  Other rifles in this caliber may be considered.

5. Anything in .256 Winchester Magnum.  Would like to give this caliber a try.

6. A long-range rifle scope by Night Force, Leupold, or a maker of similar quality.  I don't know all the ins and outs of these scopes, but if you'll let me know what you have, I'll research it and get back with you.  Sorry, not interested in anything made by Tasco, Simmons, Bushnell, etc.  I already have scopes of that quality."

I decided to disassemble the pistol for cleaning and better identification. I found that this is a Ruger MK II Target, Government Model with the 6.78"" barrel. 

I have a Ruger Mk ll that was setup as a trainer/practice pistol by a lady that has graduated to high end race pistols. I have enjoyed owning this .22 LR. The scope is a Tasco Center Point PDP2 red dot with a stepped reticle. It is dead on at most indoor target ranges. I typically send the target all the way to the back and work out the center with with. The mount for the scope has been worked over to ensure it can eject all types of ammo.
The aluminum compensator on the end prevents rise and quietens the report down significantly. The oversize grip is a Volquartsen Volthane Target Grip. It's comfortable and allows for solid manipulation of the pistol.

I estimate a sale/trade value of the Ruger Mk ll at around $400.
B square scope mount - $25
Aluminum Compensator - $50
Volquartsen Volthane Target Grip - $50
Tasco ProPoint II PDP2 1x25mm Red Dot Sight Illuminated 5 MOA Reticle Matte - $82

Invested Value - $600

If you have a gun to trade make sure we are really close to the trade value or be willing to kick in some ammo and or accessories."

I will gladly send detailed pictures to anyone interested, once they've told me what they have for trade.

1. Beretta 92FS Compact L 9mm pistol.  This is the shorter barrel, shorter-gripped, 13-rd version of the 92FS.  It'll come with two sets of grips, 4 magazines, a lightweight D hammer spring already installed, and a very low round count.  This pistol is nearly new and looks it.  Black finish.

2. Swiss K35 rifle, 7.5 x 55mm caliber.  Rifle is in great shape, and will come with some brass and maybe a few rounds of ammo (have to see what I have for it).  These have a reputation for great accuracy.  Straight-pull bolt action.

3. Beretta 86FS Cheetah, semi-auto .380 pistol with tip-up barrel.  Will come with (3) 8-rd magazines.  This is a collector's item these days.  Pistol is a shooter, and great for anyone who isn't strong enough to rack the slide on a standard semi-auto.

4. Remington 40X smallbore .22 LR rifle.  This is the early version.  ""US"" marked, with Redfield iron sights.  Rifle is in good shape.

5. Beretta 92G 9mm pistol.  Same as the 92FS, except that the decocker lever doesn't have a ""Safe"" position.  It's spring-loaded, and will spring back to ""off safe"" when released.  These are fairly rare and sought after for competition and defensive use.  Has a D hammer spring installed to reduce trigger weight.  Will come with (4) 15-rd magazines.

6.  Beretta 92 Practice Kit for .22 LR.  Will include (2) magazines and complete barrel/slide assembly.  Can be used on any full-size Beretta 92 series pistol.  The kit probably has had 200 rounds through it, and still looks new.

7. Double Star AR lower.  This is a stripped aluminum lower which is new in the box.

8. There are various Beretta 92 accessories which I'll give options to buy/trade for to the people who take the 92's.  These accessories include grips, multiple magazines, holsters, extended slide release, etc.

NOTE:  Yes, I may be willing to sell some of these, but I'd prefer to trade them instead.  Cash prices will be on the high side.  

NOT INTERESTED IN SHIPPING.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME ABOUT ANY OF THIS IF YOU ARE OUT OF STATE OR CAN'T MEET ME FACE-TO-FACE.   I will travel within VA to meet you, distance depends on what you have to offer."

It is currently on consignment for the same price at Sportsman's Toy Store in New Bern, NC. It fires the .223/5.56 round and has been built and customized by me. In addition to the extras listed below, I also painted this rifle camouflage. I built this rifle with the intent of using it as both a tactical AR and a hunting rifle. I literally fired only 60 rounds from this rifle before putting it away and now deciding to part with it. This rifle functions flawlessly and will be a great addition to anyone’s collection as a shooter AR. It has minor cosmetic blemishes in the paint, but nothing to detract from its overall appearance or functionality. I hate to get rid of if especially since I put so much time and money into it, but I decided to go with something different. The upgrades include:
