This is a very lightly used AR-15, has but maybe 100 rounds through it. I bought it but need the money to pay some bills. 

This gun includes a FREE FLOAT rail as well as a Magpul MIAD grip. This is a sweet deal because this gun is custom to the top. The lettering on the lower has custom red inlay making it look real SWEET. The Free Float rail allows for greater accuracy by not adding negative pressure to the barrel. The barrel is crome lined and it has a 1x7 twist rate, which allows for heavier bullets up to 90 gr. Also is included is 2 30 round PMAGs.

It will also come with a belt holster.  the holster is nothing fancy, just a basic holster without any retention.  It comes with one magazine (Walther Brand).

The Bad:
There is nothing major wrong with the pistol.  The front sight popped off the last time I shot it and haven't had the time to replace it.  Apparently this is a very common problem with the P22.  the other thing is the thread cap for the barrel (The one that holds the barrel sleeve in place when the silencer is not attached got wedged in my safe and got destroyed.  These pieces are relatively inexpensive to replace (About 30.00 for both online)  That is all that is wrong with it.  Shoots straight and perfect!!!

I have used this press to load 223, 45acp, 9mm luger, and 40S&W I am including the 223 dies all you need to do the other calibers are dies, it works good but has its qwirks the priming system isn't great and some times the case feeder can be a little finicky although I did just install a new case feed rod and crank slide assembly which helped out a lot. I went from a breach lock single stage press to this and my production rate tripled even with its little issues.

Chambered in 7.62x54r, the Romanian PSL resembles an SVD-Dragunov but The PSL internal components are a little different. The PSL is based off of the Kalishnakov (AK) design and features a long stroke gas piston, versus the SVD's short stroke gas piston.  This is considered a Designated Marksmen Rifle (DMR).

Shoots great but I don't have anymore ammo for it so my need for this gun has ended as I just bought a 8mm Mauser with 1,000 rounds.

This is a great gun for the avid hunter or collector. Very powerful, yet extremely compact, this gun is well suited for small spaces. This rifle also has a scope mount already on it and a 16-power Tasco scope inluded.  Another great feature is the ported barrel. Having only an 18.5"" barrel and being such a large caliber, every little bit of recoil management is appreciated. The sling in the pictures is also included. I have only put 5 rounds through this gun and the previous owner (a relative) only fired 20 rounds to zero the scope. I love this gun, but im looking to get an AR-15 by either trade or cash. Price is $800.00/OBO, so make me a serious offer.  Included below is the Marlin factory characteristics:

Caliber:	45/70 Gov't. 

Capacity:	4-shot tubular magazine

Action:	Lever action; side ejection; solid top receiver; deeply blued metal surfaces; hammer block safety.

Stock: 	American black walnut straight-grip stock; cut checkering; ventilated recoil pad; tough Mar-Shield® finish; swivel studs.

Barrel	:       18.5"" with deep-cut Ballard-type rifling (6 grooves).
Twist Rate	1:20"" r.h.

Sights:	Adjustable semi-buckhorn folding rear, ramp front sight with brass bead and Wide-Scan™ hood. Solid top receiver tapped for scope mount; offset hammer spur (right or left hand) for scope use.

In this link, this rolling block went for $1000

This rolling block was in great condition BUT not perfect and still sold for 1000

The top rifle in my picture is in good condition and my trade value on it is 650, all mechanicals work perfect.

The bottom one isn't as good as condition, pitting, some scratches etc. I would say that it's worth 350

These rifles are only going up in rarity and price. In 10 years these will be worth even more and they will be even harder to find.
I believe my rifles are priced decently. 
I have mine set at a decent trade value but if you have ANY interest at all, please email me so we can come up with a deal

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

This is an older safe which is not insulated; it locks with 2 deadbolts…one on each end.  Come with 2 keys.  The rust on the front is only surface rust – does not go all the way thru – and could be sand blasted or sanded out and painted very easily.  This chest is very solid, sturdy, and strong…I’m not sure of the gauge of metal, but it is much thicker than the modern non-insulated ones.  Comes with a felt lined 8-rifle elevated rack which fits perfectly in the chest and a large felt pad which covers entire bottom of chest.

The cabinet is built in three pieces…base, door, and box.  It is very sturdy and heavy.  It is lined with multiple layers of fire board.  It was used to store ammo & reloading supplies but could be used to store anything you need kept safe.  It locks using multiple pipes which are locked in place when the top of the safe is down and locked.  The outer layer is oak and oak plywood stained and varnished so it looks nice in the house.

It is truly in mint condition. I added a rubber sleep on the grip, makes it a tad more comfortable. It has less than 100 rounds through it, if that many.

You get a brand new PX4 Storm at a price lower than anything you'd find on the Internet from Bud's etc.

$500. You avoid taxes and FFL fees and get it for about 15% less than I paid for it locally and less than you can find it on the Internet, new, etc. Good deal. Don't miss it.

I also have five twenty round extended mags which I will sell separately for $40 each. That's $5 less than the lowest price I could find on the web.

It features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available. 

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings. 

The P380 proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol.

It was a relatively inexpensive lesson in checking my gear thoroughly before I hand the cash over.

Externally, the rifle is in pretty good shape. Internally, it's pretty chunked up. The slide is rough, and the inside of the chamber shows that the slide has been rough for a rather long time. 

The gun fires fine but the extractor doesn't extract. It may be usable as a repair or a gunsmithing project. I'm just trying to recoup some of my losses."

733,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2211733,For Sale:  Surefire DSF-870 Tactical Light for Rem 870,"Dublin, Ohio, Columbus, Ohio",$ 315,"Listed On: Friday, November 1, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"DSF-870
Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns.

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness.

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left-and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations.

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters.

The DSF-870 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Remington 870 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense.

Packed with versatile features, the SR22® is lightweight (only 17.5 ounces) and perfect for just about anything - plinking, target shooting and even small game hunting. It is easy to field strip, fun to shoot, and will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition (not just high-velocity ammunition).
Firearm Features and Specs

The SR22 has light double-action and crisp single-action trigger pulls. Its external hammer is designed with a rounded spur for easy cocking and single-action shooting. The SR22 features a polymer frame and two interchangeable (no tools required) rubberized grips with angled serrations, allowing shooters to select either a slim or wider palm swell option. The aerospace-grade aluminum slide has serrations on both front and rear for better grip and slide manipulation. The easy-to-use underside Picatinny rail features multiple cross slots for variable mounting of most popular accessories.

The 3-dot sight system has a fixed front sight and a rear sight that is adjustable for both windage and elevation. A reversible blade allows shooters to select two white dots or a solid black blade. Other SR22 features include a stainless steel replaceable barrel, an ambidextrous manual thumb safety/decocking lever, ambidextrous magazine release, plus a visual inspection port to determine the load status of the pistol. The SR22 includes two finger grip extension floorplates that can be added to the magazine for comfort and grip. Each SR22 is also shipped with two 10-round magazines and a soft case.

Ameriqual is one of the three companies that produce MREs for the U.S. military. In fact, they're the largest providers of MREs. After years of being out of the civilian MRE market, in 2006, they finally came out with a product called ""APack Ready Meals"".

According to Ameriqual's APack website, their civilian MREs are called ""APacks"". But their cases (see below) say ""APack"". I'll stick with what the case and the MREs say for now.

Contents
With the exception of the beverage mix, all the food components of the APacks are the same as what is found inside the regular military MREs. The spoon is different from the military MRE spoon.
APacks come with a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH) that looks exactly like the military version with the exception that it has to be activated by salt water (a packet of which is included in the meal bag) instead of just plain water. Because the standard FRH can be activated by regular water, they are considered hazardous materials and can only be shipped via ground transport. By changing the FRH formula to require salt and water to activate, the APacks do not fall under those restrictions.

A case of APacks comes with 12 individual meals. There are usually six different menus in each case so you get two of each menu. The menus from Ameriqual appear to be set for now so every case should contain the same menus. Here are the six main entrees: Beef Stew; Spaghetti w/ Meat & Sauce; Chicken, Noodles, & Vegetables; Chicken Tetrazzini; Chili w/ Beans; and Chicken w/ Beans & Rice."
