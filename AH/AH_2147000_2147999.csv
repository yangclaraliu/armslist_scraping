There is no way for me to ship ammo. I Went to Fed Ex and UPS and they will not ship out ammo. You have to go through a special Haz Mat packing/shipping course. 

If you or your friends just happen to be visiting here on the ""Big Island""  called Hawaii, you can pick it up!-  Fly to Hilo Airport on the east side of the island. Ammo limit per person's suitcase is 11lbs.
If you fly in by Alaskan Aiirlines, the ammo limit is 50lbs. Alaskan Airlines flies in to Kona airport which is on the other side of the island. That can work too.  
You will need to declare the ammo when you check in at the ticket counter. Remember, failure to do so will get your ammo confiscated, get a hefty fine, or worse!

ST-22 with Magpul handguard, CMMG anti jam charging handle, Taccom plug, Taccom extractor, extra recoil spring. I am also throwing in a Taccom firing pin. The firing pin needs to be modded (a slot cut to match the spikes firing pin) in order to work. I dont feel like returning it, so im including it incase someone wants to perform that.

Im gonna be honest, you need good ammo for this. I dont feel like looking for high velocity ammo for this gun, that is why i want a 15-22 (ive shot my uncles and it'll shoot anything). This gun has never failed to eject or anything, but it has had its share of ejections into the charging handle space. After that happened, I upgraded the ejector and cut a few coils from the recoil spring. I have not shot it yet.

Also included are 3 blackdog mags (2 steel lip mags which are almost brand new and a nylon lip one which is used).

For a small fee, I can include a Boonie Packer insert that lets you shoot M&P 15-22 mags.

I'm asking M&P 15-22 + $300 OBO for everything, including the scope and the rear sight (both are amazon quality (NC Starish)). (of course the price depends on the 15-22)

If interested you can call or text 406-570-nine3ninezero Thanks! $365 firm

 Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

KEY FEATURES:

Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
Sling swivel studs built-in
Includes Modified Rem Choke"

Item Description (From Manufacturer):
The SureFire 618LMG replaces the original forend of your Remington 870 shotgun. Compact 6-volt (2-battery) system features a virtually indestructible LED emitter focused by a TIR lens, which produces a brilliant beam optimized for close- to medium range applications. Three switches are integrated into the forend: a momentary-on pressure pad switch (right side), a system-disable rocker switch (right side) and a constant-on rocker switch (left side). The 618LMG generates 200 lumens of output and has a tactical runtime of 2 hours per set of batteries, with gradually decreasing output afterward. The tough polymer body features a molded-in high-friction pad for enhanced grip in wet or cold conditions.

What the Warfighter will experience…
Turning to the suppressed mode from unsuppressed, you will immediately feel your rifle shooting smoother. The “blow back” in your face is almost non existent. No more burning eyes and choking gas. Your weapon has now become an average of 2 -2.5 DB quieter at the shooters ear with Innovative Arms silencers or other quality silencer brands. Your weapon will not only be shooting quieter but also cleaner. With less fouling and heat, the accelerated wear and tear that was once a standard issue is now a non-issue, giving your suppressed Black Rifle the longevity it deserves.

　

The W.A.R. is designed for the modern Warfighter and is to be fired only in conjunction with quality 5.56mm ammunition.

The Warfighter has two modes, SUPPRESSED/UNSUPPRESSED. By switching the lever in between modes the gas is ""OFF"" and results with the requirement to manually cycle the next round.
Innovative Arms has revolutionized the suppressor game with a new product named W.A.R. ""Warfighter Adjustable Receiver patented, patent pending technology"". The W.A.R. is in a class all by itself being the only upper reciever on the market with the ability to regulate gas flow at the upper reciever. There are big advantages in being able to make adjustments at this location over making the adjustment at the gas block.

Some may ask ""why do I need to regulate gas flow when running a suppressor ?"" Some of the benefits of regulating gas flow is that it reduces fouling, and blowback. By reducing blowback you reduce the action noise which makes the rifle quieter at the shooters ear. It also reduces the wear and tear from suppressor use. The W.A.R. does all this and more."

WESD51 still available.

I have two brand new in box Weller soldering stations. These are both temperature controlled soldering stations.

Weller WES51, $80

Weller WESD51, $120

Prices are firm.

The advantages of a temperature controlled (as opposed to wattage controlled) soldering station over a corded soldering iron:

-Variable temperature, and highly responsive current control
-Interchangable irons and tips
-Durability, you can replace the ceramic heating elements in the irons
-More power in a smaller package, the irons are smaller diameter and more comfortable than traditional irons
-Cooler in hand, because they use a small high power ceramic element out at the tip of the iron, the handle stays cooler during extended use

When using traditional corded irons, you have to keep several different wattage irons on hand for different size jobs. On top of that, you're stuck to a single temperature, and therefore a single type of solder. When you apply the iron to a part that sinks a lot of heat away, it cools the iron, and you have to wait for the iron to recover at its fixed wattage... all the while pumping unneccesary heat into your part.

With a soldering station, as soon as the electronics detect the iron cooling, they crank the current to recover the iron quickly... this means you bring your part up to temperature quickly, with as little excess heat as possible. All you need is a single iron and several tips, and you can safely and successfully solder anything from tiny IC's, to large battery terminals without worry of damaging your parts or cold solder joints."

so I've decided to sell my 9mm Uzi. It is either an Israeli or German lower with select fire grip (made into only semi and tac welded so you cannot easily make it back full auto), collapsable folding stock, 32 round mag, and parts kit (semi auto) upper. I got this in trade and later was told that the barrel length it had made it require certain licensing. So, I removed/destroyed the other improper barrel, and this is now completely legal. It literally is ready to roll with the exception of the barrel itself.I was told by previous owner it shot great and had no issues, but have not shot myself as a result of discovering the status of the barrel. So, this will currently come without a barrel, so it leaves open to you whether you want to buy a short barrel and fill out the required paperwork, or buy the 16 inch or longer barrel and need no paperwork. Either way, the barrel itself will only run around 120ish (i already located some online). This has normal wear, dings, and scrapes you would expect any Uzi that wasn't a safe queen to have.This is still a great little gun and looks very authentic versus the remake ones that you see selling for 1400-2000 and are half plastic and spray paint looking. I am open to cash offers, trade offers for multiple guns, single guns, anything gun related really. Im very flexible on offers and I am reasonable on price. Shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Please no shotguns or black powders (unless it's an amazing deal for me. I know around what these sell for so please dont lowball me or waste our times. For the right trade offers I can include ammo on my end, but am mostly looking for a multi-gun even trade. 
Thanks for your time and if you want any pictures or other info message me on here, or via text.

On a side note, If you have someone local who is selling a 16 inch UZi 9mm barrel then please let me know. I would be glad to do business!
Thanks for looking

    Nosler’s lead alloy mix, dual core, provides superior mushrooming characteristics at virtually all impact velocities.  The fully tapered copper-alloy jacket ruptures instantly at the thin jacket mouth, yet the gradual thickening along the bullet’s axis controls expansion and curls the jacket uniformly outward at high and low velocities.  Nosler’s integral partition supports the expanded mushroom and retains the rear lead-alloy core. The enclosed rear core retains more than two-thirds of the original bullet weight for deep penetration.  Every Partition® bullet in the Nosler® line delivers optimum length, weight and ogive design for maximum in-flight and terminal performance.  Special crimp locks Add strength to resist deformation under the pressure of heavy magnums.

This is a very interesting piece of history which is fully functional on the range! The only revolver that has cylinder move forward as you cock it to cover the gap and make a complete closure of the gap as you fire it. The only revolver that can actually be silenced. This model was created in 1895 for Russian Imperial Army and was used through WWI and WWII for Russian, Finnish, Bulgarian and many other armies of the world. 

This particular gun was made in 1944. It's in excellent shape and only has about 100 or so rounds through it. It's pretty accurate too, please refer to a target image on the bottom. Nagant is known for a pretty bad double action, however this one had a trigger job and double action is manageable. Of course it's not as good as on the new, contemporary revolver, but again: refer to a target image for results. If you need an ammo for this gun, I can point you to a reliable online resources where you can buy it.

The gun came to me new from the arsenal about a year ago, so you can say that I am the first owner. It comes with an original holster and cleaning rod. I can ship to a FFL for $35. Thanks."

Gun looks great, is very very accurate, never jams, and if you do ever get a light primer strike or lousy primer the gun will keep the bullet in battery and give you a second strike on the same bullet to give that bum primer a second chance.  I've shot a few hundred rounds through it and it has never failed to fire. But if it ever does that feature is there for you. 
The gun has 3-dot sights that are very quick.  Easily operates.  Has Decocker.  Very ergonomic!  Trigger pull is great in single and double action. Take-down is a pretty simple operation. Similar to glock.
This is the full size 5"" barrel version.  It has excellent balance and the extra inch and a half length and weight added makes the recoil VERY manageable.  Which is rare in .40 cal weapons.
The reason I think you will enjoy having this gun is simple ""AMMO IS EASY TO FIND and affordable!""  You can walk into any Walmart and pick up a box of target ammo for this thing for $15 or less.  .40 is a great mix of 45acp power and 9mm capacity.  And it's a newer caliber so most people are still hunting the stores for 9mm or .45 while tons of .40s&w just sits on the shelf waiting to be shot.  This gun even fires the Tula steel case ammo just like the high-price stuff. And Tula is 9$ a box.
A great round for self defense!  
I don't really want to sell this gun.  I'll be straight with you... If I don't get my asking price or close to it... I'm not selling it.  This gun is my every day open carry and I'm not selling it unless I get what I need from it.
So feel free to haggle but I can't promise I'll consider low-ballers.
mainly looking for cash. Trades considered.
The gun is worth at least $450 with the extra magazine, lanyard and Serpa holster I think my price is fair.
Text or email me your offer. Either will have about the same response time. I don't normally answer calls from number I don't recognize so text or email please.

Accurate LT-32 is an exact copy of the original T-32 powder used by benchrest shooters in 6mm PPC cartridge.  In fact the new LT-32 is made in the same factory on the same machines that produced the original T-32 powder.  The new LT-32 is known for its extreme consistency and allowing higher velocity out of smaller capacity cases like the PPC family.  The extremely small extruded powder results in consistent metering in powder measures and higher velocities compared to spherical powders.  Standard Deviations between lots have been cut in half to insure the most consistent lot to lot powder on the market.

I've been on a rash of purchases lately. All of them have been Sig 220s. I have bought three in the last month. This is one of the three. 


That being said, I am in no way, shape or form in any need of getting out of this pistol. I haven't even shot if yet, after all. But there is something I have been looking for and haven't found... a newer series 70 commander size colt 1911, or a 10mm 1911, preferably a delta elite. I will take an FN 5.7, of course. After handling some stuff today I will also take a sig 224 and cash or extras, or a 226 elite. See below.

This is a sig sauer p220 elite scorpion. Its tricked out from the factory, as tricked out as they come. Made in November '12, it has the smooth corners and heavier cerakote built to last. The grips are g10 parannah series from houge. The trigger is a factory installed SRT. Crisp as they come. The sights are bright, bright, BRIGHT. 

I have plenty of extras for 220s, holsters, ammo, whatever Whatnots you might need to seal the right deal. 

I may consider other 1911s, but nothing else, unless you have a sig 227 and some cash or a compact USP bitone and cash or extras. 

Let me say again that I am in no hurry to dump this. So please dont waste time asking my “bottom dollar."".... I've already listed it.

I am reasonable and I am sure there are things out there I haven't thought of in trade. But if you are making an offer, it MUST be fair. Dont expect too much interest if it isn't something I haven't listed."

I'm open to suggestions but no junk.  Chances are if you haven't been able to trade or sell your item, I probably will not want it either.
I'm open to guns first, then other items but again, no junk.    I don't need rims, tires, tools, tattoos, etc.
My only hard stipulation on guns is that they must be shorter than 28 inches or they need to be easily broken-down to be shorter.   

I also have 2 other guns available for trade and ads are up on this site.
1 is a Cobra 380.
1 is an AK-47 ""handgun"".   It's a short AK-47 with no stock and an SBR barrel. (very much like a krink or draco, but mine is Polish)"

John Browning and John Pedersen  are the original disigners of this gun. The ultra featherlight is the lightest pump shotgun at 5lbs 4 oz and is becoming quite rare.


 Artist Bill McGraw designed the game scene on the receiver and Sid Bell silversmith wildlife artist designed the deer red cap on this model.  Google these artist for more info.  Ithaca ultra featherlights have not been made for 26 years.  The newer and heavier Ithacas weigh over 6 lbs!  When you throw this shotgun over your shoulder you don't even know you are packing a gun.  This one is in beautiful condition wood and metal ( I would estimate 97% ) $750.00.  May consider trade or trade plus or minus cash for a quality handgun.


You can take off or change the barrel on an Ithaca 37 in less than two minutes.  Unlike other shotguns Ithaca uses threads to mate to the receiver for a more positive match up.  Most other shotguns use a slip fit.  It makes it very easy to clean the gun when the barrel comes off so easily, and no tools  are needed."

This Gen 4 Glock has even had it’s extractor and ejector replaced by an official armorer to ensure functionality with all ammunition, though it never had problems with ejection to begin with. It is currently in the left handed configuration but can be switched to right hand config in less than 5 minutes. This isn’t like your typical ArmsList sale where $400 guns are listed for $900 dollars. With this package, you need not fight and find and purchase all the peripherals separately, having to test for functionality or compatibility with each add-on, nor do you have to pay for sight installation. This package has you ready for any and all situations including night shooting, home defense, concealed, open and competition carry.

Accurate LT-32 is an exact copy of the original T-32 powder used by benchrest shooters in 6mm PPC cartridge.  In fact the new LT-32 is made in the same factory on the same machines that produced the original T-32 powder.  The new LT-32 is known for its extreme consistency and allowing higher velocity out of smaller capacity cases like the PPC family.  The extremely small extruded powder results in consistent metering in powder measures and higher velocities compared to spherical powders.  Standard Deviations between lots have been cut in half to insure the most consistent lot to lot powder on the market.
