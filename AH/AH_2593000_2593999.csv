104,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2593104,For Sale:  GG&G Under Foregaurd Integrated Rail (UFIR),"Panama City Beach, Panama City, Florida",$ 10,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"100% US MADE!!! Convert standard AR-15 foreguard into Picatinny rail system

Vertical foregrips and other accessories mounted at the 6 o'clock position on shoulder fired weapons have become prominent in military, law enforcement and civilian arenas. However, not every agency or individual for that matter, can afford or justify the purchase of a forearm assembly surrounded by multiple rails, when all they want to do is add a vertical foregrip or flashlight to the weapon.

Over ten years ago, GG&G introduced an inexpensive but mission ready Under Forearm Integrated Rail (UFIR) that permits instant installation and removal of most vertical foregrips, flashlights and numerous other accessories on the AR15/M16 weapon systems. This adapter rail can easily be installed onto the underside of an AR15 or M16 forearm, (standard or M4), using simple hand tools and a small amount of Loctite 262. The three point mounting system insures a solid, rugged mounting platform. Because our handguard rail mount follows the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913 or NATO's STANAG 2324) standard you will have no problem with accessory compatibility.

Installation does not require permanent alteration to the forearm. Detailed instructions and all of the parts required are supplied in the kit. The UFIR is manufactured from solid 6061 T6 billet aluminum alloy and is Type III hard-coat anodized matte black per mil-spec to provide combat durability. The GG&G UFIR is four inches long, provides eleven mounting cross lugs and machined to MIL-STD-1913 specifications so as to provide tactical flexibility in accessory mounting. It is lightweight too-at only 1.6 ounces.

This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it, and I am selling it simply because I don't have a place to shoot it to its maximum potential. Everything on this rifle is like-new

. The parts list on this rifle is as follows:- Remington 700 SPS  tactical .308
cadex defense chassis short action
Leupold mark 4 LRT 6.5x20 TMR glass with leupold mk 4 rings and base
 2x 5-round Accuracy International Detachable Magazines and 2x 10 round mags.
will also come with either hard case with layered inserts.

This rifle is easily capable of 1/4 MOA with the right shooter and ammo. I  only run SSA 175 grain match through it. 
. I will also gladly provide more pictures of any aspect of the rifle to serious buyers, since Armslist only allows 3 pictures to be uploaded.There are over $7500 in parts in this rifle.I am asking  6000 OBO. I may consider a trade for a FAL, SCAR 16, SCAR 17, H&K MR556, and LWRC AR or other high-end semi-auto rifle. .I would STRONGLY prefer cash, though. Make me an offer."

Let us take the hassle and guess work out of converting your old 5.56 that's been sitting around.  Your brass will be returned to you ready to reload however you see fit.  All of our gear and processes are top notch and we ensure quality at every step.

Conversion prices are as follows:

$50 - 500 cases

$100 - 1000 cases

Have more than 1000 cases needing to be converted?  No problem contact us for a price quote and timeline.

*Prices do not include return shipping and insurance.

*There is a minimum of 500 cases to be converted on each order.

We are also willing to purchase your 5.56 LC ""Lake City"" brass in bulk, please contact for pricing and shipment.

I have for sale one messaging pedicure chair. The chair is mounted to the pedicure base with four bolts. The chair can be used without the pedicure part. Although it is very comfortable watching a movie while soaking your feet and getting a good message. Everything on this chair works as it should, everything has been cleaned with Clorox and hydrogen peroxide and there are multiple message settings on the remote. There are heavy duty drink/snack trays that fold up and down on each side of the chair.
It is easy to move after the chair is removed from base.
I would like to trade this for a nice double barrel shotgun or maybe 30-30, or marlin 22.
The value on the chair is $600. I'm not stuck on having to trade even just a nice well kept gun close to the value. maybe trade also for a ruger 380lcp for wife"

I pushed roughly 500 rounds through it flawlessly and had it cleaned professionally prior to taking pictures of it.  It will arrive in the original box with four (4) Magpul 30-round magazines, the original accessories, manual, lubricating oil, rail guards, backstraps, etc.  Please reference the picture showing everything.

Up for sale is an HK USP 9mm Variant 3.
Comes with everything as it would from the factory: box, paperwork and mags. Also comes with 5 additional 15-round magazines. So, 7 total magazines (5x 15-round, 2x 10-round).
Great pistol, I just don't have a use for it. This is cheaper than a used USP9 without the extra mags - which are $40 or more each.

WITNESS DESCRIPTION: 
The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding firearm platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

""Why would I go with this AR? It has less tan and green stuff on it!"" We'll my friend this AR was not built to show off to your stupid friends in the safety of your house and never see a cold day at the range hammering out drills. This AR was pieced together by a combat veteran who just got out about 2 months ago. So the crazy is still very fresh and he has a beard now. Which we all know adds so much tacticalness. Long story short, this weapon was made to be a reliable, efficient, killer.  It has been meticulously maintained, and is ready for your further customization. (All my special shit went on my new AR ;) 
I can add go mags, PMags, h&k mags, Troy mags, optics, gangsta grips, and what not for the right deal. Or if you're just really really cool. Here's some of what's on it now.

 Like i said I can add optics and all kinds of tacticool bits for you to squeeze on while you deal death with this weapon. But only for the right trade. Trade value is about 1200 but if you have something that tickles my fancy that is obviously negotiable. Let's make a deal

Asking $500 OBO. This is not a 91/30. This is a 117 year old, best of the best, Mosin Nagant made by the Finns. 1942 Barrel date, SAKO manufactured. 1897 Tang date. This rifle has a PRE-WAR stock, and was almost certainly used in the Winter War. Bluing is about 97%. Bore shows signs of use, but gun still holds its accuracy beautifully.

The bolt matches the barrel, which means this is an ALL MATCHING gun. It shoots beautifully. I've shot 1 MOA at 100 yards with 180 gr. JSP in a 5 round group. 

Price includes a 7.62x54r Full size/Bullet seat/Crimp die, and 140 rounds of once fired brass x54r casings.

I recieved it with only one magazine so that's what you get with it. Has an apex spring kit and an apex aek trigger.

I'm looking to trade it for a S&W m&p 9mm full size. Ideally I'd like the model with the frame safety but it is by no means a deal breaker. I may also be interested in other similar guns, must be full size or accept a full size magazine. Please no Taurus. I understand these guns are usually more expensive than this gun so I am also considering throwing a stripped AR lower in with the right deal or just boot some cash. Located in Graham but will drive a little for the right deal.

The UTS-15 Marine has a digitized camo pattern which incorporates a specially formulated marine blue base coat over which the black and gray non-glare digital camouflage pattern is applied. The springs used in the UTS-15 Marine have a special corrosion resistant coating and all exposed metal parts sport satin nickel plating to be impervious to saltwater. All other metal parts, such as the barrel are black chromed or similarly treated to hold up to use at sea with a minimum of maintenance. The UTS-15 was designed to meet the demands of OBS24, one of the Worlds leading security companies providing security on board commercial vessels passing through the pirate infested waters off Somalia.
