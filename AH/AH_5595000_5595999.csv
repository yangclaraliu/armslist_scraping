Very scarce. Very well made! The Union Fire Arms company was located in Toledo Ohio and manufactured fine shotguns from 1903 to 1917. In 1917, Ithaca absorbed the company. If you are from the Toledo area and want an amazing conversation piece this one is for you.According to Gun Digest, a Union double barrel is worth between $300 in poor, non functional condition to $1400 in excellent condition. Also, there is a 15-20% premium for single trigger models, which this has. Based on my opinion only, I would say that it appears to me as if this gun would fire and function as desired if attempted. This is certainly a very seldom seen amazing piece of local history. It belongs on the wall of a local collector."

113,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5595113,For Sale:  Kirkpatrick Western Holster for Ruger Blackhawk .357,"Scottsdale, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, September 11, 2016",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling a Kirkpatrick Laredoan (1914) Western holster for a Ruger Blackhawk in .357 caliber. The belt is marked size 28. I wear size 30-31 waist jeans and it fits low on the waist at the last two holes and fits higher on the waist when fastened by the middle hole. The rig is in excellent condition and looks pretty close to new.  There are a few light scuffs from handling.  As you can see from the photos, you'd be hard pressed to spot them unless looking extremely close. It has never been worn outside the home or holstered a dirty firearm. The conchos are silver, and the details on this holster are very nice.  If you want a Western rig for your six shooter, this is a nice one. I do not know if it will fit other SA revolvers apart from the Ruger, but it may because the leather is not heavily molded. This holster sells for $395. I am asking $150. I will consider reasonable offers, including full or partial trade for ammunition in .22 LR, .380, 9mm, .357 mag, .38 special, .357 sig, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, .223/5.56, or 300 blackout.The cartridges are for photo purposes only and are not included.

Like New. Local Only!M21 Reflex sight provides constant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the M21 was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat. It is battle proven, reflexive to use, deadly accurate, and totally reliable. The M21 features a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. Reticle illumination is achieved by a protected fiber optic light collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area. The M21 is night vision compatible. This reflex sight offers shooters the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open. It is also designed to work with a magnifier. The M21 is the optic of choice for the Israeli Defense Forces. Bullseye Reticle Triangle Reticle X Reticle 4.3 MOA Reticle 5.5 MOA Reticle Always ready for action ‚ no batteries or switches. Reflexive, parallax-free aiming with both eyes open and focused on the target. Self-illumination adjusts to ambient light. Reticle designed to be visible under all conditions. Operates under all weather and temperature conditions. Large 30mm diameter lens with state-of-the-art coatings assures large FOV. Armored design for hard combat use. Sight is black and grey, no white or bright colored fiber optic tubes exposed. Increases accuracy and speed when firing under pressure. Quick-release Picatinny mount retains zero. Tritium Illumination is warranted for 10 years. Manufactured for The Mako Group by Meprolight in Israel."

I purchased this rifle as a sporter, I was going to do a restoration on it with a correct stock and metal, but have since purchased a more complete rifle for my collection. Bolt, safety lever and cocking piece all match as does barrel and rear sight parts, bolt sleeve has odd markings on it, have not been able to identify. There is no number on the receiver, which was common. There is extensive exterior pitting to the barrel as shown in pictures. Bore is dark, but rifling is decent, we put five rounds through it, shoots fine, it is NOT a sewer pipe like some of the old k98s after years of corrosive ammo and no cleaning. Does not look it has ever been reblued and has the “brown” –bluing patina common to firearms of the period, pitting could have possibly been battlefield, from the looks of the finish Stock came from another rifle that I am restoring and from what I am told might be an East German (DDR) rework of a WWII stock, from the triangle mark near the pistol grip. Also included, what looks like either a very late War or early Post War leather sling. This rifle has been priced very reasonably considering the current prices of wartime k98 Mausers with matched parts and no import markings and is a perfect opportunity for someone to get into an inexpensive non import matched rifle.
