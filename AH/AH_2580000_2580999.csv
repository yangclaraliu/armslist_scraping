Locally manufactured high-capacity magazine floor plate adapter converts your 10 or 30-round PS90/P90 magazine to a 50-round magazine.

Pictures show original 30-round magazine next to a 50-round magazine. All PS90 mags (10, 30 and 50-rounders) have the same spring. Only the floor plate determines the capacity.

I bought this Volvo XC90 when I got back from Afghanistan and needed a car. I paid $13,500 to purchase used from a reputable dealer, and have been current with upkeep and maintenance and have documentation of all work and repairs. This car has been great to get myself, my fiance and our dog to the mountains for camping several dozen times in the harshest of weather. I have really enjoyed having this car but at this point I don't need it as much as other things; namely cash and guns.

*** I am not kidding when I say this car is great in the snow. This car is STUPID good in the snow. Obviously driver skill is a factor and I learned to drive in some gnarly New England winters, but this vehicle has been a breeze to get around town in even in the roughest conditions. And being a Volvo you know it'll last forever, these things just don't die. 
The facts:
2004 Volvo XC90
Mileage: 102XXX
4 door with hatchback/tailgate 
AWD
Seats 7 people with folding 3rd row.
Nice hot heater + HEATED SEATS
Cold AC

ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round

Chambered in .40 cal
Includes 2 Sig Sauer .40 cal factory magazines
Factory Gun Case

I purchased this Sig in 2008 and it has performed flawlessly.  There are probably about 500 rounds through the gun, and to date I have not experienced a single issue of any kind.  Principally this was my home defense weapon, and lived most of its life in a bedside Serpa holster.  I'm selling because I want to buy a 1911 (not interested in trades, sorry)

The P226 Elite comes with a few great upgraded features over the regular Sig P226, specifically:

*Extended Beavertail - Great feature to keep your hands safe from slide or hammer bite!
*Tritium Night Sights (there is still some life left in the sights, but they are probably half as bright as they used to be.  Still visible at night though)
*Slide serrations on both the front and rear of the slide
*Short Reset Trigger - Sig's proprietary Short Reset Trigger (SRT) allows faster follow up shots, a lighter single action trigger pull, and very little trigger travel.  This is one of my favorite features on the gun personally.
*Rosewood Grips - These were from early 2008, right before the big gun rush.  Shortly thereafter Sig stopped making the 226 elite with the rosewood grips because they couldn't get a hold of enough good wood to keep up with demand.  
*Front rail - great for any accessories you may want to attach (lights, etc) - great feature for a duty or home defense weapon.

Condition:
I had a gun shop look over the gun to give me an estimate of condition, and their appraisal was ""at least 99% perfect"".  I've tried to get close up shots to show the condition.  The wood grips are in perfect shape, I can't find any marks, gouges, or scratches.  The finish on the metal is also in extremely good condition, with no marks or scratches.  The only place where wear-from-use is noticed is on the barrel itself, where you'd see the typical stainless finish starting to peek through the black.

I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have, email is the best way to get a hold of me.  MSRP on a new 226 Elite Dark is $1,218 (but those don't come with the wood grips), or the Stainless Elite model has the wood grips but retails for $1,368.  I'm asking $850 for the gun, will accept cash only, and will meet you somewhere local if you're in the Chicago Suburbs.

I'll require a picture of your FOID card so I can draw up a bill of sale, run it through the Illinois State Police's FOID check, and I'll require the mandatory 3 day wait period as well.  

As I mentioned, only looking for cash, not trades.  

Thanks for looking!

This beautiful rifle comes with its original box, cleaning kit, manual, one 5 round, one 10-round magazine. Also included are accessories that I purchased later: two CSSpecs 20-round magazines specially made for this VEPR 308, a Katlinka center scope rail mount, and an AIM Sports 8-32x50E-SF tactical scope (new in the box)
All items listed are new, un-used, with original boxes/packaging. You assemble this riffle and accessories to your liking. 
The semi-automatic hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big game. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (frm -50 F up to 120 F). 
VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel (550mm length for this rifle) with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market. 
The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a receiver base for a top, center scope mount.

This VEPR SUPER comes with a fluted barrel for reducing the rifle weight and improving cooling ability.

It's a break-open, single shot.
The serial # indicates it was made in 1949.
It is in excellent condition for it's age.
The wood and bluing show signs of wear and age, but with a nice patina.
The bore is shiny and clean. The action is nice and smooth.
It fires flawlessly and is also very accurate.
The original buttplate was missing, so I had a gunsmith install a period correct recoil pad.
He did so by shaving the wood down and fitting it so that it did not change the original length of pull.
It is comfortable for any size shooter, man, woman, or child.
It comes with a carry case

It has been a great rifle and I recently replaced the extractor, plunger, and spring with them.  Feeds flawlessly.  Just a good accurate reliable gun.  I need a new hunting rifle, so this one needs to go.

Has an accessory rail on the front of the stock to attach light/bipod/whatever.  Right below that there is a hole that doesn't affect the gun's function, just an odd little hole that was there when I bought it.  Rear flip up sight is cracked but still functions, just doesn't adjust.  I have never used the sight, only used the scope.  From what I know I am the second owner and I am not sure how many rounds were put through it before me but I have put about 700 through it.

All the standard, must be of legal age, Oregon resident, and I won't sell to felons, illegals, thugs, etc.  Prefer to sell to CHL holder.  No lowballers, bad-mouthers, or the like.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation.
The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the fore grip and sliding the fore grip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position.
The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. A unique feature of the SPAS-12 was the hook on folding-stock variants. This hook could be rotated in 90-degree increments, so it would fit under the user's forearm when the stock was extended. With the stock supported under the forearm the gun could theoretically be fired with one hand, allowing the user to fire around cover or use their support hand for other tasks.

More information on the rifle: 
The weapon is based on the Heckler & Koch G3/HK91 design widely used around the world, which itself is a variant of the Spanish-made CETME rifle. The United States Federal assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired in 2004) prohibited certain cosmetic features of the HK91, meaning that it could no longer be manufactured and sold to the US civilian market in its original configuration. Furthermore, the German-made HK91 was specifically prohibited from importation under the US 1989 Import Ban. Subsequently Heckler and Koch ceased manufacture of the semi-automatic HK91, and since then civilian versions of the G3 have increased in collector value. The PTR-91 was developed to fill the void, as the two rifles are almost identical.
JLD Enterprises (""JLD"") began manufacturing ban compliant PTR-91 rifles in 2002, after purchasing prints and tooling from Fabrica Militar of Portugal - an HK licensed factory. The ban compliant models did not have a threaded barrel, bayonet lugs, adjustable stocks, or ""high capacity"" magazines. Very early models, being produced directly from the purchased prints were nearly identical to the HK91 with the exception of modifications for compliance with the assault weapons ban. After the ban's expiration in 2004, JLD began offering a wider range of PTR-91 models, many of which featured more of the original military features. JLD also began investing in research and development, and debuted many new improvements and modifications to the original HK91 design. Initially, JLD produced rifles relied heavily on imported military surplus components for G3/HK91 rifles. In fact, most parts between the HK-91 and the PTR-91 are interchangeable.
In 2005, the major assets of JLD Enterprises were purchased by the newly formed PTR-91 Inc. Mr. Jose Diaz (JLD Enterprises' founder and owner) stayed on with the new company as a major partner. Mr. Diaz left the company in late 2010. Subsequently, the remaining partners and new management changed the strategic direction of the company. PTR moved from a business model of surplus part importation and assembly, to that of a true manufacturer - physically producing the components of the weapon in house. The company added significant machining and fabrication capabilities over the course of 2011 and 2012 to accomplish this change. Currently PTR is capable of producing every machined part on the rifles at its own plant in Bristol, CT - and sources other items (plastic, etc...) locally in the United States on tooling that it owns and produced. As a result, the current PTR rifles are actually made in the U.S. rather than simply assembled in the U.S. In order to represent the change in direction and capability of the business - the company recently adopted its current name, PTR Industries, Inc.
In the summer of 2013 PTR relocated to Aynor, South Carolina due in part to increasing gun control laws in Connecticut.
Today the company offers more than 25 different model variations, and has expanded into the law enforcement and military markets as well."

The GALIL Assault Rifle is a multi-purpose personal weapon, designed to serve as a basic weapon for the infantry. The rifle is lightweight, air-cooled, gas operated, magazine fed, shoulder or hip fired weapon. The GALIL is a very robust weapon with high reliability in difficult and extreme conditions and is in use of the IDF since its development - over 30 years.

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries.

There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun.

Description The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

Compatibility: Weapons using AR-15 Mil-Spec style Fire Control Groups

Yes, you heard that correctly.

Up for sale only, no trades. Enfield 2A ""Ishapore"" - the ""Last Bolt Action Battle Rifle"" manufactured in 1964 at ""RFI"" (Rifle Factory Ishapore) in India, chambered in 7.62mm NATO.

The Indians wanted a rifle that was chambered in a standard NATO round (due to ammunition availability) so they took the Enfield technology (found in the 1mkIII) and adapted it to a brand new rifle, chambered in 7.62 NATO (aka. .308 Winchester). Who cares that the rest of the world had been using automatics since WWII....India wanted BOLT ACTION (I mean cmon rest of the world, ammo's expensive).

This rifle is in phenomenal shape considering its journey, probably into the Himalayas...I mean the Indians don't like the Pakistanis or the Chinese, so its probably even fired a shot or two in anger...but probably not...I mean really, would you bring a bolt action into combat these days? 

It is import marked on the receiver. Strong bore and rifling....no rust anywhere which is shocking seeing as how its really fricken humid over there, and gun maintenance isn't generally high on the list of priorities. This one has been cleaned of the slapdash black paint that was on many of the imports. Wood is in great shape, with a few well done arsenal repairs to the stock heel. These stocks were prone to cracking, so they did pre-emptive maintenance on many to strengthen this area. Honest dents and dings in a few areas...but it was a battle rifle...and it may or may not have been around the block a few times.

I've had it out to the range twice since I've owned it -- its a great shooter. I've seen alot of these sporterized, but I just couldn't bring myself to put a scope on it....call me old-fashioned.

Comes with....a rifle, enfield sling and a 100rds of .308 (dealer's choice on bullet weight - it seems to like the expensive stuff....but lets be honest, who doesn't? ‪#‎amiright‬?)

$275 OBO (cash or card +3%). (""Best Offer"" is usually one that isn't half what I'm asking, doesn't involve anything made by Jennings, and doesn't require me to drive 3/4's of the way to International Falls... I can look on gunbroker just like you can...and this thing doesn't eat anything or make me change the channel so it can watch it's show...just sayin'...I HAVE seen something else shiny that interested me however).

The bike has 13K miles with a liquid cooled, carburated 800cc motor.  It is drive shift driven so there isn't any belts or chains to replace or tighten.  Changed  the oil, oil filter and spark    plugs last year.  The exhaust is Cobra drag pipes with the baffles still in them.

Both rifles have gold triggers and the floor plates are engraved with ""Our Family Legacy 2013"" in gold. This is designed as an heirloom set. These rifles are new in the box and untouched other than to examine at FFL. They are flawless as are the boxes. The photos are stock photos as these bolts have never been installed in the rifles. The bolts are engraved with 1 of 2 and 2 of 2. These were built together and serialized together as a matching set from Browning. If you are interested, then you already know that the 257 Roberts are extremely rare in the A Bolt. Only 250 of these sets were produced.

Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

Simply chamber the laser bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the rifle is aiming; it's easy to sight in any scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the SightMark Accu-Dot Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any gun. It's easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. These boresights come with a lightweight carrying pouch that protects the laser for convenient use in the field.
