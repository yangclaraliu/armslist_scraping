19,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2062019,For Sale:  Colt New Agent TALO limited edition #49 of 500,"St Matthews, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 900,"Listed On: Saturday, August 31, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is the limited edition Talo Colt New Agent. Only 1000 were made, 500 in 9mm and 500 in 45 ACP. This gun is 45 ACP. The main differences between this and the regular New Agent is that it is all super cool and blacked out as well as having GORGEOUS grey/black wood laminate grips. Also instead of that crazy trench sight across the slide it has real Novak sights. The rear sight is black and the front is a Trijicon night sight.

I am the only owner of this gun and have owned it for 1.5 years. It has a very low round count as I tend to shoot my full size Colts and carry the little ones. There is a little bit of slide wear on the front end from holster use but it is pretty minor as you can see in the photos close up.

There are some modifications made to this pistol by my gunsmith to make it a little more comfortable to shoot. First, I swapped out the sharp and nasty grip safety for a Wilson Combat upswept beavertail. This is probably the most comfortable beavertail I've had on any 1911. Second, I upgraded the extractor with an Ed Brown Hardcore extractor. Lastly, I removed the Series 80 firing pin safety and put an insert in the frame. This gun has one of the most amazing triggers you'll find on any 1911 under $2000.

I am including with the gun, all the original Colt parts which I saved since this is a limited edition, 2 factory Colt 7-round flush fit magazines, and a set of olive green VZ G10 Gatorback grips and grip screws and the factory hard case and manual. The factory grips were WAY too nice for me to bang up carrying the gun so I put these great grips on it. The factory grips are therefore in MINT condition as well as the grip screws which I also preserved separately from the gun.

I will, for a little bit extra include two very nice holsters with the gun. One is a Galco Combat Master tan leather OWB holster and the other is a Comp-tac C-Tac IWB holster. I would like $70 for the holsters as they are still in very nice shape and each one is a $70-80 holster by itself. I take very good care of my stuff so these are not worn out nasty holsters, they are really just broken in and not much more.

Thanks for looking.

Items I will consider trading for: (trust me, there is NOTHING besides what on this list that I will consider)

1) A QUALITY rifle scope: must have exposed and numbered turrets and be either fixed power or first focal plane variable. Looking for something in the 6-16 power range and a 30mm tube.

2) Sig Sauer P229 40/357 magazines: don't have to be in great condition but not dented or rusted either

3) Sig Sauer P229 .357 barrel

4) DPMS 308 magazines (10 or 20 round)

It is in great shape and appears to have been handled and fired very little.  Has a set of Hogue grips on it that make it fit the hand very nicely, also has older but still usable night sights.  Only comes with one mag but it is an extended 8 round mag and P239 mags are readily available online.

I'm primarily interested in trading for compact or subcompact sized .40's with double stack mags as the single stack guns are too thin for me.  I'm most interested in either a glock 27 or 23, an XD40 subcompact or service model, or a Beretta PX4 compact or subcompact in .40, but let me know if you have any other double stack .40 that I might be interested in, though I'm not wanting anything full sized.  

I would also consider a commander sized 1911.
I might also consider a higher end (no Tauruses) snub nosed .38/.357 revolver, but I'm really more interested in semi autos.

Will sell for $600 if not interested in trading, or give me a reasonable offer.

Windage and elevation adjustments are 1/4 MOA.  I also have the original box.  This scope currently sits atop one of my benchrest rifles, and is only for sale because I want to put a Nightforce Competition scope on this rig.  The scope is pristine and perfect, not a single blemish on it, and as can be seen, is worthy to sit atop a very expensive fully custom benchrest  rig.  But I just  want an even more powerful scope (Nightforce) on there so I can shoot 1000 yards, that's the only reason I am selling this.   This model scope currently sells for 760 online, and with tax and shipping would cost over 820 dollars.  I would offer mine at 650,  so someone willing to purchase from someone like myself who obviously uses top quality equipment and takes care of his stuff, can save themselves 170 dollars.  Again, original box included as well.  And sorry, but the rifle is not for sale at this time.  Maybe in a few months or next year after I've played with it some more and am ready to have a new project gun built."

I just received a call from my dealer that springfield has issued a recall of the XDS models.

The issue is described as possible fire with chambering a round when racking the slide and/ or a double fire when the trigger is pulled once.

PLEASE BE ADVISED - PRESS RELEASE

""Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur."""

This item is for SALE and the price is FIRM.  Face to face CASH transaction in Clearwater area.

Based on the last few Emails I have received I feel I should add:
I do not have any ammo or holsters to include,
I'm not interested in trading my gun for your boat or car detailing services,
I'm not interested trading for your Mosin Nagant or any other firearm, 
I'm not willing to drive out of the area to meet,
The least I will take for this gun is $325, I'm not Walmart and I don't price match because you saw a guy selling one for less on the other side of the country. 

Thanks for looking!

Benelli M2 Tactical with Ghost Ring sights, 18.5"" barrel, Inertia drive recoil reduction system, New in box, no trades. MSRP: $1359

The M2 Tactical is a no-nonsense 12-gauge shotgun that police and military the world over reach for when the going gets tough. The M2 Tactical, like all Benelli semi-automatic shotguns is Inertia Driven, which uses recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. The M2 Tactical fires all 1-1/8 oz. or heavier 2-3/4"" and 3"" shot loads plus slugs. The M2 Tactical features a fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sight and military-style fixed-blade front sight or adjustable rifle sights.

-Inertia Driven bolt mechanism
-Includes 3 Crio choke tubes

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A."

Have two rifles up for trade, one is a BCD 4 coded Kar98k LSR repro sniper and the other is a Springfield (Remington made) M1903a4 repro sniper. Both are absolutely beautiful rifles and have been built by HIGHLY skilled gunsmiths (the Kar98k was done by a gentlemen on GunBroker, scope base was hand fitted to the receiver). The Kar98k has a repro russian PE scope w/german reticle. The 1903a4 has an ORIGINAL Weaver M73B1 scope with NOS Redfield base. Kar98k has a little corrosion in the chamber but nothing real bad, still functions flawlessly and accurately. Other than that, bores on both rifles are shiny and strong. These rifles are BEAUTIFUL and finding others like them is probably darn near impossible. I also have ammo for both, about 60 rounds of 8mm (consisting of a mix of Israeli, Italian, and Portugese) and I think about 8 FN made AP rounds. Have about 30 rounds of Remington and Winchester (brand new) .30-06. 

I am really only looking for a NICE AR10, and must have at least 24"" heavy barrel. This is mostly a feeler post right now, but send me an offer, worst I can say is no thanks! I am not interested in pistols or shotguns, only rifles. I will send pictures and more details to SERIOUS INQUIRES ONLY, I don't have time for picture collectors. There is a pic of the LSR below I threw on simply because it was already on my computer. This may only be up for a day too, I keep going back and forth between trading them and locking them back up."

I also like AR-15 uppers and lowers as I'm building a few right now (Rock River, CMMG, Colt, S&W, Daniel Defense.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The gun is as stated a Pre B and doesn't have a firing pin block. It also has a round trigger guard with a spur hammer and original CZ styled grips. There is an import marking from Magnum Research Inc located underneath the frame's dust cover and the box is also marked by MRI.  This was done because the pistol was imported before CZ USA was formed. The pistol is also marked ""Czechoslovakia"" not Czech Republic.

Kel-Tec RFB18 Bullpup 308win Carbine Rifle - Factory new in box, in stock & ready to ship
Info from Kel-Tec - RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross- section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. email seller : REDACTED"

This is a great rifle, I just want to unload it and build a sbr. I'm asking $2500 for the rifle, case , and sling that came with it. I am willing to negotiate with serious buyers. I will not entertain ridiculous offers and trades. Eotech in picture is not included. Magpul rail covers are not included."

Remington 700 in 7mm-08. The 7mm-08 rifle cartridge is one of the most efficient hunting cartridges for medium and large game found everywhere in north america. Having LESS recoil than the .308 AND the 30-06, yet flatter trajectory than both, it screams in at around 2800 FPS with an impact of around 2500 ft-lbs. Not to mention, since the parent case is .308, it is much easier and cheaper to reload than the 7mm magnum. Hundreds of yard of lethal accuracy, ready to hunt! Included is a brand new padded sling that holds an additional 4 rounds. Taking OFFERS on cash or trades or a combination. That means dont ask what my bottom dollar is or what ill take for it.

 Up for TRADE, I have a very nice, clean, and ""finished/fitted/tuned"" black Springfield Armory XDS chambered in .45acp. Package comes with everything as if purchased new (XD Gear, holster, mag holder, case, and lock with test fire casing dated 3-21-13. Also with this package are the original SA Parts that were replaced during improvements by a gunsmith, (stock weight trigger assy. springs and sights)

 Upgrades installed are as follows:

 1. Extended grip safety (provides higher grip on handgun and fills void in frame when depressed so the sharp edge can no longer chew on your hands) Plus it looks very nice.

 2. Talon rubberized textured lay over grips (Black in color flash makes them look grey in picture and provides comfortable, non printing, positive grip on handgun.

 3. TruGlo T.F.O. sights (Tritium Fiber Optic) Best sights on the market! Quick target acquisition with BRIGHT green dots that glow very bright in day and night! GLOWS IN DAYLIGHT!

 4. Powder River Precision's trigger enhancement spring kit (4lb smoother than stock trigger with a very clean, crisp break and very short reset.

 5. Cosmetically have installed a Freemason's striker cover and flat mag plate. Also second mag has Pierce grip extension.

 Has 350 rounds down pipe, all ammo CLEAN BRASS FACTORY AMMO. Not a single failure, I HAD NO INTENTION AT ALL OF GETTING RID OF THIS GUN, BUT A RECENT 1911 PURCHASE HAS MADE ME VERY CURIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO GET A OFFICERS OR SMALLER 1911 TO CHANGE TO AS MY DAILY CARRY."

I have several adds listed on GOC with items I am selling for my brother who is being deployed to Afganistan on the 10th and asked me to sell/trade the things for him. He obviously doesn't have time for himself right now to do this. One of the items he was looking for was a Remington SPS.

I was contacted by a person from Pikeville claiming to have one that he would like to trade. He asked for the shotgun listed plus $300 which was a fair deal. After getting back home from the trade I find out that what was actually traded was a Remington ADL which is $150-200 cheaper and not a fair trade at all. I contacted the guy to let him know of the mistake and was told I he knew it was an ADL and that I should have known what I was looking at when I traded. It is true that I looked the rifle over, but I took the guy at his word. I asked for him to make it right and that I would drive to him plus give him a box of slugs and $20 for his time, but he wouldn't go for it.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."
