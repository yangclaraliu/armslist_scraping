Consider the RUGER LC9 NRA is a Special Edition, double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull for your next concealed carry firearm. Slightly larger than the ever-popular LCP, the control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. For peace of mind, a loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication of a chambered round, as well as internal, manual, & magazine safeties. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. With its unique Natural Gear Camouflage frame, this Limited Edition LC9 totes a NRA prefixed serial number and provides a donation to the National Rifle Association with each purchase. It also comes with a lifetime repair or replacement warrantee as well as a custom Ruger carrying pouch to protect your “concealed” investment.

That's 560 rounds of proven ammo. $500 takes it all, including the .30 cal ammo cans Serious buyers only, please. Since this is in my Bound Book I must require an FFL number or DL/CHL number and a bill of sale.  FTF preferred in or near Beaverton area."

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I am not looking to haggle, I have considered what I have paid for every item I have on here, what current market value for the item(s) are, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. And of course, Colorado Residents can legally buy dope now but you CANNOT have icky, ugly oh SOOOOOOOOOO scary 20rd magazines.  Sorry.  If you are a Colorado resident wanting to purchase we can talk about what we can do instead since I can't sell the gun to you with the mags.

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I am not looking to haggle, I have considered what I have paid for every item I have on here, what current market value for the item(s) are, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I am not looking to haggle, I have considered what I have paid for every item I have on here, what current market value for the item(s) are, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

Our patent pending C4 rail system is a lightweight, rugged, 2 piece free float rail that when installed gives the uppers a continuous 12o’clock rail. The C4 system is the lightest and most rigid rail that clamps to a standard barrel nut on all AR15, M4, and M16 type weapons systems.  Our design allows the installation of the rail on an upper assembly without removing the front sight post or permanently attached muzzle devices.

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I am not looking to haggle, I have considered what I have paid for every item I have on here, what current market value for the item(s) are, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."
