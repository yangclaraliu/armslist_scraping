Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Like the title says, looking for a quality 1911.  As the title reads, I'm looking for high end to mid range.  Citadel is the absolute bottom of the line id consider, that and a rock island tactical (same thing as citadel for the most part).  I prefer stainless and nickel to blued guns.

I'm not paying retail prices, and don't want a new gun.  I'm very current on prices, and look online everyday so no trying to polygack me.

I PREFER TRADING.  Let's talk about what you have, then we can talk trade or price.  I have several guns I'd consider trading, a brand new gun safe that's awesome and heavily modded to maximize space, a new never used 3250 watt generator, very nice Marin mountain bike, etc.

I also have a like new heavily modded rock river ar15 I'd consider trading off for the right gun plus cash.

New ""Ultra Compact"" discreet carrying case is the industry's smallest case designed for the AR-15. The unique design allows the weapon to be stored and transported by pulling  the pins to break the weapon into Upper & Lower assemblies. The small shape, navy color, and absence of external pockets offer a very discreet method of transportation.

SPECIFICATIONS:
• 2 1/2"" total soft padding
• Full-length heavy-duty zipper with pull
• Brushed Tricot soft scratch-resistant inner lining
• Padded divider protects gun parts and optics
• Wrap-around carry handles
• Two internal extra magazine pouches
• Durable, extra heavy-duty Nylon, water-resistant outer shell

This is a great case to keep and/or transport your AR rifle. There is a separate padded area for the lower and upper assemblies and two mag pouches. It makes the package you are carrying small and light weight and in no way gives a clue as to what's inside.

I purchased two of these thinking I would also use one for my AR pistol but instead decided to only use one on my AR-15 rifle. Broken down my AR-15 rifle with 16.5"" barrel fits easily in this case with room to spare. The one I am selling here is completely brand new and still in its plastic bag with all tags.

Asking $4500 plus a HONDA (prefer civic hatchback, 2 door better, 4 door ok) in running or non-running condition depending on year / condition for me to keep and use.

OR 

Asking $5700 reasonably firm.

OR

A spectacular trade involving no cash. Gotta be seriously damn spectacular though.

See Below For Details

Automatic 5spd w/ overdrive. Makings of a great work/play truck. A little rough around the edges, solid where it counts. Would make great plow truck.

The Good:

Super Duty - Hitch receiver and tow harness adapter
A/C and Cruise Control
4x4 (manual hubs, shifter on the floor)
Power windows, locks
Linex liner
Toolbox
Good tailgate
Front clip in good shape


Long list of new and newer parts on truck:

Transmission rebuilt
Turbo rebuild
Turbo pedestal and plunger replaced
Two injectors replaced
Two 5 month old Interstate batteries
New starter
New water pump
New glow plug relay
New intake heater relay
New both sides in front
Upper, lower arms
Upper, lower ball joints
Steering stabalizer
Wheel bearings
4 shocks
New drive belts
New air filter
New high pressure oil pump
Drivers headlight assembly replaced
Nice bulbs recently installed
Recently had oil change and tune
Used lucas oil products in everything
New L/R hub, bearings, internal parking brake, rotor, pads
New fuel filter

Have receipts for many of above parts and some service records - oldest is an oil change receipt dated during the year 2000

The Bad: Truck's block heater needs to be plugged in overnight to ensure reliable starts in cold weather.

The Ugly:
Truck has a cracked windshield (not shattered)
driver's seat isn't so hot (truck now comes with brand-new RealTree seat cover)
driver's side rear door has some damage (dented and then pulled out)
Bed has a little wheel well rust and some dings and dents (no huge wounds)
Cupholder/ashtray in dash broken put present
Different keys for ignition and door (driver's outer door lock doesn't work with key)
A few bumper dings/dents. I'd give the body overall a strong 7/10


Truck has 392k miles, mostly highway. First owner was construction company, used for management transportation between job sites, then put into general service with a friend of mine before it came to me. Yep, that's a few, but it's a strong runner (stupidly reliable 7.3L International engine - they used to put 'em in semi trucks) and is good for a ""running with room for cosmetic improvement"" work/play truck.

Was originally interested in truck to use for my small business, would keep but don't have a requirement for a big truck currently (business concept hasn't worked out ... yet). Transmission was rebuilt less than 10k miles ago. Expected to put another $1k - $2k into it (tires and eventually injectors) and put another 200k miles on it.

KBB value for 'fair' condition, including odometer miles, somewhere north of $8500.

Clean Colorado Title. Can provide VIN for carfax to prove no accidents (on your dime).

OFFER MUST INCLUDE SPECIFIED PRICE IN CASH."

 I'm selling my 22' hydrostep I/O boat. Hull is in great shape! Trailer is usable but could use new tires and some cleaning of the frame and some paint. I purchased this boat/trailer in the spring for $2150.00 and I'm looking to get back what I paid for it.

 The hull is in great shape. It was the original step hull design a lot of the newer boats are using now. The engine condition is unknown to me but it did crank when I hooked up a battery. I don't know how it runs because I never hooked up gas or water to it. I purchased it with the intention of putting in a long block chevy in but never had the time to complete it. The trailer could use some cleaning up and welding in some areas but over all its in good shape.

 If you're looking for a solid winter project this is the one for you! Boat is being sold as is for $1500! I'm moving the boat to storage on Sunday the 17th and will give the new owner the $500 storage fees off the price ($2,000) if we can arrange pick up by the 17th.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, I'd like to get this sold before I put it in storage for the winter!

This is a nice gun in great condition with extras and a very low round count (less than 1 box). No visible wear anywhere (those are just my fingerprints on the slide, from taking pictures). The barrel is a Lone Wolf threaded 1/2x28 and it has both a thread protector and a muzzle brake. The high Trijicon sights are dual purpose, with white dots for the day and green night sights in the dark. These sights are high enough to clear a suppressor. It comes with two 17-rd mags, two 33-rd mags, and 1 50-rd mag, as well as all the original stuff like the factory hard case, paperwork, mag loader, and test casing.

The ammo in the picture is for sale but is not included in the listed price...I'm just throwing it in as a possible add-on.

This gun has been well taken care of. I've put approximately 550 rounds through it. It functions flawlessly. Very easy to shoot and very accurate. Comes with everything you see in the pictures, including the gun itself, all 9 mags, the original case and the original brass and nylon cleaning brushes. The gun also has a set of TruDot tridium night sights as well as Hogue overmolded grips. I'll also throw in a Fobus drop holster.

Cosmetically, the gun is in great shape. The only issue that it has is some very minor discoloration on the backstrap. I assume this is from being held. I have not tried to get it off, other than using rem oil. I'll include a picture of this in this ad.

I'll take $450 cash for it. Firm.
Otherwise I'm looking for a $525 trade value.

The original finish has been worn away in places over the last fifty-four years, and there're a few small scratches under the tip of the barrel from when it was poking out of my holster and I sat on concrete.  It remains the most accurate handgun I've ever fired, able to hit golf balls at forty feet when I'm paying attention to what I'm doing.

For those unfamiliar with the Single Six, it's a single-action .22LR six-shot revolver (they didn't start offering .22WMR cylinders 'til two years after this one was made) with four hammer positions (ready to fire, load/unload, just been fired, and a 'safety notch' just far enough back to keep the hammer away from the firing pin so it won't go off if dropped/bumped).  A spring-loaded rod under the barrel is used to eject spent casings, and disassembly for cleaning involves an easy, push-button rod release.

Two holsters included, one leather hip-holster nearly as old as the pistol is, but in decent condition, and a nylon holster with straps for a shoulder rig that can be unclipped to wear it on the hip.  Included ammo is six rounds of cast-fragmentation self-defense loads, twelve rounds of Stinger that have noticeably more kick than most .22's, and roughly two hundred rounds of assorted cheap ammo, mostly Federal."

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire. The versions of 2"" Rhino with Double Action only (item codes ending with ""D"" instead of ""DS"") do not have an external hammer. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included."

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is its distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. Dot-and-Post sight system are clones of the M9.

LaRue Tactical A-PEG™
Initially designed with the precision shooter in mind, the folks at LaRue Tactical queried trusted individuals in the precision shooting community what they would prefer in a grip. The result is the LaRue A-PEG™. The project grew into an accessory that featured ambidextrous geometry that can be used by all shooters, enchaining control of AR15-type weapons. The A-PEG™ is available in two sizes; Regular (for 5.56 receivers) and Extended (for 7.62 receivers). The Extended version fills the “gap” in AR10-platform receivers. 

Inspired by the human hand, the unique “flats” on the front and back fall more naturally onto the geometry of the hand’s structure. The flat front also provides indexing to help level and square the firearm to the target. A sculptured palm swell on either side fits nicely into the hollows of the palm. A gentle taper helps seat the hand towards the firearm, and helps to keep the hand from sliding. The generous texture added to the sides gives just the right amount of traction in slippery conditions. 

Having an A2 footprint, the A-PEG™ will attach to almost any firearm that has an AR15-type grip interface. Comes complete with mounting hardware. 

Price is $20 face to face in north Carson City."

Warranty:
A warranty. What else about a product says as much about how highly a maker values their own work? It’s a mark of integrity, an assurance that the person who built it believes in it enough to stand behind it. Lawyers, legalese and fine print have no place in it. And we feel ours both stands on its own and speaks for itself.
“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one
of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”
That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

100% SELF GENERATING EMERGENCY OFF GRID BATTERY BANK POWER SUPPLY

2000Watts (4600W Max Surge) ALL BRAND NEW - NEVER USED EQUIPMENT!

Complete, Ready To Work Immediately!

#1 Survival Bug Out Camp Necessity IN WINTER!  Everyone has weapons, but everyone seems to forget what will you do to keep you warm in the Winter? Burning wood or paper produces smoke and fire; which will be seen and act as a magnet for everyone to come to you! Here in WI, the below zero temps will knock off your friends/enemies faster then your ammo...

My Custom Backup Battery Power Bank was designed to work as a Free Off Grid electrical system that you can use 24/7, for many months continuiously, without it needing any maintenance.  Imagine having your own, self generating electrical supply in your basement or garage! I have these for Emergencies, but they can be used for hours, days, and months, hands free.  (I do check it a couple times a day when I'm using it 24/7 for reassurance...)

This setup has 4 Brand new Quality Marine Deep Cell Batteries (900 ah each = 3600ah) as its power supply.  You can easily expand this setup to add more batteries (6+) for more reassurance.  I convert these to household power outlets so you can plug in essential electronics like you do at home.  (Car batteries are not made to store power-only initial surges to crank over).

The power issue is that no sunlight=no solar power; no wind=no power; and gas generators uses gas.  NOTE-Gas has several major issues.  1-No power=no working gas pumps; 2-Gas DOES NOT last forever, and only has a shelf life of about 7 months from the time it's made (not forever)!  So long term Bug Outs who expect to use gas generators, they are not the answer, nor the smartest long-term idea!  But I bypassed all of these issues...

I made several of these Backup systems for my families, and have this 1 extra; which I am offering here. Imagine the peace of mind you will have knowing that once the power goes down, that you and your family will still be able to have electrical power! You can plug in your Heater, Lights, TV, Computer, Microwave, etc... It will handle MORE electricity then what ia Power Strip can handle! Especially here in WI, what will your family do for heat when the power goes out for 24 hours, or 3+ days and nights?  Once Martia1 Law kicks in, it will be Months (if ever again) you get any power thru the lines...  Perfect for a cabin up north, any building (barn) or location without any power lines, and can be moved by one person.

$1100 Complete. ($900 in Parts) At Home Easy Plug and Use, with No Maintenance.  Needed parts are getting harder and harder to find, and once the first disaster happens, it will be almost impossible to find and put together this system...

Photo is not complete and only show some of the items included in this sale. I will not give out any key piece(s) needed in my setup until time of sale... Make no mistake, THIS DOES WORK.  This is a legit offering, and I, in no way am scamming anyone. 

I personally have done many trials and errors with this setup over years, and finally worked past the solar/wind/generator issue(s).  I feel my asking price is well worth all my invested workaround time/experience for a self generating system...

Remember, no one can do it all alone.  Pool resources.  You need to find like minded people who will watch your back, and you can trust in any disaster.  Don't be selfish, but work together for the benefit of the your LIKE MINDED Survival Community.  If they are non believers or can not benefit the community, say good luck and move on...  Family members (bro/sis/par) are not automatically the best survival companions if they don't have the mindset, will, or drive...  Are they a asset or liability?

That's what I get for trying to be ""artistic.""...Now back to your regularly scheduled ad...

I bought this at Ron Peterson Firearms last summer. Never even took it out since I am fortunate to have several rifles that I shoot regularly. This is a very early one, when Remington still produced all their products with high end materials and walnut stocks. I have three magazines that will come with it. The finish is all original, rated over 95% and it has sling swivels installed from the factory.  Just a very nice high quality rifle. I think I have it priced like a junker, but it isn't.  When you see it you will fall in love with it like I did. Hopefully you will have time to shoot it.

Gas operated, semiautomatic rifles llike this should be lots of fun with less recoil than a bolt action .223.

Please and thank you.

This is a rare collectors piece as they are hard to find and are considered the best for quality and etc. It is imported by Intrac of Knox TN. This is NOT a cheap Russian M-44 or Chinese M-53. It is honestly the best mosin example I have ever seen. Most are beat to hell, but this is a work of art. This gun has all matching numbers and has a very beautiful wood stock and bluing. I have never shot this gem, but it has probably been shot at the factory. It is dated 1953 and the markings are crisp and clear. The trigger and bolt are so smooth compared to other mosins. The craftsmanship that the Polish put into this gun is just outstanding. The rifling is great and doesn't seem to be worn down at all or look like a sewer pipe. Now there are some cons to this gun, one of them is the bluing at the front of the top hand guard. Other than that, this is a beauty and has been a safe queen ever since I've had it. It doesn't have any rust that I know of. Everything is as solid about this gem. Its just so beautiful.  But, I'll have to let this go to fund some other things.

EDIT: Sling is Russian .... Also, I will only sell to a OR resident if they have a C&R license or you Pay all ffl fees and other fees that may occur. 

Price is always negotiable but don't low ball me. 

I am asking $425.00 OBO (NEW PRICE)

I've done my research on the prices and I believe this would be a fair price to ask for this gem considering you can look at it in person and not pay FFL, shipping and etc. Remember, I'm not talking about prices from 2008 and etc.  Im talking about today's prices.

I'm open to trades, but I honestly need cash more than a trade.  Cash is king.

I have a Winchester 1907 SL .351 Cal with a 5 and 10 round mag. The gun is in operating condition but looks rough. Barrel has had bluing removed by sanding quite a bit, bore is bright, rifling does look worn down, rear sights been replaced, (Really, I'd say the barrel is a total loss) forearm is missing, receiver is pitted. Don't want to sugar coat it, it's rough, but fires. The 5 round mag is original, but sanded/ground on and the 10 round is aftermarket. I am not a old Winchester kind of guy, so I would like to trade or sell it to someone needing parts or who wants to restore it. Its a good firing mechanism and trigger assembly parts gun.
