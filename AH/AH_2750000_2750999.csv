ACP. Serial number 52***. This pistol was manufactured approximately 
in 1920.  I say approximately since these guns were not shipped in 
strict serial number order, so it's possible that it could have been in 
inventory for a few years prior to shipping. Comes with stag grips (going for approx. $150 when you can find them). Disclosure- The finish is not original blue. At some point it was reblued. Has original Colt magazine. Additional pictures upon email request. 

I will only sell face to face if you have an Oregon Drivers License AND a CURRENT Oregon Concealed Carry License. Otherwise we will go through an FFL Dealer with all expenses of doing so at your expense. I will not sell to someone who cannot legally own a firearm. No exceptions."

FN SCAR
Daewoo 
FAL 308/7.62
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal.  
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily. 
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal 
Beretta 92FS INOX, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
1911 pistols 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be perfect for my AR-10
Maybe another Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.  A Savage 12 BVSS .308 would be nice as part of a deal.

This listing is for a Tactilite Spartan 50 BMG upper receiver that mounts to any AR-15 lower. It takes 5 minutes to convert your AR-15 to fire 50 BMG- all you have to do is remove the buffer and spring, and install the new hammer and spring (included!) This is not legally a firearm, so you can have it shipped to your front door! I live in Howard County but commute to Baltimore so if you live in Maryland, I can definitely travel a reasonable distance to meet. 

I do have a listing on gunbroker http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=396994547 but I would rather sell locally to support the MD shooting community.

interchanged or removed

To demonstrate the mounting of the upper, I've included pictures with it mounted to a lower. The lower is not part of the sale, though.

More pictures are available by request.

I am an individual seller, not a dealer, so you are receiving an excellent price compared to MSRP. I am also offering free shipping. I am selling the upper because I'm moving to where I won't have easy access to a 50 BMG range.

Please pay with cash, check, or money order.

Varmint style laminate wood stock with 3 sling swivel studs.
24"" heavy barrel with a recessed target crown.  Barrel tapers from .804"" ahead of the receiver to .740"" at the muzzle.

Receiver is drilled & tapped for Weaver scope bases (included).

Savage adjustable Accu-Trigger.

Barrel is 1:14 twist chambered for 22 Hornet .224 Hornet not .223 .

Overall length is 42.25"" & weighs in just under 8 pounds naked (7lbs 12oz)

Single shot, bolt action, feeds & extracts excellently.

Rifle is very accurate.  Last Spring I was testing factory rounds with a BSA 6-24x40 scope.  At 50 yards (my range outback) it would group Hornady 35gr V-Max 3 shots touching.  In the late Summer I added a 8-32x50 scope with a target dot & it would put 3 shots in the same hole at 50 yards with the same box of Hornady.

It shoots Hornady the best for me with Winchester & Prvi Partazan being about equal but no where near as accurate as the Hornady.

It does NOT like any Remington factory loads, PERIOD.  At 100 yards Remington looks like buck shot down range.

I have used this rifle to take woodchucks out to 190 yards with ease.

There is no recoil, a very mild report & the rifle feels lighter than it is due to an excellent balance.  

Whether you shoot coyote, woodchucks, fox, porcupine or other varmints this rifle will do the job and then some.

Add your scope of choice, grab a box of Hornady 22 Hornet and shot this rifle.  If you reload then you can work up a load for it.

If interested contact me via email. 

Can meet for face to face or within 75 miles of 16509 for FFL transfer, and I am willing (unlike other Armslisters) to ship to a FFL.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
I have one Woodland Camouflage Point Blank vest included with the 2 Armor plates for our ""Mil-Spec 46100"" for $200 the size is Medium and it is like new. I have only one Multicam Front/Back/Side Carrier manufactured by
""Tactical Tailor"" for sale the complete set plate carrier including the plates would be $300

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

Okay here is your ""Reach out and touch someone"" style rifle that was used extensively by sniper teams due to how ""flat it shoots"". Doesn't drop an inch in 100 yards I am told. I have had this thing for a long time and have still not had a chance to even shoot it as I don't get a chance to hunt and it is just gathering dust.

Has a nice Saddle Mate sling with cartridge holder, and big Bushnell scope 6x18x50. 
Probably older version with checkered wood stock and shorter saddle barrel .

Would destroy deer  and other large game. Send me pictures of something to drool over and it is yours.

Compact dimensions for open and concealed 
carry, minimum weight despite large magazine
capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability 
of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, 
which was demonstrated through tests and widespread 
use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive 
arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities 
for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.
