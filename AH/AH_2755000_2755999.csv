In 2011, Bowtech released the Invasion which featured the new Center Pivot Extreme riser design, OverDrive Binary Cam system, pre-loaded, seven-layer HardCore Limbs, FLX-Guard cable containment system, two-piece DymondWood grip and a set of vibration damping accessories. BowTechâs new Center Pivot Extreme (CPX) riser has extended ends that sweep back to meet the limb approximately halfway along its length. This places the pivot point of the limb behind the deepest part of the grip and is, by definition, a deflex geometry riser. Benefits of a deflex riser include inherent stability and accuracy provided by this torque-resistant configuration. The test bow shined brightest in this area, demonstrating amazing stability and a deadly still aim. The center-limb support also reduces overall limb movement, which reduces shock and vibration at the shot. 
IBO speed for the Invasion CPX is 343 fps. The power behind the performance is found in BowTechâs OverDrive Binary synchronized dual-cam system.
This bow is set up for:

I have a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 in 9mm Glock 17 format.  I also have several accessories that will come with the rifle.  I have purchased the keltec rail accessory that allows attachment of VG/Light/Laser etc.  I also have 3 great products from tacticool.  See below for full descriptions.  Everything included + the rifle is BRAND NEW, NEVER FIRED, with all original boxes, documentation, tools, etc.  I waited 8 MONTHS after putting down money for this awesome little rifle to come in but I've since changed the main caliber of my SHTF weapons.  As a result, this baby needs a new home.  I'd love to keep it and am still somewhat on the fence about selling it, but as a poor student there's only so many firearms I can indulge myself in at any one time, so if I get the right offer I'll have to say goodbye, but the price has to be right.  If you've been frustrated by Kel-Tec's crazy slow manufacturing speed and you NEED this thing now, shoot me an email and lets work something out.  See below for detail/photos:

1. Kel-Tec 9mm Sub-2000 Glock 17 format with 17 round glock OEM magazine 

2. SUB-397: Picatinny Rail for SUB-2000. Attaches conveniently to the bottom of the forend.  (value $30 with shipping)

3.  SUB-2000 Buffer Cylinder  (9.50 + shipping)
For a little pistol carbine, the Kel-Tec SUB-2000 has quite a kick.  It's so fun to shoot, it's easy to go through a few hundred rounds, and you'll be feeling it in your shoulder tomorrow.  Now, there's a simple and inexpensive solution that eliminates over 30% of the felt recoil.

4.  SUB-2000 Bolt Tube Cover  (13.50 + shipping)
The Kel-Tec SUB-2000 carbine is fun to shoot, but the cheek weld to the steel bolt tube is a source of some discomfort.  The heavy bolt recoils inside the bolt tube which is in contact with the shooter's cheek.  The steel bolt tube is also a good thermal conductor, transferring heat or cold into the shooter's cheek.  The Bolt Tube Cover insulates the shooter from the shock loads and temperature extremes, greatly increasing the comfort when shooting the SUB-2000.  It also provides a tough rubber armor for the bolt tube, making it an even tougher little go-anywhere, do-anything carbine.

5.  SUB-2000 Operating Handle Cover  (4.50 + shipping)
The Kel-Tec SUB-2000 carbine is fun to shoot, but the steel operating handle isn't very ergonomic, and pulling back the bolt to chamber a round or verify the chamber is empty can tweak your finger.  The SUB-2000 Operating Handle Cover is a quick and easy way to increase the comfort and make the SUB-2000 friendlier to shoot."

Original correct never blued bolt, with knurled underside of bolt handle. A bit sloppy when all the way back at the stop, but bolt cycles perfectly and action locks tight. Head space is correct using a field guage, though I've never fired it. 

Butt plate, bolt, safety, cocking piece, bolt sleeve, extractor, firing pin, front and rear trigger guard screws, floor plate, follower, trigger guard are all original stamps, and  numbers match the receiver. The bolt stop is also stamped but non-numbers matching.
Though I haven't done anything but lube it in the 20+ years I've owned it, this old boy has led some sort of life somewhere. The numbers and marks are there and visible, but they are neither crisp, nor bold.   

This is not some MM electro-pencil ""force matched"" collection of parts, it's the real deal. 

As far as I can tell, the stock appears to be the original walnut, but as you see it was sporterized - the popular thing to do with Mausers in the 30s. They even checked the fore end and the grip. The other thing that was done during the sporterization was it was rebarreled with a Springfield '03 barrel in .30-06 also popular during the 30s I'm told. Apprently set up scope only (I didn't get one). 

Taking up space in the safe that I need for something else and it should be with someone who truly appreciates it. Straightforward resto only needing a stock, barrel, and number matching bolt stop.   

I have more photos if you have a part you wish to see more closely.

No rust. No pitting. Not a blemnish. Recently equipped with a Baker Tactical scope rail. Its hard mounted to the receiver and gauranteed to never lose zero. (The best design for the SKS ever!) The dragonov stock is hydro-dipped in 3D skulls with a silver undercoat. The finish also has no blemishes what so ever. The rifle also has a UTG illuminated scope. (Not the best but a good one for an SKS) This SKS is a good shooter and has mainly stayed in the safe since it was put together. The scope still needs to be sighted. Everything is functional and 6 Tapco, 20 round mags are included with purchase. 
Fires flawless and its a head turner at the range.....I'm not in a hurry to sell it. My wife loves it and would kill me if she found out I might sell it. Just looking to get my investment out of it or an even trade for a Romanian SAR-2 AK74. I'm open to any logical trades though. Just email me."

Year 1996 Eagle $50 denomination.  I bought this for $1611 with the premiums and tax.  I am hoping to get better than spot for it.  We can meet at a store to verify its authenticity.  Asking 1500, spot recently is 1327.80 but premiums are about %12 (~$159) plus tax (~99) it would be hard to get a better deal than about 1586 at a store.  I was hoping to hold onto it, but I had some unexpected expenses.  Gold is near a 17-week high right now, but personally I believe it will go up, not down if you can hold onto it more than 6 months.  Honestly, I expect gold to go WAY up once the New York Comex is revealed to be a rigged market, and once the volume of salable gold in the U.S. is redefined downward, with an upward price tag per physical unit.

Description

SMITH & WESSON INC

M&P 15 Sport

5.56 NATO (223 Remington), 16 in, 6 Point Collapsible Stock, Black Finish, 30 Round Detachable Magazine

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house â 16? without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:9 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isnât the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what youâre looking for.

These are going fast I only have 4 left. If you want one I suggest you contact me quickly as they will not last long. 

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a  better upper receiver available.

The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell Deflector only. Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer  a  service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

 If multiple uppers are purchased then I would be willing to negotiate on price."

A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

This is a well used field-grade gun with 26""inch barrels. The upper barrel is choked 3 stars or modified choke. The lower barrel is choked 4 stars or improved cylinder. This has great metal work and the wood is still in very good shape. There is freckling on the barrels and this gun has been used but there are no known cracks or defects. Lockup is fairly tight with a light bit of play which does not affect function. A smith would solve this with a larger hinge pin. I have used this shotgun on clays and had no issues."

The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform.  This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452.  Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation.  

The CZ 455 American Combo Package is now available from CZ-USA. The package features the new CZ 455 in .22LR and a .17 HMR barrel along with everything you need to make the caliber change. The CZ 455 eliminates the need to spend the extra expense on a second rifle when you want to add another quality shooter to your rimfire battery.

The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

Please read the entire article before responding.  I've got a little extra cash to spend and am testing the waters for offers to buy your higher end 1911 (and I say ""higher end"" because obviously some custom shop ones are going to be out of my price range).  I am interested mainly in 1911s that are valued at or around $900 - $1500.  Please reply with Make/model info, asking price, pics, round count/usage info, and list any upgrades or extras/ammo you'd include with the offer.  Wanting new(-ish) or otherwise mint condition, but if there are cosmetic flaws, please inform me including pics (would not appreciate surprises here).  Might also be interested in pieces with history, even if the actual item is valued lower than the minimum I am looking for.  Totally prefer self-illuminating Tritium sights; prefer .45 ACP but 9 or 10 mm is ok too.  Here is a list to give a general idea of my interests, 1911-style pistols ONLY:

Springfield TRP
Sig Scorpion or Compacts 
Kimber Warrior or Custom Shops
Colts in Stainless, Colt Combats, any Railed
S&W Performance Centers, Sc's, Stainless E-Series, any Railed
Para Executive Carry, Black Ops, Pro series
Dan Wesson
STI
any unique or rare models, or possibly a piece with some good (preferably verifiable) history behind it, or any used complete Nighthawk, Baer, Wilson, Brown etc. that you would like to sell quickly.

Prefer to deal with locals and inspect the item F2F, or may even possibly travel within Texas for the right kind of deal.  I'd rather not deal with private sellers from other states.

If I did not list the item you have for sale but you still think I might be interested, it can't hurt to send me the offer with requested info and pics - just please don't waste my time with unreasonable offers."

With numerous law enforcement and federal contracts, the P229Â® is one of the best selling SIG SAUERÂ® pistols available. Now with the introduction of the new Elite model, the P229 is more popular than ever. The new P229 Elite features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights, custom wood grips and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The P229 Elite Stainless features a stainless steel slide and frame in a natural stainless finish.

*No loaded chamber indicator on top of slide or mag disconnect-a definite plus!  The new CA approved Sig Sauer handguns will all have them-this is the last of a dying breed!
