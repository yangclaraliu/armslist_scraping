It is a CMP Special which means that when the CMP received it they replaced the stock and barrel with brand new ones, replaced any worn parts with originals and made it look great. With these you don't really have to worry about parts matching or barrel wear affecting the value like it would on a collectors piece. Rifling is sharp, bore is shing, and free of wear. They are a great gun for someone who wants to shoot an M1 Garand because the cheap shooter grade ones aren't going to be this nice and you don't have to worry about devaluing a nice purely collectors piece.

The Jimenez Arms J.A. .380 is quite possibly one of the simplest, easiest to use and most comfortable compact .380's on the market today. Jimenez Arms includes such features as: a comfortable stance and an extended finger rest located at the bottom of the magazine. Other manufacturers offer this feature only on specialty clips at higher prices. Jimenez Arms, however, includes this feature at no extra cost. If you're in the market for a compact .380 and price, accuracy and comfort is a factor- the Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 is your solution.

I am the original and sole owner and have fired probably 400-500 rounds through it total (only brass). I just don't get around to shooting it as often as I'd like to so I figured that it's time to sell it. I personally cleaned and oiled after every shooting session and am quite anal about keeping my guns clean. 

It came stock with the standard black, two-piece plastic handguards however I installed my own quad-rail handguard with detachable rubber stoppers. I still have the plastic handguards if you would prefer those instead. The gun comes with one 30 round magazine. The magazine is the original grey/steel one in the pictures and I still have the original owner's manuals to go with it.

I also have a bipod, 200 Lumen flashlight with pressure switch, and a foregrip that aren't shown but attach to the handguard if you would be interested in those as well. I'm sure we could work something out for a little extra.

The three shot group on the bottom picture was at about 110 yards with Winchester Bulk 55gr FMJ ammo and I am about an average shot. The rifle could probably be 1 MOA or lower with the right ammo and shooter.

Viking Tactics, Inc. offers a large selection of high-quality, battle proven tactical gear, designed by warriors for warriors. The VTAC product line covers a wide variety of tactical needs for the soldier, the law enforcement officer, and the competitive shooter as well.

This rifle has a premium quality 16"" 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel with a versatile 1:8"" twist rate. 1:8"" twist rates are an ideal compromise between 1:9"" twist rates for lighter commercial ammunition, and 1:7"" twist rates for heavier military and precision ammunition. Innovative 5R rifling is used, an intermediary type of rifling between conventional groove rifling and smooth polygonal rifling. 5R rifling increases accuracy and velocity as compared to typical rifling, while also improving ease of cleaning. The muzzle is threaded and Smith & Wesson's enhanced flash hider is outfitted, reducing flash signature significantly while directing gasses and sound forward and away from the shooter. A mid-length gas system is used, resulting in lower felt recoil, and subsequently better accuracy for 2nd shot hit probability.

A VTAC/Troy 13"" Extreme TRX handguard is equipped, free-floated for maximum accuracy and reduced heat transfer. The light weight and rigid design allows quicker target-to-target transitions as well as improved ergonomics. Two 2"" modular Picatinny rail segments are included.

The upper and lower receiver are forged 7075-T6 aluminum with a black hard coat anodized finish.

Viking Tactics, Inc. offers a large selection of high-quality, battle proven tactical gear, designed by warriors for warriors. The VTAC product line covers a wide variety of tactical needs for the soldier, the law enforcement officer, and the competitive shooter as well.

This rifle has a premium quality 16"" 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel with a versatile 1:8"" twist rate. 1:8"" twist rates are an ideal compromise between 1:9"" twist rates for lighter commercial ammunition, and 1:7"" twist rates for heavier military and precision ammunition. Innovative 5R rifling is used, an intermediary type of rifling between conventional groove rifling and smooth polygonal rifling. 5R rifling increases accuracy and velocity as compared to typical rifling, while also improving ease of cleaning. The muzzle is threaded and Smith & Wesson's enhanced flash hider is outfitted, reducing flash signature significantly while directing gasses and sound forward and away from the shooter. A mid-length gas system is used, resulting in lower felt recoil, and subsequently better accuracy for 2nd shot hit probability.

A VTAC/Troy 13"" Extreme TRX handguard is equipped, free-floated for maximum accuracy and reduced heat transfer. The light weight and rigid design allows quicker target-to-target transitions as well as improved ergonomics. Two 2"" modular Picatinny rail segments are included.

The upper and lower receiver are forged 7075-T6 aluminum with a black hard coat anodized finish. Geissele's Super V trigger is equipped, boasting a light trigger pull, quick reset, and simple design with no set screws to come loose. The bolt carrier and gas key are chrome lined for excellent corrosion resistance. A VLTOR IMod 6 position adjustable stock is installed, as is an A2-style pistol grip. A VTAC wide, padded 2 point sling, VTAC light mount, VTAC LPSM low profile sling mount, and one 30 round PMAG magazine are included."

Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

I bought this pistol in mid-2013, and it only has about 350 rounds through it. 

It has the Hogue, OD-green finger-groove grips, which are uber-comfortable. Sorry, the original, plastic factory grips are gone. Those are only about $25 straight from Sig if you want to go back to factory grips. The barrel is a brushed stainless. The finish wears off the barrels on Sigs pretty quick, so I took it down to a brushed stainless finish. It looks great. 

Included are the 2 original 8-round factory mags. In addition, there are two, factory, flush-fit 7-round mags, an extra factory 8-round mag and a factory 10-round mag. This is about an extra $150 worth of mags. 

Also comes with original Sig hard-case and manual. 

This thing is accurate and shoots like a dream. Zero malfunctions. It's a good one. I am only selling to fund some other gun projects. I will be sad to see it go. 

I also have about 350 rounds of quality, factory ammo in 230gr FMJ (Fiocchi, American Eagle, Remington UMC) if you are interested.

I have a Smith and Wesson M&P .40 Compact handgun that I am looking to sell and/or trade for a 9 millimeter handgun. I have had the firearm for almost a year and love the look, feel, and everything about the gun. I have never had any misfires with it, nor has it ever jammed on me, and it has served as my carry weapon. The reason for selling is simply that I want a 9 mm, as I already own a separate .40 and having the two does not make a whole lot of sense for me. I am willing to sell the firearm for $425 USD (sellers pay the transfer fee) or trade for a 9mm of the following variety: S&W MP 9c, Glock 26 (Baby Glock), Glock 19, or other any other reasonable offer. For instance, I am not convinced I will absolutely trade for a Beretta Nano, but I have given it thought and would not be completely opposed. 

My requirements are fairly simple, the buyer/trader must possess and present a CWP in the state of South Carolina to insure he/she has passed a complete background check with SLED. If no CWP, then buyer/trader will have to work with me and the local FFL of our choosing to ensure the sale/trade is legitimate and in compliance with all SLED laws. 

Please contact me via e-mail if interest. If you have not seen a S&W 40c before, I highly encourage you to check one out before reaching out to me either in store and/or online, as they are a beauty of a machine."
