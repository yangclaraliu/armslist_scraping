Open to trades, mainly looking for a VP9, Glock 43, M&P Sheild with cash to make equal. I can even add ammunition. Thanks!
The XD® Mod.2™ is now available in a 4” Service Model. The 4” Service Model is a slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Service Model is ready for duty, a day at the range and even concealed carry.
With high visibility low-profile sights and a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ Service Model is a feature packed full sized double-stack pistol. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ offers 16+1 rounds of 9mm. The noticeably slim profile and other features combine to make the Mod.2™ Service Model a pistol that offers excellent ergonomics and serious firepower in a surprisingly concealable full sized handgun. Plus, you can choose between two attractive finishes – all black, or bi-tone.
Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Service Model is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod. 2™ Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol.
And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Service Model on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ 4” Service Model, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite pistol.

This is a custom safari rifle built on a Pre-64 Winchester Model 70 action that was manufactured in 1952. It chambers the .416 Taylor cartridge which uses the .458 Win Mag case necked to .416"". This cartridge is capable of launching a 400gr bullet in excess of 2350 fps with 4900+ ft/lbs of energy,more than adequate for any large/dangerous game on the planet.Overall condition is excellent. While this rifle has been used (it has been to Africa), it has been lovingly cared for. The metal finish rates 98% overall with some thinning to the finish on the bolt handle and some soft edge wear at the front of the magazine floor plate. There is absolutely no rust or pitting. The oil finished stock is also in excellent condition without any cracks or chips and only a couple of very small handling marks.I'd grade the wood 98% as well. Mechanically, this rifle is in top shape and everything works just like you would want it to.Must be FFL shipping,cost due to location."

I never use it and I'm about to start hunting, so i would really like to get an AR15 in a .308 caliber NOT .223 if you have a .223 I am not interested, I already have plenty of them. The only thing I'm willing to trade for is a nice .308 AR like a DPMS Oracle, or a large caliber hunting rifle that's nice. Nothing else.Or I'll take cash, but don't low ball me, I'm not desperate. This is a nice rifle, it was custom made for the guy I got it from at a gun maker somewhere in Indiana. He did tell me where it was from but i forget. It cost him just under $3000 back then. This is probably the smoothest and most solid feeling AR I've ever fired. It literally has no recoil. It must have some kind of suspension system inside it, because it just eats up that recoil and feels like you're shooting a pellet rifle. Nothing wrong with it and it will come with 1 mag.Thanks"
