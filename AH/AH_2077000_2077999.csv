I have a discontinued, ec, 7 1/2 in. barrel Stainless Steel Single action pistol to offer in trade. The bore is spotless and the value on these are only going to increase. The Old Model has a heavier barrel, frame and cylinder to withstand the high pressure hand loads that hunters favor. These discontinued models are already as scarce as hens teeth and if you can find one they are going for 640 to near 800 dollars.
Mine is not an 800$ piece. No box or papers and it's been shot some, but value is what it's worth to YOU. I value it between 500-600 dollars.
It's not exactly a concealed carry gun but then again neither is a full size 1911 a PT92-101 or big boy Glock. Plus if you want a gun to put up as an inexpensive investment piece, well you could do a lot worse. Interested?

It was in the news last week that Obama was going to sign an executive order outlawing the importation of surplus military rifles.  These old Steyrs are already getting harder to find.  

Here's a nice example of a 1919 gun made in the original Austrian Steyr plant.  (Many of these were made in Hungary.)

These have an interesting straight-pull, dual bolt design.  It basically has a bolt within a bolt.  The inner bolt was there so that the gun could be more quietly cocked during tactical situations.

Also included are four each, very hard to find NAZI, Hitler-era clips with the German eagle and swastikas stamped on them.

The sling is a very nice, vintage Bianchi Cobra #62.  If you don't want the sling, you can knock $25 off the price of the gun.  These slings alone, when you can find them, sell for $50-$75 online."

Manufacturer description:

Designed in partnership with Tango Down, the Vltor Bipod is a sturdy and lightweight unit that mounts to the left and right side rails of the weapon.  It locks at every 90-degree angle to fold out of the way when not in use and is adjustable for height.

The Vltor Modpod utilizes the rail mounting components of the Scout Mount series and the Tangodown bipod. At first, Vltor was originally going to develop their own bipod legs, but instead chose the robust TD legs. Unlike the TD bipod, Vltor bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the user multiple mounting options."

I have a discontinued, ec, 7 1/2 in. barrel Stainless Steel Single action pistol to offer in trade. The bore is spotless and the value on these are only going to increase. The Old Model has a heavier barrel, frame and cylinder to withstand the high pressure hand loads that hunters favor. These discontinued models are already as scarce as hens teeth and if you can find one they are going for 640 to near 800 dollars.
Mine is not an 800$ piece. No box or papers and it's been shot some, but value is what it's worth to YOU. I value it at 600 dollars.
It's not exactly a concealed carry gun but then again neither is a full size 1911 a PT92-101 or big boy Glock. Plus if you want a gun to put up as an inexpensive investment piece, well you could do a lot worse. Interested?

The selector switch turns to Lock-Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6X LED is activated by using the rocker arm toggling down for Momentary On or locking up for Constant On. The rocker backplate on the M6X LED is interchangeable with the long-gun backplate designed for M6X models, to utilize a remote switch to turn the unit off/on.

From Wiki:  The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver)."

This butt stock allows your AK-47 to fire full auto There is a switch on it that goes from Semi, to full auto. It's made in America and its absolutely Legal, because technically, the trigger is being pulled a thousand times a minute even though it doesn't feel like it. It's ATF approved and is very accurate. And no, it doesn't cause wear and tire on your fire pin. I paid $375 dollars for it, 45 dollars was shipping and handling and 30 dollars was sales tax. It's yours for $300 dollars or best offer, and I even bought extra screws for it incase you lose one. It's only been used once, and is still in the box it came in. Why am I selling it? Because of all AK-47's in the world, I happen to buy the one with an underfold stock that is welded on my AK, so it doesnt work for mine. If your AK-47 has a detachable butt stock, like 99 percent of them do, then it's going to work for it just fine. I used it on my newphews AK-47 with a 75 round drum and a couple 40 round mags, and it fired beautifully without a single jam. You can use your AK-47 as a machine gun or Squad Automatic Weapon if shit hits the fan with that butt stock and lay down some good suppresive fire. Get it while it's still legal. Because the government is trying to ban them. Call or text (253)-254-8228."

I actually suspect these are being made in the same factory and with the same components as the ones being made for Crimson Trace... They're that good.

Comes with the laser grip, batteries, grip shim for the G20SF and G21SF, replacement grip pin, and hex key for elevation and windage adjustment.

$55 + $5 for shipping. I only have two and I do not expect them to last long..."

674,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2077674,For Sale:  Huntertown Kestrel 5.56 Suppressor,"Ellisville, MS, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 13, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up until now, user serviceable centerfire rifle suppressors have been longer and heavier than their sealed counterparts. That's changed with the introduction of the Kestrel 5.56. Engineered from the ground up to maximize serviceability while not compromising on weight, length, or strength, the Kestrel 556 provides the most user friendly centerfire rifle suppressor in existence. Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, ease of maintenance, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Kestrel 5.56 has the features you are looking for.

Suppression

The Kestrel 5.56 had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.

Maintenance

Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors. With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality. The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core. Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity

There are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part. We are huge proponents of stacked baffle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair. Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.

Safety

The Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.

Here's the description shamelessly copied from the beretta website. :)


The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a
Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment
of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has
an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the
sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.
The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing
the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions."
