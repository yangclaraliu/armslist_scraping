The Pinnacle gun safe is a Pro Series safe from Browning ProSteel. The Pinnacle offers reliable security with a heavy-duty 3/16"" steel body.  Browning ProSteels' patented innovation of MAX Locking Bolts provides 12-times more surface area than traditional bolts, and when combined with Pry-Stop Corner Bolts, creates a gun safe that is twice as pry-resistant as a safe with regular round bolts.  The Gear Drive Locking System is three times easier to operate. The versatile storage inside the Pinnacle includes the AXIS Adjustable Shelving, DPX Storage System with Scope Saver and cedar panels on the ceiling and walls for a luxurious gun safe that protects your guns and other valuables.  The Pinnacle Series offers unequalled security and fire protection features, the most versatile interior in the industry and refinement not found anywhere else, the Pinnacle is the finest gun safe available. These uncompromising safes are formed from a single sheet of thick 3/16"" steel for exceptional strength and rigidity. Axis Adjustable Shelving maximizes storage potential and the fragrant cedar and simulated leather interior provides a luxurious appearance. You can spend hours researching websites and catalogs, but you won't find another gun safe that compares to a Pinnacle. The Pinnacle is a symbol of strength offering unmatched security, fire protection, interior versatility and pure elegance. The safe body is formed from a sheet of thick 3/16"" steel for exceptional strength and rigidity. Inside, you will appreciate the elegance of fragrant cedar and simulated leather. The Pinnacle is also available in seven colors to perfectly complement your home. For the ultimate in security and beauty, look no further than the Pinnacle. THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTION New ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame.  Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.  MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTS MAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.  MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTS Innovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.  UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEM Robust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.  OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTION A carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.  DPX SCOPE SAVERS Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.  AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING Multiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.  DUO-FORMED DOOR The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 (5/16)"" thick.  ELECTRICAL OUTLET A 110V outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.  GRADE VI INTERIOR/LED LIGHTING A fragrant cedar interior adds a rich quality to the safe. Interior LED lighting along the door frame makes locating items inside a safe much easier.  AXIS DRAWER AND MULTIPURPOSE INSERT The Axis Drawer mounts beneath an Axis Steel Shelf and includes a Multipurpose Insert that keeps small items organized, easy to locate, and protected.  AXIS FILE BOX Important documents may be irreplaceable and need to be easy to find. Keep track of them in the convenient File Box.

The steel body is formed and continously welded - not spot welded - for outstanding strength and flawless appearance. Wide MAX Locking Bolts offer additional security and the smooth rolling Gear Drive Locking System provides bank vault-like feel. The versatile Axis Adjustable Interior with DPX Storage System and Scope Saver makes it faster and more convenient to access your most prized possessions. Honor your firearms and valuables with a Prestige safe.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTSInnovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEMRobust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTIONA carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.DPX SCOPE SAVERSFound exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection.

The steel body is formed and continously welded - not spot welded - for outstanding strength and flawless appearance. Wide MAX Locking Bolts offer additional security and the smooth rolling Gear Drive Locking System provides bank vault-like feel. The versatile Axis Adjustable Interior with DPX Storage System and Scope Saver makes it faster and more convenient to access your most prized possessions. Honor your firearms and valuables with a Prestige safe.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTSInnovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEMRobust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTIONA carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.DPX SCOPE SAVERSFound exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection.

I took purchase of this pistol a few years back off of a retired police officer. This past year I added the deltapoint optic, which was purchased new for over $450.00. The optic is still under warranty and has a lot of great features.  It turns on when it detects movement, and turns off when it has sat idle long enough.  The lens is also the clearest out there, so the sight picture is phenomenal. 

 I also have six magazines for this pistol which I will include for the right deal, they were purchased new and are genuine H&K branded mags.  They sell for $50 a piece so you can definitely appreciate having five of them from the get go! As pictured I also have the very comfortable paddle double magazine pouch to be included. Plus original USP box as well as the deltapoints box and manual, along with spare parts. 

YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER USP WITH A REFLEX OPTIC, MUCH LESS ONE OF THIS QUALITY. Reason being is the lack of mounts being made for use with the USP.  This firearm has a natural bluing and it is absolutely gorgeous, accurate, and unfathomably reliable. 

My cash price is $1300, and that is firm.  Trade value would be about $1600.

Smith & Wesson produced approximately 163,600 U.S. Army Model 1917 Revolvers between 1917 and 1919. All revolvers were polish blue with 5.5 inch barrels and chambered to shoot the .45 ACP round. This early production revolvers had the ordnance acceptance mark of GHS (Gilbert H. Stewart) which was replaced with the ordnance bomb around April of 1918. The Early Original finish on the S&W M1917 was bright polish blue with case hardened hammer and trigger, they were configured to use the .45 ACP ammo with a moon clip (holds 3 bullets, also allows for extraction). The inspectors mark of Col. Gilbert H. Stewart (GHS) can be found on the left side of the receiver until April, 1918 and then a Ordnance insignia (bomb) until end of production. The serial number can be found on the butt, back of cylinder, underside of barrel, inside right grip, underside of extractor, inside of crane. ""United States Property"" mark is located on the bottom of the barrel. This is an early issue revolver in a serial range of 1 - c. 12000 seen with “GHS” marking indicating Col. Gilbert H. Stewart as inspector The ordnance acceptance mark of GHS (Col. Gilbert H. Stewart) is only seen on approximately the first 40,000 revolvers. Butt is marked “US Army Model 1917- No 116xx” All matching serial number can be found on the butt, back of cylinder, underside of barrel, underside of extractor, inside of crane and Col. Gilbert H. Stewart S inspector marks on the bottom of the barrel and rear of the cylinder and above the frame assembly number. This early production has the better commercial style bright polish blue with case hardened hammer and trigger finish. Inspector mark of Col. Gilbert H. Stewart (GHS) on the left side of the receiver. This 1917 Military is a rarer Pre flaming bomb marks, pre dull field grade finish, pre June 1918 revolver when Smith & Wesson was nationalized by president Wilson, during WW 1 The government had NATIONALIZED the factory- SEIZED control of it, and declared it a branch of Springfield Armory from that point on the S&W factory was run by division of Springfield Armory and these were United Stated Government manufactured. Less then 25% of the S&W M1917 revolvers are known to have the GHS inspector markings. Has non original serial numbered 1917 Commercial Model style checkered raised diamond walnut grips with the S&W monogram and a notch has been filed in front sight. Approximately 163,600 were made for the U.S. Army between Sept. 17, 1917 to Jan. 1919. The frame is stamped “U.S. ARMY MODEL 1917” in four lines on the butt. “UNITED STATES PROPERTY” is stamped on the bottom of the barrel on the flat. “S&W D.A. 45” is stamped on the barrel’s right side. The top of the barrel is marked “Smith & Wesson Springfield Mass U.S.A. Patented Dec. 17, 1901. Feb. 6, 1906. Sep. 14, 1909.” Lock up is very tight, excellent bore and timing is true and correct.

The steel body is formed and continously welded - not spot welded - for outstanding strength and flawless appearance. Wide MAX Locking Bolts offer additional security and the smooth rolling Gear Drive Locking System provides bank vault-like feel. The versatile Axis Adjustable Interior with DPX Storage System and Scope Saver makes it faster and more convenient to access your most prized possessions. Honor your firearms and valuables with a Prestige safe.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTSInnovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEMRobust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTIONA carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.DPX SCOPE SAVERSFound exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment.

The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

MANY people have never seen or heard of these, and here is why.  BATF has banned their imports BECAUSE, the rifle can be ""taken down"" by easily removing the stock by means of a take down screw on the side of the receiver.  Since the rifle can still be fired while taken down - BATF does NOT like this since WITHOUT the stock it is SIMILAR to a short barrel rifle.  It has a 17 1/2"" barrel so it does NOT need the standard SBR paperwork.  It is a VERY neat rifle that shoots .357 and .38 pistol ammo, stored in a tube (under the barrel) magazine.  It is a pump action with very high quality bluing and walnut stock.   Look around on other gun web sites and if you can find one, they range from $650 to over $1000.

Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova’s innovative engineering. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3½"" magnums. To help dampen the recoil of today’s super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer. Black Synthetic stock, the Benelli Nova is the most versatile pump-action shotgun ever made — and just when everyone thought the pump gun couldn’t be improved.

Standard chokes included: IC, M, F.
Push-Button Shell Stop
The button on the underside of the forend activates a shell stop, allowing a chambered shell to be removed without releasing rounds from the magazine.
Grooved Grip Surface
Checkering is for wood stocks, but the Benelli Nova Pump use distinctive grooves that give both an unmatched gripping surface and an unforgettably distinctive look.

To the best of my knowledge the information below is accurate, but I am not an expert, so it might all be entirely incorrect.

UK VZ.59 Sight
Factory: “yal” Meopta Prerau - Prerov factory
Manufactured: 1960's
Tube: 35mm
Magnification: 4x8, non adjustable focus and magnification.
Reticle: Cross with single chevron in center – reticle moves off center with windage and elevation adjustment similar to a Mosin PU sight
Adjustments: Windage and Elevation knobs (black with white numbers) – moves reticle off center in sight tube. Rare sight versions may have silver knobs.
Accessories: Shock absorbing screw-on rubber eye-protection piece; Screw-on yellow Lens Filter (male threads on one side, female threads on other); Screw-on Lens Flash Hider (screws directly on to lens tube, or on to lens filter).
Case: Canvas carry case with belt loop, straps and leather trims; may include a Lens Cleaning Kit (horse hair brush and piece of linen)
Variations of sight: Tube (Day/Night sight) with side port and connection for reticle illumination device; Daytime only optic (rare) without side port connection for reticle illumination.
Illumination/Flashlight device (NOT INCLUDED with sight unless noted - I believe these are pretty rare these days): Flashlight has RGB plastic color filters manually slid into place over the bulb. Sight reticle illumination requires this battery operated illuminator with cable attachment (pretty rare these days) – see the connector on the mount side of the sight tube for bulb port. You can shine a small flashlight or bore light into the port on the side of the sight tube to see how the reticle lights up white in dark environments.
Mount: Clamp mount – securely pinned to sight tube, fits all UK VZ.59 milspec receivers 




THESE OPTICS WERE DESIGNED TO TAKE THE VIBRATION AND SHOCK OF A FULLY AUTOMATIC VZ 59 LIGHT MACHINE GUN OPERATING IN COMBAT ENVIRONMENTS, SO WHILE THEY ARE SIMPLE IN DESIGN AND FUNCTION, THEY ARE VERY ROBUST FOR A CIRCA 1960's SIGHT.


UK59 w/ mount and sight. Copyright 2014


This private collection of optics have been individually inspected and it is believed that each sight functions properly as designed, however I am not an expert. The single cross/chevron reticle correctly moves off center (similar to a Mosin PU scope) in both windage and elevation using the two adjustment knobs on the tube as designed – there is no binding. The glass lenses are clear and not cracked or damaged, but may include tiny cleaning scratches, or inclusions/flaws in the glass as originally issued from the factory. If there are any marks found on the glass it should be noted in the specific description or shown in the pictures. The included sight mount that is securely attached (pinned) to the optic tube is complete and functional and will attach the optic to the UK VZ59 receiver securely as designed. The optional rubber eye piece extension, the yellow daytime lens filter, and the lens flash hider are all intact and included with the optic. There may also be a lens cloth and small brush (“cleaning kit”) and canvas bag (carry case) included so check pictures and the specific description. 

If you find that the optic does not mount securely to a milspec UK59 receiver, or function properly as originally designed and intended, you can return it to me WITHIN 15 DAYS of receipt in the same condition you received it in, for a full refund of your purchase price (not including shipping costs). This does NOT cover any cosmetic issues so review the description and photos carefully.

These optics are acceptable used Czech Military surplus equipment and they will show varying signs of field use potentially including: scratches, missing paint - usually on mounts, field paint touch ups, slight surface rust and/or slight pitting on bare metal surfaces, small dents, and other cosmetic blemishes. I believe these optics are in very acceptable military surplus condition and would rate them as very good to excellent used surplus condition. None of these cosmetic issues will effect the proper mounting and/or operation of the optic. I have tried my best to note any cosmetic issues in the specific description and show them in the pictures. Please contact me with any questions or for more pictures before purchase as I will not entertain any returns for cosmetic issues.

I'm selling my .22 caliber upper, model M4-22 manufactured by Chiappa Firearms.  This is a complete upper that allows you to shoot .22LR ammunition from any mil-spec AR style lower.  This upper has been well cared for and has been cleaned after each time it was used.  The flat-top upper comes with two 28 round magazines and a removable carry handle with an integrated rear sight that is both windage and elevation adjustable.  This upper has been a lot of fun and has helped me practice shooting form this platform without spending a great deal of money on ammo.  It's more picky about ammo than my 10/22 but it's also more fun to shoot.

In the 1910s, Remington Arms produced a 1911 style pistol modeled after the Colt 1911 after receiving a contract from the US government to produce the pistols. The war came to an end only years later and Remington shut down their production of the 1911 in 1919 until April of 2010 when they announced that they would start producing the 1911 again.[3] This time the pistol would be marketed as the Remington 1911 R1."

Rifle is in excellent condition and functions without problem. Accuracy is good with any mil surp but really shines with match grade ammunition in 168.

This loaded model has a great 2 stage trigger for precision with a national match barrel. Bolt is the desirable USGI TRW. Also added to the weapon is the difficult to acquire Advanced Armament Blackout suppressor mount. I believe I have 6 or 7 usgi m14 magazines and a five and ten rounder should you wish to hunt in places that have capacity restrictions.

The Troy chassis is a great addition to the m14 platform. It provides an excellent solution to mounting optics and other accessories, as well as giving the shooter an adjustable stock for length of pull and cheek rest height. 
I took this rifle to a private range and was nailing a steel 10"" gong at a laser rangefinded distance of 510 yards with boring regularity.

Leupold MK4 scope and rings and GGG bipods not included in this price.

This is the 1st civilian version of the military M16 to be issued to the public. It is in really good condition and will make someone a great trophy gun. It is in great firing condition and has not been fired since 1995. It has spent it's life in a gun safe ever since. Everyone that see's it in our store thinks that it is a fully automatic M16 and no one wants the newer AR15 after seeing it's past in this one. It is known for it's triangular hand guard and bayonet lug and some other features listed below. The features below were shared with the M16. 

Slickside The earliest version of the AR-15 upper receiver which can easily be identified by its lack of forward assist and brass deflector. This type of receiver was used on the original M16, USAF weapons, and the SP1 civilian rifle. 

The bayonet lug on AR-15 rifles is a small protrusion on the front underside of the gas block. This is present on the majority of Colt AR-15 military rifles, but is omitted in the case of some carbines as it is redundant due to the bayonet requiring a longer barrel to be mounted onto. It is also absent from a number of civilian rifles, most notably the Match Target rifles, in order to comply with various laws and regulations. 

The iconic M16 flash hider often referred to as the “Birdcage”, and was on a closed design to address problems encountered with the duckbill type flash hiders snagging on vegetation. Introduced on the M16A1, it has 6 ports equally distributed around the flash hider.

The barrel and bands are a mix of plum brown and pewter patina with a few minor dings and handling marks. The frame is a mottled case-hardened pewter and brown patina. The butt stock and forearm rate about very good as slightly refinished, retaining the minor dings and handling marks from the years. There is a legible left-side cartouche and the butt is rack numbered ""14"" while the right side of the butt is also numbered ""Gn 95"". This example correctly lacks the locking action hammer of the Model 1871 and is marked only on its right side of frame ""U.S./Springfield/1870"", this beneath a federal eagle, there is no left-side frame marking as found on the 1871 models. Remington patent information is on top tang. The correct ""single stop"" cleaning/ram rod is present. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: The United States Army contracted for 1,008 Model 1870 rolling block rifles, and 313 saddle-ring carbines, to be used for field trials (these guns are quite scarce). The results were favorable enough that in 1872, The U.S. Army ordered a full contract of 10,001 Model 1871 rifles."

     Up for sale I have two different firearms. Both are new and very good quality. They both come with ammo as well. The first is my HK 9mm compact. Gorgeous weapon and it comes with everything the factory sent to me plus all the ammo I have. Including some self defense rounds. I also have a IWB holster that I purchased because this was supposed to be my carry weapon. If you know pistols you know this is a great gun that will run great for years to come. Roughly a $1000 invested- no reasonable offer refused

Next I have my AR15 that was custom built for me. Built like a tank and is ready for anything. All parts used are quality parts and all parts are new. Couple rounds down the pipe for function testing only. I have ammo for this as well. must be about 200 rounds of 223/556. It is a mix of both loads. Sitting on the rifle is a vortex 1-4 and that is in a vortex one piece cantilever mount. Everything is very solid. The scope and mount have never felt recoil. Mounted and put in a temp/hum controlled room. This is a great rifle and a good addition to a collection. Roughly 2000$ invested-No reasonable offer refused.

I can text or email pictures. If you don't have the money to make a reasonable offer please don't ask for pictures. Google images has plenty of pictures for you to look at. I don't have time for picture collectors. PLEASE BE SERIOUS!
