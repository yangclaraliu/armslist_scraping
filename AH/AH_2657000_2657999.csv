Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a light paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 Would meet face to face anywhere between Lynnwood and Arlington Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

Where:   Frontline Arms

  Gun Show & Tell is this week Thursday the 6th. Come and help us put a new twist on an old tradition… SHOW AND TELL. Remember showing of your cool stuff to classmates? Same idea except now you'll be presenting your favorite guns to other firearms enthusiasts. Beside seeing all the cool guns and meeting new friends, enjoy some free food and a soft drink on us.  

SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE GOT!

  Of course we can't do it without your help. So I'm writing to those of you who have unique guns or stories you'd like to share with your fellow firearms fans. When it's your turn, bring your firearm to the table at the front of the room and tell it's special story. We are asking that you only bring one or two guns so that everyone will have time to present their pieces to the group. Of course you don't have to bring a gun to join in. Just bring your interest in firearms and your desire to meet other firearms enthusiasts.

  EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS…SAFELY  

We encourage and welcome anyone concealed or open carrying as long as you have a current CHL recognized by Oregon. However for everyones safety we REQUIRE your co-operation by NOT having any of your show and tell weapons loaded. Also before you hand any firearm to someone (even your concealed or open carry gun) unload it in a safe direction, no loaded magazines, no round in the chamber.

  TAKE A LOAD OFF, RELAX  

For your convenience you are welcome to have your firearms placed on the gun wall behind the counter, in your view, until it is your turn to present them or you would like to show them to someone. Just ask and we will be glad to ta! ke them off the wall for you. This way you can have your hands free to eat or just relax knowing your firearms are always safe behind the counter and always in your sight.  

SMILE FOR THE CAMERA

  In order to promote Frontline Arms and the Gun Show and Tell we will be taking photos and video at the event. By attending the event you are giving your consent for your likeness as well as the likeness of any of your firearms or show and tell items to be used by Frontline Arms for promotional purposes. If you do not want your likeness used please let John or Casey know and we will not include you or your firearms in our promotions.  

HELP US MAKE FRONTLINE ARMS GUN SHOW AND TELL THE EVENT FOR EVERY FIRST THURSDAY  

Obviously we need to make a profit to stay in business and provide these events for the community. Also by ATF's definition this event IS a GUN SHOW. As a gun show the law requires that the proper forms be filled out and that the buyer pass a background check before the firearm may be transferred. In exchange for creating a marketplace and assisting in the sale Frontline Arms will charge the seller $25 per firearm sold and the buyer $10 to perform a background check ( the $10 goes to OSP). Just to be clear, we don't expect you to sale your gun if you show it, just letting you know the option is there if you want to.

 We look forward to seeing you Thursday February 6th, at 6:30PM  

Thank You, 
John Laird, Owner --&-- Casey Dean  CEO/MANAGER"

Barnes 21548 VOR-TX 300 AAC Blackout 110GR TTSX FB 20Box/10Case

Barnes VOR-TX is precision ammunition loaded with TSX, Tipped TSX or TSX FN
bullets to offer double-diameter expansion, maximum weight retention and
excellent accuracy. The TSX bullets provide maximum tissue and bone
destruction, pass-through penetration and devastating energy transfer.
Multiple grooves in the bullet's shank reduce pressure and improve
accuracy. Bullets open instantly on contact - no other bullet expands as
quickly. Nose peels back into four sharp-edged copper petals destroying
tissue, bone and vital organs for a quick, humane kill. Whether you're
after whitetail deer, elk, antelope or boar, put 'em in the VOR-TX and
they're going down.

The classic Weaver k-6 (6 power) scope provides fine crosshairs for sniper
class accuracy to the extremes of range of this ""strictly business"" type of rifle.

The muzzle flashhider serves to diffuse the rifle's report, making it more
difficult to determine exactly the source of the shot.

Its a very fun and accurate 9mm AR pistol. The sights/buffer/compensator combo make it easy to do fast followup shots. The buffer tube is long enough to shoulder, but I usually put my check on it and pushed out on the sling. Putting a Sig armbrace thing would make it sweet. The magazine block can be removed from the lower if you ever wanted a different caliber in the future. I enjoy being able to shoot an AR cheaper and in the pistol bay or ranges that won't allow rifles. The 7 inch barrel really gets the most out of the 9mm cartridge.

I've never had any jamming issues out of this gun with any of the magazines. Even the cheap stuff runs great!

Mostly looking for trades but cash always speaks. Partial trades, multi-gun trades considered. I can add cash for the right offer.

This is a pistol so pistol permit or concealed carry permit and bill of sale will be required."

This 9mm is in excellent condition. I bought it new in January 2013; I am the original and only owner. Also, I got an excellent firearm. This particular pistol has none of the FTE/FTF issues you may have heard about. I've put 500 rounds through the pipe with only one FTF, and that's because I was using cheap, cheap Sellier & Belliot ammo. I used that box up and have avoided it like the plague. This Nano eats up all ammo from Walmart: Federal, WWB, and the like. 

I have the box and all papers, even the original lock. It has 2 6-round magazines (it came with 1 6-round and 1 8-round mag, but I didn't like the eight round mag, sold it, and bought the 6-round mag). I'm also included the two PJ Holster kydex holsters, one IWB with J-hook and Velcro and one OWB with belt loop, which I used at the range. Finally, I have two PJ Holster kydex magazine pouches/holders that I will include. The holsters and magazine pouches are valued at ~$140 alone, AND each one takes 10-12 weeks to receive. You can have these immediately, without the wait. Visit PJ Holstersdotcom to see the quality of these things: I love 'em.

This also has tritium night sights, which I bought directly from Beretta, and I'll include the original factory sights and the allen wrench/key to change/drift the sights. Again, the sights cost nearly $100. This Nano has Talon grips on it, the rubberized ones, not the sandpaper ones. 

The pictures aren't really current: Since I took the pics, I sold the eight round mag, I added the tritium night sights (which are less than a year old, btw, so they have many years of service left), and the talon grips. I can send more pics and current pics if you're interested. 

Shipping to your FFL via UPS Next day is ~$100 (unless you have a cheaper solution, I'm not an authorized dealer, just a private citizen). I'm willing to split shipping but need to clear $300 on this handgun, hence the price of $360, which should also cover paypal and armslist."

Easy to purchase!!!","ALL, Lawton, Oklahoma",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, April 23, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"If you can legally buy a Handgun in Oklahoma then you can Buy a silencer. No license is required to purchase one!!! We have silencers for .22LR that start at $199.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00. We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I offer all major brands of silencers, so if you have a special request just ask. It is now LEGAL to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $5000.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am a experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED. Leave a message in reference to what you are calling about if I don't answer and I will call you back ASAP. Thanks.

It has a very nice action and a crisp trigger. I have converted the sights to three-dot type, using orange fluorescent paint in dimples on the rear. This can be taken off with a little nail polish remover if you don't like them, or changed to a different color. Front sight is not dimpled since I didn't want to do anything to it to permanently modify it. You may notice an unusual set of grips on it. The originals will come with it, but what is on it now is a modified set of Colt Commander aftermarket grips. These are EXTREMELY comfortable and thinner and more sticky than the factory grips. They are secured with Allen screws and are attractive. I would recommend shooting it with these grips on it before you swap back to the Chinese Tok grips. If you do, I doubt you will want to swap them back. It is a shooter, and not really a collectible pistol anyway. But you'll get the original grips just in case. It also has heat-fitted grip tape on the grip frame front and rear. This again makes the grip sticky. Done like this, I prefer shooting my Toks over almost any other of my 9mms. Just pull it off if you don't like it.

 This pistol has been used as a range gun by me, as just a plinker. I also kept it by my bed for a couple of years. That is how reliable I believe it to be. 

 The days of cheap 7.62x25 ammo are apparently long gone, so it is cool to have one of these 9mms around so you can afford to actually shoot it. They are great guns in 9mm, and this one has NEVER had a FTF or FTE or any other kind of malfunction. Unfortunately, I only have one magazine for it. I bought it without a box, so that is long gone as well.

I am firm on my price on this. They go for more online and you would have to pay shipping, sales tax, and a dealer fee to get one. And even then you would not have the grip mod or the sights. Plus I KNOW this one is reliable!

Thanks for reading my very long ad as usual.
