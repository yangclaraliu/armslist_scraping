IWI Tavor SAR-B16 bullpup battle rifle of the IDF

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing. 

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:

• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

71,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2210071,"For Sale:  Anti-Personnel 44 Mag. Ammo - 200 gr. Hard Cast Wadcutter (1,300 fps) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Friday, October 11, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms. We prefer to establish advertised velocities from real-world firearms and not from extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities. You know what you are getting in the real world, where it matters, with Buffalo Bore ammunition.

BEST ON ARMSLIST,"Manchester, Tennessee, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, August 8, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new dueling tree for pistols and rifles. YES!!!, you can shoot these paddles with your AR's and AK's. Targets are 6 inches round and are made with 3/8 inch thick AR500. Will handle thousands of shots from any pistol or rifle of .308 or smaller ( rated for rifle ammo @ 3000 fps or slower). Stands roughly 5 ft tall. Comes with stakes to secure target to the ground. I designed these trees to be very simple to use and assemble. They do not require any tools to assemble. Target plates and legs are easily removable for easy transport. If you've never shot one of these or have never seen one in action, I can send a video of one in action. They are a self re-setting reactive target. When your bullet strikes the target, it swings around to the other side, ready to be shot again! All you have to do is reload your mag and shoot!

Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform
possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with
effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and
ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet
of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull
action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking
groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight
pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum
movement. Interchange calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to
provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is
fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting
systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is
machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt
assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated
into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced
distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection
molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme
temperatures.

Please note: Scope, night vision rail, bi-pod and muzzle break shown, not included."

Brand new dueling tree for pistols and rifles. YES!!!, you can shoot these paddles with your AR's and AK's. Targets are 6 inches round and are made with 3/8 inch thick AR500. Will handle thousands of shots from any pistol or rifle of .308 or smaller ( rated for rifle ammo @ 3000 fps or slower). The last picture is a paddle that I shot with a .40 pistol and a 5.56 FMJ. You can see that the bullets simply splatter on impact.  If you wish to plink this target with .22's, I can swap the heavier targets for lighter targets or I can include 12 targets (6 heavy and 6 lighter) for an additional $25. Stands roughly 5 ft tall. Comes with stakes to secure target to the ground. I designed these trees to be very simple to use and assemble. They do not require any tools to assemble. Target plates and legs are easily removable for easy transport. If you've never shot one of these or have never seen one in action, check them out on youtube. They are a self re-setting reactive target. When your bullet strikes the target, it swings around to the other side, ready to be shot again! All you have to do is reload your mag and shoot! This target is perfect for two people shooting at once. I have one that me and my buddies shoot and it is addictive! I have sold 2 of these to date and the buyers are sending me some great feedback. One said, "" it's been the best addition we've made to our range."" Targets like this one sell for as much as $600 online! I can offer these for a lot less than that because I don't have any overhead, employees or fancy web site to pay for. Asking $325 or best offer. Money is tight and I need to sell a few of these so make me a reasonable offer! I guarantee you will not find a tree of this quality cheaper anywhere! They are built very similar to the ones from Action Target. You can text message (preferred), email or call me as well. 931 3I2 9I22. I am willing to meet you half way, or up to 50 miles, to ease travel time. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away! Shipping to the lower 48 is $50.00

What a name! It's based on the fact that many judges are now carrying it into the courtroom with them-and for good reason. We know of no better self-defense firearm. Whether loading all 45s-all .410s or alternating them in the cylinder, the Judge is the ultimate shotgun/revolver duo. New for 2008, we're giving you the Judge in Ultra-Lite forged alloy. You'll be amazed how light this gun is and how easy it is to tote around. Also new is the Judge 3"" Magnum.

1st:
  Mosin Nagant 91-30 bolt action Russian rifle, 1933, has the rare octagon receiver, re-varnished stock. (going for $170.00 right now at Cabela's without the rifle case and ammo). Has all the original gear (ammo pouch, oil can, sling, bayonet) comes with a soft rifle case and 80 rounds of 7.62x54r for it (60 Black Bear SP and 20 additional that were bought at a gun show). This is in good condition and has been used the last 2 years for deer hunting (I have picked up a Sporter style Mosin which I am now using so no need for this one).

Second is a Marlin .22 Long Rifle, semi auto, comes with 3, 7 round mags, soft rifle case and 100 rounds of Remington ammo. This is in very good condition and works great, fun plinker, but have picked up a different .22 so this one needs to go. 

Third is a near new (owned less than 3 months) SA Sports 175lb crossbow, wood camo rifle stock, has a 4x32 scope and open sites, sling, loading and stringing support cables and 10 arrows in a quiver (small golf club bag that works perfect). Also included is a near new target bag one side has targets and one side has the main body of a deer. I bought the crossbow and shot it literally 12 times and realize I like my regular bow more. This goes for $150.00 online without the additional arrows and $40 target bag."

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."

feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the
NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913
accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion
resistant black polycoat finish.  The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail
to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and
more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front
and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail
noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows
for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional
accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also
found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

Rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. Friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a 16.625 inch threaded barrel with flash suppressor. Adjustable sights. Ten round rotary magazine. Stock is dipped in Mossy Oak Break-Up camouflage.

1916 Spanish Mauser re-chambered for 308/7.62x51. It is number's matching and all original aside from the re cambering which was done for the Spanish police in a arsenal. IT IS NOT SPORTERIZED. Bore is very nice(no pitting and is clean) along with the wood, bluing is worn on receiver though! Shoots  great but I don't have anymore ammo for it so my need for this gun has ended as I just bought a 8mm Mauser with 1,000 rounds. Nice thing about this rifle is that it shoots one of the most popular and available rifle rounds on the market, so no worry's trying to find ammo to shoot. Quality is equal to that of a sweedish/german/yugo Mauser!"

BORE IS NICE . GREAT OVERALL CONDITION . PLEASE SEE LISTED DETAILS. The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

""Patterned after the Anschutz Silhouette style rifle stock, this beautiful  stock features a wide-beavertail and  upwardly-tapered forend... The smooth radius on the beavertail also provides a firm, and comfortable grip when shooting offhand- yet is flat enough for a bipod without requiring an adapter...a larger palm swell and vertical grip provides for perfect trigger control, and the horizontal comb makes this stock particularly suited for either the ""traditional"" Russian sniper scopes, LER scope mounts attached to the rear sight,  or modern low-profile mounts... "" http://www.biggorillagunworks.com/mosin-nagant-stocks.html

All work was done by a professional gunsmith:

- Stock is fitted with a 1"" Pachmayer Decelerator recoil pad.
- Stock was inlet to fit Timney trigger
- Barrel has been cut down to 22"" and fitted with a muzzle brake. 
- ATI scope mount and bent bolt kit (Bent Bolt handle was welded on rather than drilled) 
- Sling Swivel Studs and bipod legs added
- +/- 120 rounds of ammo

This rifle has put rounds on target at 800m+. The muzzle brake, weight of the stock, and recoil pad make shooting it painless. Not sure about the manufacturer of the muzzle brake, it was an extra that was laying around in the shop. Threaded the barrel for it and it has worked like a champ. The scope is not included in the sale, but can be for an additional $100. It's a Nikon prostaff 3-9x40 ($159 at Walmart.)

$550 for the rifle and bipod
$650 for the rifle, bipod, and scope.
