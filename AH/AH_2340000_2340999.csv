This .30-06 M1 Garand Rifle was built by Winchester During WWII (1943), and most likely it saw action in WWII and possibly Korea as well. The rifle has been completely re-built, and re-barreled, the new barrel date is March, 1967. The barrel crowns at about a “3”. The rifle has been re-parkerized, the new finish is nice but it partially obscures the markings on the receiver. The rifle also has a sanded, nice stock with a good cartouche on the left hand side. The new barrel has a crisp bore with strong rifling. Condition of the rifle in it’s current state is 90-95%. Yes, this is a re-build, but, in today’s market, this is still an affordable M1 Garand, especially for a Winchester"

This IS NOT the same gun as a regular FNP.45. IT IS comparable to the tactical model except this model has a tuned trigger, different sights and no threaded barrel. Threaded barrel for this can be had online for around $140 if that's what you are looking for.

For trades the only things I would remotely consider would be a high end 1911, a really special garand, an M1A or a target 10/22 lightweight short barrel w/cash on your end.

Why is the price so low?


The price for this rifle is $350.00. Is there a little room to negotiate? NO, NOT REALLY BUT YOU CAN TRY. But, call, email, or text to me some crazy low ball offer, I will laugh a little, be annoyed a little and ultimately just not respond.



How did I come up with the magical number $350.00? 

    Do a little research online, maybe even check out a few gun dealers. The Yugo SKS rifle is averaged priced at $450-$550. I have priced mine in the hopes that it will sell quickly! THEREFORE THIS RIFLE IS PRICED TO GO!

Four boxes are 124 grain and two are 147 grain. These boxes have been climate-controlled and HST is the best handgun ammo made. 

Unfortunately, in the current crisis we face, this ammo has not been available at retail for over 2 years and will likely not be again for at least another 2 years. You can't buy this at local retail at any price. If you find it occasionally on the Internet, it's at a price at/over $1.40/round (plus shipping.) 

I have these 6 boxes for sale at $50/each. That's $1/round and there is nowhere to buy it for less. For someone who wants all 6 boxes, I'll sell them at a total of $270. Please....no requests to buy at a lower price. I'm foolish to sell these at this price but I no longer have a 9mm and these boxes are space in the safe that could be used for something else. No trades. Cash only. I can meet you anywhere inside I-465 or within 5 miles outside of it. First come, first served."

SIG Sauer:

""Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.""

This is the earlier model (A) serial number. Has the slight frame bulge in one spot on the frame. It's barely noticeable and only visible with the slide off. It affects the function in no way shape or form. I bought the gun used about a year ago. I've put around 300 rounds through it with 1 malfunction that was due to the ammo I believe. Comes with decocker installed and I do not have the safety but it can be bought from the Cz website. I also have an IWB leather/kydex hybrid holster that will come with it. Comes with two magazines. One drops free and the other one doesnt always fall out of the magwell without a little help.  The gun has a couple of scuffs onto the slide from normal use and the plastic sights have a couple of scuffs.  I'd give the condition 7/10. Text 316- 8412216 for more pictures.

I haven't kept an exact round count, but it's definitely less than 500 (like most of my guns - I play with them and then I find an excuse to upgrade/try something else).

It is in like new condition with the original operator’s manual. The gun has fired very few rounds, probably less than 100. The action is a roller delayed blowback action which is also used by CETME and Heckler & Koch German military rifles. It produces very little barrel climb and recoil. It is quite reliable. The ejection port is out the bottom so it is totally ambidextrous. This model was made years ago, long before modern design plastic guns were in style. It was way ahead of its time in both design and function, to say nothing about the capacity. This unusual, rare gun can be part of your collection. It's sure to be a conversation piece. It's a trip to shoot. It is shown with the 50 round magazine attached.  Package includes the following:

Flash hider ($45)
Scope/laser mount ($90).
Shell catcher ($49) sling swivels.

The scammer is pretty sophisticated. If he follows the same approach, he'll first ask you to go through PayPal. He will claim that he can't get the money from PayPal into his bank, and then refund your money. He'll then ask for a wire. Once wired, his wife will die, he'll wind up in the hospital, and well, say goodbye to your $."

The Model 03-A3 was produced by both Remington and Smith-Corona during WWII. A somewhat simplified version of the famous Springfield Model 1903, the 03-A3 incorporated some stamped parts, a re-positioned rear sight that was more combat-effective, and a few other modifications designed to speed production. Due to the pressing need for arms and with Remington struggling to increase production, it was decided a second prime contractor for the 03-A3 was needed. Smith-Corona was selected and tooled up for production. S-C was eventually awarded a contract for 300,000 rifles and was assigned the serial number blocks 3,608,000-3,707,999 and 4,708,000-4,992,000. The first ""pilot"" batch of 20 rifles was produced in October, 1942. This rifle, serial number 3,608,004 is the FIFTH RIFLE in the first block and is likely one of the ""pilot"" rifles manufactured in October, 1942. These earliest rifles have some unusual features including a SIX-groove barrel that was manufactured by Savage (rather than the High Standard 4-groove commonly seen). This rifle has the 6-groove barrel which is marked on top, behind the front sight, with a small ""ordnance bomb"" and a punch mark. The underside is marked with a ""P"" proof. The barrel profile is somewhat unusual also with the first 7/16"" of the muzzle turned down to 0.618"" before stepping up to a normal profile. Additionally, the left receiver rail has no ""thumb relief"" cut for stripper clip loading normally found in ""regular production"". Overall condition is quite good and the rifle retains almost all of the original finish on the receiver and barrel. The ""X"" marked Smith-Corona bolt is blued, has an Smith-Corona ""S"" marked extractor, scalloped Smith-Corona bolt sleeve, and an ""R"" marked Remington cocking piece. The stamped trigger guard/floor plate is of Remington manufacture and parkerized. The stock has a faintly visible FJA cartouche, a 7/16"" circled-P proof behind the trigger guard, and no rebuild markings. The stock is free of cracks or chips although it does exhibit some normal handling wear. The buttplate is of S-C manufacture, as are the barrel bands. The rifle appears to be in excellent mechanical condition. The bore is likewise excellent with bright, sharp rifling and low throat and muzzle erosion readings. This is an interesting rifle and a unique"

Bore is in excellent shape, and the entire firearm is well-cleaned and stored with a healthy coating of oil.
  I received this gun in trade a while back, and have only had it to the range once.  I manage to shoot several consecutive .5""-1"" groups at 25 yards, using the stock notch-and-ball iron sights and run-of-the-mill Federal 36-gr HP ammo, shooting from the prone.  I suspect that with a little polish to the trigger and about $50.00 to mount a scope, you'll be getting close to 1 MOA with this little guy!
