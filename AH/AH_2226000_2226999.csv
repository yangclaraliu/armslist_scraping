Less than 20 rounds of .357Sig and 33 rounds of .40S&W have been run through the gun. My Glock 21 has had almost 4000 rounds fired through it and I trust my life with it. 

 First upgrade is a Glock factory .40 S&W barrel on top of the original .357 Sig barrel.  This barrel is drop-in ready, you don't even have to change the magazines.  The .357 Sig cartridge is a necked down version of the .40 S&W.($150)

The magazine has a Pearce +2 magazine extension to take the stock 9 rounds and allow for 11+1 for carry.  

The slide, slide stop, and takedown tab are Duracoated.  The biggest enemy of concealed carry gun is sweat.  Sweat causes corrosion and corrosion causes malfunction.  Duracoat keeps the sweat away from the metal and builds upon the strength of the Parkerizing.  This particular Duracoat color is Woodland Tan. A little bit of holster wear on the front sight post due to rubbing  against my knife.($150)

The next upgrade is that all the upper internal articulating parts are polished.  The feed ramp on both barrels, the firing pin assembly and the extractor depressor plunger are all mirror polished.  I did not do the trigger components, but will be more than happy to if it sweetens the deal for you.($50 for the upper internals and one barrel $25 for the other barrel)

The last upgrade is Trijicon Night Sights.  These are tritium night sights guaranteed for over a decade and only installed two months ago.($120)

Manufacturers description:
Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights.

Included is one 10 round and THREE 13 round magazines along with 150 rounds of Winchester white-box ammo. I also just installed GG&G's $50 aluminum rail adapter. Original case and manual are included as well.

The description is one I pilfered from HK's website:

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life 
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes 
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves 
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release

Model #DDM4 MP 1/7 TWIST 5.56 NATO

Lower was factory-built by Palmetto State Armory (PSA) Multi-Cal model (no polymer here).  Perfect fitment, test-fired exactly 50 rounds at 50 meters with the TruGlo red dot optic (included) and did not have to make adjustments for shot placement; no FTF or FTE, in fact, no failures at all.  Just VERY, VERY loud.  Selling b/c it's a 'toy' that I thought I had to have for father/son shooting, but really don't need...rather sell than let it sit.

Package comes with 3 new magazines (used one Pmag twice, 25 rds each time); consists of 2 Gen2 Pmags, plus one metal 30-rounder by US contractor w/ anti-tilt follower.  Also has spare Rock Island ergonomic pistol grip (used), new Magpul AFG (mounted), 150 rounds of ammo with 50 of those being Hornady soft-tips.  All 55 grain FMJ brass.  Also comes with the spare/stock end plate (ring in pic) and stock A2 style handguards.  Everything pictured as one package for $995.  Will need to show OK driver's license and sign a firearm bill of sale b/c it is registered in my name.  If you don't want or need the ammo I will automatically take $70 off the price...so, everything else as seen in the pic for $925.

Check out DD's website and price out what I am asking if you would like to price shop, or for reference or comparison (before sending an offer); may save us both time.  This is a no-gouge offer for a quality AR.  Can even turn it into an SBR, but that would be more paperwork for you plus another $200 tax stamp, just FYI.  Otherwise, this should stay classified as a pistol.

Serious inquiries only (will need phone number in message if serious).  No trades, and will not ship out-of-state unless it is to your FFL.   And one last thing, it looks a lot better in person than with my old 5 mp camera."

I have the gun manual, warranty card, choke tubes, choke tube wrench, and shim kit that came with the gun.  Nothing is wrong with it and its in excellent condition...just looking to get something that I think will fit me a little better for the upcoming waterfowl season.  I have only used it in on a round of sporting clays and for the opening day of dove season so there have only been about 3 boxes of shells total through this gun.

This thing is tough to find in stores because a) it is a great price for a semi-auto shotgun b) it is made in Italy by Benelli (Franchi is part of the company) and c) it has received some really positive reviews from gun experts (http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/gun-nuts/2012/06/good-shotguns-franchi-affinity) so hopefully somebody out there is interested.  For those that aren't familiar it is very, very similar to Benelli's M2 and even incorporates the Inertia Driven technology that is well known for its reliability.

Please feel free to ask me any questions - I will be more than happy to answer them.  I will also provide pics if you are interested.

I have a DPMS Panther .223/5.56 AR 15 that has FDE Magpul handguard, pistol grip, and buttstock.  It has an A-frame front site and a flat top.  Since .223/5.56 has been so expensive and hard to get i havent shot the gun much.  I would say less than 100 in two trips to the range. The gun was cleaned each time and sits in my brothers safe.   Its in awesome shape.  Im finishing up a custome AR build and dont need two AR15's.  Im hoping to use this money to finish up my build and put the rest towards a Saiga 12.

Im asking $850.00.  That will include the gun with the Magpul parts listed above, 2 boxes of .223 rounds (40 PMC brass cased bullets) and one magazine parts kit.

Please email me with any questions or offers.

This is a lightly used 8 inch Colt Python. There's just the hint of wear around the front cylinder edges. This beautiful handgun hasn't been shot enough to wear the bluing out of the bore! The stock factory grips are in near perfect condition, with no nicks or gouges in the checkering. There is a scratch on one grip panel visible in pic 2. It would probably rub out with some paste wax! This fine Colt has the adjustable rear sight and the red-ramp front sight. The Bianchi shoulder holster is in fine condition! Payment is via postal money order only...

Here's a really nice gun, one of my favorites in fact. This is a Colt Python in .357. This is a nickel plated gun that is in really good condition but it has been shot. The barrel is about 4"" long with an unaltered front sight and vent rib. I didn't shoot the gun much but it isn't ""new"". It is very accurate and the action is really smooth. The serial number is E60148 which is think puts it about 1973. The grips are perfect, they are Pachmayr Grippers with the Colt escutcheon which I think was factory for this serial number. There is no box or papers with the gun. The gun is coming from a private seller and must go to another FFL.

The barrel, flash hider, and gas system are Melonite-treated for corrosion resistance while the bolt and carrier have been coated with Nickel Boron for the ultimate in wear and rust protection. The bolt and receiver are marked with the Spike's Tactical logo while the left side of the upper is marked ""5.45x39"" for easy identification. 

I purchased this upper new and put about 200 rounds total through it during two range sessions (making sure the upper was cleaned and oiled after both, as you can see in the image below the bore is still bright and shiny.) I was very pleased with both the performance of the upper and the very low cost of the round, but as I have recently been bequeathed the reloading equipment and large component stash of a relative I've instead decided to reload 5.56 for my cheap plinking needs. 

With Russian steel-cased .223 still near 40 cents per round surplus 5.45 is currently the best deal in centerfire rifle ammo. If you don't reload but still want to shoot your AR-15 it's the way to go right now as AIM and Palmetto are currently selling it as low as 16.6 cents per round shipped. The future outlook for surplus importation from Russia is good while new production ammo is available from Wolf, Bear, and Hornady. I have available 210 rounds of 7n6 Russian ammo as well, which I would be willing to sell for an additional $36.

Please note that although you can usually get 5.45 to feed from Lancers or USGI mags when downloaded to only about 10 rounds, this upper requires special ASC 5.45 magazines if you'd like to load and fire a full 30 rounds per mag. Unfortunately I've already sold mine but on the plus side it appears J&G Surplus has them in stock for $10 each. 

This comes with both the FDE Magpul handguards and stock round carbine handguards pictured. I can meet you in St. Peters or St. Charles, my preferred spot for FTF sales is at Bass Pro Shops or Cabelas."

Mags actually hold 24 rounds, not quite sure why they are always advertised as 22 round mags, but they certainly hold 24 rounds without a problem.  This is a GREAT gun and I am sad to sell it, but I desire another shotgun.  I ALWAYS clean my guns after the range, and this GSG has only seen the range two times.  Possibly a total of 500 rounds down the tube, it has very little wear and tear, and is in perfect working order.  It comes with a $150 Barska scope and 4 Hi-Cap 22 round mags (Gun comes with 1, so 3 at $25/each) and approximately 600 rounds quality 22LR ($50) DO NOT get tricked into paying $350-400 for the cheap ""Lightweight"" version of this gun!  It is PLASTIC and of no comparison to this GSG-522 SD.  Also comes with the bolt/screw upgrade kit ($20) but I have not taken the time to install it yet.  However, I would highly recommend installing it because GSG used rather soft screws throughout the gun and they have been known (rarely) to sheer off under severe duress.  Open to trades (Mossberg 500 w/ Breacher Barrell), but CASH IS KING.  $500. Thank you.  REDACTED"

It has been an occasional project for me for over a year now. No longer have time to finish it. As it sits right now it is a drivable vehicle. It has a strong in line six engine and a rust free frame. The body has two small rust spots below the doors on both the passenger and drivers sides. It has rust through in the front floor which has been covered with steel plating. The frame however is good to go and rust free. So far I have made the following improvements to the vehicle. It has a new steel gas tank, new starter, new alternater and belt, new battery, new carberator, new brake pads and master cylinder, the rear end gears and axle have been rebuilt (beyond my skills had this done at a professional transmission shop), Vehicle has nice aluminum wheels and four new tires. This vehicles suspension is in stock condition as in no lift. The vehicle does need a new muffler and the wiring is suspect as in left turn signal doesnt work and I have no idea why. I am sure the wiring could use more help Though front high and low beams work as do brake lights. The top is a soft top and is complete though not new in any way so expect some issues. It does also have the short top for summer also. I know I havent covered everything so if you have questions feel free to email I will do my best to answer them.   I want $1500 dollars for the vehicle. I would consider partial trade in firearms or ammo mostly just want bulk in cash though."
