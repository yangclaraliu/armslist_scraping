The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4."

  I have for sale a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum Air Lite PD revolver. Some features:
- 5 shot
- Rubber grips for excellent grip and comfort
- No hammer to get caught on clothing, purse holster etc
- Tru-Glo sight (green) for quick target acquisition
- 10 rounds (5 each on a flexible stripper clip)
- Leather shoulder holster rig. (One side for gun, other side to hold 2 speedloaders)

This gun is EXTREMELY light. It weighs 11.40 oz unloaded. You will be amazed at how light this is and thus how easy to hold on target.

This gun is in truly excellent condition and has rarely been shot. The older woman who owned it was a realtor and bought it for self-protection. She shot it only for familiarization and no more.

Please let me know of you have any questions or require other pictures.
In order to protect us both, the sale of this gun will require the purchaser to have a valid AZ drivers license. 

I am not open to trades or negotiation simply because I purchased the gun for $800 to help the owner when she needed cash. I am selling it for exactly what I paid for it. I do not want to make a profit; I simply don't want it (I have enough others).

Thank you."

This grade of rifle is no longer available in the CMP stores or by mail order. It's a CMP auction item only and the lowest they close at have been $2300. You are welcome to search the CMPs past post war correct auction listings to see for yourself. Rifle comes with all the correct paper work and green Plano style CMP plastic rifle case. This is the best CMP Garand you will see on Armslist by a long shot! If you have a specific 5mil. HRA serial number you are looking for please reply with that info and I will let you know if you've won the Garand lottery. Serious inquiries only! I will send more photos to your email upon request. This is not a hoax, bluesky, cai, dane, or greek import!!! This rifle appears to be original, unaltered, or messed with since it left HRA. In my opinion HRAs of this vintage are much nicer than any International Harvester or Springfield. This rifle will double in value in the next 15 years! If its here it's still available. This is a CMP certified correct grade rifle. This is not a corrected mixmaster! Serious inquiries only, price is firm! Buyer pays all shipping and FFL transfer fees."

...not that you CAN order them online anyway; they are all either out of stock or back-ordered for like 6-12 months--almost impossible to get.

At $40/box you're looking at 80¢ a cartridge--a decent price for rare and excellent ammunition."

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.

My first handgun was one of these, purchased in 1981, and it had these same larger wood grips.  Therefore, I believe this one would have been manufactured around 1981.  It has some wear on the blueing and a scuff here and there, but it locks up tight, the trigger is crisp and light, and it shoots nice tight groups.  I want to deer hunt with a .357 and in Ohio the barrel has to be 5"" or longer, so this 4"" won't work.  I'm offering it at $325, which makes it the least expensive Security Six on either Armslist.com or Gunsamerica.com, so get it while it lasts, because I doubt it will last long.

These are shooter guns. This one is priced as so. There is some corrosion on the outside parts of metal, but there was no chance for the internals to rust since it was caked in preservative. I completely cleaned out the cosmoline from the metal and the wood and re-stained it.

Like I said, this is a shooter. If you want something that slings 7.62 this is the gun for you. 

I bought this gun from BUDS and had to replace the firing pin on it and re-blued the finish when I got it. It shoots well and functions correctly. Its a cheap gun, not a safe queen.

Includes three 7-round factory magazines and a pocket holster. The gun comes from the factory with one magazine and extras cost about $22. The holster is valued at about $10 and has only been used to protect the gun in storage.

1 extra magazine base pad with finger rest
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor leaf spring (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor screw (new and unused)
Owners manual
Factory original hard case

PLEASE READ ABOUT THIS GUN'S HISTORY BELOW. After owning this pistol, I cannot honestly recommend anyone buying anything with the Kel-Tec name on it, but if you want to try your luck with this, have at it.

This pistol cycles reliably with brass cased ammunition. Aluminum cases (such as CCI Blazer) have occasional failures to extract. Some European ammunition with hard primers (Sellier & Bellot, Herters Brass) do not ignite reliably. Standard pressure American made factory loads work just fine. I have not used steel cased ammunition in this pistol and would not recommend doing so.

The slide has been replaced by Kel-Tec. The original developed a hairline crack after only 400 rounds--factory, standard pressure only. Replacing the slide means the gun also has a new firing pin, extractor, and related hardware. The new slide assembly has only seen about 20 rounds.

Be sure to keep the screw on the extractor spring tight. I put some blue thread-lock on this one. If the screw loosens, the firing pin will spring out of the back of the slide. I lost the first one prior to the slide replacement. 

The assembly pin has also been replaced twice by the manufacturer after it sheared in half. As noted above, I have only used standard pressure, factory 9mm Luger ammunition in this gun. 

Everything broken has been replaced with new parts. The gun has been cleaned and maintained properly. It has spent most of its existence in the safe.

Buyer must show a Wisconsin Driver's License and sign a bill of sale. A Wisconsin Concealed Carry License is a plus. I can meet people in the Fennimore or Platteville areas."

The Molot plant has gone back to the original ways of the Vepr and returned the design from a slant back receiver to the original straight cut design. They have also gone from a 1mm to a 1.5 mm overall receiver metal thickness. And yes I have measured it. The superior gen 2 guns also have thicker barrels and the bolt holds open on the last shot. Like all Vepr variants it has the heavy duty trunion and bulged side rails in the front of the receiver. Chrome lined barrel. Tapco Razor fence cutter muzzle break installed. Molot factory heavy polymer 5 and 10 round magazines included. Magpul buttpad installed. The stocks took two complete sets of Vepr rifle stocks to make! It's real beautifully striped tiger maple. The forend has been reprofiled almost an inch shorter showing the gas block. I cut the schnabel forend angle just tighter than 60 degrees. And vertically a quarter inch has been smoothed off the overall height of the forend showing the gas tube a bit more and cut straight unlike the normal Vepr forend which has an odd 6 degree cant to it in stock form. I went minimalist with the buttstock with a strong but light mini club foot shape. It looks great. All wood has 7 coats of polyurethane on it. The pistol grip was shaped to an average medium stocky hand profile. I sanded it for a week. It fits most I've shown it to like a glove. I have also included a CAA black pistol grip as an alternative in case you have big paws. Everything is brand spankin new! 
NOW $840 with just the two Molot Vepr mags
SGM Surefire and CSSpecs metal 25 and 20 round mags can be purchased for less than wholesale at $38 a piece which is cheaper than anywhere on the internet in the country by a decent bit! You get the two factory mags either way

868,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2757868,Want To Buy:  Use caution when buying knives from a guy in Algonquin!! / Also looking for quality folders,"Northwest Suburbs, Chicago, Illinois",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, March 1, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Since discovering Armslist I have done a lot of business with some great people.  I am a rather broke special education teacher who really can not afford many nice things and Armslist has helped me find great deals that makes protecting myself and family affordable.  However, today I bought a Cold Steel blade from a seller in Algonquin.  This whole thing is my fault annd I just want to make sure people do not do what I did.  

I wanted to meet the guy in a public place to look at the two knives I was interested in in detail.  When he said that he didn't want to get out of his car I should have known something was wrong.  I looked at the blade in my car while the snow came down and it looked good.  When I got home I looked at it in better light and discovered that not only was the profile of the blade massively crooked(see attached picture), but the pocket clip was missing screwes.  At this point I figured I could pay to have it reprofiled and put one of the lefty screws on the right.  Well, as soon as I put the screw it, it fell out.  The hole was stripped.  I then looked at the other two lefty screws only to see that they were stripped.  I messaged the seller and asked if I could exchange this for other products since I didn't want to be a total jerk.  He explained to me that ""buyer beware"".  Now this is my fault.  But, please do not do what I did.  If you buy from this guy please take the time and look over every aspect of his blades; because he will not make it right.  Sure legally he has no obligation to help me; his customer.  However, he could have done the right thing morally and ethically.  So if you are looking at a blade from Algonquin, please double and triple check it before giving the guy money."

The Molot plant has gone back to the original ways of the Vepr and returned the design from a slant back receiver to the original straight cut design. They have also gone from a 1mm to a 1.5 mm overall receiver metal thickness. And yes I have measured it. The superior gen 2 guns also have thicker barrels and the bolt holds open on the last shot. Like all Vepr variants it has the heavy duty trunion and bulged side rails in the front of the receiver. Chrome lined barrel. Tapco Razor fence cutter muzzle break installed. Molot factory heavy polymer 5 and 10 round magazines included. Also one SGM Surefire indestructible 25 round magazine goes with it.  Hogue OD Green recoil dampening pistol grip installed which actually feels quite good. I have installed the SGM Surefire quad rail forend. It's is polymer, not metal, but is made Very well and twice as thick as metal and reduces weight on a somewhat heavy gun to minimal. Guaranteed forever. A set of OD Magpul rail covers are included. A Magpul RVG forward grip is installed and there's also a black CAA finger groove fore grip if green isn't your thing. The buttstock I made with a black and OD green urban camo. If it's not your taste this is a $40 fix from K-Var.  It is made well and extremely strong and retains the Vepr raised cheek swell to have the proper height for an optic. Everything is brand spankin new!  $975 Cash

It is a full-blooded Browning Hi Power MK III with a different roll stamp on the slide, not a clone.  It has the Browning serial number format; but it actually has the FNH logo stamped on the side, and is the only one I've ever seen that had it.  Most read ""Fabrique Nationale Herstal Belgique"" on the slide.  Kind of unique, but by no means rare. They are still in production, but haven't been imported to the US for a few years.

It is in excellent shape.  The matte epoxy finish doesn't have the gloss of its Standard American counterpart, but it is extremely tough.  There is not a scratch on the exterior, except where the frame rails rub the dust cover, about 1/4"" visible on each side.  The barrel and bore are still shiny.  The trigger breaks crisply without any noticeable creep.  Novak plain black sights have been installed, the pistol is otherwise unmodified.

I have a few full-frame 9mm pistols in the stable now, including an older Hi Power that I'm interested in restoring.  I'd like to add a 1911 to my collection, so is my motivation for offering this beautiful instrument to the market.  Original case included, along with cable lock,  plus the factory 13-round and Mec-Gar 10-round magazines with the ""mousetrap"" release spring.  Pachmayr grips installed, stock resin contour grips and Hogue Tulipwood smooth grips included, if the buyer desires.  

I will ship, my FFL to yours for a flat $35.  It is also your obligation to determine if this firearm and its magazines are legal in your state or municipality.  Payment by cash or US Postal Service Money Order, absolutely no exceptions.  Feel free to email with any questions about the gun or if you're unsure about the firearm shipping process.
