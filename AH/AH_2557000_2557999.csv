It is very lightweight and comes with original box, paperwork and (4) High Capacity Magazines that hold 16 rounds each. There is a tactical light attached to it that you will see in pics. According to what you are offering this light may or may not come with it. It is a Viridian X5L ( These lights retail for $329 ). I just bought this one and it would have to be a good trade for me to give up BOTH guns and this tactical light. The second gun I'm offering for trade is a Beretta U22 Neos Competition Gun. It has a 10"" overall barrel with 6"" of that barrel being stationary and the other 4"" is what cocks the gun. The entire 10"" has a Picatinny Rail all across it from end to end so that you may ad a scope or laser, etc. It also comes with original Plastic Carry Case, All Paperwork and (1) 10 round magazine. To make the deal EVEN SWEETER, I will throw in 100 rounds of 9mm and 200 rounds of 22. I am looking for a nice compact or subcompact carry weapon. No junk ( High point, High Standard, Jennings, Taurus, Lorus, anything of that nature so dont insult my intelligence. All together I have over $1000 in these guns and expect around the same in value on trade. I would like to trade for Glock 26 ( Any of the smaller Glocks in 9mm ) SIG, etc. I will also sell the Beretta outright for $290 with ammo. If you have something you think I my want, text me pictures REDACTED. Serious Inquiries ONLY PLEASE!!! MORE PICS UPON REQUEST"

I live in Palo Cedro and am able to meet any evening after 6:00 pm during the week. If there are any questions don't hesitate to ask. The case that it is in, in the picture, is not for sale. The cable lock that came with the rifle will also be included.

The guy I got the shotgun from said his friend used some sort of DIY rhino lining/cheap coating & after it wouldn't load or cycle because it was so thick.  He scraped most of it off and it's nearly ready for a proper coating/re bluing.  It loads, cycles and fires without problem at all. The stock has some scratches but no serious dings/bruises or cracks. The gun is solid, cycles and functions just fine. It's just ugly right now & a perfect candidate for restoration.

- Provide detailed photos
- Transfer FFL to FFL if not within driving distance of Savannah, GA

- Consent to a three day inspection hold so I can have someone check it for proper grips,  fit, function.

This gun has killed more deer than any of my other guns I hunt with. I am only selling it to put money towards the LDR by Traditions. I want it cause it has a 30"" barrel and where I hunt now I need a little more reach for longer shots. This gun is woods ready; sighted in 1"" inch high at 100yds with TC 250gr bullets and 100gr powder. Gun comes with 3x9x40 Tasco scope which is very clear and mounted with over and under scope mounts giving the ability to still use brush sights if needed. Gun also has the threaded speed breech plug for quick and easy cleaning. If interested please call or text. My name is William"
