Its body is laser straight, good glass with very small crack in top of windshield. Interior is very clean and presentable. All windows work heater and ac blast have done quite abit to the vehicle. Relatively new tires. Gets excellent gas mileage tranny is fine differentals 4x4 all works great.

It needs a new tps and or pcm it runs strong and smooth. Engine will stop running. I do not have the time and health issues prevent me from working on er. i did drive it to longmont and back with no issues and it just seems to stall evry now and then, if you are good with jeeps this may be for you.
I realize it may take abit of work to get er back to normal so i will go below kbb book value. Lowest would be $2,500. If you know jeeps you know the value 

If you have cash in hand i will deal. You may drive a nice jeep home."

If people refuse to buy them, they will lower there prices. That is if they are needing to sell them. I know this may make some people mad, but it needs to be said. People that say I paid that much for the .22Lr ammo. When they are talking about $50-$60.00 a bulk pack of 325-550rds of .22Lr ammo, they are pulling your leg 99percent of the time. If they did pay that for them, then they either must have a lot of money to blow or are very foolish & can't wait for a better deal to come around. Walmart does not set their prices really high. You just have to be patient & check often! Between $20-$40.00 is all anyone should pay for a bulk pack of .22Lr ammo between the 325-555 round count boxes. As far as those remington 1,400rd buckets, they use to sell at rural king for about $60.00. I can see asking a little more than that. But $100-$250 for one 1,400rd bucket? Someone must be really high! Come back to earth. I don't care how hard they are to find, don't pay people the extreme high prices they are asking for their .22Lr ammo!

While I do not claim to know all of this guns rich history, you can do the research yourself to understand the understated value. Collectors know the popularity of their (S&W) models 19 and 66 series. From reading, the model 66 debuted in 1970 or there a bouts and finished it's illustrious run in  2005 having been discontinued.  Along the way the model went through revisions like 66-1, 66-2 and so on improving each generation.  The 66-2 was in the very early 1980""s.  This gem considering the age is in Great Condition. With very few rounds fired by the previous owner, and none by me- the current owner.  Just can't bring myself to this beauty.  I require for sales or trades Bill of Sale, and ID which is standard.  So please look at these photos, do your research and consider this opportunity.  There is NO Factory Box or Paperwork.  It still appraises high. Thank you for your consideration and time.

It's a rare WWI German F. L. Selbstlader pistol in 7.65 Browning (.32 acp). There were only about 50,000 of these made and almost all of them were issued to the German Army in WWI. They were made between 1915 and 1918, this one was made about 1916. It is in excellent condition and still has about 85% of it's bluing left. The bore is immaculate with no signs of rust or pitting. The grips are made of horn and are also in excellent condition. There are German nitro proof marks, and a military acceptance marking. It seems to be in good operating condition, although I have not shot it. All numbers match (slide, frame and breech block). This would be a hard pistol to upgrade.

WARNE Rapid Acquisition Multi-Sight Platform, or RAMP, is a cantilever style scope mounting platform that allows proper scope installation on the popular AR-15 rifle. By design, the AR platform was intended for fixed iron sights and did not offer an acceptable mounting surface for optics. As the weapon system evolved from the military designate M16A1 to the M16A3 and M4, Picatinny mounting systems became standard equipment, however, the rail system found on the A3 and M4 weapon systems still did not allow a variable power optic to be mounted far enough forward with conventional scope mounts.

Warne 45° Side-Mount Adapter

Designed for the Flat-Top AR-15 and other tactical rifles
Installation requires no modifications to the gun
Constructed of rugged, machined 6061 aluminum
This 45° Picatinny side mount is specially designed for the Flat-Top AR-15  and other tactical-style rifles. It provides a 45° accessory platform that can be mounted on a handguard, so your backup sight is perfectly aligned with the sight on your R.A.M.P. mount. Installation is quick and requires no modification to your firearm. Constructed of rugged, machined 6061 aluminum with a durable anodized finish. Designed to co-witness with the side rails of the R.A.M.P. mount to allow the use of a pop-up or fixed-type combat/open sights. Also creates a mounting positon for a flashlight, laser sight or sling without obstructing your sight line.

$20.27 for 50 pack Winchester


$20.27 for 50 pack Federal (or around there).





So   $37.57 x 8 = $300.56    


      $20.27 x 4 = $81.08

I called all the stores around Orlando area and a lot did not have 1000 round bulk boxes of .40cal


The cheapest I found was shoot strait which priced me $350 for 1000rds PMC bronze .


$350 plus tax is $372.75

COLT marked sear block with half circle bolt. the rifling in this weapon is superb, overall condition is excellent, has a couple of very small handling marks on the receiver that can somewhat be seen in the pics, but those are typical, especially for an AR of this age. the man i bought it from was the original owner and put 60 rnds down the barrel over the time he had it and i have fired 20 through it for function test; so 80 rnds through it and it works flawlessly, EXTREMELY accurate as well. cleaned and well maintained.

This gun should not be confused with the Sterling X-Caliber pistol of Lock port, NY. Itacha manufactured the barrels for Sterling and are so marked. This pistol features a unique firing pin system that detonates both rim fire and center fire cartridges. From information gathered according to S.P. Fjestad, author of the ""Blue Book Of Gun Values"", only about 300 units were ever produced in 22 LR and that production was ceased due to unsolvable production problems. This gun is marked Itacha and features a 10 inch barrel with contoured Gondola Alves grips and forearm. Among the rarest of the rare single shot pistols ever manufactured the Itacha Model 20 X-Caliber is seldom encountered. In fact, there were far fewer made than the Ruger Hawkeye. A must have for the Itacha collector or collectors of single shot pistols. This pistol is in excellent condition. Bluing is excellent"

First is a Yugo M48 in pristine condition.  I have never fired this rifle.  I bought it several years ago but I used the K98 I had instead and just never got around to testing this one out.  It has a mirror bright bore, two bayonets that both fit perfectly, and it still even has traces of the cosmoline in the bolt.  Wood and metal look great.  The second is a German Gewehr 1888 Commission rifle.  This rifle was produced between 1888 and 1897 so shoot at your own risk.  The Gew. 88 was designed to shoot a .318 round nose projectile in a .321 Groove barrel (so called ""7,9x57 J"");  In 1905, the Germans upgraded to a Pointed bullet of .323 diameter (7,9x57 JS), for the Gew98 (new rifle).  So you would need to either reload your own ammo or use low weight, low pressure rounds.  Also I believe PPU makes ammo specifically for these rifles.

In addition to the rifles I have about 300 rnds of 8mm ammo, most of which is egyptian(corrosive) that I bought back in the 80's and it was old surplus back then.  

Don't really want to sell but I need some cash for auto repairs.  Asking $700obo."

From Beretta:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry."

The GALIL Assault Rifle is a multi-purpose personal weapon, designed to serve as a basic weapon for the infantry.  The rifle is lightweight, air-cooled, gas operated, magazine fed, shoulder or hip fired weapon. The GALIL is a very robust weapon with high reliability in difficult and extreme conditions and is in use of the IDF since its development - over 30 years.

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries.

There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun.

Product Description

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I do not need to get rid of it, but will consider if there is a decent offer.  I am also willing to trade.  I have less than 80 rounds threw it.  Shoots very well.  Makes a great rifle for camping or to put in a bug out bag.  Whatever you are into.  I kept it in my tractor to shoot coyotes with.  It is a VERY CLEAN rifle.  It would also come with 10 regular G.I. mags and the original 2 10rd mags.  This gun is interesting in that is uses concepts of an AR and AK in the rifle.  The bolt (not bolt carrier) is almost identical to an AR.  It also uses a piston gas system like on an AK instead of direct impingement like on an AR.  You can carry up to 60 rounds at anytime with this rifle.  If using G.I. mags you could carry 1 in the mag well and 1 in the stock.  Very cool. 18+ years old.  Must be U.S. citizen."

This unit is designed to replace a hinged floorplate assembly on Remington 700 short action rifles. Unlike other bottom metal systems this Wyatt trigger guard is as close to a drop in fit that you can get. On my HS Precision and the original injection molded stock it required no inletting, and while the magazines are sold as 5 rounder’s I consistently could fit 6 in there. The magazines will work with any 308 winchester based catridge: 243 win, 7mm-08, 260 rem, 6.5 CM, 338 fed, 358 win and any number of wildcats or improved cartridges based on the 308. I used it for the last two seasons on a 243 winchester and it worked perfectly but I’ve since upgraded to a nice AICS Magazine system so I no longer need it. Normally this system costs $250 brand new and each of the mags sell for around $64 a pop. If you bought all of the stuff I’m throwing in new on Midway it would cost you around $380 (don’t forget the shipping…ouch!) I’ll part with it all for $240 OBO. No low balls and I can mail it to you at your expense. I will consider trades for reloading components (I need 6.5mm match bullets, Accurate 1680, or a progressive/turret press) but it has to be reasonable. Thanks for looking!!"
