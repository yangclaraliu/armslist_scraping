18,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2617018,For Sale:  BUFFALO BORE AMMO - .45 ACP +P AMMO - 230 GR. J.H.P. (950 FPS/M.E. 461 FT.

45ACP+P ammo is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 ACP ammo and can be fired in any 45 acp firearm that is in normal operating condition. However, the greater pressures and power of the +P ammo will give you greater slide velocity and if you are going to shoot more than a box or two of +P ammo, you should consider replacing your recoil spring with a Wolf Spring that gives roughly 4 to 6 lbs more spring weight than factory stock springs. A shock buffer might also be a good addition although it is not too necessary if you use the stronger spring.


The below velocities were fired from my personal Colt Gold Cup 1911 (5 inch)


1. 45185-----------1180 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. 45200-----------1078 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. 45230------------979 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. 45230FMJ------981 fps (230gr. Fmj-FLAT NOSE)
5. 45255------------960 fps (255gr. HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always, with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give real world data and results. Laboratory test barrels tell you little about what kind of speed you can expect from your stock firearm.

All our 45 ACP+P loads utilize flash suppressed powders so that you will not be blinded by your own gunfire should you need to fire in the dark when the criminal element is at work.


The three JHP loads are design for defense against humans, while the two non-expanding loads are designed to shoot through large shoulder bones or the skull on a black bear. These non-expanding bullets also work well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

51,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2617051,For Sale:  1943 Mosin Nagant PU Sniper LOWERED price,"Lawrence, Kansas, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 26, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I have a Mosin Nagant PU scoped Soviet sniper rifle. The rifle in an I.O. INC imported rifle. The reason I own it is due to the bore, which is mirror bright and strong rifling. Essentially, the bore was very well taken care of, including the crown. This rifle, besides being a historical piece, is quite a shooter. Using PPU heavy ball ammo, this rifle easily achieves 1 MOA accuracy, with most groups closer to 3/4 MOA.  The stock was the only ding on the rifle, with the original finish chipping off, so I refinished the rifle into an original look. The scope is not currently sighted in, however prior to refinishing the stock the scope was sighted in.

Some history on this particular piece as I have gotten from some research. This is a 1943 Ishevsk produced rifle. Serial number is KKxx meaning just two digits. It is a factory refurbed rifle with a strike/stamp number on the magazine floorplate. The bolt is not matching unfortunately. In correct form the scope's serial number is stamped into the left side of the receiver just above the woodline of the stock, and it matches the scope. The scope itself is original refurbished. It was refurbished in the Saranska Optics Plant in 1953. Saranska removed the previous markings of the original manufacture, which I believe to be from the Progress plant in 1943. The scope number is original to the rifle, just at refurb the old number was restamped onto the scope. Additionally the scope mount is original Izhevsh production sniper, un serialized original as common at that stage in the war, but there is a visable Izhevsk stamp on it. Later in refurbishment the rifle serial number was electropenciled onto the scope mount, which was common in the refurbishment process.

Essentially, through my research I have uncovered that the rifle is original Soviet sniper rifle that had undergone refurbishment post war, 1953. All the pieces are ORIGINAL, but refurbished.

I have no desire to ship the rifle as frankly I do not want to undergo the process.

And finally, the rifle is available if this is VISABLE, asking me if the rifle is still available will annoy the heck out of me. Any questions, trades, or picture requests feel free to ask.

This is a semi-sporterized 7mm mauser. The stock has been sporterized and the metal polished.  I've test fired it, and the action is very nice, as well as the accuracy with the iron sights.  Recoil is very manageable.  It would make an excellent first deer rifle, or project. I have some remington ammo to go with it.

100 RDS of 175 SIERRA GMM INCLUDED WITH THE SALE

That's a total of $3021 total for everything that has been done to the rifle. I understand that it is used, and I understand some parts may be more or less at this time. 

However, it is not beat up, and is in like new condition with less than 100 rounds fired and all proper break in procedures followed. It is now sitting in the safe oiled and stored properly.

I am not asking new retail, as it is not new. I would think that $500-700 off the NEW parts cost would be a fair USED resale or trade value, but I am also negotiable on this as well, as long as I am not getting unfair offers or stupid trades like Ipods and PS3's.

The rifle is incredibly accurate and is in excellent shape. I have shot quarters standing up in 2x4's at 300 yards with it. It has also been to 850 yards before at iron man sized targets and easily achieves this.

If you are interested and have a cash/partial trade offer, just email me.

The gun does show some holster wear from the BlackHawk but nothing major. I tried to take pics to show this so you won't be surprised. It is not brand new. It has had about 100 rounds down the pipe but the bore is bright and shiny as it should be. Some of the features are the ambi thumb safety, 3-dot sights, Beavertail grip, ventilated and lighten trigger and target hammer. The grips are black checkered as well. Firearm functions as it should.

It is a lot of fun to shoot and even with the ammo shortage last year, there was never a shortage of this 762x38R ammo. When you pull back the hammer, the cylinder goes forward about 1/4"" onto the barrel therefor there is no blow back at all, and it don't make a lot of noise considering its a 30 caliber revolver. Ammo for this is still about .50 cents a round."

This is prob the lightest shooting gun on the market and makes for a great gun to shoot at anything for anyone.  Even my girlfriend likes shooting it. 

I will trade for a Vinci only and will come up with cash on my part for the right gun.

This is a great shooting gun and thought i would try something other than a benelli for a change and don't regret it.  Now i am going to go with a vinci just to go back to my benelli's and I was told that I have to get rid of something so this one must go.  

The attached pics are all that i have right now of the gun.  I will try and take some more and add them later but as you can see it works."

The stock is in very good condition, has not been refinished and is free of cracks or repairs. My only problem with this rifle is that some ""genius"" felt compelled to replace the butt-stock screws with hex heads and then epoxy them into place. (see pic #   ) While this does not effect the way the rifle operates, it would not have been my choice. This SKS will make a great addition for someone wanting a very nice rifle and also wants to shoot it.

Body Armor Vest 
GEN II, MultiCam, Includes Inserts
Size Large
NSN 8470-01-583-9507

Includes
Consists of base vest assembly-front and back carrier with ballistic inserts front and back Size Large
2 side plate carriers, right and left external waistband
2 side plate pouch 
Release cable assembly 
Yoke and Collar assembly 
Tactical Assault Panel TAP OCP Multicam Chest Rig

The U.S. Army began fielding the new second generation Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV)
“The latest design Gen-II IOTV vest includes 17 improvements over the Gen-I vest. The new IOTV is designed with more versatile, modular approach, allowing units to configure their gear to better confront multiple threat levels in their unique environment” said Major Craig Fournier from PEO Soldier.

Improvements include a totally redesigned and removable yoke and collar, reversible and detachable side carriers and universal side pouch, and equipment anchor points on the front and rear which interface with items such as hydration systems and the Tactical Assault Panel or (TAP). In addition, the new design has better adjustability in the shoulders and hips, to better fit all sizes. The newly designed location for the side-plate is also adjustable to the wearer. Given the enhanced flexibility and modularity of the new kit, soldiers will be able to wear a more comfortable vest, and carry just the equipment they need for a mission. When required or possible, they could strip the IOTV down to its basic function, becoming a light weight load carrying vest, retaining effective protection, maneuverability and flexibility.

Features and Benefits:
More than three pounds lighter than OTV
Single-stage quick release added to the front of the vest allows a Soldier to doff the IOTV and its attachments with one pull
Other features include front and back pockets for SAPI, E-SAPI or other compatible hard armor plates and side adjustment straps. (Hard Plates not included)

Tactical Assault Panel TAP OCP Multicam Chest Rig 
MOLLE II Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment II Tactical Assault Panel (TAP),  replaces the Fighting Load Carrier to allow for quick-release of equipment in emergency situations. TAP is compatible with the quick release system of the IOTV/SPCS. TAP can also be worn like a Ranger Assault Carrying Kit (RACK) using the external webbing harness. The Tactical Assault Panel (TAP) is designed to carry a variety of basic Modular Lightweight Load Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) pockets and pouches. The TAP is a replacement for the Fighting Load Carrier Vest and maintains the quick-release function of popular vests. Fully compatible with the Improved Outer Tactical Vest and Releasable Body Armor Vest, the TAP can be easily connected to and detached from the vest, allowing Soldiers to remove the heavy load when only body armor is needed.

$400 Cash or
Possible Trades of Firearms, Current Issue Military Gear
But Cash is Prefered
I will seperate from TAP Panel and sell vest for $365

Hey all,
I also have available a Lorcin 380 pistol. It is finished in the chrome/nickel finish and is really good shape. It does have some light wear on it and a few nicks, but nothing major. It will come with one factory mag as well. I just finished testing out/reviewing this one and am only selling to open up funds to test out a few more! This gun shot fine and reliably, the only hitch it seems to possibly have is that i believe that mag spring to be weak (didnt always want to feed the last round or so perfectly) could also simply be that the feed ramp needs a polishing to feed great. I got it from the original owner who had put less than 50 rounds through her, so it could also just need more ""breaking in"". I dont expect it to be a major issue or I wouldnt sell it. Either way it had zero issues firing and ejecting. I am open to cash offers and trade offers for other firearms but please be reasonable on value and I will as well. My cell is REDACTED (text only please) or message me on here.

I have for sale or trade a rare little old pistol. It is a 25 acp ""MAB"" French made pistol. It is one of the more rare ones that came with the nickel finish instead of regular blued. It also comes with the original Leather holster for it and one factory 6 rd mag. The gun has definitely seen better days and has a large amount of wear but shoots great. she might not be the prettiest example of these but it shot fine for me with no hitches (except the one dud round i had haha). This pistol more specifically is a Model A, 2nd variant. Dating these is really difficult due to a lack of any real records, but this is one of the older models because it is a variant 2 and a model A. This appears to be all original except one screw on the grips looks to have been replaced. Because the value for these is all over the board I think my asking price is fair. I would also trade for a bunch of different kinds of guns, primarily pistols though. Please dont lowball or try and waste our times with needless comments. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). Please message with any offers or questions and I will try and respond as soon as I can! I can get more pictures as well if you desire. 
Thanks and have a great day!"

Original stock has minor dents and nicks but is in outstanding condition.  No rear sight.  The scope is a vintage Redfield Widefield 2-7x33.  I inherited the scope from my grandfather and the seals had gone bad.  I sent the scope out to Iron Sight, which is one of only two companies in the country that rebuilds pre-Leupold Redfields.  I had to wait over a year to get it back, but now it's a brand new scope.  Wide ""television screen"" eyepiece.  Original Marlin buttplate and Marlin bullseye in stock.  Scope mounts and flip up lens protectors are included.  Sling swivels in stock.  24"" barrel.  Very accurate.  The scope needs to be zeroed as it was mounted after I got it back from Iron Sight but has never been used since it came back.  I'm in the Cedar Creek area of Greeneville.  Email or text me at (732)2 one three-7nine4six.  I could use the cash, but feel free to offer me a trade.  My interest is vast regarding firearms so you may have something I like.  I am looking to fund the purchase of a Masterpiece Arms .45 pistol (MAC-10 clone).  Throwing that out there just in case..."

John and Ben are great guys, both knowledgeable, maintain a friendly atmosphere, and have rifles, shotguns, handguns, ammo, and accessories in stock. Gunsmithing is available, as well as certified Glock armorer services. Did I mention superb service and a great group of guys?!?! Did I also mention better pricing than I could find elsewhere locally or online?!?! You may not have to pay sales tax for an online purchase, but I'll gladly pay a little extra for great local service and support. 

I've been looking for a LGS to establish an ongoing relationship with, and I think I've found one. Not to mention, they're open later in the evening five days a week, and have Saturday hours! Perfect for those of us who can't get away from normal business hours during the work week. 

Give them a ring, or better yet, go in and meet them. You won't regret it. Thanks guys!

GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies.

Colt factory magazines are hands down the most reliable magazines available.  Their also equally known for having the most inconsistent finish straight from the factory with uneven, and at times, missing finish on some areas.  Add to it the wear marks and scratches from the factory shipping them in loose boxes and new looks old.

Because the discriminating shooters expect perfection in a true Black Rifle a demand was born, and now met.  The solution was found by taking new factory Colt magazines and giving them a chemical resistant, high-temperature ceramic coating resulting in a durable and beautiful matte-black finish for that special rifle.

Finally, new Colt magazines that look as good as they are reliable…Colt stamps and green followers are standard.
