I just picked the GP100 up recently, its been lightly used and is in great condition.  6 inch barrel, blued finish, adjustable sights, tight timing and lockup and great trigger.  I've really been wanting a 2in barrel .38/.357 Ruger SP101 though, and this is the primary gun that I'm looking for.  Would also consider the same gun, a GP100, with a 4in barrel.  Not really interested in any other trades, but MIGHT consider other all steel .357's, primarily snub's or mid sized revolvers with a 4 inch barrel  (no Tauruses).

If not interested in trading I will sell it with a speedloader and 50 rounds of .357 magnum for $500.  Price is firm, I don't need to get rid of it.

Looking through the safe I've decided to part with a couple firearms that I simply don't get out enough so I thought I'd see if there is someone out there that maybe is looking for them.

Perfect carry firearm, light weight and very concealable, reliable & accurate.

I'll upload actual pics as quick as I can I'm on a quick business trip so when I get home I'll snap a few and update the listing if its still available.


Minor holster wear at the very end of the receiver & across the top of the slide, it was carried for awhile so its typical holster marks, not bad just want to be as descriptive as possible. Shots VERY WELL just as all the 3rd gen Smith's do, I carry a 45 and I was going to keep it for my wife although she likes her revolver so I'm good with that.

Functions flawlessly, and extremely accurate, simply isn't getting any use, i don't mind keeping it but extra space in the safe is welcomed also.

Includes one magazine, sorry nothing else came with it when I purchased it, and its $485.00, I am firm on the price, I don't mark them up just and negotiate down.  I just don't have a lot a extra time so please understand I'm just trying save time for everyone. 

Pic here is stock as mentioned above as soon as I can I'll snap a couple and update.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have, although if the posting is still up it means no one has committed to it. -- Once its sold, and paid for I'll remove it right away, if its being sold & shipped or someone is on the way to pick it up, (committed to purchasing) I'll update the listing as - ""Sold Pending Funds"" in the title and body.

Thanks for looking - Martin"

Before you read on, I am not selling this because I need money. I am selling because my wife chooses to carry the Shield over the XDS and I have 2, so trading/selling one of them.

Wanting to trade for a full size Springfield XD/XDm in 9mm or 45acp. XD will require some boot, XDM will not. Depending on the deal, I have ammo/mags/cash to add.

I also have interest in a Gen 4 Glock 17. Feel free to message me offers of other FULL SIZE 9mm/45acp guns. I have no interest in other compacts of .40 s&w guns.

Also included are 4  30-round magazines and 1 5-round magazine. I also have a pretty cool WWII german mag pouch that holds 4 30-round magazines. This rifle has a standard stock and grip but also has the original thumbhole stock as shown in the picture. Wood is in very good condition and is absolutely beautiful. Will also include whatever ammo I have, probably about 30 rounds or so.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo in the loadings whenever possible as over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20D utilizes a very hard cast 150gr. WAD CUTTER bullet. The bullet is made hard, so it won't deform or mushroom. It cuts/crushes a ""cookie cutter"", full diameter hole in human flesh just like it does on a paper target. It penetrates deeply (roughly 14 to 16 inches in human tissue) and its full diameter profile maximizes blood loss as it cuts and crushes (not slips or slides) its way through tissue. Although I've never been shot with a full profile wad cutter bullet, I must assume that the initial impact of that wide flat nosed bullet, is crushingly formidable. As a teenager, I took to the woods on a regular basis and killed many a critter with heavily loaded 38SPL wad cutters'. The effect of a full profile wad cutter on small game was obvious and amazing, compared to regular round nosed bullets. That flat nose, literally hammers living things. These bullets are hard and properly lubed and will NOT lead your barrel. Note my velocities from real world ""over the counter"" revolver s- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1.  GLOCK 29 Gen 4 Pistol (and all that came with it - see photos below).

3.  Additional, very convenient black tactical carrying bag that can carry up to 2 pistols, 6-10 magazines, along with ammo, etc., in various pockets.

This is an excellent ""concealed carry"" pistol, or one to have along in the forest due to it's tremendous 10 MM stopping power (which will down a bear if need be).

REASON FOR SELLING:  I'm in the process of continuing to scale down my collection of firearms.  I purchased this Glock 29 roughly 8 months ago.  However, since I've not been doing any shooting lately, many of my newly purchased firearms have not been used.  So I minus well put them up for sale to somebody who will use them.

QUALIFICATIONS:  I will only sell to a buyer who either has a valid (current) NC Sheriff's issued Pistol Permit, and/or a valid NC Concealed Carry permit.  No other considerations will be given.

SELLING PRICE:  $460 Cash (no checks please).  And please - no trades.  I don't need another pistol - just the cash.

Rossi now offers medium frame revolvers built to the same quality and reliability standards that have been part of the Rossi name for over 100 years.

Each handgun features deep, contoured finger grooves in the grip for a solid grasp and maximum shooting comfort. All Rossi Revolvers have the lifetime repair policy, as well as the patented Taurus Security System, a simple, integral locking device that allows the firearm to be secured by use of a special key. The Model 972 is a heavy-duty stainless steel revolver that fires .357 Magnum rounds. The 6-inch barrel helps reduce recoil and the adjustable rear sight along with a red ramp front sight help further ensure accuracy.

It is a true MOA shooter with no mods at all. There are not enough adjectives to describe my utter joy when I behold this gem. It was obviously sent from heaven to complete my life.""  Another on the same forum said ""I've had several Savage 111's and the only one that I was disappointed with was a tactical rifle.  The hunting guns were great.  In fact the 110 youth model that I have in the safe now will outshoot my Remington 700 BDL Varmint rifle.  They just haven't gotten the respect they deserve.  You'll like it.""  And finally a third said ""It's a good rifle. I had one many years ago, but had to sell it. Last winter I finally picked up a 111 GCNS in 30-06 to replace it, and this one shoots as good as my old one did, so far it's sub MOA with every ammo I've tried.""  I don't know what more there is to say.  This one is also beautiful!

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.
The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The SCAR is delivered as a battle carbine with battle trigger which means they are horrific.. Special Forces unit armorers have replaced these units with Geissele units (select fire) from the beginning and cleaned up the interiors. That said Rangers are for the most part stuck with the factory units.. these upgraded SCAR units DO have Geissele trigger units installed; 2 stage with second release 2-2.5lbs enabling precision work. Shown with the Trijicon 6x issue ACOG. This unit is simply awesome with a BDC ballistic drop compensator out to 1200 meters.. target at 800?

Steel cap retention devices, distance/range use, red chevron, upper picatinny rail, fiber optics (adjustable) for day with tritium for night. Battery free, waterproof 100+ meters, dustproof. This system is an awesome platform but for room clearing 6x is too much. Optics package includes an offset Trijicon RMR system also with chevron. Enables fast target acquisition for close quarter battle/ room clearing. On an offset 45 degree mount which allows you to easily switch from 6x to 1x and vice versa.

I have almost 1100 rounds with it as well: 180 rds assorted 5.56, 390 rds PMC Bronze .223, 211 rds assorted steel case, 140 rds misc. brass ammo, 150 rds Fiocchi V-Max, 20 rds Remington JHP.

$1700 for everything. I'll sell things separately, but the rifle has to sell first. I'd rather not sell all my mags and ammo then have a rifle sitting that I can't shoot. If the ad is up, the rifle is still here. Buyer must have GA ID and GWL"

966,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2922966,"For Sale/Trade:  Savage 111 LRH 7mm Rem Mag w/ dies, brass, projectiles","Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 9, 2014",Rifles,Savage Arms                                                                                ,7mm Remington Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a Savage 111 Long Range Hunter chambered in 7mm that I would primarily like to trade for a short action model 10/model 11 platform. 7mm-08 and 260 Remington setups would get first preference with .308 and same bolt face's second preference. Absolutely must be short action and absolutely must be Savage.

This rifle has exactly 80 rounds down the tube. It includes the accustock and a closeable muzzle break. The tip of the forend slightly touched the barrel so I lightly sanded it to ensure free-floating (this was done w/ proper dowel and wouldn't be noticed had I not said something). It will also come with an EGW 20 MOA rail but not the scope, rings, or bipod.

Also included in the package is 300-500 pieces of once/twice fired brass. I bought some once fired from others and have inspected 90% of it.. no obvious cracks or extremely loose pockets so I believe it to be once fired. 

I have about 80-100 168gr GMAX, 100+ 168gr Interlocks, 50 140gr Nosler E-tips, and 50 of something else but I can't quite remember.

Lastly, this will come with RCBS 7mm Full Lenth X-Die, Neck Die, and sizer. I also have a collet die for belted magnums that sells new for $100 (I'd recommend using this the most to get more cycles from the brass). Oh... and I have the Hornady LNL brass casing for 7mm Rem Mag so I will include that too. :)

Air pulled 154gr Interlocks with 58.5gr of IMR 4831 got me .6MOA. I was also using Tula LRM's and guessed at my correct torque (without overtorquing) so I feel like the rifle would do slightly better with a more capable shooter.

I'd prefer a trade of equal or near equal (give or take boot) on a Savage 7mm-08/.260 rig w/ reloading components. If 7mm-08, I'd keep the projectiles.

Could be had for a cash price of $1250 plus shipping and FFL fees if applicable. I would not be willing to part with the reloading components/dies unless a deal on the rifle has been finalized with another buyer/trader.

E-mail me if interested in a trade or want to give a reasonable offer. I can text pictures easier than uploading so include your number if you would like me to send pictures. The rifle is like new and the brass should last an experienced reloader for the lifetime of the barrel if the collet die is utilized properly. 

*Obligatory Armslist Note* This rifle has been greatly cared for and is truly in like new condition. I will not negotiate with Armlist regulars over minor cosmetic blemishes or the fact that I correctly free-floated this barrel. If the fact that 80 rounds have been down the tube bother you then please buy new. If I wanted to get nickled and dimed over minor blems/improved performance then I'd take it to a pawn shop."
