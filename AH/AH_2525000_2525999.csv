 I bought this rifle new just over 6 months ago and it does not have a scratch or blemish on it.
 Price is firm and includes everything shown. Allen soft case, Simmons 8-Point Scope (3X9X40mm), Weaver scope rings, ""MARLIN"" 10 round nickel plated magazine, Security lock, all original boxing, packaging and literature. I will also include a 100 round box of CCI MINI-MAGS 22LR. Everything needed for target and plinking fun. And because it's bolt action, it will cycle great with pretty much any 22LR ammo you put through it!
 This rifle is incredibly fun to shoot and amazingly accurate with everyday bulk ammo!
 Purchaser must be at least 18 years old and a Wisconsin resident. Local pickup only"

Not a mark on it. I fired 36 rounds through it the day I got it and put it up. I have never carried it but intended to just never got around to it. These were sold as a limited edition Promo model and came with BOTH BARRELS FROM THE FACTORY (357 Sig and 40 caliber). The 36 rounds were shot through the 357 Sig barrel. The 40 caliber HK barrel has NEVER been fired. All numbers match etc. Factory sights , not nights. Very nice HK that is no longer made in 357 Sig.

I am primarily looking to sell to help fund a Mission trip for my Wife. That being said I'm not opposed to trades if it is something I really want bad or maybe a multiple gun trade or optics plus cash so I can still generate some funds for the mission trip. $1200 cash/trade value. 

If you are an HK fan you already know the limited history with this particular model but I would be happy to answer any questions either way. This HK is truly in pristine condition and could pass for unfired. However, I did function test it the day I got it so it has had a whopping 36 rounds of Speer Gold Dot through it. Buyer must have a CCH or permit and a Bill of Sale will be done.  Thanks!"

I have had this Limited Edition Promo SK subcompact (2 factory Combo Calibers in Sig AND 40-Caliber Combo) for a while due to my obsession with HK and it is immaculate. Not a mark on it. I fired 36 rounds through it the day I got it and put it up. I have never carried it but intended to just never got around to it. These were sold as a limited edition Promo model and came with BOTH BARRELS FROM THE FACTORY (357 Sig and 40 caliber). The 36 rounds were shot through the 357 Sig barrel. The 40 caliber HK barrel has NEVER been fired. All numbers match etc. Factory sights , not nights. Very nice HK that is no longer made in 357 Sig.

$1,150 cash or $1,200 trade value for everything.  (Essentially 2 HK's in one with the factory matched barrels).

If you are an HK fan you already know the limited history with this particular rare model but I would be happy to answer any questions either way. This HK is truly in pristine condition and could pass for unfired. However, I did function test it the day I got it so it has had a whopping 36 rounds of Speer Gold Dot through it. Buyer must have a CCH or permit and a Bill of Sale will be done. Thanks!

This gem is chambered in .458x2"" American, which is a shortened 458 Win Mag (a straight walled belted magnum case.)  Designed to drop ANY game in North America, this could be the ultimate brush cutter!

The conversion was likely done back in the 1960's, and was expertly completed.  The scope is a super-nice variable Bausch & Lomb BalVar 2.5-8x40mm on a rugged detachable mount.  The optics are great on this premium scope, with tapered cross-hairs.

The stock is a classic full-length walnut, w/ pronounced cheakpiece & metal nose cap.  Front ramp sight is in place.  Bore & rifling are great.  Trigger & bolt are well worked.  Sling points mounted.

The cons are few, the stock has a small chip/hairline at the rear of receiver.  The butt pad is old, hard, and a little mushed from standing on her tail.  Both things are easily fixed.  Bluing is around 85%.

The extras: 
1) A set of RCBS Custom Shop dies.  Lifetime warranty.  Worth at least $150 alone, these are what you need to make very affordable ammo.
2) Ammo.  I have 10 loaded rounds, all built on new brass with premium components.  The load is medium-strength, pushing a 350 gr. softpoint.  Perfect deer rounds...or elk...or moose...or bear.  LOL.
3) New reloading components:
Brass- Remington 458 Win Mag, untrimmed.
Bullets- Horonday 350 grain, round nose, soft point. 
Primers- Large Magnum Primers."

It is a Japanese Arisaka Type 99 rifle from the EARLY 32nd Series. This rifle is from a WWII Marine Vet estate. It is a true battlefield captured rifle and bears the full unmolested MUM. When I got the rifle it had been in storage for several years and not cared for. I took the rifle apart and cleaned it throughly. It is pretty pitted up as you can tell from the pictures. My Grandfather calls it ""blood pitting"". The bore is frosty but shows distinct lands and grooves. It does shoot and function as designed. The stock cleaned up really nice and is in good shape. No major dings and no cracks or splits. It is missing one of the bayonet lug screws. It has the full length cleaning rod. The serial numbers (405) match on the dust cover, bolt, extractor, safety knob, and firing pin. The bayonet lug is unmarked. The rifle serial number is pretty much unreadable due to some pitting. It reads 31XXX but if you get a jewelers loop you can pretty much make out the last three as 405. But because I can't be 100% sure I am not going to say it is 100% matching. You can be the judge. The rifle is just a really nice piece of WWII combat history. It is hard to find them with matching dust covers. If you want to buy the rifle I require full payment to be made by US POSTAL MONEY ORDER within seven days of the agreement to purchase.  Along with the money order I will need to see a signed copy of a valid FFL or C&R license of the individual you would like me to ship the rifle to for the transfer. I am not an FFL so make sure your FFL is willing to accept the rifle from me. If these instructions are not complied with the rifle will not be shipped.  Rifle will be shipped insured to you for $30 if you live in the lower 46 states.   It you want the rifle shipped to California, New York, or DC...Forget it.  Alaska and Hawaii will be a little more.

The one I am selling has had a replacement trigger put in so the trigger is very nice. 

The bolt has been lapped it's very very smooth and hasnt had any types of malfunction since I've had it. I have a shot log with 67 shots through the rifle. And I have formed ballistic tables with a chronograph. They have only been confirmed to 800 yards but the information is accurate overall the gun has had about 1200$ worth of gunsmithing put into it.

Tools and small hard case that came with it included.

This is from their site.
Taurus semiautomatic pistols deliver excellent performance at prices that make them a great value. The TCP .380 ACP is the lightest pistol in the Taurus lineup at just 10.2 oz., making it an excellent concealed-carry option. The frame is rugged polymer, and the metal components are stainless steel and titanium. Low-profile fixed sights. Double action only. Loaded-chamber indicator. Ambidextrous magazine release. 6+1 capacity."

Thumbhole stock is not original to the gun. I took this gun on a trade and had a regular buttstock on it, and decided to install a thumbhole stock for the 922(R) compliance. Thumbhole stock is in excellent condition, no cracks, scratches, or splits. However, it has a couple of very minor dents. Just installed a rear sling swivel on the buttstock (a few days after the pictures were taken). The Hungarian SA-85Ms (sporters) were imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's.

The hammer has been lightened, set screw in hammer to adjust the sear engagement, radius ground on the bottom of hammer for over travel, set screw in sear to reduce creep, set screw for adjustable trigger return pressure, over travel set screw in trigger gaurd, auto bolt release, The bolt has been chamfered, stoned and headspaced to .0425, firing pin has been staked, bolt buffer, set screws in the rear action to lock the trigger group and some misc polishing and stoning. It also has a extended bolt release and Kidd extended bolt handle. 


The stock is a custom one of benchrest stock. It has silver metallic base with ghost flames. The paint is in pretty good shape, not perfect however. The rifle was built to shoot, not sit in a safe. The bottom of the grip, palm swell, forgrip endcap and stock are all custom machined pieces of billet aluminum and polished. The length of pull is adjustable via some set screws.


You won't be disappointed in this rifle. It's a real head turner. Will surely get attention at your local range.
