 I've been shooting this pistol, too much fun not too. Anyway round count is down on the box listed. So I'm going to add one box of Gold Dot and 10 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty with the pistol. I've had a ton of offers, and the same amount of no shows or found out I am a 2 to 4 hour drive. So $350 is the price, no cash offers (I'll just delete them) I will take trade offers but they have to be in the firearm family of military gear. Also it is okay with me if I just keep this pistol, it is a lot of fun and I have a ton of ammo for it.

It does have some holster wear on the slide but the frame is almost flawless and this is a well tuned machine! Has a very low round count for its age. I believe this was a service pistol but I can't say for sure because I bought it from a local gun shop. I am not the original owner but I have shot it and it shoots like a dream! The internals are in excellent shape and was just inspected by a Sig Armorer recently. It DOES NOT HAVE the original box but I have all the extra parts that were replaced and I have a newer Sig case for it."

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.

These Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads were designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for defense against humans. Both loads feature light weight, hollow nosed bullets, designed to mushroom dramatically at the intended impact velocities. Item # 4H will perform on humans much like our DEER GRENADE load (Item # 4F) performs on game animals. The light-for-caliber weight of these bullets, aids in reduced felt recoil, for faster follow-up shots. We've employed flash suppressed powders but, with any bullet moving this fast from typical length revolvers, there is still a decent flash in low light.

Both of these loads will also work well on light, big game such as whitetail deer.

Both of these loads are safe to use in ALL/ANY 44 mag. firearm that is in normal operating condition.

Note our real world velocities taken from my personal stock firearms. We prefer to establish our advertised velocities from over-the-counter, stock firearms, while most ammunition companies establish their published velocities from laboratory, long, test barrels, which provide false or exaggeratedly high readings. We feel that this long established practice does not give the customer a true idea of what the ammunition is doing when fired from 'real world guns' under 'real world conditions,' where these numbers really do matter."

I have already adjusted this to make it a very short, smooth, light pull with no overtravel making reset almost instant which makes for great speed and accuracy on follow up shots. You can double tap quarters at 20 feet with this gun. It also has Truglo Low Profile Tritium night sights. Heavy tungsten recoil assembly, recoil buffer, Glock extended slide stop lever, grip plug, and a Vicker's/Tango Down extended mag release. Also it has a Pachmayer grip glove which is great for not only gripping the gun better but also reducing felt recoil and hand fatigue on long shooting sessions. The gun also comes with an IWB holster and 50 rounds of Speer Gold Dot hollow point ammunition. I also have a hanfull of Independence hps I can throw in if you like. It comes in the box with 2 15 round mags and all that came with the gun.

Must be within 50 miles of Columbus,GA unless you're willing to pay the shipping, and have a valid I.D. and a CWP would be nice too. Face to face is my preference though."

It has a foregrip with built in Bipod and also a super bright Lithium powered rail mounted flashlight with quick-release(mounts to the rail on the side of the foregrip).
It comes with a Pitbull padded case and a ""bungee""  sling that clips to the swivel point that is installed on the UZI. The swivel moves to two different spots on the UZI.
It has never malfunctioned ...at all... in any way; and it has zero blemishes. It is the same as new. It is  quite a machine."

One of the simplest, most reliable, small arms ever designed with a brand new comfortable setup. This rifle rivals the Ruger Mini 30 in accuracy, design, firepower, modularity, and cost.  

Clean, straight barrel, clean bore, clean bolt, clean pin, clean gas tube, clean piston, clean trigger mech, clean furniture, fresh mags, no cosmoline, no rust, no weird smell, ready to shoot. 

Bolt modified to allow the mag to release even when bolt is seated to the bore. The bolt DOES NOT have to be pulled back to release mag. (very convenient) No effect on accuracy, I hit a 1 1/2 inch .22 target circle 3 times in a row at roughly 75 yards and absolutely destroyed it. 

Theres extras. Within the water-proof buttstock, are several things necessary for this gun to last; a brand new firing pin recoil spring, and cleaning jag and fresh gas-piston tube with rail. 

 Furniture in olive drab, mountable pistol grip in olive drab, strap in black, gel butt-pad in black, magazines are black. All aftermarket parts are made in USA and made by TAPCO (with exception of butt-pad and Promag 30rd magazine)

This rifle is very popular because of the fact that it is built in Russia on the same machinery used to build a real ak 47 so the quality of the metal/parts and smoothness of the action is extremely good.  I purchased this rifle with the intent to eventually convert it but I never got around to it. This conversion can easily be done at home and there are many kits and videos that can be had to help do it, or you can just keep it in its sporter form and still have the same reliability of an ak, just in a “not so scary” form… 

The rifle comes in its standard box with the provided instructions, oil bottle, 10 round magazine and cleaning kit…. Just as if you purchased it from the store.  This particular 7.62 x 39 sporter DOES have magazine dimples.

My price is $550 and im firm at that…….These rifles are hard to find and keep going up in price every time I see them. 

The picture provided is not my picture but my rifle is the same thing.  I can take pictures of it if you would like but there is not even 1 mark on it so it will look the exact same as the one in the picture."

I need to sell it because I don't have a varmint problem and I have an AR. It weighs about 14 lbs and still has room for a lb or 2 of lead shot in the stock. The scope is a Nikon 4.5-14x40mm with BDC reticle that can be used for a variety of common calibers. The Choate stock is made of DuPont Rhynite and takes paint very well. Has a nice wide flat forearm, bipod adapter, sling adapters for right or left side carry. This rifle is nice and heavy for the bench and it touches off like a bb gun. The lack of recoil allows you to see exactly what's going on down range because it doesn't change your sight picture. You can literally watch your varmints blow up. 
 The trigger is of course an accutrigger so it's not the greatest but it's a lot better than your average deer gun. As for accuracy it's a savage. It will put the 50gr Hornady Vmax that I load with a measly 25gr of BLC2 inside a dime at 100 meters all day.

Now with that being said I have a very good price on it. If I don't sell this gun a week from today I'll just take the listing down and nobody wins that way. I'm not going a penny lower than 700. This is one hell of a varmint gun and the shit is a steal at that price."

It comes with 2 fifteen round magazines, factory box, gun lock, and speed loader. I also have a box of 20 Hornady 180 gr hollow points that I'm throwing in too.  The only thing I have done to this gun is I replaced the plastic guide rod with a stainless steel guide rod with stainless retainer and increased the recoil spring from 20 lbs to 22 lbs. I ordered it from Galloway Precision and it cost me $40 and took some of the recoil out of the gun and smoothed it out. I still have the original guide rod and spring in the box.

I have a few brand new unissued GEN 2 packs. I also have a few GEN 1 previously issued and are in B Grade condition showing slight signs of use. All packs have fully functional zippers and buckles with no tears. Don't buy a crappy pack offline that's been through multiple tours. Get one local and see what your getting before you pay the shipping cost on a worn out pack. Most of these bags are used but most could be considered new, only a few show any signs of use.

What we got in the end was not just a new gun, but a new class of gun - the short-action 1911. Now that the hard part is out of the way, other gunmakers will surely copy it. But when you see their copies that look almost like a Springfield EMP, you'll say to yourself, ""Hey, that looks almost like a Springfield EMP."" It's great to be first.

For sale is a Miroku Arms .38 special revolver 2"" barrel. This belonged to my late father who had this for more then 41 years. As you can see from the photos gun needs to be re-blued on one side. I've done re-bluing myself before and it really doesn't cost much. I just don't have the time anymore and don't want to buy a kit to do it because of my limited time. I took it to the range last week and fired it, it fires great! Just like is used to when I was a youngster.

The Boyd Walnut stock is fit to a very tight tolerance for best receiver support during firing, while still maintaining ease of cleaning and field stripping as it is not glass bedded. National match 595 rear sight by Springfield is graduated in .5 MOA increments instead of the usual 1 MOA, this makes for much finer tuning of downwind point of impact, especially at range. Front sight is also a National match .062 post with military type prong guards. The Bolt has been lapped to the receiver for full bearing on both locking lugs. This is the single most important gunsmithing upgrade to do to an M1A. It provides the most stable lockup possible for reliability, precision, and accuracy. Chamber was maintained at about 1.63 inches, which is pretty consistent with military specs. The sling is a standard quick adjust webbed GI type black sling. I still have a Springfield box, paperwork, chamber flag etc... for it. I am including the two match type 5 round mags. These are desirable for long range competition shooting as they keep down the weight and bulk while the shooter is ""slung up."" As I understand they are also legal for hunting.  I have sighted this for perfect point elevation adjustments using the elevation markings and M80 Ball ammo. I have fired it out to 400 yards with very impressive results. I just don't do enough long range shooting, someone needs to be able to stretch this guns legs a bit. I am in need of cash so no trades at this time. Thanks for the look and let me know if you have any questions."

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

This includes the pistol with one magazine.  This is a cheap .22 that is a fun range gun.  Like most .22 pistols, it is ammo finicky and needs high velocity ammo.  I've put 50 rounds or so through it and had the occasional light strike but all then fired with a second strike. Also the rare failure to extract the fired case. So it is a good cheap range toy but NOT a defensive pistol. It is possible a thorough cleaning of the firing pin channel, main spring, etc. could clear up the light strikes.

Ammo is starting to show up faster than the price gougers can buy it and rip u off. There is a guy selling 1000 rounds of .22lr on this site he more than likely got it at a store like I did and is looking to make money . 

Flag or make fun of these guys so they get the point and stop screwing us over on ammo , this is the kind of people that has made ammo prices high .
