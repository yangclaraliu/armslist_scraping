I have a custom 350 Magnum Weatherby I purchased from a retired gunsmith/dealer about 8 years ago I'm thinking of letting go. I have three 350's so it might be time to thin the herd.  It has a Medium Contour barrel.  Weatherby actions are NOT cheap to build on an this one is silky smooth (well over 1k to build this rifle).  The ONLY reason I am considering a swap is because I already have 3 of them.  It makes a really compact hunting rifle with some serious dropping power.  Anyway, here are the details:

350 Remington Magnum
Built on a Weatherby Vanguard Long Action
20"" Medium barrel
Factory Stock that I painted and cut to 13"" LOP
Factory rings and bases
Crisp 3lb trigger (tuned or aftermarket I'm not sure but darn good)
blueing, barrel and action in excellent condition (2 tiny nicks on the trigger guard but that's it)
I painted the stock about 6 years ago and a little bit of the paint has chipped. This is the only negative on the rifle I can think of.  

Burris 3-9x40 Fullfield Made in USA model (lifetime warranty)

$500 CASH for just the Rifle
$600 CASH for everything 
$650 Trade Value
FFT only within a reasonable distance

I believe this to be a great deal for someone.  Heck just the Barrel and Gunsmith work alone would cost you more than what I have priced it at.  Thanks!"

I like the belt, but have standardized on a nylon belt, so looking for a fellow shooter who likes a discount and can make use of a good-looking, sturdy gun belt to keep your pants up and easily and comfortably stabilize a full-size gun and holster.

 Chinese Type 53 Carbine with folding Bayonet date 1955 Era Built At Arsenal 26
 These rifles haven't been available for awhile due to china's tightly closed door policy and who knows how much longer they will be available! Get yours while you can!


  NC23GUNS offers you rare examples of Sino-Soviet cooperation from a bygone era! The Type 53 is a copy of the famous Russian M44 carbine, and like its predecessor is chambered in 7.62x54R. We were able to locate a cache of these carbines where they have been preserved for decades just waiting to be re-issued. Needless to say - these won't be around forever. If you are a collector of Mosin-Nagants, this is a fantastic opportunity to add a hard-to-find carbine to your collection. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 20.25"", Overall: 40"", Weight: 9 lbs. Condition:  FAIR TO Good.

After WWII the Soviet Union shared much of its weapons technology with its satellite countries, including the Mosin rifles and carbines. T53s were produced in the 1950s by China and other than minor differences these follow the same pattern as the post war Soviet M44s.

 These rifles haven't been available for awhile due to china's tightly closed door policy and who knows how much longer they will be available! Get yours while you can!

 After WWII the Soviet Union shared much of its weapons technology with its satellite countries, including the Mosin rifles and carbines. T53s were produced in the 1950s by China and other than minor differences these follow the same pattern as the post war Soviet M44s.

81,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2679081,For Sale:  THE BIGGEST REASON 22 LR IS SO HARD TO GET,"EVERYWHERE, Wisconsin, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, February 10, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have seen many people post many different blogs regarding the availability, or more appropriately the lack of availability of 22 LR. 
Like most people, I have blamed the resellers. But, the sad truth is that they are only a symptom of the actual problem.
22 LR production is in high gear, but where is it all going?  The retailers we used to buy from are not putting it on the shelf. Not because they are not receiving shipments, but because they can sell it for 4-5 times as much online. 
Even our favorite outdoor stores have figured out that if they sell it online, that they can advertise it at the same price as it would sell for off the shelf, but charge ammo surcharges or shipping and handling far in excess of the actual shipping costs.

Think about this for a minute. Why would you put a box on the shelf for $25.00 if you can sell it online for $99.99 and never have to listen to a customer complain about the price?

Item Description: I have a slightly used 40 cal PPS that I would like to trade for the 9mm version(trying to eliminate a caliber). It comes with 3 mags (1) 5rd, and (2) 6 rds. I have 342 rds of ammo to go with it, 47 rds of wolf ball and 295 rds of GA Arms 165 gr JHP. I do not have the box, docs, or extra back strap for this pistol, so you can keep yours when we trade. To make it more interesting for you, I will trade 2 for 3 on ammo. To make it an even #, my 342 rds for your 200 rds. With this ratio, I would like them to be some kind of bulk self defense loads similiar to GA Arms.

It's in excellent condition with less than 400 rd count. Comes with pachmayr grip  but otherwise is all the way it came from factory. It has all the goodies on it as you can see and also comes Wilson combat magazines. I'm selling it for less than normal because some ass&&@@ stole the box out of my shop thinkin gt he gun was in it but luckily it wasn't so I have not got the OEM box. The trigger pull is currently around 3lb and this gun is soo impressive to shoot. It blows my Kimber custom shop out of the water and the other better 1911 I have shot is a Wilson Combat. I'm looking for cash but I would entertain a cash/trade possibly. Some applicable trades with cash would be glock (Full size only) 9,.4,.45, Kimber  .45 or ???

Accessories include quick release picatinny weapon mount, TNVC weapon mountable ir torch, surefire spare battery carrier, surefire lanyard, original morovision head mount, and pelican weatherproof storage case.

The image is crystal clear with no scratches whatsoever on the lenses including the removable front additional sacrificial lens.  I've had this unit for around two years and estimate to have put about 50 hours on it.  It is still running the original battery to give you an idea of its use.

Those familiar with the pvs14 will find it to be noticeably smaller, lighter, and in my opinion, better image quality.

The torch is zeroable and can be focused.  It is extremely powerful and will easily illuminate targets at 200 yards.

Price is $2500 for everything

I may consider partial trade for a higher end 7.62 ak rifle, xdm 3.8 compact 40, springfield xds, other firearms and optics.  All that I can say is no.

The rifle has less than 100 rounds through it, the ONLY reason I am selling it is due to needing a new vehicle like asap. It is zero'd to 100 yards, and is a tack driver as long as the shooter does his/her part.

The DPMS also has Magpul STR butt stock, Magpul MOE handguard, and a Magpul bottom rail. I spent roughly $2200 on everything new. I am asking $1500

In the event someone wants to buy the rifle, I will need to see Florida DL, or a FL concealed weapons permit. If you only have the Florida driver license you must be 18 years or older. You will be ask at the time of sale if you're a prohibited person, purchasing a firearm while being on the prohibited is bad joo joo and if any part of the FTF deal seems sketchy I will cancel it. I strongly prefer to both exchange names, via looking at one anothers Drivers License. I am as pro second amendment as they come, they're TOO MANY rules on it already but I want to protect myself. You're more than welcome to take down my name, or have a look at my Florida concealed weapons permit.

He represented the gun with no problems in great condition for it's age. Recently when I brought it to my local gun shop to trade it in the shop owner noticed something wrong with the rear sight. The elevation screw hole was rigged with some sort of hardware store grade screw with the wrong thread pitch and was held in place with what appeared to be super glue or something similar. I don't want anyone else to get taken advantage of by Logan Boss. He did a good job of hiding, or should I say rigging the problem so it was hard to detect. Pretty sad that there are gun owners out there that will take advantage of fellow gun owners just to make a quick buck."

Practically brand new. I got it a couple of years ago and put probably less than 5 boxes (250 rnds) of ammo through it. It's been sitting in the safe ever since. It is in excellent condition besides a couple of bumps on the stock from things being moved in and out of the safe. The price is non-negotiable. These are getting hard to find and it is too good of a gun to give up for lowball offers. I'm asking $550, and no less, I'd rather just keep it. I can meet FTF for serious buyers or ship to your FFL for $550 + shipping costs.

I have a very nice S&W TRR8. It has a very low round count, comes with both rails (top and bottom) and performance center metal locking case. I also will include some 8 round moon clips as well.

Accessories include quick release picatinny weapon mount, TNVC weapon mountable ir torch, surefire spare battery carrier, surefire lanyard, original morovision head mount, and pelican weatherproof storage case.

The image is crystal clear with no scratches whatsoever on the lenses including the removable front additional sacrificial lens.  I've had this unit for around two years and estimate to have put about 50 hours on it.  It is still running the original battery to give you an idea of its use.

Those familiar with the pvs14 will find it to be noticeably smaller, lighter, and in my opinion, better image quality.

The torch is zeroable and can be focused.  It is extremely powerful and will easily illuminate targets at 200 yards.

Price is $2500 for everything

I may consider partial trade for a higher end 7.62 ak rifle other firearms and optics.  All that I can say is no.

This is a great AK for Home defense or just having some shooting fun. A very compact underfolder can easily fit in a backpack or under a car/truck seat. 16"" barrel with original wood furniture.

I bought this rifle brand new last year and made a few upgrades:

G2 Tapco Trigger 
RSA retainer plate (replaces shepard's hook in the reciver)
Apex Cheek Riser (no intereference with the grip in folding) This offers better cheek weld when using iron sights.

This Rifle also has the thicker, RPK style 1.5mm stamped receiver and as such carries a little more weight than a standard stamped AK.

I have fired approx 150 rounds or so, just enough to get it dialed in on the iron sights and then test accuracy. This is a stainless steel barrel, not chrome lined and thus more accurate than chrome lined but care must be givien if you decide to shoot corrosive Milsurp Ammo. I shot Bernaul Golden Bear ammo through this rifle. Not one misfeed or FTE.

I will include in the purchase a 10 round polymer magazine, a genuine Yugo Bayonet  $600 firm.

A real custum rifle, I have built several over the last 10 years.  I bought the parts to build two of them.  Built them and now I have two badass rifles that I don't need and I would prefer the money to build some more.  I built them to be super lightweight and they are without a doubt nicer than anything else you can buy for the money.

$1200 each, buy both I'll take $100 off.  Sale will be on the books, my treat if you meet me at 111 gun shop in Louisville.

It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster."
