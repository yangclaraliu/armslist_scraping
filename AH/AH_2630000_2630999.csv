My SR9c has the factory included Compact Mag (with or without pinky finger extension), and the Extended Mag (with full size hand grip extension).  Gun provides great options for the range, or for compact carry.  

I also have a $40 Galco Leather Holster, (2) Extra Compact Mags (paid $32.99 each), and an extra Extended Length Hand Grip Extension (paid $8.99). 

Realistically:  I have seen used Ruger 2R9c Pistols list for around $400-$440.  (NIB is $499 + Tax = $535 New)  I have $110+ in extra Mags and Holster.  My Total value is easily worth my asking price of $520.  (more like $550-$560 in value)  But I am asking a firm $410 for my SR9c + $110 for the extras.

I am open to reasonable offers (if sold fast), or I would trade for an SR45 Stainless Model.  Please, NO LOW BALLERS.  The extra Mags and Accessories I have are valued upgrades that most will want.  (Must be MN Resident)

Comes with a 6 and a 7 round magazine.

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

OVERVIEW: Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently. Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline. KEY FEATURES: - New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs. - Carbon steel magnum contour button rifled barrel - 22"" standard chamberings and 24"" on magnums - Pillar-bedded stock and free-floated barrel - SuperCell™ Recoil Pad - Model 783 accepts two Model 700™ front bases

OVERVIEW: Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently. Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline. KEY FEATURES: - New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs. - Carbon steel magnum contour button rifled barrel - 22"" standard chamberings and 24"" on magnums - Pillar-bedded stock and free-floated barrel - SuperCell™ Recoil Pad - Model 783 accepts two Model 700™ front bases

This holster was a gift for my wife to fit her new Kel-Tec P3-AT .380, however she has decided to change to a different handgun due to her strength issues to fully operate the slide on her Kel-Tec. This Crossbreed holster is listed as new and has never been carried or worn as you can tell by the photos.

Functions flawlessly, smooth and accurate after 300 rounds, not one FTF or FTE. 

I will post information about the piece from Kimber's website and post pics of the one I have for sale. 

I have added custom machined grips to the gun that were 75 dollars. It has a few scratches where I installed the grips, but NO WEAR at all and has been kept in a Safe. It's never been carried. 

I also added 2 top of the line Wilson Combat magazines which totaled 70 dollars. One was 40 and the other 30 dollars. 

It comes with the original grips  all the paperwork, hard shell case and take down tool. 

This gun would cost you over 1000 all said and done (Without the Wilson Combat Magazines and custom metal machines grips.)

I need a few hundred dollars to get my truck out of the service shop, so am looking for someone to trade me there .45 and add 300 to 200 dollars depending upon the type of .45 they have for trade. 

.45 XDS / FN / Beretta PX4 / Glock 30S / Preferred but will listen to all offers. 

It's rare you will find a Kimber for this amount of money - Sacrifice 850 dollars cash or trade for your gun with cash.

As you can see, my gun, the gun I wish to trade, comes with its original case, 2 magazines, a trigger lock, and all papers to include never-completed warranty registration card.  I only purchased this gun (on a whim) a little more than a month ago, just before Christmas, and I've never shot it.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our Exclusive ArmorLokt process seal the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail."

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible  for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the  warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance  under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which  you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's.

You are only responsible for return shipping       costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer  we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are   shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a       replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original  signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's.

I would've taken the scope off for the pictures but i have it zeroed at 300 yds so didn't want to take it off, plus this gives you an idea of what a scope looks like on this chassis.
this rifle is VERY accurate and has very low recoil due to the weight and good ergonomics of the chassis. its also very easy to disassemble for cleaning. 
the rifle is in excellent condition, rifling is very crisp, action is smooth and tight and bluing is excellent. over its lifetime, its only had about 200 rds through it, ive personally fired 30 through it for testing and zeroing and was very pleased. the chassis is also in excellent condition with no damage or wear of any kind.  
ive had this rifle for a little while, and while happy with it, i rarely have time to shoot it or use it at all, so looking to sell or trade for something more useful for me but if i dont any good offers, ill probably just keep until i can use it lol.

This has been my personal shooter since July and I have done a trigger adjustment  with replacement trigger spring(10oz), Recrown barrel, and have lapped and polished the bore with JB Cleaner and Polish.    

These are very good shooters for the money. It has been shot approximately 1500 rounds through the bore using both CCI Std Vel and SK Std Plus. 

Rifle is used as stated. And has some light bumps on the stock that were raised using steam and are barely noticable at this point. There are some scratches on the scope mount dovetail from an improper scope mount.

This rifle is an excellent shooter now. I just have bought too many rifles and am cutting back to only one Kimber from 5 originally.

Bolt and Rifle serial numbers match USGM0014xx.

It has exactly 15 rounds thru it from the sighting in process. (2 inches high at 50 yards) Now a well pump/ water softener problem at the house and I could stand to sell it.  I paid $729.99 for the gun $95.99 for the scope.  Of course a bolt action Ruger, it is accurate and stable.  Scope held Zero for the last 5 rounds once sighted in.  This is basically a brand new gun with all boxes and manuals for $200 less than it would cost from a gun store."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a BRAND NEW, factory fresh and hard to find CZ 455 Lux .22lr bolt-action rifle.  This beautiful rifle features adjustable iron sights, “Lux” pattern walnut stock, 20.6″ barrel, 5-round detachable magazine, and an adjustable trigger.

CZ USA 455 Lux Bolt-Action .22lr Rifle, 20.6 Inch Barrel, Walnut Stock, Detachable Magazine, Adjustable Sights- CZ 02101

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

The Lux model features adjustable iron sights and the “Lux” pattern stock that is designed to excel when used with open sights. A 5-round magazine is included.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh Kel-Tec SU-16B “Bravo” semi-auto 5.56/ .223 rifle in the hard to find Tan Cerakote finish.

Kel-Tec SU-16B Semi-Auto Sport Utility Rifle, 5.56 NATO/ .223 Remington, 16″ Barrel, Synthetic Stock, Cerakote Tan Finish, 10 Rds – Kel-Tec SU-16B-CK-TAN

The SU-16 is a gas operated, self loading rifle in .223 Remington caliber. Several unique features make the SU-16 a versatile sporting firearm. An integrated picatinny rail for mounting different sight systems. The forend folds down to form a bipod for increased accuracy. The stock can store spare magazines. Two 10 rounds, or one 20, or 30 rounds. The stock and trigger mechanism can be folded forward for added safety and to facilitate secure storage, or carry under extreme conditions. The SU-16 has a conventional gas piston operation and utilizes the proven M-16 breech locking system. It is compatible with standard M-16 magazines.

The “Bravo” model retains all the features of the original SU-16, such as integrated bipod, Picatinny rail, and rotating stock with magazine storage.However, the “Bravo” has a lighter and shorter barrel, about 8 oz. and 2.3.

The front and rear sight are hard coat anodized aluminum and adjustable for elevation and windage respectively. They are both removable and the front sight uses AR-15 style front sight posts. The SU-16B is not a replacement for the original SU-16 but a complement for customers that put a premium on light weight and compactness. The “Bravo” type sights can be purchased as a retrofit for SU-16 owners preferring the AR-15/M-16 front sight system.

Colt O6891 Mustang Pocketlite 380 ACP 2.75"" 6+1 Blk Poly Grip Nickel/Brushed SS

The Colt 380 Mustang XSP and Mustang Pocketlite are small and lightweight,
and they boast enhanced durability, reliability, and accuracy, making
either an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining
process, use of high-quality materials, and improvements in design make
these pistols two of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the
market. The slide and barrel are CNC-machined from solid bar stock for
precise tolerances, and with loaded magazines, each weighs less than one
pound. These pistols feature high profile sights, a commander-style hammer,
a solid aluminum trigger, and a lowered ejection port. The minimal weight
and length, short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs, and
firing pin safety block combine to make the Mustang pistols ideal for
personal protection.

It's a awesome gun and shoots great.  It comes with one clip, one box of FMJ and some self defense hollow points.  It also has night sights, this is truly one of the best full frame .45 I have ever shot.  call, email or text 316-708-969 four.  below are the specs from the H&K Website

HK45
The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. 1911

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:
Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
HK45 grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911’s profile
Common high-capacity metal magazines with a capacity of 10 rounds (for both HK45 and HK45 Compact models).
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and better accuracy

This is very accurate ammo and shoots a tighter pattern than FMJ's or HP's. This ammo is designed to cause maximum damage to tissue and shock to the organs without a straight thru shot. Anyone that has ever used this ammo knows what it is, and what it will do. Cheaper than Dirt gets over 1.56 per round plus shipping, so my price is firm. Face to face only, no shipping. Thanks."
