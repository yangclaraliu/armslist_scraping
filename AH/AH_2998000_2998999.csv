I bought this gun on 3/31/14 (date date on the test round shows 3/2/2014) and it has not had a single failure of any kind. It's accurate and shoots everything I've fed it. I want to conceal and carry but honestly, this gun, though accurate, is smaller than I want to get used to.  That's it.  I've grappled with the idea for a few weeks and finally decided that I will carry a compact instead of single stack.  Suits my large hands better.

Kind of a weird story on this gun, so bear with me on this.  

Bought this gun new in September, and it has been my carry gun since then.  The gun was originally a factory flat dark earth finish, which I did not like so I sold the original frame and bought a brand new, unfired, standard run of the mill black Glock 19 frame from Gun Broker.  What this means is that the upper (barrel/slide) do not share the same serial number as the lower.  Nothing wrong with this gun at all.  There was no catastrophic failure or anything crazy like that, I just didn't like the FDE frame.  The gun has 720 rounds fired through it and cleaned after every trip to the range and monthly otherwise.  It has very, very light holster wear and no other cosmetic issues.

I will include:
Factory box
Two 15-round magazines
Everything else that came with it (cleaning rod/brush, literature, factory fired shells, mag loader)


Main reason I am selling is because I have a Glock 17 and 26, and according to the boss I don't ""need"" three Glock 9mm's.  I can't really argue with it, and I would rather have money for ammo and bills than a third gun.  If money weren't an issue, I'd keep the gun."

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips.

Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required.

Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!"

Please note that this is NOT a M91/30, meaning no, you can't just go buy this for $129.99 at Fleet Farm. This is the very rare first iteration of the Mosin Nagant series of rifles. This thing is absolutely covered in proofing marks. Some of the stamps include the early Imperial ""Peter the Great"" style stamping on the barrel shank. Unfortunately, the royal seal has been scrubbed, which was common with these rifles. Also has the Provisional Black Powder proof stamp, the Point of Aim proof stamp, the early Izzy ""Bow & Arrow"" style stamp, and the early Tula ""Hammer"" stamp. There are a bunch of other stamps all over this gun that I can't identify, though it appears this rifle wasn't a Finnish capture, or if it was they didn't stamp it with the ""SA"" as they usually would. The bolt is non-matching to the barreled action, but the barrel, magazine, and stock all appear to match. The stock appears to have gone through some stock repairs throughout the years, but they appear to be arsenal repairs. There is some pitting on the underside of the barreled action and  a pencil-eraser sized spot on the bolt handle, but nothing that would make the rifle unsafe to fire, granted as with any old gun like this you should get it checked out by a smith before shooting it. The bore on it is absolutely stellar given its age. This rifle is absolutely gorgeous and I am in no hurry to get rid of it. I'm putting it out there because I already have a Mosin Nagant collection and am interested in something a little different. Considering the average M91/30 is selling for $130-200, I feel my asking price for this piece of history is fair. More interested in trading though. Cash or trade only, will not accept credit card or check of any sort. Will meet anywhere in the Altoona/Eau Claire area, but am not looking to ship. If you'd like any specific pictures or if you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an e-mail."

Absolutely no issues. Always goes bang when I pull the trigger, and hits what I aim at. Sighted in, cleaned, and ready for action.

Excellent weapon. Seems pricey for a 22, but you get what you pay for. Not a toy like the GSG-5 and other plastic copies of high-end guns. This is a solid firearm in a cheap, easy to find, low-recoil caliber. Fun plinker and practical tactical weapon in one package.

Just selling so I can try something new.

Ruger 5601 SR-762 SA 308/7.62 16.12"" 20+1 Syn Col 6pos Stk w/3 20rdMag Soft Case The Ruger SR-762 brings the downrange authority of the .308 cartridge to the popular SR-556 family of two-stage, piston-driven, AR-style rifles. The SR-762 is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform. The .308 Win/7.62 NATO cartridge is perfect for hunting medium and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. The SR-762 retains the features of the original SR556 that make it a solid performer among AR-style rifles. It comes with a Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat Anodized finish and a precision-filed, chrome-lined, cold-hammer-forged MilSpec 41V45 chrome-coly-vanadium steel barrel. It comes with a round, smooth-sided Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver that features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail. It also has a Hogue Monogrip pistol grip and comes with three 20-round Magpul PMAG magazines, a soft-sided case, and three finger-grooved rail covers.

This is an original Hi-Power clone with the oval on the frame, meaning it uses the original Hi-Power barrel locking system! A very rare pistol here in America with a GREAT reputation! Most Hi-Power clones don't use the original locking system. The oval on the frame is the indication that it is a TRUE Hi-Power!

This is truly a rare bird! It is a MkI Kareen Hi-Power, which you don't see many of. It has a hard chrome finish. It is the ONLY one with Hard Chrome finish I have ever seen, or been able to find online!!! It is a 100% numbers matching pistol. Slide, Barrel, and Frame all match! With the original Kareen plastic grips!

It is in the early B serial number block. Polished barrel with 6 crisp lands/grooves!

It is in very good shape. A few dings here and there with some holster wear. While most Kareens look like they have been run over repeatedly, this one just looks used. The hard chrome finish helps reduce the wear.

The magazine safety has been removed, with giving it the ability to fire without a magazine in, a free-dropping mag, and a 1000% better trigger pull. I have the magazine safety still, which will come with it, if you want to put it back in. Most that have had it removed don't keep it.

This is a 1958 Type 56 SKS, one of the early ones that were made under Russian supervision on Russian set-up equipment. These are of the highest quality of SKS's, with all milled parts.

Was a Century import. Thorough removed all of the cosmoline from the entire rifle and sweated the cosmoline out of the stock. Sanded and refinished the stock, and kept the bumps and bruises for character, and clean/oiled the metal. Overall in EXCELLENT shape! The stock has no cracks and the bluing is in great shape! A few small pits under the stock, but that's it.

I have the trigger and box tag from importation with the ORIGINAL test-fire case from the 50's! I took the butt plate completely off and the round was in the upper hole in the stock. Not the hole where the cleaning kit goes, but another hole that is not accessible with the butt plate on. A pretty unique find to have the original test-fire cartridge!

Mk-16 Jager Karabiner
5.56mm x 45 NATO Self-Regulating Gas Piston System
Jäger means “hunter” in German. In military contexts Jäger may be regarded as meaning “rifleman” or “fighter.” The mission of modern Jägers are akin to US Army Rangers. Their missions require speed, effectiveness, and rugged reliability in a wide variety of demanding conditions. That is exactly what the MK 16 Jäger Karabiner is built to deliver.

Mission:
The Mk-16 Jäger Karabiner was designed for military units, law enforcement officers or civilians looking for a high quality carbine with the benefits of a gas piston system.

Description:
SWORD’s “Critical Mission Grade Small Arms” have a series of enhancements created with the end-user in mind. Combined with precision manufacturing, the result is one of the most reliable, smoothest running carbines made today.

You can feel the quality difference the moment you first send rounds down range.

Proprietary Self-Regulating Gas Piston System
A key feature of the Mk-16 Jäger Karabiner is SWORD’s proprietary self-regulating gas system. The action is smooth and crisp. It is one of the most reliable carbines available anywhere.

Warfighter PC Compensator
SWORD’s unique Warfighter PC Compensator features a crowned tip for pain compliance applications. It features dual top ports that reduce muzzle flip and enhance the operator’s ability to stay on target. Porting exclusively on the top reduces the dirt and debris created by side ported compensators when shot in a prone position.

Lothar Walther Barrel
The free floated barrel runs cooler and provides greater accuracy when it counts. The Lothar Walther button rifled barrel coated in black nitride makes the barrel match accurate while being extremely durable. The 1:8 right hand twist allows the operator to shoot both heavy and light grain ammunition with precision

Full-Length Rail System
A full-length picatinny rail runs down the top. Additional rails at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions allow operators to integrate a full spectrum of accessories. Precision cut from aircraft grade aluminum, it provides and optimum length to weight ratio.

Exclusive Enhanced Upper
An examination of the CNC machined upper reveals a number of enhancements that skilled operators appreciate.

There are unique weight distribution sections integrated on the non-ejection port side. This provides better gun balance and dramatically reduces vibration. The result is better accuracy and SWORD’s distinctive smooth operation.

The magazine well is set at 5 degrees instead of the typical 15 degrees for certain and reliable reloads. It reduces magazine rock which reduces malfunctions. The increased chamfers on the magwell speeds magazine changes in low light and time sensitive situations.

The brass deflector has been reengineered so that brass is not just sent to the side, it is deflected forward. This eliminates other operators catching hot brass down which can be painful.

Precision Trigger and Integrated Enhanced Trigger Guard
The Nickel-Boron Advanced Combat Trigger is smooth and crisp. A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all types of ammunition.

The integrated enhanced trigger guard is enlarged to allow the use of cold weather gloves. It contours to match the trigger bottom to reduce gloves catching in the trigger action. By using a smooth, stable design, the hand injuries common with swing away trigger guards are avoided.

Rubber grips improve dexterity in all weather conditions and reduced hand fatigue.

Rugged upgraded Bolt Carrier Assembly
The  Nitride coated carrier assembly and a heavy duty buffer return spring, moves the assembly with speed and power. This allows the carbine to function in austere conditions when others would fail.



In total, the Jäger Karabiner provides exceptional performance and reliability that operators appreciate when they need to count on their equipment.

This gun has exactly 98 rounds through it, 7 mags, all cycled perfectly, of course! With the gun comes a midrange owb holster with 2 mag spots, and a very nice custom molded FNS 40 black leather shoulder holster from The Holster Store, bought just a month ago (also has 2 mag spots).  Also included are 50 rounds of American Eagle FMJ  180 grain .40, and 25 rounds of 165 grain Remington golden saber hollowpoints. 

This is a package deal and I won't sell separately, sorry! Gun is 99%, holsters are 100% and ammo isn't even a month old. Unfortunately the only thing missing is the FNH factory box (which is replaceable from FN if it matters to you, along with all the alternate back straps).  What's pictured is what you get! I will consider all fire arm related trades, although I'm almost certainly not looking to trade up for anything right now as I'm looking to fund a couple other things. Let me know what you have!

 I personally will never by another Remington product again, I am tired of this companies lies and false advertising of ""safe"" products.  When I bought my Remington 700 with the ""new"" trigger design, it was advertised as safer/better, apparently it is not!

Remington’s investigation determined that some XMP triggers might have excess bonding agent used in the assembly process, which could cause an unintentional discharge. Therefore, Remington is recalling ALL affected products to fully inspect and clean the XMP triggers with a specialized process. Remington has advised customers to immediately cease use of recalled rifles and return them to Remington free of charge. The rifles will be inspected, specialty cleaned, tested, and returned as soon as possible. Do not attempt to diagnose or repair recalled rifles. Remington established a dedicated website and toll-free hotline to help consumers determine whether their Model 700 or Model Seven rifle(s) are subject to recall:
• Website: http://xmprecall.remington.com



• Toll-Free Hotline: 1-REDACTED (Prompt #3 then Prompt #1) Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT.
The website and hotline provide guidance on returning recalled rifles free of charge. “Remington takes safety extremely seriously,” said Teddy Novin, Director of Public Affairs and Communications. “While we have the utmost confidence in the design of the XMP trigger, we are undertaking this recall in the interest of customer safety, to remove any potential excess bonding agent applied in the assembly process. We have established significant safety and technical resources to determine which rifles are affected and to minimize any risks. Our goal is to have every recalled firearm inspected, specialty cleaned, tested and returned as soon as possible.”

“We’re putting our customers and their safety first by voluntarily recalling all potentially affected rifles. We also want to take this opportunity to remind everyone of the Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety,” Novin concluded."

Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

This thing is scary accurate.

Sadly, I don't find many opportunities to shoot at the ranges that this rifle is made for and don't find myself with a place for still predator or varmint hunting (this rifle weighs about 12 pounds, so you really don't want to tote it around on your shoulder all day).

Halo V: SOLD

Combat Troodon: SOLD

UTX-70 Blackout: LNIB, never carried, used to cut, or sharpened. Double action automatic. Has been fired multiple times, no discernible wear in firing button area. It was a limited run item from Blade HQ. 300 were made and individually serial numbered, and I ended up with serial number 001. Double edged dagger blade in S35-VN steel. Blacked out finish, overall 10/10. $225 FIRM

Select Fire: LNIB, carried once and used for light cutting duty. Manual folder. Factory edge wasn't the greatest, so I have resharpened it to a razor edge. Has not been used since resharpening. Plain edge blade in S35-VN steel. Bead blast finish blade with black aluminum scales and carbon fiber inserts, overall 9/10. $225 FIRM

Sorry for the long ad, I just like to be as descriptive as possible. All the knives come with original packaging/accessories (The Select fire has a sheathe, Combat Troodon and UTX-70 have micro fiber bags). If you're interested in both, you can get both for $425 total.
I am interested in trades as well, or trades + cash. Looking for something in 9mm or .45, no junk guns please. Some examples of what I'm interested in are: Beretta M9/92fs, Springfield xd/xdm/xds series, or a decent 1911. Also interested in quality revolvers in .357 or .44 mag (S&W, Ruger, Colt).

Optic Specs:
The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios. Built around a rugged, ultra-bright daylight visible illumination system, the Mark 6 1-6x20mm offers a true ""both eyes open"" situational awareness at 1x, while also offering the ability to identify and engage targets out to several hundred meters at high magnification. The Mark 6 1-8 elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic.
The Mark 6 1-6 comes complete with LaRue QD mount (see the pull-down menu to the right), spare mounting screws with wrench, QD adjustment wrench, vial of blue Locktite and Instructions
