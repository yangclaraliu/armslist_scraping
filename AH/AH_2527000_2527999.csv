This derringer has original / correct hard rubber grips (one has a crack that has been repaired) and retains approximately 75-80% of its original blued finish. The action works flawlessly and is extremely crisp. The barrel locks up tighter than a drum.
That said....
PLEASE NOTE: The hinge was cracked and professionally repaired a loooong time ago. A very nice repair. Like I said it locks up tight and I wouldn't hesitate to fire it. Also, the bore is pitted and shows dark spots. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.
This gun has been priced accordingly for the condition and still has enough meat left on the bone for the buyer to make a healthy profit on resale. PRICE IS FIRM

Well, I am not a huge fan of handguns, more of a bolt gun guy myself, but I own 2 Glock 20s because lugging a .300 Win Mag around isn't always feasible and I like the performance of 10mm loads. Anyways, this family member heard me talking about (TEN)mm and saw a Hi Point in (NINE)mm and put two and two together and came up with God knows what, so yeah I have a 9mm handgun with no mags and no ammo, supposedly only fired like 50 times. I cleaned it out of boredom and I have to say it actually looks really clean and fresh, especially for a Hi Point.
He bought it for $215 so I am asking for 175 or best offer, anything reasonable. I am incredibly open to trades, anything related to hunting or camping or hiking. 5.56 or .300 Win Mag or 10mm ammo is always appreciated as well, as is pretty much anything else.
OH! Stranahans Snowflake edition whiskey. If someone has a new or even newish bottle of Stranahans snowflake I would be wicked interested in that, and would gladly add cash on my end as well.

This frame is the ""Made in Austria"" frame, not the US made frame. The US made guns are more common and will eventually take over now that Glock's facility in Georgia is up and running to make complete guns, not just assembling them anymore.  

The serial number begins with PDK, dating this pistol in May of 2010, the good years before the gun rush.  

The finish on the pistol is the standard black, not the ghost gray/parkerized type that scratches easy.

The pistol has an aftermarket ghost trigger connector......the person who is installed it is a Glock certified armorer and is a master firearms instructor.  This is a GREAT trigger pull! 

This pistol comes with an extra mag (3 mags total).  Gen 3's only come with 2 mags, I am throwing in an extra hi-cap mag.  

Glock is phasing out the generation 3 handguns for the generation 4.....this is a chance to get a brand new Gen 3 before they dry up.

For Sale is a new, truly unique, and unfired AR15 rifle.

This is the Marck 15 Hydra rifle from MGI Military in Maine, USA.  It is a modular weapons platform that allows you to change calibers while using the same basic rifle.

The caliber change can be completed without tools, due to the quick change design of the parts.  See how here: http://www.mgi-military.com/index.php?id=2&sub_id=24

The rifle is MIL-standard with the exception of the quick change parts - so you can use ANY standard rifle barrels, mags, fire control groups,bolt carrier groups, sights, that you want.

Simple as changing just a bolt and barrel on this system the user will be able to fire 7 plus calibers including .22 rimfire, .223/5.56, 6.5 grendel, 6.8 spc, .450 thumper, .458 socom, and the .50 beowulf.  In addition, with some of the specialized ""AR conversion magazines"" that are available for milspec ARs, you could shoot 7.62x39 Russian with just a bolt and barrel.

Further, MGI offers the following magwells for caliber conversion:  
https://www.mgi-military.com/store/index.php?category=9

Now that you know a little about the Marck 15 Hydra, let me tell you about mine:

This rifle was purchased as a complete MGI AR lower($499) and MGI QCB-D upper ($599) in January of last year.

MGI did not have any barrels in stock at the time of purchase, so I purchased a barrel, BCG, gas block, sights, etc to finish the rifle.

SPECS:
Mossberg OEM .223/5.56 AR Barrel, fully melonited inside and out. ($150)
DS ARMS gas block ($30)
Wilson Combat Stainless Steel gas tube ($20)
Overmolded Rubber ERGO Grip ($30)
Magpul MOE adjustable stock ($45)
Milspec front sight, rail mounted ($30)
Magpul MBUS folding rear sight ($50)
GG&G quick-disconnect sling plate, rail-mounted ($30)
KNS Precision QD sling swivel ($25)

I have about $1500 invested in this rifle.  That makes it slightly more expensive than the Hydra purchased direct from MGI, but consider the following:

Better Quality Barrel (MGI barrel is not chrome-lined nor is it melonited)
This gun comes with sights (Hydra does not)
Ergo Grip (MGI is a standard crappy AR grip)
Magpul Stock (MGI comes with crappy plastic adjustable)
$50 worth of sling hardware
No shipping/handling/transfer fees

I live near Traverse City.  I will drive to you a reasonable distance.  I prefer to meet in the parking lot of a firearms store, or other public place for transfer.

CASH ONLY.

I would prefer to shoot a mag of ammo thru the rifle to function test before selling - but I will let you decide if you want it in unfired condition or not.

Contact me thru Armslist to get phone number for questions.

PS - it's not a COLT, but they don't list MGI as a Manufacturer......

PSS - the mag in the pictures is NOT included with the rifle.  If you do not have any of your own mags I do have a 10rd ACS mag I will include for 10 bucks."

This is a semi-auto version of the PPS-43, which is a Polish submachine gun. It was made in Radom, Poland and imported into the US by IO Inc. These pistols are no longer being manufactured or imported, so they are becoming harder and harder to find.

My pistol is BRAND NEW AND UNFIRED. It has been sitting in my safe since I purchased it in September of 2013. It will come with 4 35-round magazines, and has an upgraded Blackjack polyurethane recoil buffer to replace the normal oil-soaked leather buffer that is known to disintegrate after only a few magazines.

This pistol can be registered as an SBR with a Form 1, and with some simple work and a spare PPS-43 parts kit which are widely available online, the stock can be swapped out with a working model to create a really unique SBR. As it stands now the button used to open the stock has been fixed shut to comply with NFA and ATF laws in order to make this a pistol. Or, it can be left as is for a really fun pistol that shoots a powerful round.

Looking to sell this brand new, unfired pistol along with 4 magazines, all in the original factory box, for $400.

The base rifle is a Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD chambered in .308 Winchester. It originally came in a black Hogue overmold stock, but I have since replaced the stock with an Accuracy International Chassis System v. 1.5 in FDE. This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it, and I am selling it simply because I don't have a place to shoot it to its maximum potential. Everything on this rifle is like-new. The parts list on this rifle is as follows:

- Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD .308
- Accuracy International AICS 1.5 FDE
- SWFA SS 10x42M Tactical Scope
- TPS 30mm TSR Low Aluminum Scope Rings
- Weaver 20 MOA Base
- AAC Blackout Flash Hider
- Atlas BT10-NC Bipod
- Atlas Bipod Spigot Adapter for AICS
- Badger Ordnance Tactical Bolt Knob (this was installed by Badger Ordnance themselves, so it was done by professionals)
- Accuracy Interational Adjustable Cheekrest Thumbscrews
- Butler Creek Scope Caps
- 3x 5-round Accuracy International Detachable Magazines

This rifle is easily capable of 1/4 MOA with the right shooter and ammo. I will include all of the above, along with the original Hogue stock and original factory box/documentation. I will also gladly provide more pictures of any aspect of the rifle to serious buyers, since Armslist only allows 3 pictures to be uploaded.

There are over $2600 in parts in this rifle.

I am asking $2200 OBRO.

I will ONLY sell to NH residents with a valid NH Driver's License and Conceal Carry permit, which must be shown at time of sale. CASH ONLY, NO TRADES. LOCAL SALE ONLY, I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT SHIP.

It was owned for decades by an old farmer who fired a couple magazines through it when he first bought it, then stored it, oiled.  It has less than 100 rounds through it, and you can tell by how clean it is.  No carbon anywhere.  This is legitimate 100% COLT (the real deal holyfield, not Oly, not Bushmaster, but the Cadillac of them all-  COLT.)  Triangular handguards, pencil thin barrel, slab side magazine well, no forward assist, giant pin.  
This is the gun Arnold uses in the original Predator movie.  (Billy uses one also.)

This rifle will last well past your lifetime, and here is the best part:

I have a letter from Colt, confirming the production date according to the serial number, and it is indeed a preban.  Thus, this rifle is LEGAL to buy/sell/transfer within Connecticut.....for now.
January 2014, the AR15 landscape has changed.  Of course, since April 4, 2013, NO postban AR-15s could have been legally purchased or transferred within CT.  And, as of December 31, 2013, all postbans bought before 4/4/13 were required to be registered as Assault Weapons with the state of CT.

So, what is your option if you want an AR-15?  Well, you have two options:
Never buy one legally in Connecticut again, or 
Buy a preban AR, with NO NEED to register it, plus you can put as many modifications on it as you like, ALL 100% LEGAL!  What types of modifications? These:
*Collapsable or folding stock
*Pistol grip
*Flash suppressor
*Bayonet lug (and bayonet)
and more.

There is serious rumor and definite talk that this so-called loophole will be closed in the next legislative session (late January, this month!) so that law abiding CT citizens may no longer even purchase preban AR15s!

Good luck finding an FFL or gun shop to accept an out of state transfer of a preban.  Even the stores which were doing so, are no longer doing so in 2014.....

I live in the Bridgeport-New Haven area, and I am willing to travel.

This rifle will be sold according to all applicable rules and laws.  I will NOT sell this rifle out of state....it MUST stay in Connecticut!  So, Nutmeggers only need apply.

Email me, or text me at 2o3 -8one4 - 4four2five

I have more photos, if you like, just email me.  (Limited to three here on Armslist.)

This rifle will accept both 223 Remington and 5.56 NATO rounds.


I recently put 5 rounds through her during a trip to the range.  It was freezing cold out, with a driving, almost sideways rain.  Shooting from under the cover of the outdoor range roof, in the dark (there were some lights on pointed downrange, but it was still very dark out at 5:15pm in the rain!), I put all five shots on an 18 inch target at 70 yards, using iron sights, while standing!"

This is NOT the ultimate trap and skeet gun handed down from the gods on high.  Rather this is just an inexpensive good condition clean old gun and nearly full case of ammo.  So questions about chokes, lengths of pull, etc...  will go ignored and unanswered.  This gun would be most useful at keeping rabbits out of your garden, or carrying afield for general blasting duties.  Or perhaps build that tacky floor lamp for the cabin that you always wanted (I am not here to judge).  The price for this good old gun is $300 firm FTF, includes 248 shells.  If you are unsure of the definition of FIRM, please look it up and save us both some grief.     Thanks for your consideration.  Have a great day.

I have for sale an older Remington Model 700 BDL in 6mm Remington, Serial No 6646xxx.  It has a 24-inch Heavy Varmint or “bull” barrel.  I purchased this rifle used in 1999 because I “thought” I needed another varmint rifle, and these factory heavy-barreled rifles are somewhat hard to come by.  I no longer do much varmint hunting, and I still have a couple of good .22 cal rifles, so I am liquidating the excess.

This rifle is all original, except that the action has been pillar-bedded, the barrel free floated, and it wears a Pachmayr recoil pad.  The stock shows normal signs of use, i.e. the usual dings, dents, scuffs, scratches, etc. The bluing is in overall very nice condition.  The action is smooth, the safety works fine, and the trigger has been adjusted to a smooth, light pull, with virtually no creep.  The bore is smooth and shiny. 

The rifle comes with Burris 2-piece scope mounts and Burris Signature Series rings installed.  The scope shown in the photos is NOT included.

Sadly, the front end of the trigger guard is broken where the trap door latch is located (see bottom photo).  The latch is still functional, but the trigger guard assembly should probably be repaired.  I usually just loaded one round at a time and had no problem with it.

This rifle will routinely shoot 5-shot groups under 1-inch at 100 yards using Nosler 70 gr Ballistic Tip handloads.  I have probably fired only 200 rounds through it since I bought it.  It is a good shooter for sure!  I just don’t have use for it anymore.

The asking price is $750.  I will consider any reasonable offer. (Again....the scope is NOT included)

This is a CASH deal, no personal checks or Money Orders.  I will also accept PayPal plus 3 percent of the selling price to cover the transaction fees.  I prefer to sell to a fellow Arizona resident, because no FFL transfer in required, but will sell to an out-of-state buyer if he pays for all shipping and FFL transfer fees.

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I WILL NOT HAGGLE, the listed PRICE is 'THE' PRICE, and NO I DON'T WANT YOUR S****Y TRADE!.  I have calculated current market value for every item I have on here, what I paid for the items, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I WILL NOT HAGGLE, the listed PRICE is 'THE' PRICE, and NO I DON'T WANT YOUR S****Y TRADE!.  I have calculated current market value for every item I have on here, what I paid for the items, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

This beauty is in extraordinary condition for it's age as evidenced by the pictures. Wood and bluing are terrific, with only very minor flaws. The bore is spotless. The only fly in the ointment is that I do not believe the barrel is original, as the only markings are ""12 gauge full"" and ""SP"" in an oval. This appears to be a Savage model 720 barrel. The Savage barrel was commonly interchanged with the Remington barrels in the olden days. The bead on the barrel has been replaced with a more modern style as shown; and the actual inside diamter at the end is .724"", which corresponds with a ""skeet"" choke.  This baby would make one fine Skeet or Sporting Clays gun!  You will be hard pressed to find a nicer example of this Shotgun. Please feel free to e-mail with any questions you may have. Will ship to out-of state FFL for $35 fee.  More pics available upon request.  Serious buyers only may text me at REDACTED."

A 5mm multi-coated Pyrex® window protects its lamp assembly, and the window itself is protected from dust, mud, and heavy particle impact by a swing-open infrared cover for use with night vision devices (NVDs)

The HellFighter's rugged high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is powered by one or two military BA-5590 batteries (not included) or from a 12-volt auto battery, and is virtually immune to failure from recoil, vibration, or impact since it has no filament to break or burn out.

I do not have the time to take this out as much as I had anticipated. It is a stunning conversion in a popular NATO cartridge and will devour any type of ammo you feed it. This rifle features a like new 16'' barrel with a HK muzzle device, The front sight assembly was removed and placed on the gas block with an HK front sight, The rear sight was moved from the gas block to the receiver cover providing an extended field of view. This rifle also features a KREBS extended tactical safety lever. The rear stock was converted with a folding stock mechanism and an ACE folding stock. The pistol grip was upgraded as well. The entire rifle was duracoated in glossy black. This rifle was professionally converted, as I have no gunsmithing skills myself. I just had the ideas. Comes with 2x 25rd surefire magazines. The rifle functions 100% and never had any issues. This rifle would make an excellent all around rifle, perfect for the close fight and capable enough to accurately engage deep targets with ease.

*SERIOUS Buyers only/Disclaimer Section*
This section is reserved on all my listings for the ""don't be stupid"" section.  

First, I WILL NOT HAGGLE, the listed PRICE is 'THE' PRICE, and NO I DON'T WANT YOUR S****Y TRADE!.  I have calculated current market value for every item I have on here, what I paid for the items, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."
