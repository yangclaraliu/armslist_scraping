She is completely re-built custom and shoots the powerful MACH 2 HM2 round on the semi-auto Ruger 10/22 platform using standard Ruger 10/22 magazines!  Professionally re-built with an E.Arthur Brown heavy stainless steel barrel, heavy bolt and compensator.  Truly a one of a kind Ruger.  

For those that may not know, HM2 17 caliber rounds fit in standard Ruger 10/22 magazines but this round packs a lot more powder, speed and power.  It truly is a MACH 2 round - hence the HM2 designation and the need for ""re-inforcement"" inside the standard Ruger 10/22 housing to handle the additional pressure.

Only had two 50rd boxes left so I snatched them both. These are supposedly some of the top 22LR hunting rounds you can get and lately seem to be treated and revered like gold. The cheapest individual 50rd box on gunbroker is $14.49 each at time of posting. 

Plain wood stock ruger 10/22 with a small Tasco 3-7 x 20 scope that's sighted in to 50yds. Fired 50 rounds of CCI standard velocity (flawlessly) through it to sight the scope then cleaned and stored. Was gonna be my raccoon gun but can't get a dog at this time so the rifle kinda is useless to me so might as well sell to fund the PTR91 I'm getting my dad for Christmas. Comes with one ruger 10rd BX-1 factory mag and one ruger BX-25 factory mag. Still have original box. Have 550 rds of 22lr ammunition that goes with. NOT splitting this up. Package deal. No use for gun without ammo/magazines and vice versa. 
Ammo that goes with is as stated:
100rds of CCI stingers copper plated HP, 1640 FPS 32gr
300rds (25 of which are loaded into the BX-25) of CCI mini mag HP 36gr
100rds of CCI mini mags round nose 40gr
100rds of Winchester T22 lead round nose 40gr
50rds of CCI standard velocity lead round nose  40gr

Asking $300 even. With Christmas coming up this would be a nice little full package present. And with ammo it's like getting that special someone that new toy WITH batteries, but batteries are easy to find. Quality 22LR ammunition is kinda hard to stumble across with all the people buying it up just to sell and line their pockets which of course is a major contributor  to the current false 22LR ammo shortage. There's plenty out there, just getting bought mostly by people who don't even own a 22 firearm."

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

832,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2305832,"For Sale:  Gewehr 88, 1888 German comission rifle, Gew 88","Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 6, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This classic representative of the first German smokeless powder rifle, the German 1888 commission rifle, is for sale. It is in wonderful shape for its age, and it shoots straight as an arrow. This is the finest Gew 88 that I have ever personally seen. 

This rifle was a battlefield capture at some point. It does not have a matching bolt, but it does have a matching barrel, receiver, and stock. I have had the headspace checked, and it is well within specification. It is a .318 bore rifle, with the S and DOT marks on the receiver. It comes with a reproduction period correct sling, the hoop to parade mount the sling, and an original cleaning rod. 

This antique rifle is complete, I have shot it, and the bore is in good shape. You can still buy ammo for it, which is known as the 7.92x57J. This rifle does not shoot modern Mauser ammo, because modern 7.92x57mm Mauser ammo has a .323 diameter bullet. 

This would make a heck of a wall hanger, but I really do encourage you to shoot it. It is easily capable of taking large game, and the trigger has a smooth break right around 3lbs. The crown is in great shape, and the action operates smoothly. This is as fine a rifle as you can find for 300 bucks. It was made in 1891 by Lowes in Berlin, Germany.

It comes complete, with a silicone gun sock, the sling, the parade loop, the cleaning rod, and several brass stripper clips. I have more pictures if you need them. You won't be disappointed. I will also consider trades. I like other curio and relic guns, hand guns, etc. I do not accept anything non-gun related in trades, and I appreciate your time."

The new 22PLY has been redesigned with sleek new lines and a polymer frame—weighing in at a mere 10.8 ounces. Both feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round. If light and fast are your priorities, the 22PLY is the pistol for you. Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

AMERICA'S HUNTERS --- 
Pretty Amazing!
http://www.d21c.com/frecs/holdys/Hunter.gif
 The world's largest army... America 's hunters! 
I had never thought about 
 this...
hunter
 A blogger added up the deer license sales in just a 
 handful of states and 
arrived at a striking 
 conclusion:

http://www.poorwilliam.net/gif-ani/hunter_shooting_shotgun_lg_clr.gif

There were over 600,000 hunters 
this season in the state of Wisconsin .. 
Allow me to restate that number: 
 600,000

 Over the last several months, 
Wisconsin's hunters became the eighth largest army in 
 the world.
http://www.bucklakehuntingclub.com/treestand_hunter_hg_blksmall.gif
 More men under arms than in Iran .

 More than France and Germany combined.

 These men deployed to 
 the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin , to hunt with 
 firearms, and no one was killed.
http://www.sd84.k12.id.us/SMS/departments/Ross/images/hunting.gif
 That number pales in comparison to the 750,000 who hunted the woods of Pennsylvania and 
Michigan's 700,000 hunters, 
all of whom have now returned home safely. 
Toss in a quarter million hunters 
 in West Virginia and it literally establishes the fact that the 
 hunters of those four states alone 
would comprise the largest army in the world. 
And then add in the total number of hunters in the other 46 states. 
It's millions more.

 The point?
 America will forever be safe 
from foreign invasion with that 
 kind of home-grown firepower. Hunting... 
it's not just a way to fill the freezer. It's a matter of national 
 security.

 ********************http://www.thehowardside.com/images/Photo%20Gp%201/huntingpic.gif*******************
 That's why all enemies, 
foreign and domestic, 
want to see us 
 disarmed.
 Food for thought, 
when next we consider gun control. 
 Overall it's true, 
so if we disregard some assumptions that hunters
 don't possess the same skills as soldiers, the question 
 would still remain... 
What army of 2 million would want to face 30, 40, 50 million armed citizens???

 (IF YOU AGREE, AS I DO, PASS IT ON, I FEEL GOOD THAT I HAVE AN ARMY OF MILLIONS WHO WOULD PROTECT OUR LAND AND I SURE DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TAKING CONTROL OF THE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS)
http://www.electric-bass.org/GIFS/MaleFemaleHunters.gif
For the sake of our freedom, 
 don't ever allow gun control 
 or confiscation of guns.
And remember, of that 30, 40, or 50 milion hunters the majority of them are ex-military!"

Legendary for rugged, reliable service. Utilized by law enforcement for many years before the trend towards polymer pistols.

Includes: original manual, plastic hard case, TWO fourteen round stainless factory mags, TWO ten round stainless factory mags, and TWO SEVENTEEN ROUND Mec Gar mags!! That is a shooter's package total of SIX mags, folks.

This pistol is in impeccable condition, sirs and ladies. No rust, pitting, easily close to 100% . It has been well cared for and maintained.

Features ambi safety, raised style sights, and the superior flared/squared trigger guard. Black plastic textured grips. This is a real gun.

ALL STEEL! No aluminum, no plastics. This is a gun made to truly weather the centuries! Thus, it handles recoil very well. The use of a barrel bushing on this model makes it a tack driver. It is much like a stainless 1911, but without all the jamming issues and with more than double the capacity. Handles FMJ and JHP with ease. You will be handing this weapon down to your children's children's children.

Asking 600, or best offer.

I am only selling this firearm because the ammo is difficult to find and expensive now. With six mags, I burn through my supply too quickly. However, this is a great home defense package, and offers a great deal of firepower in a package superior, in my opinion, to any polymer Glocks, or aluminum Berettas with known locking block issues."
