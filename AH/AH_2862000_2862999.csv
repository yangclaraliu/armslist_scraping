The XDS-9 4.0"" is an extended slide version of the wildly popular XDS series of pistols, offering improved accuracy due to the longer sight radius, increased muzzle velocity, and slightly reduced felt recoil as a result of the marginally increased length and weight. Additionally, an extended 9 round magazine is included for a ""full size"" feel.

This pistol has a sleek, slim black polymer frame and black finished Forged Steel slide. The XDS features an ultra-slim design only 1"" thick, making it easily concealable. The USA (Ultra Safe Assurance) Trigger System guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. A Loaded Chamber Indicator and grip safety increase safety and improve handling confidence. An integrated Picatinny rail makes attaching accessories such as tactical lights or laser quick and easy. Low profile snag-free sights, including a fiber optic front sight, are holster friendly. This pistol ships in a Springfield Armory branded padded hard case, and includes one 7 and one 9 round magazines, speed loader, magazine holder, and paddle style holster.

Field grade M1 Garand in .30 (civilian .30-06). Springfield Armory receiver, dated from May 1942. Springfield barrel dated 1951. Good strong bore. Trigger group and op rod are Winchester; this is typical of a USGI re-arsenaled rifle. Stock marked RRA (Red River Arsenal work done after WWII). Wood is walnut and has seen some use - pics were taken before cleaning and a light coat of BLO (proper finish for this rifle). Stock looks nicer in person, but I want you to see all the marks and wear. Comes with certificate of authenticity, hard case, 4 (four) 8-round clips (yes, clips), user guide, chamber flag.

With re-importation of these no longer allowed from South Korea and other allies, these are getting harder and harder to find, especially the WWII vintage rifles.

INFORMATION FROM WIKIPEDIA

When the LWRC Six8 was being developed, Alliant Techsystems was contracted to develop a new 6.8x43mm round for the weapon. Unlike smaller commercial firms, ATK is a large ammunition supplier that delivers products for the U.S. Army, so it had large resources and manufacturing capabilities at its disposal. Commercial cartridges varied in case capacity and thickness, but LWRC wanted a thick and durable case for military uses. A 90 gr (5.8 g) load was developed specifically for a high muzzle velocity and low felt recoil from the Six8's 8.5 in (220 mm) barrel. Effective range would be over 300 yd (274 m) and the bullet would still have enough energy to penetrate intermediate barriers. Three 90 gr loads were constructed for testing that included Gold Dot, Monolithic Hollow Point, and FMJ. The Gold Dot bullet was selected with a .035 in (0.89 mm) jacket and a bonded core. The propellant was designed for reduced muzzle flash stable performance at temperatures between -29.2 to 125.6 degrees F. Muzzle velocity averaged at a 200 ft/s (61 m/s) difference at the required temperature extremes from the 8.5 in barrel. From a 24 in (610 mm) barrel, the round produced a group of 1.56 in (40 mm) at 200 yd (183 m).[16]

This 9MM is one of the excellent S&W M&P9 C.O.R.E. Pro Series Optic Ready pistol with the outstanding Leupold DeltaPoint reflex sights and comes in its original hard case with all papers, including warranty card as well as fired cartridge case, cable lock, extra magazine (both are 17 rounds) optic sight base adaptors and no-optic filler plate with hardware, and 3 Interchangeable palm swell grip sizes (one custom stippled, two stock). The included mags ARE NOT THE EXTENDED MAGS in the photos!! It features an Ambidextrous Slide Stop, Reversible Magazine Catch, Universal Accessory Rail, Embedded Stainless Steel Rigid Chassis System and Black Melonite® Finish Yielding a Surface Hardness of 68 HRc. 

The Leupold DeltaPoint reflex sight is one of the very best of the type made in the world and with advanced technology that turns it on when it’s moved and off when it has been completely still for a few minutes.  This is the 3.5 MOA Illuminated Dot.

The pistol is in like new condition. The finish is MINT, of course, as it was just done so it retains 100% finish with no scratches, dings or rub marks while the Leupold sight is in perfect, new condition. All accessory parts and magazines are in new condition.

This is a great pistol with all the extras and in a condition that is almost impossible to top...Until you see the custom work!!

I have had the frame custom stippled by Chris Damato at Damato Custom Stippling. He also tuned the trigger which included a reduction in over-travel, reset and the overall trigger weight was reduced to 4.5lbs.

I sent the slide to Doug Presson at DP Custom Works. He completed the side and top window cuts, removed the engraving and then had the slide Cerakoted in graphite black.

Finally, I sent the barrel to MG Precision Arms to have it coated in AlTiN (Aluminum Titanium) making it 100 times harder than stock and changing the color to silver.

Overall, there is over $1,500 in this pistol and it is beautiful!

The MSRP of the pistol is $609. The cost of the Leupold Deltapoint is $399.

The slide, frame, trigger, and barrel work I had done cost over $500.

This is an awesome deal trust me. Each magazine will run you $34 and the Laserlyte laser sight is valued at about $80 on its own. So I am pretty firm about this price as the whole package together was $518 plus tax.

Anyone that knows anything about this weapon can more than likely tell you that it is a decent weapon. This pistol has never been fired or carried.

Little fun fact. Did you know that Glock sued Smith & Wesson over this weapon since its design is almost identical to a Glock?

 Remington 597 Semi-Auto .22LR Rifle w/20″ Barrel, 10rd Cap, Gray Synthetic Stock, Scope & Mounts Included

The Model 597 with scope starts with the proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy. Of course, Remington didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull (that stays that way). To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot ‘hold open’ magazine feature and the patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

Please note the right side hammer is missing. The Grade 2 production started about 1875, before the grading system was adopted and it sold for $80 (a 80 Dollar grade). As Parker introduced the named grades they named Grade 2 guns E, F, G, H, EH and GH. The GH and EH describes Grade 2 hammerless Parkers, the other names describe Grade 2 hammer guns. These names were based on various gauge and stock configurations. It was a popular gun for the owner that wanted a gun with more adornment that the average gun and was willing to pay about $20 more for a gun that looked better and was well balanced. The Grade 2 had a higher quality of American walnut which has some figure. Most Grade 2 guns have Damascus or Parker Special Steel barrels. They were significantly better engraved than the lower grade guns. Quail, ducks, snipe and woodcock are common figures in the engraving of the frame sides and bottom; the forend latch and screw heads are also engraved. The checkering was deeper and finer than lower grade Parkers. After about 1880, the hard rubber dogs head butt plate and a white metal shied behind the top tang became standard on the Grade 2. Because of the added embellishments, it was very popular with Parker customers. Ejectors were an option on GH grade. These guns with ejectors (GHE) are desirable to collectors and can add as much as 50% to their collector value.

It is a CMP Special which means that when the CMP received it they replaced the stock and barrel with brand new ones, replaced any worn parts with originals and made it look great. With these you don't really have to worry about parts matching or barrel wear affecting the value like it would on a collectors piece. Rifling is sharp, bore is shing, and free of wear. They are a great gun for someone who wants to shoot an M1 Garand because the cheap shooter grade ones aren't going to be this nice and you don't have to worry about devaluing a nice purely collectors piece.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)
