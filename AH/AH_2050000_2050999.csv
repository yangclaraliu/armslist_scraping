It's barely a month old and only has 200 rounds through it, all which were trouble free.  I ended up buying a P227 due to the wider grips and just want to find a good home for this amazing pistol.  This pistol is by far the most accurate pistol I've ever shot.  Comes with box, lock, manual, additional o-rings for the barrel, small and medium backstraps (HK doesn't make a large) and (2) 10 round magazines.

This is a .45 caliber pistol.  It can be used in DA/SA, or locked and cocked.  Lever on side is both a safety and a decocker.

I have been planning on having some things done to my FSN but then realized the next owner might not have the same taste as I do regarding upgrades, so I left it stock.

The gun comes in the original case which includes 3 - 17 round magazines, gun lock, manual and test shot casing.
The gun itself is a Striker Fire (Just like a Glock) Has night sites glow in the dark. It has an ambidextrous slide release, magazine release and safety. Also comes with two back straps, 1 is flat & slimmer for a smaller grip and the other is rounded and slightly bigger for a larger grip.

Thank you.

(1) Taurus PT92 AF 9mm, all metal construction built in accessory rail, , very few rounds down the barrel. Finish is in99% condition, this is one of the newer models. Da/Sa, decocker, extremely easy to take down. Includes 2 17 round mags and a 16 round magazine, two keys for Taurus's internal safety lock. Put the key in the lock (located on the frame) and turn the key- makes the gun safe, can't be cocked or fired. Pretty nice feature, especially of you have kids. Can include up to 350 rounds of Remington fmj. Also has original box. 

(2). Cz52- 7.62*25mm tokarev, excellent condition. This thing is a TACK DRIVER! Very fun to shoot, ammo is cheap, especially the surplus ammo. I have two of these or I wouldn't be getting rid of it. SA, includes two factory magazines, leather holster with magazine pouch. Barrel is in good condition, very accurate even up to a couple hundred yarda- sounds crazy but its true. The finish is in basically perfect condition, has had trigger work. This is a great target pistol and great for plinking"

It has about every option offered by SSK, including the diamond contour barrel. It is extremely accurate at long range. I was told by one of Grover's friends that he took a number of animals with it and it was one of his favorites for javelina. I bought it from Grover's family after he died and the configuration is exactly as Grover left it. The gun is in excellent condition, wit has no scratches, nicks, and dings in the finish here and there. The rear scope bell has a small ding at the top (see pic), but it doesn't affect use of the scope at all. The scope is a Bausch and Lomb 2-6 power and is an excellent scope. No Trade"

This is a great shooting rifle with moderate recoil, about as to be expected from a little 300 win mag. my 5' 2"" 105lbs wife loves shooting it. we have taken Deer, Black Bear, Hogs, and even little varmints with this rifle and no one ran anywhere.  very hard hitting round that is surprisingly accurate. zero at 200 yard it with be 1.5 high at 100 and 12.6 low at 300 with a 450 gr. the 325 has a better trajectory with much less drop at 300. I have done a 1.25"" group at 100 yards. (not bad for a 458 caliber)

First up, Saiga AK in 5.45x39. Got it in trade awhile ago. Second owner. Round count unknown, but I put it at roughly 200 rounds down the pipe. Weapon has been properly converted, and has bullet guide installed. Replaced the crappy tapco stock and pistol grip with furniture from kvar (still have those parts of you want them though). 2 loaded tapco mags, and one brown Bulgarian (?) surplus mag included.

Second, lnib Pap pistol. Chambered in 762x39. Comes with 2 loaded mags, at least one is the bolt hold open mag. Box and docs included. Has echo nine three sling mount and 4 piece muzzlebreak. 

I'm looking to trade either separately or both as a package for something different. I'm willing to do two for one  depending on offers. I'm not interested in pump shotguns, 22's,  Ar's (unless they're colts), or broken down cars. Let's be reasonable with offers. I have receipts for what I paid for everything. These guns aren't crappy century wasrs, these are good quality weapons. As such, I will only entertain quality trade offers.
I love hk/hk clone rifles and carbines. Aug clones, fn rifles, also are high on the list, but shoot me an offer. Worst I can say is no. 
BoS required. Trade only with va resident not prohibited from owning a firearm. Have to be 21 or older for the pap because its classified as a handgun. Also, I'll want to take a peek at va dl, and voter reg or chp."

It's throat gauge is less than one and the rifling is excellent, which means it's rarely been used. The stock has virtually no dings and matches the receiver. This is definitely a collectible model, although it shoots beautifully if you are so inclined (as I hope you are). The pictures do not do this rifle justice.

263,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2050263,"For Sale:  Tactical Assault Gear Advanced Loadout Bag, A-TACS, NEW","Rochester, Detroit, Michigan",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 28, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a New without Tags, TAG Large Advanced Loadout Bag in A-TACS. This bag is amazing, huge, and built like a tank. I've had it for about 6 months, and it has been sitting in my basement unused. It's probably too large for my intended need, so I figured I would post it for sale here. This bag retails for. $699 new!  $400. I would consider trade for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 17, or 19.  Prefer local deal, but I will ship at your cost. This bag is huge! Please call or text Mike @ REDACTED

The Advanced Load Out Bag is the largest and one of the most sophisticated pieces of gear TAG manufactures. After reviewing every other rolling bag on the market and using operator input we quickly realized that the problem was with the frame. TAG attacked this problem by not using a cheap off the shelf plastic luggage roller that is typically bolted to the bag. We worked with a custom metal shop and had them use 6061 Aircraft grade aluminum with thick tube walls to prevent the frame form bending or warping under heavy loads. The frame has wheel wells covering the wheels. This helps supports the weight of the bag when rolling and acts as a guard in case something punctures the bag from the inside, so the bag keeps rolling. The frame was then powder coated to ensure long lasting exposure resistance to the elements. We use a one piece solid axel for the wheels. The wheels are over sizes roller blade wheels. Rubber bumpers on the bottom of the frame are riveted in place. The frame is welded together making our frame stronger than any other in the world. We have delivered thousands of these bags to operators all over the world. Problem Solved.

The Advanced Load Out Bag is a oversized cargo bag that is attached to our roller frame. The bag is made with 1000 denier fabric for durability, water repellency, and abrasion resistance. The bag is lined with 440 weigh pack cloth for added strength. Inside there are (5) tear out bags that have hook and loop attachments so they can be stuck in place with in the bag. (2) large for the floor of the bag, and (3) small ones that line the back wall of the bag. Heavy duty YKK zippers are used on the bag. There is a zipper cover sewn in place to protect the zipper. Large cargo pockets are sewn to the outside of the bag for extra gear storage if needed. Heavy duty handles are sewn to the body of the bag. One is sewn directly onto the frame so you are not putting stress on the bag while moving it. There is also a handle sewn to the bag on the edge near the center. This handle allows you to pull the lid closer to you while zipping it shut so if the bag is over loaded the zipper will not break by accident. There are (2) clear view windows on the bag so you can easily mark and identify your bag when you get to you final destination. These bags can take an extreme amount of abuse. They are also backed with TAGs exclusive NO Questions Asked Lifetime Warranty."

It still has its sling and swivels in their original bag.  The safety lock is with it, as is the takedown/sight adjustment tool and the original magazine.  I have the original box and even the blocks of styro-foam.  

It is fun to shoot and keeps nice, tight groups at CQB distances.  It has very little recoil and even has some recoil absorption springs between the stock and the butt-plate.  It is an ideal gun for plinking with something more formidable than a .22.  It's recoil operated, so it can shoot cast bullets without fouling up a gas system.  It would be great for a kid who is ready to move up from a .22, but isn't ready for a .308 yet.  It would also be an excellent gun for a shooter's wife or husband who is not an experienced shooter because it won't kick like a shotgun and is a lot easier to hit a target/intruder than it is with a pistol.  It shoots great and is a lot of fun.  I don't have any ammo to throw in because I only bought one box of GI ball and that's what we shot.

It has a top rail for a red dot, laser or some sort of optics.  It has a bottom rail for a vertical foregrip and/or light.  It comes with the original 10 round magazine.  Additional OEM and extended aftermarket magazines are available from Midway USA and are still cheap.

I am willing to take things in trade.  Some of them would require you to add money.  Others would require me to add money.  Send me an e-mail and make a proposal.  Please include your phone number.  The worst I will do is politely decline your offer.  

The sort of thing I am hoping to take in trade: a JRC in 9mm, a Browning Recoilless trap shotgun, metallic cartridge reloading components and equipment for .223, .308 and .300 Win Mag.  I also like silver (90% U.S. coinage or .999 Good Delivery list) and foreign gold coinage (fractions of an ounce).  There are other things I am sure I have forgotten to mention here, but if you are interested in the gun, drop me a note.  If I'm not interested as of this time, I might suddenly become interested because of your note.

I'd prefer to conduct the transaction face to face.  We will need to show each other our driver's licenses to demonstrate that the transaction is fulfilling the legal obligation that we are both Ohio residents.  I ask that, if the gun is illegal where you live, don't buy it.  If you are ineligible to own a firearm, don't buy it.  If you intend to use the firearm to break the law, don't buy it.  As a used firearm, this is a no-return item.

If you are outside of Ohio, I can have the gun shipped from my local FFL holder to and FFL holder in your area at your expense.  Your dealer will perform a NICS (or similar) check on you.  If you fail your check, you will wish to have your dealer sell the gun on consignment for you because refunds and returns are a costly and complicated process.  I have no idea where I'd begin on an international shipment of this gun, even if it is legal, so I have no intention to even try to have it shipped out of the U.S."

It was built on an Elk River Armory receiver and has a chrome lined barrel. Has a UTG quad rail and an ATI folding/collapsible stock. Will come with 6 30rd magazines and approx 700rds (loose packed) of 7.62x39. Very high quality rifle with a very smooth action, and with its Tapco G2 trigger, it breaks just as smooth. This is not a WASR, so please don't expect me to accept an offer close to one. For those uneducated in Romanian AK-47's, feel free to brush up on Wikipedia, but I'll go over a couple points here:

Romanian G AK's were used in the military, WASRs were built from ""throw-away"" parts that weren't up to specs.
WASRs were built by Century Arms, on Century receivers. Since they didn't use the ""mag dimple"", their rifles are prone to mag wobble. My Romanian G has mag dimples and has ZERO mag wobble.
My G has all the scary parts, including the bayonet lug and threaded barrel. WASR 10's do not.

Overall, this rifle has much tighter tolerances than the WASRs I've handled in the past. With ammo and all, I'm looking for $1300 and will include a Pentax Red Dot sight and original mag pouches, capable of holding 8 magazines."

This bag is amazing, huge, and built like a tank. I've had it for about 6 months, and it has been sitting in my basement unused. It's probably too large for my intended need, so I figured I would post it for sale here. This bag retails for. $699 new! $400. I would consider trade for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 17, or 19. Prefer local deal, but I will ship at your cost. This bag is huge! Please call or text Mike @ 248-842-6241

The Advanced Load Out Bag is the largest and one of the most sophisticated pieces of gear TAG manufactures. After reviewing every other rolling bag on the market and using operator input we quickly realized that the problem was with the frame. TAG attacked this problem by not using a cheap off the shelf plastic luggage roller that is typically bolted to the bag. We worked with a custom metal shop and had them use 6061 Aircraft grade aluminum with thick tube walls to prevent the frame form bending or warping under heavy loads. The frame has wheel wells covering the wheels. This helps supports the weight of the bag when rolling and acts as a guard in case something punctures the bag from the inside, so the bag keeps rolling. The frame was then powder coated to ensure long lasting exposure resistance to the elements. We use a one piece solid axel for the wheels. The wheels are over sizes roller blade wheels. Rubber bumpers on the bottom of the frame are riveted in place. The frame is welded together making our frame stronger than any other in the world. We have delivered thousands of these bags to operators all over the world. Problem Solved.

The Advanced Load Out Bag is a oversized cargo bag that is attached to our roller frame. The bag is made with 1000 denier fabric for durability, water repellency, and abrasion resistance. The bag is lined with 440 weigh pack cloth for added strength. Inside there are (5) tear out bags that have hook and loop attachments so they can be stuck in place with in the bag. (2) large for the floor of the bag, and (3) small ones that line the back wall of the bag. Heavy duty YKK zippers are used on the bag. There is a zipper cover sewn in place to protect the zipper. Large cargo pockets are sewn to the outside of the bag for extra gear storage if needed. Heavy duty handles are sewn to the body of the bag. One is sewn directly onto the frame so you are not putting stress on the bag while moving it. There is also a handle sewn to the bag on the edge near the center. This handle allows you to pull the lid closer to you while zipping it shut so if the bag is over loaded the zipper will not break by accident. There are (2) clear view windows on the bag so you can easily mark and identify your bag when you get to you final destination. These bags can take an extreme amount of abuse.

POF USA P308 NP3 .308 14.5"" Barrel T-Rail - Black - 20rd: R308-14-11T-308-N1
POF is extremely proud of the durability and performance of the P308 and the P415/P416 gas-piston uppers. They have eliminated features of the gas operating system such as gas-rings, gas tube, gas key. The P308 and the P415/P416 gas-piston systems also eliminates heat, carbon build up and gas leaks which can have an adverse effect on the operating system. The biggest issue being HEAT. A weapons first priority, must be RELIABILITY.
* Comes with Magpul 20rd PMAG, Magpul MOE Grip, and Magpul STR Stock. *

The battle for this prestigious order was intense. Springfield had developed a special model for the test program, in accordance with the technical demands of the FBI, who wanted a special single-action pistol for their SWAT teams.
David Williams was responsible for this project being Head Master Gunsmith and manager of the Springfield Custom Shop. Springfield decided to launch a new model specifically for the civilian market, the Bureau Model, based on the authentic FBI Model.
This pistol has a hand-made adapted slide on a national match frame. It has a match barrel and bushing, with a polished feed ramp to the cartridge chamber. In addition, this pistol has a special speed trigger that is tuned to a trigger pressure of 2000 grams. This weapon also has a special match hammer, tumbler, and a tuned and polished cartridge extractor.
The grip safety is ambidextrous and is extended insto an extra long beavertail. The combat rear sight is from Novak with a tritium triple dot aspect marking. The magazine has been enlarged and beveled. The front and back of the Cocobolo wooden grips are ribbed. This pistol has a so-called Black-T finish and the series number of this weapon start with the letters FBI. It’s dimensions are the same as that of the standard 1911-A1.

I'm looking to trade or sell my S&W SW40VE. It's a great gun. I am the 2nd owner and have fired 100 rounds through it in the past month, the owner before me ended up wanting a compact. If you're interested in trading, I'm only interested in trading it for either a 9mm handgun that is worth a little more (since mine comes with 4 magazines & ammo) or a 9mm handgun with ammo.

Included:

**SW40VE Firearm

**4 S&W brand Magazines, two 15 round and two 14 round (I kept the magazines loaded for a few days so they're easier to load than brand new magazines)

**115 Rounds of .40S&W ammo

**Camouflage shoulder holster - This originally held your firearm in a holster that holds 1 magazine under one arm and under your other arm it had a 2 magazine pouch, but the guy who gave this to me cut the 2 magazine pouch off, so now it's just a camouflage shoulder holster and then separate is the camouflage pouch that holds 2 magazines."

This is in prestine condition. Gently used. If you look them up new Msrp is $700
I took this info directly off their site 

Hornady’s 366 Auto Shotshell Reloading Press is the ideal press for the avid target shooter. The time-tested design lets you load high-quality, low-cost ammo in a hurry — just set the case and wad in place, and pull the handle. The 366 Auto does the rest, automatically.

Features:
PRIMER TUBE FILLER

Every 366 Auto includes our Primer Tube Filler. Holds a full box of shotshell primers, and fills the tube with a turn of the dial. Won’t drop primers upside-down into the tube.

EASY EMPTY POWDER AND SHOT HOPPER TUBES

If you need to empty your powder or shot, this entire assembly can be easily removed without spilling — a feature unique to the 366 Auto. Baffles let powder and shot flow more smoothly for more uniform loads from start to finish.

AUTOMATIC PRIMER FEED SYSTEM

Makes priming shells automatic with the pull of the handle. Extremely smooth and reliable design reduces to nearly zero the chances of crushing the primer. Primer Tube Filler ensures no upside-down primers enter the feeder tube.

THREE-STAGE TAPER LOC CRIMPING

Starts crimp, closes and tapers. Perform more reliable crimping with both six or eight point crimps. Give factory taper to your shells.

PRIMER FEEDER SHUT-OFF

Optional

SPRING LOADED SEATER PUNCH

Optional

STANDARD SHOT AND POWDER

These easy-to-change standard bushings make it easy to switch to a different shot or powder for most popular target loads.

POWDER SHUT-OFF AND SHOT SHUT-OFF

The shut-offs for powder and shot let you operate the machine as you need to by shutting off individual stations.

SWING-OUT WAD GUIDE

The wad guide swings out to give you better access, making it easier to place the wad. Helps to speed up your reloading.

AUTOMATIC INDEXING

Each pull of the lever automatically rotates the shell plate, so you don’t have to do it manually. You’ll be amazed at how much faster and smoother your reloading efforts go with auto indexing.

FULL-LENGTH RESIZING STATION

You can resize your shells to factory dimensions, or skip this station entirely and speed up your reloading. Many presses force you to resize. The 366 Auto gives you the choice.

PRIMER CATCHER

Every pull of the handle ejects the spent primer from fired shells into the primer catcher for neat, easy disposal.

AUTOMATIC SHELL EJECTION

Completed shells are automatically ejected behind the press, so you don’t have to remove them manually. Another speed advantage over other presses.

SHOT DRAIN HOLES IN SHELL PLATE

If you reload, you will eventually spill shot. Spilled shot rolls to the edge of the shell plate and through the holes, so it won’t jam.

ALL DIECAST CONSTRUCTION

Solid die-cast frame is long lasting, and provides a stable, rigid platform for precision reloading.

Back ground of the Saiga.The Saiga autoloading rifle is based on the rugged Kalashnikov design. In the Saiga line of rifles, this timeless design utilizes a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and very few internal parts that provide the reliability that Izhmash has delivered for over 60 years. A hammer forged, chrome lined barrel and chamber provide the ultimate in long life. The driftable post front sight with protective ears is adjustable for windage and elevation. The notched side catch with bar rear leaf sight is adjustable for elevation. The rear sight has presets for 109, 218, & 328 yards. The comfortable, ergonomic operating handle makes charging the firearm effortless. The spring loaded magazine release provides for quick magazine changes. The elongated selector handle allows for a smooth transition from safe to semi-auto.

I have owned both. This pistol, unlike others, has an actual hammer...you can cock/decock this pistol, it's not just a striker fire like all the other ones. Also the magazine release is not a button but is a portion of the bottom of the trigger guard, it is a beautiful set-up...you push down the trigger guard and out pops the magazine... It comes with a second ""backstrap"" for the grip. That is so you can make the grip wider or narrower by putting in the other backstrap. They are both factory backstraps and Walther gives you two different sizes. This is for right hand and left hand shooters...every feature , including safety...is ambidextrous.  Best .22 pistol  I've ever owned. I have had the others, sold them and kept this one...hands down the best. It is single and double action. BUT, I need money."
