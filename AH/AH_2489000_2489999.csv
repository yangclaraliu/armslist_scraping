The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

It is a Mosin Nagant 91/30 that has been completely modernized. I bought it as an unfinished project from previous owner and finished it. It worked great for me for this past deer season. Only reason I'm selling is because I am thinking about getting something new to have some range fun with. 

This has an ati monte carlo camo stock, ati bent bolt kit, ati scope mount, improved one finger loop safety, barska 3-9x42 scope with lens focus adjustment and back lit red and green cross hairs. The barrel had been shortened to 24"" by the previous owner and I re crowned the barrel with a full 79 degree target crown and polished the crown to eliminate any grooves or chatter marks. Camo stock had some chips from use, bolt has a hole on the front side of the handle from having it backwards while installing the bent handle. Nothing interferes with good operation. Only thing this rifle would need is the scope zeroed better. I ran out of time before deer hunting due to work schedule, but I didn't have a problem hitting an 8"" circle from 100 yards repeatedly,  so that was good enough for me for this year.

This takes a classic and makes it like a modern hunting rifle. My favorite thing about this rifle is the ability to target shoot or stock up surplus ammo for about $0.17 a round. That's crazy cheap. I bought 3 boxes of premium soft point hunting rounds for $13.99 for a box of 20. That's cheap for a large round like this 7.62x54r. 

Included in this package is:

Rifle with scope
Sling
Ammo saddle
Soft case
Bore sighter
17 148gr silver tip surplus fmj rounds
20 Barnard 203gr soft point rounds

38 PPU 150gr soft point rounds

The gun is in very nice condition, the stock is NOT cracked, as are many.  There is no rust, the bores are bright and shiny.  It is tight and seems to have been cared-for properly.  It is not needing to be restored.  These are designed to be used on the farm, so many examples have served that purpose well.  This one has not seen that sort of service, it is neither beat-up nor rusty.  This model also has the factory-drilled and tapped top-strap (preferred over the dove-tail mount) and includes a nicely-mounted scope mount, as well as the factory flip-up rear sight.  The stock's finish is worn in only a few places, and the case-coloring is worn along the edges.  This is a Series C, made in Westfield, Massachusetts (serial number B853***).    Definitely a 90%++ gun.

The gun is in very nice condition, the stock is NOT cracked, as are many, there is no rust, the bores are bright and shiny.  It is tight and seems to have been cared-for properly.  It is not needing to be restored.  These are designed to be used on the farm, so many examples have served that purpose well.  This one has not seen that sort of service, it is neither beat-up nor rusty.  This model also has the factory-drilled and tapped top-strap (preferred over the dove-tail mount) and includes a nicely-mounted scope mount, as well as the factory flip-up rear sight.  The stock's finish is worn in only a few places, and the case-coloring is worn along the edges.  This is a Series C, made in Westfield, Massachusetts (serial number B853***).    Definitely a 90%++ gun.

This is a gently used Primary Weapon Systems AR-15 semi-automatic rifle chambered in the high performance .223 Wylde caliber. It is clean and functions flawlessly. It is less than a year old with extra key mod rails and handguard covers installed. .223 Wylde is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the same external dimensions and lead angle as found in the the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of semi automatic weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition. The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK116 Rifle is a crowd favorite. The MK116 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a PWS FSC556 muzzle device. The 16"" barrel features a versatile 1:8"" twist rate, offering stabilization of the widest ranges of bullet weights available. Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS sights. The MK116 utilizes a proven mid length Gas Piston operation system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block and free-floated barrel. The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail. We also have additional modular Picatinny rail segments available for sale. This rifle ships in a padded hard case. Caliber: .223 Wylde Capacity: One 30 round PMAG included Barrel: 16.1"" Barrel, 1:8"" twist Overall Length: 33"" - 36.5"" Weight (unloaded): 6.9 pounds"

Too keep prices dirt cheap on this because I cant know what your prime shooting application will be that you will tailor your scope too.  If you want a decent 3-9 scope with scope caps added on. I will add it on and boresight it for $35.

If you are looking for cheap 223 ammo in 55 or 62 grain we can add that in and price that later.

Let me know what questions you have.  Email is the best method to reach me.  This is a great deal even compared to walmart, or other resale sights.  Will only sell locally or you can drive here.  Must be willin to sign a bill of resale.

The Taurus PT92 is a double action/single action, 9x19mm Parabellum, double-stack magazine, semi-automatic, short recoil action pistol manufactured by Taurus in the former Beretta factory in São Paulo, Brazil.I've always wanted a BERETTA 92FS, but with my luck I've never had the cash. On the other hand there are designs true to the BERETTA M9 that have kept me quite happy even if they don't say BERETTA. 

I am selling my Taurus PT92, which is well built, solid and reliable. Best of all, it'll shoot any ammo as long as it is 9mm. It has new Hogue finger Grips and has always been kept clean. Has holster wear and some wear on the slide but it still looks and functions like it can pack a punch. 

If you're interested or want more info text or call at six122245245. I'll only sell to people with a PTP or PTC

MIT-15 SPR+ RIFLE


""Form follows function.""
FUNCTION:

BARREL
Shoot the same quality barrels which have won many regional and national championships.
Match chamber in 223 Wylde will shoot both 5.56x45 NATO and 223 Remington ammunition.
416R stainless steel barrel preserves accuracy through reduced internal erosion.
BOLT
Enhanced bolt is manufactured by a much stronger and higher quality material than the GI-issue bolt.
Fully-supported cartridge case by the bolt face helps solve historical bolt carrier issues.
Enhanced carrier has a resilient coating and refined heat treatment.
TRIGGER
2-stage combat trigger has a fixed 4.5 lb. total pull weight with second stage that breaks clean so shooter can stay on target.
A lightweight hammer driven by a full-power hammer spring speeds locktime and delivers positive ignition of all ammo types.
Trigger pull is optimized for both highly accurate aimed fire and quick CQB shooting.
FORM:

HANDGUARD
Free-float design significantly improves accuracy.
Ventilation holes reduce weight and quickly dissipate barrel heat.
Streamlined for secure no-slip grip.
STOCK
Offers an improved cheek-weld designed for increased comfort and consistency.
Rubber butt plate reduces felt recoil and provides no-slip surface against web gear and body armor.
GRIP
An anti-slip over-molded rubber coating for enhanced weapon control in wet conditions.
Curved beaver-tail fills grip-to-receiver junction to help maintain a comfortable hold and protect operator's hand during sustained firing."

I have a brand new Saiga 12, 12 gauge shot gun. Made in Russia by Iszmash (reliable 4 life). I already installed all the bells and whistles on it which includes: barrel shroud, laser site, flashlight, adjustable stock, quad-picatinny rail, and 20 round drum (will include original 5 round mag). This will save you a ton of time and money. I shot less than 50 rounds through it (only had it for 1.5 months). It shoots 2 3/4, 12 gauge ammo. Works GREAT when shooting a bit more premium ammo. It will not cycle cheap bird shot unless you have a gun-smith bore out the gas chamber (30 min job). These are going for 1,300 at any store. 

I'm asking $900.00 cash. That of course includes all the gear i put on it. Need to sell--baby on the way. Write if you have additional questions.

Both in excellent condition. Have original cases, cleaning brushes, mag loader etc. with both, and paper work. Have a alien gear holster for the G20 and an interchangeable alien gear kydex shell for the G29 and an Ed Hume holster for the G29 all IWB.

Not in a hurry to get rid of them, only reason I want to test the waters is because unfortunately I have nerve damage in my hands and can no longer handle the recoil. Which isnt terrible, but looking more into a couple of 9's or .40's. or even a mix. The firearms are in awesome condition, I have quite a bit of ammo too ranging from range ammo to full power loads. If wanting to buy both looking for a $1000.00. That's both guns with holsters, several hundred rounds of ammo and all original packaging with paper work accessories etc. will list trades below which is really what I'd prefer to do, is trade them. Also have several recoil springs of different weights, for hotter loads, also have steel guide rods as well as original polymer stock ones. 

In the case of selling them seperatley I'd divide the ammo between the 2, but include all after market accessories, holsters and original packaging for each individual firearm. Seperatley I'd part with them for $535.00. I will only meet at cabelas in Lacey, during the day on a weekend. CPL preferred. No felons please.

(Edit: have more ammo than pictured, also have 2 +2 mag extensions for the G20, and 2 mag extensions that add an extra finger groove for 2 of the 3 mags for the G29 gen 4)"

Forend is like new, but not original to the gun- previous owner had installed a new walnut forend. Your guess is as good as mine as to why, but looks nice all the same.  

Very nice gun that is no longer cataloged, I believe this was made in 1992. Check out the price of the barrel alone on these guns. You'll find they get about what I'm asking for the entire gun. If you want a slug gun, it's hard to beat the bang for the buck on this one. Only reason for selling is to pay for a recent handgun purchase that I just had to have. You know how it goes.

A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
Durable Melonite QPQ Finish for increased wear resistance.

It will come with 20rnds of ammo that its dialed in for, 2 3rnd mags, and 1 5rnd mag. It also has a sling. Nothing wrong, rifle is was always stored in my safe, which is indoors. 

Read up on this gun, its a VERY nice gun. It is a Beretta made gun with a Sako action. I purchased it at Scheels in St. Cloud for 800 new without the scope, sling, or extra mags. The 5rnd mag is 80 alone, and I might have two if I look around. The scope was 229 when I bought it, and 199 now.

919,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2489919,For Sale/Trade:  Smith & Wesson Shield .40 (Not effected by Shield recall),"Manchester, Manchester, New Hampshire",$ 395,"Listed On: Thursday, December 26, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One owner Shield in excellent condition.  150 rounds through it , after which is was cleaned/lubed and put away in its box.  I am a Vet who is anal about his firearms, as anyone can see who looks at them.  I also build custom handguns and rifles, so I am careful with them and treat them as they should be treated.  
This Shield functiones 100%, with Zero malfunctions of any kind ever with both the standard and extended magazine.  This Sheild was NOT effected by the recent recall having to do with the trigger return.  Never modified or messed with, 100% original.
VERY nice for daily carry with its slim profile, light weight and overall size, it just doesn't fit my hands, (too small for me) so I am not as accurate with it.  I've had other people pick it up and shoot the ""10"" ring to death with it, (making me look like a horrible shot).  
I've found another daily carry piece that fits my hands well and with this Shield being my only firearm in .40, it is just sitting in the safe.
I am looking to sell/trade it with everything it came with;  The original Box, both magazines, (one 6 round and one extended 7 round), gun lock, etc.  It will also come with 20 rounds of Hornady ""critical defense"" carry rounds, (my preferred carry ammo, if the buyer wants it) and a quality, (not cheap-o) black leather 3 slot belt holster.  These extras alone would run you almost $100, and the pistol was $425 for a total of about $525 new.  So, I think that my asking price is more than fair considering what you'd be getting and its overall condition.  I think it's a great deal vs. buying just a new Shield without the added stuff you're getting here.  
I will need a copy of your NH drivers license and carry permit for sale, or we can meet at an FFL of your choice to transfer, you cover the transfer fee.  I believe I may have another 50-100 rounds of Fiocchi ammo if the buyer is interested, and I would be happy to sell that at a discounted price.
Serious buyers or trade offers only PLEASE.  If you send me a trade offer, I will respond to it IF I AM INTERESTED!  If you don't hear back within 48 hours, I am not interested.  
Thanks for your time, I know this reads like a novel but I try to make my listings as clear as possible.  I have 100% feedback everywhere I have sold online including many firearm parts and complete rifles/handguns and I plan on keeping it that way.  Happy shooting!"

This is a rare weapon. It is an open bolt fired carbine. The Eagle Carbine was developed and manufactured in small numbers from 1964-68. The gun has iron sights (which were only used during the first year of production making this particular gun even harder to find than ones made during the next 3 years of production). As far as legality, This particular design was followed by the Spitfire, Commando and Apache Carbines which appeared in the early 1970's. The Spitfire's and Apache's were banned by the ATF and reclassified as ""machine guns"", in effect making this already rare Eagle Carbine the only legal version of this type of firearm.
