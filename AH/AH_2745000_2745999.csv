The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Includes two 8 round magazines, box and manual Does show some holster wear, no damage to pistol. excerpt from Gunblast.com As stated above, all ammo functioned perfectly with both magazines provided with the pistol. The Taurus PT1911 is an all-steel, five inch barreled 1911, just as John Browning intended his .45 caliber pistol to be. After almost one hundred years, the 1911 .45 automatic is still the standard to which all fighting pistols are compared. Even with all of the designs introduced in the past few decades, the 1911 is still the choice of professionals who have to carry a handgun into a fight. The Taurus is a superb weapon, right out of the box. The only change that I would make if this were my personal weapon would be to add a set of night sights for use in very low light situations. Another good alternative would be Crimson Trace Lasergrips. The Heinie sights are very good, however, and offer a good sight picture, but I just prefer tritium inserts. The PT1911 is a heck of a good value in a quality 1911 pistol. It is made from forged steel, has a very good blued finish, and a long list of upgraded parts that would cost extra on most pistols in its price range. I usually don’t list retail prices in my articles, as the articles stay up on Gunblast for years, but this PT1911 sells for about the same price as a basic 1911 did thirty years ago. The suggested retail price on this gun, as of July 2006, is only $599 US. That is a real bargain for a 1911 with this many features, with this good of a trigger pull, that is this accurate. It is a high quality fighting pistol, and I highly recommend this Taurus PT1911."

But then I got bored. I stripped and refinished the stock and all of the metal. I cut down the barrel (well within the legal limits) and re crowned it. All of the metal has been coated with Brownells Aluma Hyde II. It is a very tough finish. I added the butt pad as well. I am not a gunsmith and the rifle was built by the Soviets, so this is not some fancy piece of art. This is not an $800 sporterized Mauser project. This is a Scout Rifle/Brush Gun. Still, it turned out really well and shoots straight. I fired 20+ rounds through it since completing the project and carried it hunting. This rifle is very light and very short, so a word to the wise, don't buy it if you don't like recoil or if you think 12 inch flames coming out of the barrel is a bad thing. Comes with 100+ rounds of ammunition, 20 of which are soft points for hunting and the red dot."

This is a like new model in the case with very low round count.  This has the NM Prefix Serial Number and comes in the blue NM case.  

This is not the listing that was stated to be a fraud (that person was in Arizona).  

This is one of the best 1911's I have ever shot and I am the original owner.  I purchased it brand new in 2003 and I have had it ever since.  The only additions I have made to this are to add a Wilson Combat Checkered Front Strap (if you do not like this simply remove the grips and it comes right off) and a Wilson Combat Shock Buff recoil buffer (also removable).  It comes with two magazines which were 7 rounders but I have converted them to 8 rounders with Wilson Combat Conversion springs and followers (I can convert these back to 7 rounders if you would like).  

It comes with all of the paperwork from the factory (including the warranty card, which is still blank).  The only thing not there is the Springfield Armory Sticker.  

This is a USA made Springfield not a Brazilian model and is one of the nicest ones you will come across.  It is in Excellent to Like New Condition in the original case with all of the original accessories and paperwork.  

I will also include a SigTac Paddle Holster for it that functions like the Blackhawk SERPA.  

I am willing to drive up to one hour from Pittsburgh to meet at an FFL for Transfer and I am not interested in trades at this time.  This is one of my favorite guns but now it is time for it to go to a new home.  The price is fair and the price is firm.  Additional photos can be had on request.  Any questions please ask.

I am asking $600. I am in Wichita and will be in Manhattan this weekend. I am firm on the price ( I do not have to sell) and would only consider A new or almost new regular 9mm Pro for trade, but you will have to boot a little cash or add to the trade.

Selling a colt US army model 1896 in 38 cal. The inside of the barrel blew up. You can see in picture. I still shot a bullet out of the gun but Def not very safe. You can cock back the hammer & the gun will fire. It only seems to work in single action. Maybe you can use this gun for parts or fix it. Very cool antique revolver."

Bought this for a hunting rifle, matte stainless. Never used and found the gun I was looking for in the first place. Have three sets of rings with it. Stock stainless 1inch rings, leopold high 30mm rings, leopold extra high 30mm rings. Garuenteed to fit a wide range of .mil and civvie scopes. 

Anyways smooth action cycled with snap caps only (fake training bullets so that you don't dry fire an empty gun.)

Bbl is 22 inches, gun is very light weight. Rugers MSRP is very high on this gun (around 900) but I got it for far less. 

650 WAS what I was asking (575 now), not negotiable as it's a good deal. I paid 150 bucks in extra rings specific to the rifle, those come with it

After being stood up while driving two hours with a hundred pounds of guns and ammo, I won't be making any road trips with this. I live right off of 94 near state fair. If you commit to buying it I will effing be there with the gun. My word as a Soldier. Please respect my time and be there too.

UPDATE/PRICE DROP

Well unexpected lawyer bills has lowered my asking price to 575 cash, pickup right here. That is my bottom dollar, at a decent loss for a brand new gun."

If you want the half box you can count however much you want and pay me what I paid for them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO MAKE A PROFIT. Just trying to get my money back and not be the 22lr hog that everyone seems to hate right now. I paid $18.33 per box out the door. If you want to count out the half box and pay me the appropriate fraction of $18.33 I wouldn't mind. Otherwise, it's at least half a box and I would take $11 for it. $66 for all of it.

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight.

For sale or possible trade is a very rare 1970 Ruger Super Blackhawk .44mag. What makes it very rare is the fact that it has the ""D"" serial Prefix. There were roughly only 800 ""D"" prefix Supers made. The ""D"" stands for Duplicate. This means somewhere out there there is a different caliber Ruger with the same serial minus the ""D"". Also a great feature of the gun is that it has not been converted to the transfer bar setup and it is a super high polish bluing on the gun. I would rate the bluing at 95% with only slight holster wear on the tip of the barrel, light hand wear on the back strap, and a light scratch here or there. For a 44 year old pistol, it is very nice. Someone has replaced the grips, so from a collector standpoint, they need to be replaced with a factory set. The rubber houge grips do have a bit of the rubber chipped out on one side. On another bright note, it surprisingly does not look to have been shot much, and the action is smooth as silk. The trigger pull is insanely crisp and light and the cylinder is tight. Here is a link that explains many of the odd features of this piece: http://www.gunblast.com/Hamm_SuperBlackhawk1.htm . I will sell the pistol for $700 cash or listen to trade offers. I really dont have anything in particular in mind on a trade. Trade plus cash on your side or even trades only please. I am located in Cleveland, TN. Text or call REDACTED if interested. Text me trades offers with pics if possible. The pictures really dont do it justice. The nice leather Cross Draw holster is included, and it can be worn on the side as well. Thanks-Dave"

This is for the revolver lovers out there. For sale or possible trade is a very rare 1970 Ruger Super Blackhawk .44mag. What makes it very rare is the fact that it has the ""D"" serial Prefix. There were roughly only 800 ""D"" prefix Supers made. The ""D"" stands for Duplicate. This means somewhere out there there is a different caliber Ruger with the same serial minus the ""D"". Also a great feature of the gun is that it has not been converted to the transfer bar setup and it is a super high polish bluing on the gun. I would rate the bluing at 95% with only slight holster wear on the tip of the barrel, light hand wear on the back strap, and a light scratch here or there. For a 44 year old pistol, it is very nice. Someone has replaced the grips, so from a collector standpoint, they need to be replaced with a factory set. The rubber houge grips do have a bit of the rubber chipped out on one side. On another bright note, it surprisingly does not look to have been shot much, and the action is smooth as silk. The trigger pull is insanely crisp and light and the cylinder is tight. Here is a link that explains many of the odd features of this piece: http://www.gunblast.com/Hamm_SuperBlackhawk1.htm . I will sell the pistol for $700 cash or listen to trade offers. I really dont have anything in particular in mind on a trade. Trade plus cash on your side or even trades only please. I am located in Cleveland, TN. Text or call REDACTED if interested. Text trade offers with pics if possible. The pictures really dont do this gun justice. The nice leather Cross Draw holster is included, and it can be worn on the side as well. Thanks-Dave"

I have had this rifle for about 3 years now and have taken it to the range twice and have put about 100 rounds (if not less) down range. I have cleaned it after both sessions and does not have any dings/ scratches. The Nightforce is a 2010 WITH zerostops and does not have any scratches or dings either. I have babied this rifle. Overall this is an incredibly fun gun to shoot and ACCURATE. 600 yards at Angeles Shooting range is nothing. Please, no low ball offers I will not even entertain them."

Now that I have two boys I would like to find this gun again so they can get a chance to shoot it and own it someday when they are of age.

DD in my honest opinion is one of the best values in a factory built AR these are not cheap for a reason please do some research on these before contacting me.

AS A RESULT, IN 1952, WALTHER LICENSED PRODUCTION OF THE PP SERIES PISTOLS TO A FRENCH COMPANY, MANUFACTURE DE MACHINES DU HAUT-RHIN, ALSO KNOWN AS MANURHIN. THE FRENCH COMPANY CONTINUED TO MANUFACTURE THE PP SERIES UNTIL 1986. IN FACT, ALL POSTWAR EUROPEAN-MADE PP SERIES PISTOLS MANUFACTURED UNTIL 1986 WERE MANUFACTURED BY MANURHIN."

All officers of the law who currently operate in Connecticut are hereby requested to stand down. If you attempt to molest any free man and strip them of their rights, there is a 50/50 chance that you will not go home. Please, think of your families, friends and life. If you have any respect for the public, if you have any sense of dignity and honor, you will refuse to enforce these unconstitutional laws. We are not criminals, we are law abiding free citizens who choose to exercise our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. 
We do not want this to end in violence but we are prepared to do what is required to protect our God given rights. You took an oath as a police officer and if you decide to go against your oath, you will be considered an enemy of the citizenry. 
Your badge does not mean anything. It is a symbol of force that we will not respect if you attempt to violate our rights. 
Please understand that the American Revolution started because the British attempted to confiscate firearms. If you know anything about the history of Connecticut, you will know exactly why it is well fitting for the next Revolution to start here. 
46 states so far are rallying behind us law abiding CT gun owners. 
According to http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/rpt/2011-R-0194.htm
There are roughly 6,656 police officers in CT. 
The 2013 population of CT was roughly 3.5 million.
I believe it is fair to say that at least 20,000 CT residents own a firearm or multiple firearms. Not to mention the Patriots in NY, MA, RI, VT, NH, ME, VA, OH, MD, NJ, WV and PA who could arrive in CT in a 2-6 hour commute. 

It is also safe to say that many gun owners are better shots that most police officers seeing as civilians generally have more time to ""hit the range."" I personally know that I can put 25 rounds from a semi auto rimfire rifle in a 3x3 box at 70 yards in under 30 seconds without a bipod, bench rest or optic/scope. 
The AR-15 is a very easy to shoot rifle. The AK-47 is as well. These two firearms are so easy to operate, 10 year old kids in Africa who are kidnapped by warlords can shoot them with semi/decent accuracy. 
Have you seen the current civil unrest in Ukraine or Venezuela? A quick YouTube search will show you what molotovs do to BDUS and flesh. Hell, no wonder they are illegal!

We the people have had enough. In the words of Ben Franklin "" They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” ""Those Who Sacrifice Liberty For Security Deserve Neither.""

Included in the sale is an M&P 10 Semiautomatic .308 rifle with a 12"" Midwest Industries SSG2 Free Float Handguard with lo-profile gas block, Patriot Ordnance Factor P308 Muzzle brake, a Magpul CTR buttstock and a Mission First Tactical Engage pistol grip.  Also included are 3 rubberized rail panels and 3 short rail segments that came with the MI SSG12 and 2 Gen2 20 round Pmags.

This gun has less than 200 rounds of quality brass-cased ammunition through it.  I never shoot steel cased.  My best grouping at 100 yards with a 4x scope was just under 1 MoA with FGMM 168gr ammunition, so a better scope or better shooter should get even better results.

The M&P10 is an accurate lightweight ambidextrous rifle that is a pleasure to shoot, especially with this muzzle brake attached.  

I am selling this rifle to partially fund the purchase of a SCAR 17.  So the only trade that I will even entertain is for a black SCAR 17 where I will throw in extra Cash.

There are a few minor scratches and dings in the finish of the rifle from light use but everything is very minor and hardly noticeable"

Hunted with it last year and the action is smoothe. You can tell this is a quality rifle and have read the older models were the best.I do not have any paperwork for the rifle or scope. They come by themselves. Looking for $800 and am pretty firm on price. May consider trades for an AR15 or a 30-06 such as a savage or Ruger. May consider other firearm trades +$. Only pistol partial trade would be an Lcr."
