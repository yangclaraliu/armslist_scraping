Given that I don't need it anymore and it's taking up space in my toolbox I decided it was time to find it a new home. 

I work as a professional mechanic, so make no mistake about it, when I say it's used, I mean it's used. That being said, it's the old school metal construction, these things can take a beating and not even notice. It's a Snap On so it's still got it's warranty, I believe it's a $50 deductible if it has to be rebuilt at any time in the future. That number could have changed so don't quote me. My air tools get oiled EVERY day without fail so I'm not even concerned about it failing any time soon. 

I'm willing to consider reasonable offers, and when I say reasonable all I'm asking is for you to use your head and not throw out some ridiculously low figure. However, for a full sale price deposit I'd be willing to let you try it out for a week. Be warned however, if you do somehow manage to break it then it's all yours.

The M1A is essentially a civilian version of the M14 EBR. Its a M1A socom 2 with a Sage EBR stock. Had the original EBR stock with adjustable butt stock but was way too heavy in comparison to the EBR stock with the M4 butt stock. This stock will accept any M4 / AR-15 stock and most any M4 / AR-15 grip. If not familiar with the Sage EBR stocks look em up and you'll find they are the best M1A chassis bar none. In short this stock really changes the dynamics of the rifle making it much more adaptable and versatile. If you have any questions on the stock feel free to ask as I was trained on this weapon platform. The Socom II comes with 16"" barrel, tritium inserted factory sights and very nice factory trigger. I installed the Sage EBR stock and outfitted it with a stripper clip mounted picatinny rail,  Magpul CTR buttstock and X products 50 round drum (new with box and papers). The pictures show a Surefire 951 weapon light, Urban ERT 2 point hybrid sling, Grip Pod fore grip and Aimpoint COMP M4 but I plan on keeping these.

If you said yes to those 3 questions, you should head over to the Facebook page for Occupy Hartford Gun Rights Rally.

The AW ban
The LCM ban and registration/declaration requirements 
The ammo and long rifle eligibility certificate requirements
In a nut shell, Malloy must repeal everything except the Safe Storage Requirements and the now laws concerning Background checks.

Two 20 rd mags, case, strap and cleaning tool. The AR6720 represents a new generation of Colt rifle, which comes standard with an optics ready rail and a flip-up rear iron sight Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most unobscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade. Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor. The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones. The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine). Call Paul REDACTED anytime"

Here’s one you’re not seeing covered by the establishment teleprompter readers.
The Justice Department is going before the Supreme Court and arguing that the Obama administration has the authority to trump the Constitution with international treaties.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz is stepping up to the plate to fight this globalist broadside.
“The Constitution created a limited federal government with only specific enumerated powers,” Cruz told the Washington Examiner. “The Supreme Court should not interpret the treaty power in a manner that undermines this bedrock protection of individual liberty.”
In a speech delivered to the Heritage Foundation, Cruz said the Justice Department’s arguments before the highest court represent “an absurd proposition” that “could be used as a backdoor way to undermine” Second Amendment and other constitutional rights the global elite are working overtime to eradicate.
The case at issue is Bond v. United States. It concerns a woman charged with violating an international ban on chemical weapons. She stands accused of harassing a onetime friend involved in an affair with her husband. The federal government is arguing that it may use the international law to prosecute the woman, thus violating basic structural guarantees that exceed Congress’ enumerated powers, according to Bond’s lawyers.
“If the administration is right, the treaty power could become a backdoor way for the federal government to do everything from abolishing the death penalty nationwide, to outlawing homeschooling, to dramatically curtailing the states’ rights to regulate abortion,” Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network told the Washington Examiner."

Email me with what you have and how much you're looking to get. I'm not looking to pay a ton, so if you have one laying around that you'd like to get rid of for a few bucks, shoot me an email. Keep in mind that Kittery trading post routinely has them for under $150, so if you want more than that then I probably won't be interested.

This was the U.S. Army's first smokeless powder rifle and was the service rifle for troops in the Spanish American War, Philippine Insurrection, and for some troops in World War I.  It has a 5-round block magazine that feeds smoothly.  Serial number dates this one to 1900.  It's in great shape and fires great.  You can still find 30-40 Krag ammo at gun stores so it's easy to shoot.  The rifle has two government inspection stamps showing that it was accepted into the U.S. arsenal.
Only modification I can see is that the rear sight has been replaced with a modern sight.  You should be able to make it out in one of the attached photos.
This is a great piece for anybody who likes to collect or shoot.  I bet it would even still kill a deer.

MAGPUL

PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M3, 5.56X45 MAGAZINE

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

Magpul PMAG 30 Gen M3 AR-15 Magazine reflects five years of research and development to advance the already proven PMAG design.

Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures.

Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions.

Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity.

The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine's body. These ""smoother"" side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions.

The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way."

Runs and drives decent.
You can hop in and drive it away, but it does need a little TLC. Has a small coolant leak in the thermostat gasket, and possibly somewhere else, but I don't have time to deal with it. Needs an oil change, and I am sure a tune up would help it out. The 4 wheel drive works, but auto 4 wheel does not. The ABS does not work. Tires are decent enough. AC works. Has leather seats, power windows, locks, mirrors, and driver's seat, Keyless entry, rear wiper does not work, has Tow package, JVC CD player, brush guard, taillight guards, rear defrost, off road lights. Typical rotted out rocker panels. A few dings. The shocks (I believe they are Gabriels) and sway bar links are 2 years old, rear U-joints are a couple months old. I plan to remove the cb and antenna that is currently installed, but will leave it in if need be.
With a little tinkering, this would make someone a great winter beater, first car, or even resell and make a profit.

This has the bright daylight visible red dot and a custom Mil Scale BDC reticle designed for 3Gun competition with a BDC built in. BDC is calibrated for .223 using 77gr SMK @ 2720fps, but you can use other bullets as well I have all the BDC information to make other loads work as well. Red Dot is on the second focal plane and DOES NOT change in size as you increase the power. Also when you turn the red dot off it disappears completely, it does not have a black dot behind it to obscure the reticle. The Mil Scale reticle is on the first focal plane and DOES increase and decrease in size as you change the power of the scope. You can use the reticle like a regular Mil reticle but this one has hash marks every 0.5 mil to make ranging targets more precise. Or you can use the BDC for quick shots out to 800yds. BDC includes wind hold overs for 2.5, 5 and 10 MPH wind. The red dot is centered on the scope at the 200 yard mark. The cross hairs are above the center of the scope at the 100 yd mark. Zero the crosshairs at 100yd and you will have a 35 yd zero for your red dot. At 1 power the reticle almost disappears and the bright red dot stands out, Excellent for fast up close shooting. When you increase the power the reticle shows up nice and clear for those long shots. 
This scope comes with std zeroing knobs in 0.2 mils per click and 9.4 mils per turn.

I have a few from my collection available for sale or trade. I am mostly interested in trades, but willing to entertain cash offers. 

1st) 1960's era Plainfield PM-30P Paratrooper M1 Carbine. USA built, sold to Vietnam security forces in the 1960's. Captured and carried by US marine during the Vietnam war. Also included with it, a Korean war USGI stock. Pictures shows it in both configurations. Both stocks come with trade. This M1 Carbine will be traded with both stocks. $800 cash or trade.

2nd) Early (Vintage) Ruger Mini 14 (1975). Comes with original 5 rd mag, 20rd Ruger mag, 30rd 3rd party mag, sling. $800 Prefer trades.

3rd) WWI Eddystone (Remington) M1917. ""E"" marked parts. Very good condition, very nice accurate shooting collectible. $900 (prefer trades)

4th) Rare, Generation 1 early Vietnam era M72 LAW Rocket Launcher. This is NOT to be confused with the common generation 2 and later M72's. The Gen 1's are rare, and can not be found out there on the market. I would bet to guess this one is the only one available for sale/trade. (yes I know you can find M72's out there for $200 or less, but I KNOW you won't find a Gen 1 for sale at any price.) $400 cash/trades"

Carrier is 8620 Steel
Bolt is 9310 tool steel
Manufacturer did HPT/MPI testing on each bolt, but did not mark them. Marking them can cause the bolt to weaken according to the manufacturer.

These bolts are built to very tight tolerances. They are so tight I was unsure they would work. So, I allocated 1 from the shipment to myself and put 100 rds through my M16 on full auto as fast as I could put mags in. Not a single hickup. Please see pictures below.
