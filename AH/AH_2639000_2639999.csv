53,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2639053,"For Sale:  BUFFALO BORE AMMO - DEER GRENADE .44 MAGNUM +P AMMO - 240 GR.SOFT CAST - G.C. (1,550 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","Azusa, California, United States",$ 35,"Listed On: Saturday, February 1, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=232

Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade 44 Mag. +P is a 240gr. Massive, Hollow Nosed, 12 BHN cast bullet with a gas check traveling at the below velocities out of stock, real world, over-the-counter firearms:

1. 1935 fps -- Marlin 1894 20 inch

2. 1897 fps -- Marlin 1894 18 inch

3. 1871 fps -- Marlin 1894 16.5 inch

4. 1578 fps -- Ruger Super Blackhawk 5.5 inch

5. 1535 fps -- Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch

6. 1466 fps -- S&W MT Gun 4 inch

This load is designed as the world's premier deer load for 44 mag. The cast bullet is not considered soft, but it is not really a HARD cast bullet either as it only has a BHN (Brinell Hardness Numnber) of 12 so, it could be termed a medium/hard cast bullet. It performs as follows:

At an impact velocity of 1,100 fps it will mushroom to about 75 Cal. and should push right through any deer with a broadside shot.

At an impact velocity of 1,500 fps it will mushroom and some of the mushroom will fragment off and send bullet particles flying through the deer, but much of the mushroom and shank will remain intact and should push through any deer hit broadside.

At an impact velocity of 1,900 fps the entire mushroom will turn into shrapnel and send bullet particles all throughout the deer. The shank will remain intact, but will re-mushroom and do horrific damage inside the deer and will probably push through any deer hit broadside.

Of course all these results will vary depending on how much bone, if any, you hit, etc. This load was designed specifically to do horrific damage to deer sized game and as such does not penetrate like a hard cast flat nosed bullet. This bullet only penetrates about 30% as deep as a typical flat nosed hard cast bullet, which is perfect penetration for shallow game like deer, and medium sized pigs or black bear. This load is your best bet for immediately anchoring any deer with the 44 mag. cartridge that is not CNS (central nervous system) hit.

This bullet is properly alloyed, lubed and is gas checked; it will NOT lead-foul barrels.

This load is designed to be safe in ALL/ANY, all steel firearms that are in normal operating condition. We do not recommend its use in lightweight alloyed revolvers as the bullets may jump the crimp."

This is an Accurized Serbian Zastava AK Krink type of pistol in 7.62x39. Obviously the original krink had a triangle stock and was 5.45 but its close.Very close.  It has the correct Krink flash suppressor. Arsenal makes the closest thing to this and it costs $900 and mine is made better! Also this is one of the few CAI marked guns that they thankfully had nothing to do with building. They just import them u like the rifle variant. The pistols are fully Serbian made and imported as such and thusly don't have to follow the 922r compliance game. 
This started life as a PAP M92 pistol. It has had the bolt, hammer face and rails polished. It has a stainless bolt, fold up top cover and dual aperture front and rear sights. It has a Hogue AK grip on it although I also have a magpul and a CAA grip i can swap if you'd prefer. Has a Krinkov muzzle device properly installed with spring and detent pin. This kind has the fence cutter cut outs in front of the brake which could come in handy. Brake and hammer work performed by Mike at Coastal Gun Works in Virginia Beach.
The stocks are Russian Walnut I scored from Sarco. I sanded it for a long while and then put 4 coats of foliage stain on. I finished it in 3 coats of minwax satin poly. Came out pretty nice. Four 30 round mags are included. One serbian steel mag and 3 Korean grey phosphate finish steel mags which are actually very nice. They look more like matte stainless than anything. I also have 1000 rounds of brass Yugo 7.62 ammo sealed in wooden crate that can go with it if you need.
Now price dropped to $640!!! for the gun and 2 mags. 
The Ammo can be had for $285 if you buy the gun
Thanks for looking!

Excellent shooter with no issues. Solid example that is blued not parkerized with is the more desireable Norinco 1911 and the white dot sights are an improvement over the hard to see black blade sights. These Norinco's have been banned for import to the U.S. since 1994 so these don't pop up very often. 5 inch barrel. This is the Colt Series 70 type unlike the Series 80 which incorporates the additional firing pin safety block. A great GI type 1911 for the price point. I have heard that these were one of the few on Wilson Combat's list of 1911's that they would take on for customizing when they were just starting out, so that should tell you something.

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only, shipping additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

BCM Forged upper receiver, Mil-Spec
18"" 1/8 twist Stainless Steel Barrel
BCM Mil-Spec Bolt and Carrier
BCM Low profile Gas Block
Knights Armament RAS railed hand guard
Ops Inc. 12th Muzzle Brake/ Suppressor attachment
Mil Spec charging handle

The only rounds this upper has had down the pipe are from BCM's test firing. I was going to build a MK12 clone but just have too many other projects right now."

SIG SAUER® Introduces the New 1911 Max, Built to Winning Specifications

Competition pistol designed by world speed shooting champion, Max Michel, Jr.

SIG SAUER Team Captain Max Michel, Jr., has brought his winning ways and experience to work with SIG engineers in the development of the 1911 Max, a race-inspired pistol built to his unique specifications.
Built by the SIG SAUER Custom Shop, the 1911 Max is a single-stack, 5″ all-steel pistol with all the
custom features that a world-class shooter requires.

“We’re proud to be associated with a competitor of Max’s skill and character,” Bud Fini, Vice President of
Marketing. “He also brings years of elite-level match experience, which is incorporated in this pistol.”

A Nitron-finished stainless slide features forward cocking serrations, on top of a natural stainless frame
with 26LPI checkering on the front strap. Max’s “MM” logo is custom engraved on the slide and machined
into the Hogue® custom G-10 “Chainlink” grips, which offer a very aggressive, non-slip surface to the
shooter.

“I’m pretty particular about what goes into my guns,” Michel said. “In my world, a broken part or a
malfunction could end my shot at a world title. I wouldn’t put my name on a gun unless I was certain it
would measure up to my standards.”

Built to Michel’s specifications, the 1911 Max has a host of custom features, including SIG SAUER flat
trigger, external extractor, a Dawson® Ice Magwell®, a Koenig® Speed Hammer® and EGW® sear and
firing pin. Fiber optic front and adjustable rear sights also provide high-speed visibility.

I obtained this pistol in a deal. There's not a whole lot I could find out about it on the internet. What I've found points to this pistol being imported by The Garcia Corporation in Washington D.C. from Rossi in Brazil.  I did see that there were 2 different importers after they stopped importing them, Braztech and Interarms were the two after The Garcia Corporation. I can't find anything out by the serial number as a date of manufacture. My educated guess is late 60's early 70's. This is really hard to imagine though given the condition of the gun. It is blued and it's nearly flawless! It must have been a safe queen for sure. Shoots fine, nice crisp movement. Double or single action. Hammer and barrel are in great shape. I'd trust it in the bedside table. It's a great gun at a great price."

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22lr

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

Leupold's 1x14 Prismatic Tactical red dot sight delivers quick and precise
target acquisition. This sighting system allows the operator to engage the
target with a tactically-correct 'heads up and both eyes open' stance
resulting in enhanced peripheral vision and awareness. There are 8
brightness settings, and when the illumination feature is employed, the
brightness can be adjusted to suit ambient lighting levels. Without the
illumination, the black dot reticle remains visible & stands out against
busy backgrounds. The construction of this sight is rugged and nearly
indestructible; the main tube is milled from a single piece of aerospace
aluminum, and the etched glass dot reticle ensures your ability to continue
to gain positive sight acquisition under the toughest of battlefield
conditions. it is nitrogen-filled and 100% waterproof. Included with the
Prismatic is a durable scope cover made of water-resistant, nylon-laminated
neoprene.
