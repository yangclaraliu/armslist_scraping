Facts from Huldra / Adams Arms: 
Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control. Specs:

The Hybrid Sniper Rifle Cover is a combination rifle cover, rifle carrier, and shooting mat. The HSRC has heavy duty #10 YKK wrap around zipper for strength and fast opening. It is also designed to roll up and attach to an operator's pack or web gear. This product was developed with a vast amount of input from a variety of professional snipers. Each case comes standard with four detachable and interchangeable panels. There are two available locations for which to attach panels with snaps, in any configuration you need. Snaps are covered to prevent finish from wearing off. The four panels are as follows: One flat zippered utility pocket, one zippered utility pocket with elastic to hold ten .308 rounds, and two lammy suede panels. Lammy suede is the only material we have found that has the same friction wet or dry. Other nonslip materials, such as rubber, work great when dry but become very slick when wet."

This is the absolute best rifle I've ever owned or shot. I am unhappy with having to sell it, but life happens. It comes with a 10x NC Star scope with range finder and illuminated rectile for long rang shooting as well as a short range ATN ""Ultra Sight-D"" red dot (adjustable) open vector sight. One 10 round magazine. The normal twist for an SL8-1 is 1x7. This barrel has been adjusted to a 1x10. I am the first and only owner of this rifle and it has been meticulously maintained with around 500rds put through it. Buyer will also acquire approximately 100rds of ""Green Tip"" steel piercing .223 ammunition. Serious inquiries only please."

Hey everyone,
I have for sale or trade a rare little old pistol. It is a 25 acp ""MAB"" French made pistol. It is one of the more rare ones that came with the nickel finish instead of regular blued. It also comes with the original Leather holster for it and one factory 6 rd mag. The gun has definitely seen better days and has a large amount of wear but shoots great. she might not be the prettiest example of these but it shot fine for me with no hitches (except the one dud round i had haha). This pistol more specifically is a Model A, 2nd variant. Dating these is really difficult due to a lack of any real records, but this is one of the older models because it is a variant 2 and a model A. This appears to be all original except one screw on the grips looks to have been replaced. Because the value for these is all over the board I think my asking price is fair. I would also trade for a bunch of different kinds of guns, primarily pistols though. Please dont lowball or try and waste our times with needless comments. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). Please message with any offers or questions and I will try and respond as soon as I can! I can get more pictures as well if you desire. 
Thanks and have a great day!"

Gen 4 Glock 22 description via Glock's website:

The GLOCK 22 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this model of perfection that the majority of law enforcement across the country put their trust in every day. The Modular Back Strap design of the G22 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

This is a Bravo Company Mfg 14.5"" lightweight upper, with a pinned Bravo Company muzzle break. This has an overall barrel length of 16.1"", so it is NOT an NFA regulated item. Although this has been used, it has less than 500 rounds through it. It is in perfect condition with the only blemish being around the pins on the front sight block. It could be 100% concealed with some touch up paint. I live in South Burlington, but work in St. Albans, so I would be willing to meet anywhere in that area.
