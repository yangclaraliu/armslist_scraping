The V50SS rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction. With a solid laminate wood stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The wood laminate stock and rubber but pad absorb the recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day.

 Scope, bipod and case are included for my asking price of $2500.00.  The scope is a SIII was $850.00 new and has only seen the 50 rounds of ammo shot through this rifle"

I do care that this firearm is only delivered to a responsible, lawful owner, so I will only sell to CCW permit holders.

I WILL report your attempt to obtain a firearm to the police.

Scammers: This isn't Nigeria. Let's not bother.

Theives: There are worse penalties for attempted robbery than jail. Let's not go there, shall we?

Non-Local buyers: I know of no legal way to ship to you, and will not be researching the legality of firearm ownership/shipping/possession in your jurisdiction. Please don't bother me, unless you're prepared to give me a complete week-long seminar on firearms laws in both of our jurisdictions, to include inter-state, and have a licensed dealer receive the item on your behalf, at your expense.

DETAILS
Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system. The M4A1 profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

It has a chrome lined S&W bolt carrier assembly

150,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2065150,For Sale:  Gunner Combat IWB Hybrid holster for Glock pistols,"Denver, Colorado, United States",$ 68,"Listed On: Sunday, September 1, 2013",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"(Pics Below Description)

Denver Holsters builds the Gunner Combat: a hybrid inside-the-waistband holster for the concealed carry of Glock pistols. 

Supported Glock models: 9x19 (G17, G19, G26), .40 (G22, G23, G27), .45 (G36) and .357 (G31, G32, G33)

With nine ride-height/cant combinations you can carry in a way that is most comfortable for you, and be confident that your weapon will remain secure and concealed. The Gunner Combat offers a unique mixture of high-quality American made components and old-world craftsmanship designed to protect your investment and be there when you need it.

Supported Glock Models
9x19 (G17, G19, G26), .40 (G22, G23, G27), .45 (G36) and .357 (G31, G32, G33)

Leather Backing
The leather backing is made from premium steer hide and is combat cut to provide for a complete grip. We only use top grade hides made and processed in the USA.

Injection Molded Shell
The injection molded shell has incredible strength and rigidity and will provide the classic good looks and durability you demand in a holster. This shell is beyond tough.

Heavy Duty Belt Clips
The heavy duty belt clips are custom made, to our specs, by the same folks that originally developed them for John Bianchi and Neal Perkins in 1963. We think they are the best clips available in the world. Our belt clips are manufactured with the toughest spring steel available. Like everything else on our holsters, these are the best parts you can get. Fits belts up to 1.75 inches.

Steel Fasteners
The fasteners are made from 100% black oxide coated steel. Very strong. Very reliable. Some folks might say that our holsters are a little over-engineered. But we believe that the strength, durability and security of your holster is only as good as the components that hold it together.

Easy To Maintain
The Gunner Combat is designed to allow you to take your holster completely apart for periodic cleaning and waxing, and will ensure that your gun is protected as best as it can be.

Break Draw Feature
Break Draw allows you to bypass the holster's retention ramp and draw your Glock with virtually no resistance. This can be achieved by slightly rotating the butt of the gun towards the body during the draw. Break Draw allows for a very quiet draw (if necessary), makes drawing from a seated position very simple and also aids concealed carriers with a weaker arm strength in making a quick draw. Your Glock can also be drawn from the holster in the traditional manner.

Warranty
If the holster ever fails due to defects in materials or workmanship (not related to normal wear) we will repair or replace the holster, at our discretion, free of charge. You do not need to be the original owner to receive coverage.

(NO MANUAL SAFETY/DECOCKING LEVER) The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

This rifle has only been to zero and has never been used outdoors. This is a factory Noveske with an upgraded stock, grip, and ambi safety.  If you know anything about Noveske, then you already know, if not, the quality, fit, and finish is unlike any other.  I have owned this rifle for +/- 6 months and I have $3700 invested - not counting the gas to Atlanta to find one. It is really more than I need, is too nice to sit in my house, and I know there are current Noveske owners who would love to pick another up.  I am not currently looking for any trades.  Thank you for looking, I hope this will be a mutually beneficial offer for someone.  I can only list 3 photos but I have more if you are interested and need to see them."

DETAILS

Other features include the Cold Hammer Forged, 1:7 twist, 18” S2W® Profile barrel and shotgun-inspired hand grip. The adjustable buttstock allows for a more comfortable fit. To further augment the rifle, I have included modular rail sections and an adjustable indexable foregrip, enhancing your natural shooting position. Outfitted with a Two Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger, rifle movement is decreased allowing for superior accuracy. (Geissele SSA® has a total pull weight of 4.5 lbs, 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2 lbs on the second stage). The Ambush 5.56 features a monolithic upper rail platform and a 12” modular free-float hand guard, which protects the barrel while giving plenty of real estate for hand placement or accessories.

I am including the 7 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense that I have leftover for this gun.  

Gun was manufactured and tested in Prescott AZ at Ruger on 6/8/2013.

I am a private seller, not a dealer.  Gun functions flawlessly.  I have had just under 100 rounds through it, and I had 0 issues--not a single FTF or FTE.

Only issue with the gun is some minor surface rust/pitting on the slide (non ejection side).  This was my carry gun and it got some moisture from carrying.  Chances are the rust can be cleaned off with a light steel wool pad and some CLR--but I have neither to try it.  I have taken a close photo of both sides of the slide so that you can see.

Gun works great and is VERY manageable despite its small size.  Follow up shots are very easy due to surprisingly low muzzle flip.  I am getting rid of it only because I received a new carry gun as a gift.

I will take BEST OFFER for this and prefer to have this paid for and picked up either today or tomorrow (9/1 or 9/2).  These go for 279+tax new, mine is used with some minor pitting but works perfectly and has all paperwork and accessories-I am NOT looking for a new price--make me your best offer and lets go from there.

This auction is for a 1937 Izhevsk, round receiver. All matching serials like the rest. The barrel has a lot of different markings (for the collectors) and the rifling is very bright and clean. One interesting marking is the ""Concentric 0's"" (a zero inside a zero) which is an accuracy proof. There's a bunch more that I didn't research.

This is the pre lawsuit version of the HK cloned MP5k chambered in a .22lr. 
These are quite rare and hard to find for a reasonable price. These are no longer manufactured in this model due to the HK copyright lawsuit. 

I have found a few nationaly on Gunbroker selling from $700-1000. 

This one is used but in perfect shape. Includes all original hardware including the added on HK MP5 claw sight/scope mount, vertical fore grip, 2-22round mags, flash hider, threaded barrel, laser sight, and a box of CCI ammo. Approx 400-425 rounds left in a box that was originally 500. 

This is an early production guns modeled after the H&K MP5, GSG was suied by HK and later had to change the design. These are very populer for SBR and Suppressor use also extras are easy to find and relatively inexpensive. 

$500 cash but open to reasonable offers for trades.

All one money. No trailor. I got the boat from my grandpa and the engine from a buddys grandpa. Anyways I always just used it in a pond with a trolling motor and it was great for getting all those hard to cast areas. I made a battery box for the front and ran wires in a pvc pipe to the back where i put my old trolling motor (since been sold) My same grandpa sold me a bigger boat so I'm selling all this stuff to fund that boat project. The one white engine is a 7.5 hp with electric start. The top end turns over but needs a lower unit bearing. The trolling motor is one I pulled of the new boat I got from my grandpa and like the engine I can't garentee them. But like most things they can usually be fixed quickly. For sale or trade best off my number is 9one8 two8nine 9one5six. I would rather get cash for paying off the newer boat i got but I love things that go bang or some kind of motocycle or scooter! And I love sbc and b18 stuff so I might consider trades or partial trades.
