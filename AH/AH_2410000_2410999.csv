Here's the good: It is in great shape, cylinder locks up perfect, amazing trigger as expected with a smith, overall in wonderful shape. (could use some shining up). 
Here's the not so good: The barrel has been slightly turned since I bought it from the original owner. As in if you look down the sights the front sight is a few degrees turned to the left. The barrel became unthreaded. I have shot it and it hasn't gotten any worse but it's just been sitting here waiting for me to send it to get repaired by S&W. This is a common problem smith had with quality control during the years this revolver was made. The gun simply needs to be sent to smith to get repaired. I have been told they will repair for free. I would suggest getting the barrel pinned if they can do that. Also I don't know if they would charge to do that or not. 

Comes with hogue rubber grips, I unfortunately do not have original wood grips.

This is the M92 that is made in Serbia by the Zastava factory.  It is chambered in 7.62x39with a 10"" barrel and functions perfectly. This pistol has a few upgrades also. Included is a Houge overmold grip which is much more comfortable than the original.  The front sight has been straightened so the sights are not canted like most of these pistols.  The hinging dust cover has had a small picatinny rail mounted to it and also includes a cheap red dot sight.

The rear trunnion also has been modified to accept the included sling for extra stability.  Includes one tapco 30rnd mag.  The front sight has also has the weld removed, and a detent pin installed to accept new muzzle devices.

Also, for an additional $150 I will include a muzzle brake designed by ratworks.  It has been modified and combined with an adapter to be used on this pistol and cuts recoil dramatically. THE PISTOL WILL BE $800 WITH THE BRAKE INCLUDED, $650 WITHOUT.

I have 5 9mm magazines for the norinco 213 tokarev chambered in 9mm.  These mags WILL NOT work in tokarevs chambered for 7.62x25 unless you have a 9mm barrel and a magwell block installed.  These mags will never work in the yugoslav tokarev variants.

A semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .50 AE. Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride - Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface. The DE is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. Warranty papers are in each box, including safety cable and Bolt tool. This gun includes an extra MR magazine [7 rounds] and 20 boxes [20 rds ea.] - 400 total rounds of factory 300 -325 Gr. ammo. [$660.00]  Gun(s) and the ammo are very hard to find on the open market, NIB [New in the box], as these are. This gun has the fancy hand inlaid engraved grips [Silver, Brass and Gold], as seen in the pictures. They are an extra $325.00 ea.

The great thing about these rifles is you get the low recoil and accuracy of the .223, with the reliability and sturdiness of the AK design. Is your AR picky about ammo? You can run any type of ammo through this rifle with confidence whether it be brass or cheap steel case. Very smooth shooting, accurate, and light. Lightly used, less than 50 rounds through it.

The rear is unfinished I was going to set it up with a custom 1/4 elliptical set up so I have a 05 rubicon leaf spring if you'd want to set it up that way. 318 motor set up to run on propane. I have the vaporizer all the lines for it and 2 large propane tanks and tank clamps. One tank is about 26 dollars to fill up and you get about 8 hours of trail time out of it. Also have a carb to change back to pump gas. 727 auto transmission with a 208 transfer case. I also have another 208 low side drive case to build a doubler. 44"" Super Swampers with good tread with beadlock wheels. It has a S10 cab on it and has 2 bucket seats and that's it in the cab. THIS IS A PROJECT!! Things it needs: 
 1. Drive shaft (You can build a tube shaft cheap for slow offroad use or there are a few places around the Nashville area that will do custom shafts for 300-450 dollars) 
 2. Cab needs to be mounted (weld up some 4x4 angle iron and drill some holes pretty simple)
 3. Rear suspension ( I have the leaf spring and can direct you to a place to get ideas to fab the elliptical set up or customize your own. Id consider this a plus everyone likes their suspension differently... do it how you like.)

The Rifle is a Chinese Polytech m1a side stamped. The rifle was shipped to Warbird Custom Guns http://www.warbirdscustomguns.com/ and had several things done to it. First I had the Polytech bolt replace with a complete LRB bolt from LRB arms. http://www.lrbarms.com/m14parts.html do some research and you will find this bolt is the foremost bolt for the M1a currently. I also had Tim at Warbirds install new American made springs and a sadlak National Match spring guide. I also had him drill a USGI connector lock hole so the stock that the M1a For sits in would perform flawlessly. The M1A sits in a SAGE EBR chassis system that performs flawlessly. http://sageebr.com/. I also installed a threaded front sight base made by Smith Enterprises. I attached a PWS PRC muzzle brake to the front. http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=127 between the muzzle brake and the chassis system the rifle kicks about as much as a quality AK47. I also have a grip pod system on the front rail. http://www.grippod.com/. Rifle fuctions flawlessly I have shot about 300 rounds of foreign nato 7.62x51 with 0 malfunctions. I will include 5 brand new CMI magazines still in the plastic. The flashlight and Aimpoint pro do not come with the rifle. I would sell the aimpoint pro for $350.00 if you really wanted it. I am asking 2400.00 or best offer. I will reduce the price of the gun by 100 dollars if you want the muzzle brake removed. I will also reduce the price by 70 dollars if you dont want the grip pod. I am open to partial trades or straight trades. I am interested in piston driven .308s and also ak 47s. I have about 20 CMI m1a magazines if you are interested in anymore. Also the old Chinese bolt, stock and springs come with the gun if you would like them."

Shoot faster than you ever thought possible! ATF approved and legal! Must see the amazing video of how this product works to believe it. Designed for use with your AK47 rifle with under folding buttstock.
OK, so as a former US Marine, I never thought I would own an AK47..I have had this AK for the past year and I have to say it is a BEAST. I have fired most of all the M16/M4 variants, but operating an AK, especially the  Yugo M70 AB2T Paratrooper style with under-folding stock has been a blast. Such a simple weapon, but so devastating and easy to use, I hate to sell it. It comes with a Bump Fire /Slide Fire Stock for super fast firing.

But at the end of the day I just do not shoot it enough. Its one of the best rifles I have shot, with the addition on the MOJO peep site it can hold its own with any M4 at 200 yards with iron sights.

I don’t know what the “marble” means.
I bought this in 2011 to use in a small Bullseye League.
I never used the soft case.
The shipping box and all the original paperwork, including the test fire bullet, is included.
There are five (5) total magazines also included.
The gun has replacement grips on it because one of the locating holes in the original grip was augered out a bit by someone who had the grips off. 
As seen in the photo with the label as well.
I never did remove the grips until I started to have failure to fire or cycle issues.
Long story short, the expanded pin locating hole on the grip allowed the grip to move slightly and prevent full slide motion.
The gun functions perfectly now with the new pretty oak-leaf cocobolo grips.
Perhaps someone with a good woodworking or the like skill could repair the original grips which are included in the sale.
I prefer a local sale.

The 3 sig 226 mags are factory and in good condition.  I'm willing to do $50 for all three or $230 for the beretta mags and sig mags together."

There are zero blemishes on the gun and no evidence of ever even having been fired. I cleaned it well after it's one and only outing and haven't had it out of the safe since.

This gun shoots like a dream and I really do love it, but it's really just not a practical firearm for me. I like to shoot the guns I have and not leave them unattended in the safe. It's a little difficult to shoot this gun really often as the ammo is a touch expensive.
