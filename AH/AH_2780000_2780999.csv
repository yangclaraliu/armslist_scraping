17,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2780017,For Sale:  Puma White Hunter Knife Pre 1961,"Anderson Township, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 550,"Listed On: Friday, March 7, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Knife and Sheath are in GREAT condition. A few MINOR scratches in the blade but they could easily be polished out by someone that knows what they are doing. According to the Puma Knife Man(http://www.pumaknifeman.com/), this knife was made between 1959-1961. There is no way to track exactly what year because they didn't start stamping them until 1961. My grandfather told me he picked it up while in the Vietnam War in the 50's so it had to of been 59. These knives sell NEW for $469.99. Being this is one of the first ones made I am selling this for $550. Comes with a near mint Sheath, no box though. Can provide big detailed pictures to those seriously interested. 

The PUMA® White Hunter knife is handmade in Solingen, Germany, and has long set the standard for the ultimate hunting knife. The PUMA White Hunter was developed in 1956 in conjunction with the East African Professional Hunter’s Association to be the leading knife for big game hunting. 
The PUMA White Hunter’s featured stag handles – which are made from the shed antlers of Wild Stag – are formed via a meticulous manufacturing process and make the knife a truly unique, one-of-a-kind tool. First, each scale is boiled, stabilized, and dried over a period of weeks. Then, the handle is individually cut and hand fitted to your knife. Brass rivets are used to attach the scales to the knife. The rivet heads are filed and, finally, the handle is burnished to a precise size and shape for optimal fit and function. 
The PUMA blade is German-grade 1.4116 stainless steel for sharpness retention, toughness, and corrosion resistance. During formation of the initial steel bars, trace elements such as carbon, chromium and silicon are added to maintain the temper yet inhibit rust. Other trace elements, such as manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, and molybdenum, are also added to give the blade better structural strength and consistency by aligning the molecules more evenly during cooling. After the initial steel bars are formed, the blade is hot-drop forged, wherein the steel bars are heated to 3150-4200 degrees Fahrenheit. Once heated, the blade is placed between two dies and mechanically forged under 2200 pounds of pressure to fit the shape of the dies. The hot drop forging process not only shapes the blade, but it also further improves the molecular structure of the steel. Once the PUMA blade is forged, it is tempered and hand finished in 22 separate steps by skilled craftsmen. Each step uses increasingly fine lubricants, oil coolants, and special polishing grease.

Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function.

The NHM-91 is a semi-automatic development of the Russian Kalashnikov AKM and RPK infantry small arm built by Norinco of China and marketed in the U.S. by China Sports Inc It is no longer imported to the USA..
It is Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM91 features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm)  along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.Like the RPK, the NHM 91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. 
The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs,

It is in excellent condition has had around 200 rounds through it if that ..  made in 1992 Also has The Double Hook Trigger Group, Sights are excellent on it as well ( NO  canted front sight) The barrel is chrome lined and Bore is bright and shiny , Sharp Rifling looks terrific:  This is a very nice gun everthing on it is is tight and is accurate ..

It has really nice bluing, with some strawed parts like the trigger, bolt release, bolt, etc. has some very little flecs of pitting on the exposed part of the barrel. Every single number on this rifle with the exception of the bolt body and extractor match either the rifle serial number or the assembly number on the bottom of the barrel. Even the stock and hand guard are numbered (stamped) to the rifle which is RARE. All the tangs, mag box, trigger guard, floor plate, safety, etc match. The vet who had it really took nice care of it. Also has the cleaning rod. Because this rifle is a battlefield captured rifle it does have a full unmolested MUM on the receiver. It is nicely struck. The stock is in really nice shape. The Jap who lost this rifle must have been an ""in the rear with the gear"" troop. It also has some nice cartouches. It is NOT import marked. 

If you would like to purchase the rifle payment will need to be received within seven days of the agreed deal. I will only accept a US Postal Money Order as payment. Along with your payment I will need a signed copy of either your C&R license or the signed license of the FFL in which you would like the rifle sent to for transfer. Shipping is a flat $40 insured. If you are local you can come pick it up in Roanoke.  No shipping to California. Item will be shipped from me, a private citizen, so if your FFL wants it shipped to them from an FFL it will cost another $30 for this service on my end. 

If you have any questions about the rifle or would like to offer a trade please feel free to email me through Armslist.  

Buy with confidence.  I have been doing firearms sales and internet auctions on GunBroker and Ebay for several years and have !00% and A+ ratings.  I am also a registered FFL/C&R holder.

These rifles are getting harder to find in this condition. The old vets who brought them home are now giving them up to another generation who will in turn hold on to them for another 50 years or so. 

Get it while you can. Semper Fi"

I'm switching to a midlength gas system. That is the only reason for the sale.

The upper is a BCM 14.5 carbine length gas system that has had exactly 30 rounds through it. The barrel twist is 1/7 so 5.56 is run easily through her. The flash hider is pinned and welded of course to bring it to 16 inches.

The lower is a Spikes Tactical complete lower.


Here are the specs and extras on the riifle:

-BCM Mod4 charging handle
-Magpul ladder rails
-BCM BCG
-BCM Gunfighter stubby angled  foregrip
-BCM Gunfighter MOD 2 pistol grip
-Magpul CTR Milspec stock
-YHM sling plate
-Haley Strategic Thorntail offset light mount
-Klarus XT-11 800 lumen weapon light (Insanely bright, momentary on and strobe buttons.) Look up reviews, great light.
-Midwest Industries 20G2 free floating rail (installed by gunsmith)
-Damage Industries QD sling mount


*Will not come with mags, ammo, case or sling as I am just switching rifles*



If you're not familiar with BCM, these are beyond milspec. If you're just looking for a plinker, I'd stick with a Bushmaster. But if you want a stick that will last you 20,000+ rounds, and never fail on you, BCM is your best bet. I've had three of them now and will never buy a different AR.

Price is firm at 1500 and please no trades. I have 1700+ in it so 1500 is a fair price for a brand new rifle.  I have my IN ID and LTCH. Email or text if you have any questions. REDACTED. Thanks for looking and have a great day."

Black. NEW with case never handled, never displayed. Item Description The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

As you can see from the photos, the gun has undergone an amateur stippling job, as well as had the bottom of the frame cut to allow for easy removal of the magazine should the need arise. 

I'll say this, it's not the prettiest thing in the world, but it will fulfil the needs of someone who is looking for a no slip, perminant grip, and doesn't care what the gun they got a really great deal on looks like.  It's really not that bad of a stippling job, it's just not the kind of quality work people pay a lot of money for these days.  It doesn't rub you the wrong way... it feels exactly how you want it to feel. 

It's got factory sights.  I'll throw in four gen 4 magazines, the case it came in, and 100 rounds of Winchester white box target ammo. 

Price is $400.  Looking to meet face to face in the greater Nashville area.  The best way to contact me would be to call or text me at REDACTED"

The unit will come bagged like the second picture and when put together by you (2 easy steps) will look like the picture of the complete launcher.

Please note:  Without following the proper NFA steps including the full Class III checks and tax stamps, this is only a flare launcher.  Be very sure you know the rules before you even think about putting anything else in this like is done by law enforcement in Europe.

Selling reloads makes you a manufacturer. A class 7 FFL is required and along with that goes massive insurance in case your ammo hurts someone and they decide to sue you. This is why there are large companies like Black Hills and BVAC and not just a bunch of guys on Craigslist selling reloads!
Don't add fuel to the anti-gun fire by getting sued or arrested by the ATF for manufacturing/selling w/o a license! Whether you are trying to make a few bucks or just trying to get folks some cheap ammo to shoot.... Don't!

Remington 700 BDL in 7mm Remington Magnum. It is built for a high caliber, lightweight hunting rifle for traveling when hunting for big game, but could easily be set up for a Bench/Target rifle. It features a Boyds Featherweight Thumb-Hole Pepper-Wood stock (Original nice BDL stock is included). Stock is lightweight but has nice recoil pad made for the stock so the recoil is not bad at all. When using the high grain 7mm mag ammo, it is comparable to a 30-06. It also has Leupold base and rings and a Leopold Vari-X III 4.5x14x40 (with objective yardage dial-in focus and Duplex Reticle) sighted in at 100 yards. I also have two boxes of HORNADY Red ballistic tip (high and Medium grain), Winchester Silver-tip ballistic tip high grain, and one box of Winchester brass rounds (High grain) for range. Also has Claw sling installed. Stock also has additional forward lug for a Bi-pod. Total amount invested in rifle is below. The bolt is very smooth (like new), the gun is very clean (inside barrel is like new), very flat-shooting, very powerful. Blueing is 90% from use, but overall round count is less than 40. I am someone who takes very good care of their things, this gun was no exception (regular cleanings/lubricating even when not used just to remove dirt particles from air inside cabinet). Carried more than shot. Spends most of its time in gun cabinet. Can send more pics from if needed.

Please let me know if you are interested. This gun does have Marlins proprietary Micro-Groove rifling system. The Micro-Groove system provides very uniform bore dimensions and a very smooth bore finish designed to improve accuracy, prevent gas leakage, and reduce bore fouling.
6-shot tubular magazine and 20"" Micro-Groove barrel,  hardwood stock has cut checkering and swivel studs. In short, the gun is in excellent condition and again, has zero dents or signs of wear. It’s ready for a scope and has the mounting screws in place.

The gun is in great condition and only shows minor wear on the end of the slide and top of rear sight. The gun comes with two 8 round magazines, hard carry case, and lock. 

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
