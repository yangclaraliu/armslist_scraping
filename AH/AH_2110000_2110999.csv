Product Engineer, Jon Zum, designed the Derma Plate Carrier from first hand experience during multiple combat deployments with inferior issued armored carriers. The exclusive, custom Ares Armor - AustriAlpin COBRA™ Buckles allow for quick donning and removal of the carrier. The triple bungee cummerbund positions plates close to the body projecting a power profile appearance while increasing the amount of coverage provided by plates as compared to bulkier carriers. Lastly, the maritime release reduces the possibility of drowning with its 6-inch pull fall away feature.

The Derma Carrier is an adjustable, low profile, lightweight armor carrier that encompasses the virtue of simplicity. The Derma Plate Carrier will do the following: carry plates and work with Molle Mag Pouches on the side interior and exterior.
Derma Plate Carrier Features

The Derma Plate Carrier Features: 
1000 D Cordura Construction, custom Ares Armor AustriAlpin COBRA™ Buckle, Loop Velcro on both the front and back, moisture wicking spacer mesh internal, S/M to fit small through medium plates, L/XL to fit large through extra large plates. Made in the USA. Comes with the Ares Armor Lifetime Warranty.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 
The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance. ""

329,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2110329,For Sale:  .300 AAC Blackout brass Reloading Brass bags of 100 ready to load,"Monticello, Minnesota, United States",$ 27,"Listed On: Friday, September 13, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The item for sale is one bag of 100 brass casings for 27.00 per bag, professionally trimmed, re sized, tumbled, and ready to loaded. These are all mixed brass from Lake City, Aquilla, Remington, Winchester, PMC, and ETC. They're all pre-bagged and counted ready to go. We will ship also. We have 20 bags left email for details. thanks for looking. We have more calibers squirreled away, just ask if we have some.

The .300 AAC Blackout (.300BLK). This cartridge was developed to launch 30 caliber projectiles from the AR platform without a reduction in magazine capacity and compatible with the standard bolt.
Full power 115-125 grain ammunition matches the ballistics of the 7.62x39mm AK, and eclipses 5.56mm with much higher-mass projectiles for a more dramatic effect on the target. Or choose subsonic cartridges for optimal use with a sound suppressor. Even out to 300 meters (=325 yards) the .300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters (= 480 yards) and for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters (= 500 yards) for a 16 inch barrel. The .300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter. (Please follow all NFA rules).
FOR HUNTING……Think of it as like a 30-30 but from an AR style platform. After you are done, you can remove your 10-round magazine and put in a 20, 30, 40, 60, or even 100 round mag for plinking or home defense. (remember all .223/5.56 mags work)"

Case and manual as well.  I'd consider selling, but I'd like to pursue a trade first.

The reason is, I'd like a Walther P99, but I don't care much for the newer generation models, I ONLY want the first gen model.  This is the one with the ""ski ramp"" trigger guard and fine serrations on the slide.  I prefer green, but black will work.

This gun was new or like new when I got it, and I have fired maybe 100 - 150 rounds total.  Kind of sad, I bought two of the high cap mags back during the ban for $60 a piece. Ouch.

Anyway, the Walther needs to be in similar condition.  Ideally, it has the box, manual and more importantly, the extra backstraps."

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

I bought it new last year and it has approx. 300 rounds of ammunition run through it.  It functions flawlessly, and has been cleaned meticulously.  It is sold in STOCK condition and is 922lr compliant.  I have several accessories that you may purchase as a package to ""dress up"" this M4.  Those accessories include an 18"" titanium extension tube with spring, and a Mesa Tactical Urbino Stock.  The price for just the firearm is $1,500, the price for the firearm and the uninstalled accessories is  $1,700 (accessories will ship separately).  I prefer face to face in the local Hampton Roads Area. Cash or PayPal are the only methods of payment.  If using PayPal, there is an additional 3% added to the cost.  For face to face transactions, you must be a valid resident of the US, current resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and preferably be a Concealed Weapons Permit Holder.  You must fill out a Firearm Transfer Form and part of the ATF form (questionnaire part) for this option. This assures me that you can pass a background check.  If you are not CWP holder, you will be subject to a background check by a local FFL (I'll pay the fee).  For all out of state purchases, an FFL tranfer will have to occur."

Obtaining the greatest accuracy for target shooting was the main reason for the development of the GLOCK 34 which has an extended barrel, greater slide dimensions, and unmatched reliability in a 9x19mm pistol. This highly accurate pistol has found widespread use as a competitive pistol for USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, GSSF and other sport shooting organizations."

Really nice pistol, I just don't have any other 9mm guns. Would trade for a .40, .45, .38/.357, .44, maybe a nice .380. Or maybe a hunting rifle in .30-06, or .308. Maybe others, I'm open to offers.

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

It is a 1999 Chevy Silverado 1500 Extended Cab 4x4 with 124K miles.  The truck is pewter in color.  The full-size gold Guidon bed topper has a full-height hatchback with smoked glass center access locking door and an adjustable top rail system for cargo.  The 6.5-foot truck bed interior itself is in great condition, with no rust.  The tailgate is in the garage and goes with the truck, and it is in perfect condition.

The cab interior is also in great condition, with factory fabric upholstery upgrade.  The dash and console are all in excellent condition, no additional electronics were ever mounted anywhere on it.  The carpet is in very decent shape, and the headliner is still 99%.  There is a problem with the adjustment mechanism under the driver's seat, but I haven't looked into it yet.  The radio works, the windows work, and none of the glass is bad.  The air will freeze you out in summer, and the heater will cook you once the engine warms.

At 93,000 miles, the gas pump malfunctioned and was replaced.

At 112,000 miles, the chassis was fully re-lubed, the 4x4 mechs were inspected and tested, the transfer case lubricant was replaced, the gas filter was replaced, the transmission filter was replaced along with all fresh transmission fluid, and the cooling system was drained, flushed and refilled.

At 119,000 miles, all four brakes were rejuvenated and lifetime pads installed. 
At 121,000 miles the tires were replaced with good all-season 70K radial A/T truck tires.

I bought the truck used with 23K miles on it, and it was regularly serviced at Gordy Boucher Ford of Janesville where I purchased it, and later at Bud Weiser Chevrolet of Beloit after the sale-included service contract expired at Boucher.  The truck had the factory recall work done by Bud Weiser Chevrolet.  The truck has had its oil and filters (both oil and air) and PCV/sensor changes at regular factory intervals or as deemed necessary by the onboard computer system.

The engine is a Vortec 5.3L 16-valve gasoline fuel-injected V-8, 270 HP, with a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and Tow/Haul Shift Modification feature for heavy loads, and it has the Z71 highway suspension.  Other features include:  a heavy-duty 600 amp battery and heavy-duty alternator, stainless steel exhaust, electronic transmission control, automatic locking hubs with push-button 4-wheel-drive and electronic transfer case, skid plates, full-size spare tire, front and rear anti-roll bars, 16”  standard factory alloy wheel rims, speed-sensing power steering, and power ABS disc brakes.  There are no fluid leaks under the truck.

This truck has been used to haul both payload and heavy trailer for both work and recreation.  She’s not as pretty as she was new, and the rocker panels are getting bad due to GM's poor design of breather slots underneath, but the rest of the body panels are in good shape, and the bed is scratched but rock solid.  As stated previously, she has been regularly and well maintained by professionals, and is the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  With a few exceptions for short-distance hauling, and taking the family to Florida impromptu without a glitch in 2010, the truck has been parked for the last five and a half years.

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

Serial number dates this gun as manufactured in mid-1977.  Classic Black on Black stock/barrel colors.  Small amount of surface rust but will easily wipe off.  Gun is mechanically perfect and fires straight and true with no fouling or misfires.  Rifle was purchased new by my grandfather to teach me and my brothers to shoot.  Always cleaned and stored inside.  this gun was re-discovered wrapped up in an old rug in a corner of the old hall closet as we were cleaning out the old house to sell it.  i havent touched the dust/misc grime that has settled on the outside so i can show the gun exactly as it was found. it will easily wipe clean, but i want to show it honestly and i think the story of this rifle's history is worth telling.....so the buyer can clean it as he wishes!

Remington's Nylon 66 was their 1st attempt at a synthetic stock, mass-produced gun, and they hit a homerun with this one!  These guns are now very collectable and their value seem to keep going up every year.  The Nylon 66 was the gun every boy wanted when they were growning up as a first gun to learn how to shoot, and they are so well-built and reliable that many of them are still around today, shooting just as good as they did 30 years ago!
this gun is in good condition and is a great value for the $, both as a firing, usable rifle, and an investment.
i will accept reasonable offers, and trades (looking for a project motorcycle, honda CB or similiar. let me know what you have and we will talk.) i have several old guns for sale/trade and we can work a deal +/- $ for the right bike.

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

Test fired only, then cleaned and put back in the box, and that was only with 38 Special target rounds, not .357.  This is the J Frame model with 2 1/8 inch barrel, which makes an excellent light-weight concealed carry weapon with plenty of knock-down power.  

Price is $600, much less than you would have to pay a gun shop, if you could find one in stock.  I am open to hearing proposals of interesting trades.  Selling only because this is my only .357 and I'm trying to keep guns in few calibers in these days of ammunition shortages.  Honestly, .357 is hard to find, but 38 Special is cheap and plentiful and this gun will fire those rounds as well.

Also included is a combat grip, as well as the boot grip pictured in the photographs.  If you are local I'll throw in a new box of .357 and whatever I have left in 38 Special.

Face to face local transaction (some driving OK if we meet in between).  I will ship anywhere this weapon is legal, but only if you pay actual shipping costs and the FFL fees at both ends.

If you have any question about me, check my eBay feedback.  Have been buying and selling for 15 years with 100% positive feedback, including very high ticket items.  My eBay ID is saludatrader."
