So as far as I know, they've had 200 rounds through them. The barrel is marked ""223/5.56 1-9"". My friend says it's not chrome-lined, but does appear to have a chrome chamber. The barrel is M4 profile with M4 feed ramps. That's about all I know about the stuff.

Visibility ranges approximately 50 yards in the daytime to more than 600 yards at night. Constructed of high-performance thermoplastic, which prevents a battery from getting cold over a longer period of time, the Sightmark LoPro Green Laser is not only resistant to cold weather, but also heat protected.

Here is the D.C. Engineering Dragunov Style Norinco SKS in like new condition. This company, DC Engineering, is worth taking a look at. They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragunov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragunov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragunov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers a magazine adapter to use AK47 mags. $475.00 Cash only at this time.

Info on the round from DRT website:
""Utilizing our Terminal Shock technology, you don’t need a heavier 45 ACP bullet to inflict massive damage to the target. The technology is designed to transfer 100% of the 150 grain bullet’s energy into the target, providing maximum stopping power as quickly as possible. Keeping the bullet weight to 150 grains yeilds comparatively lighter felt recoil and therefore faster and more accurate follow up shots. Another benefit for high round count shooters is less wear on your weapon. The bottom line is that you simply don't need heavy bullets to cause extreme tissue damage to the intended target. The 45 bullet is designed to penetrate 9-11” in ballistic gelatin and to have a wound cavity of up to 3” in diameter. It will penetrate soft barriers like sheet rock, plywood, car doors, and windshields."""

Do the research on YouTube and you'll find that this is one of the finest, most well made examples of an AK anywhere in the world.  The dust cover is hinged and this pistol version is just begging to be SBR'd.
I hand stained and polished the wood and added a really sweet Magpul AFG angled foregrip, which isn't a true vertical foregrip by ATF standards so it's compliant, yet gives great control when firing this rig.
I also added a CAA ergo grip which reduces felt recoil and a shorty picatinny rail on top which still allows the factory iron sights to be used and looks great with the included Bushnell red dot sight.
This Zastava is a 7.62x39mm fire breather and the muzzle fire will extend several feet out and attracts a lot of attention at the range when shooting commando style.  I've put around 300 rounds through it and it's never jammed or had a single malfunction even once.  It will eat whatever you put in it including cheap TulAmmo...it's not picky at all and is so much fun to shoot.  I can easily hit a 6 inch metal target at 100 yards using the factory sights and they have a single flip adjustment out to 200 yards.
The factory 30 round metal magazine allows the bolt to stay open after the last round.  Everything is so precise on this gun and the trigger is better than my AR-10.
I have my CFP and prefer those with the same.  Buyer must be at least 18 and have a valid drivers license and be able to legally own and operate a firearm."

Unfortunately, my barrel has a rifle length gas system, so this upper would leave about 2-3 inches of the gas tube exposed...that's not what I want.

So, now I need to sell it.  My mistake can be your gain as I'm pricing this 10% below what I paid for it.

This thing really is brand new.  Has never had a round fired from it.   Actually the only time the barrel was even inserted into the upper was for about 2 minutes for me to realize my mistake.  It comes with all original accessories in the original box.

A Custom 30.06 barrel, & a custom Monte Carol walnut wood stock. Made in Nazi Germany, in 1942, during world war II. The Swastikas have been almost polished off by a gunsmith. All Serials on all parts are matching Numbers, the bolt, the receiver, the floor plate, everything, is matching numbers. This is clearly not some Peace of junk, like those other Yugoslavian Junk Rifles that's been piece parted together. Each part on my German Mauser has the serial 9009. Everything matches except the like Brand new replacement 30.06 barrel & stock. The Barrel is just been broken in. Perfect. But the rifle has no sights yet, it needs the bolt handle modified, because it is a wide arc bolt handle that will not have enough clearance under a scope. & the safety to. It includes the Scope mounts & Rings. So, I'm saleing as is. You must take it down to a gunsmith for further Modification. I never got around to it yet, though. Maybe you or whoever is buying it will have the time to get this perfect World War 2 Relic worked on by a gunsmith. Phone me for more info if you want to buy it, or come over & look it over, My number is REDACTED Ask for Luke.
I say its in Mint Condition since its been through war, its previous owner must have really taken care of it. Not only that Some Poor Dumb Nazi Bastard gave his life for it, in the Great world War 2. Plus, No telling how many Jews it could have killed when it had its original 8mm Mauser barrel & stock. But for sure I believe this rifle has killed before in war."

I purchased it new almost 1 year ago. It has around 1k rounds through it.

The gun has light finish wear along the outside of the barrel where it contacts the slide, and along certain parts of the rails and underside, from riding in a holster. 

All wear on the internals is light-the level you would expect from a gun with approx. 1k rounds through it, and the gun functions flawlessly with everything I've fed it from 115 gr FMJ target rounds to 147 gr hollow points. I have never had a single malfunction out of it.

This gun has been cleaned and re-lubed once a month and/or after every range visit since I got it. I'm a neat freak when it comes to keeping my tools clean.

This gun is a trooper, and it has been a reliable carry gun and range toy for me over the past several months. Honestly it kills me to get rid of it and I will miss it dearly, but I've fallen on some really hard times and I need the money.

I paid $700 new, I'm asking $550. I'm willing to negotiate within reason. I'll also include a custom made-to-fit Crossbreed Super Tuck IWB holster ($80 new, extremely comfortable) for an additional $40.

Here's a link to an album of picture on photobucket so you can see details.
http://s1207.photobucket.com/user/bwattier/library/Beretta%2092A1?sort=3&page=1

I'll conduct the transaction face-to-face only, I'll need you to sign a bill of sale, and you'll need a valid CC Permit. You know, the normal routine for this sort of thing.

This is your chance to get a great deal on a barely-used, legendary handgun!"

The American Lefever Nitro Special was introduced in 1921 and discontinued in 1948.  It was not a true Dan Lefever design; rather it was an Ithaca boxlock design, the precursor of the famous Ithaca NID that appeared four years later. Ithaca had bought Lefever in 1916 and wanted to capitalize on the famous name. The earlier Lefever double guns manufactured by the Lefever Arms Company and D.M. Lefever and Sons were highly regarded and are mostly collectors' items today. 

The Nitro Special was not a fancy gun, but it was hell for strong. Nitro Specials were designed for modern smokeless powder shells (but not steel shot) and any Nitro Special that has not been abused should be safe to use today, which is why the model is included here. 

Most Nitro Specials have color case hardened receivers, double triggers, plain extractors, a low solid rib, and semi-pistol grip walnut stocks and splinter forearms checkered about 16 lpi. However, there were variations, including beavertail forearms and a single selective trigger. Gauges were 12, 16, 20, and .410 bore.   Item G-34389-1
