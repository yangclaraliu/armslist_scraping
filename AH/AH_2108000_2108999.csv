Both complete PSA uppers that have been head spaced and test fired from the factory. Both have SAA lowers built with PSA parts kits. 

Here are some specs on the uppers:

Barrel: 16"" Chrome-lined, chrome moly vanadium. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system. The M4 profile barrel is high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated. Barrel is finished off with an .750"" diameter F-marked front sight base with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider. Barrel is made for us right here in SC by FN Manufacturing.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring M4 feedramp cuts, T-marks, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.
Lower: SAA Forged 7075 T6 aluminum. Milspec diameter buffer tubes. 
Both rifles have 8620 steel full auto M16 profile carriers, chrome lined; and staked chrome lined gas keys.
Both rifles come with a Magpul PMag and foam lined PSA box.

Differences between the two rifles I have:
-The first rifle has an 8620 steel bolt that has been Magnetic Particle Inspected(MPI). Also, this rifle has a removable carry handle/rear sight and has a standard M4 style buttstock.
-The second rifle has a 158 steel bolt that has been High Pressure Tested(HPT) and MPI.  This rifle has an aluminum flip up rear sight(not pictured) and has a BLACKHAWK buttstock with QD sling swivel.

Sorry for the graphic novel of a description.  Both of these rifles are better quality than most ""off the shelf"" rifles in this price range. Email with any questions. Price is $850 each. $1600 for both. Thanks for looking."

It currently has a brand new Eotech EXPS2-0 and a primary arms 3x magnifier with flip to the side mount. I just sited it in a few weeks ago and have only put about a hundred rounds through the rifle. It also has flip up sites just in case. I have a soft case for it that I am including. I hate to get rid of it after recently getting all the parts together to assemble it but I need the money. Wait lists are getting longer and longer for these guns and they are hard to come by. With all the upgrades and everything I think this is a fair price.

Gun comes with five 15 round factory magazines, Trijicon HD sights (orange front), a new (gun inserted, not carried) Milt Sparks Summer Special II (tan, but comes with a set of black straps), and ammo.

Ammo is 450 rounds of Speer Gold Dot, a partial box of Federal HST, and 700 rounds of Speer Lawman. 

I forgot to get a pic of the holster, but if interested let me know and I will get you some.

This whole setup ran a bit over 1400, but will let it all go for 1150 shipped (ammo weighs a lot). My father wants an M&P 9 to replace the model 60 I gave him, and I want more ammo.

Thanks for looking. Not interested in any trades. Postal money order, if you please, and as always no sales to those who aren't supposed to have this stuff.

Product Description
The 7-Rest is a truly innovative shooting accessory that utilizes a unique design to deliver exceptional versatility and true value. The asymmetric frame provides great stability while maximizing length adjustability. By simply loosening the lock knob, the angle between the two halves of the frame can be adjusted to change the distance between the front and rear supports. Having the frame offset to the side of the gun also gives adequate clearance for extended magazines on semi-autos (AR-15), lever actions and rolling blocks.

Its a taurus 5 shot snub, these work fine in my brother's larger frame ruger.  I'm willing to trade for ammo in any of the following calibers:  .357 (brass shells only), .38. .45, .223/5.56, .308, 12 gauge (slugs or bucks only).  May trade for other stuff, don't really need the money just need the safe space for ammo I can actually use.  Will also trade for fired brass in .223\5.56 or .308. Price is fair and non-negotiable. If we make a trade it will only be for market value.  

If you have never shot these in your gun don't blame me if they get stuck.  There are plenty of reviews online and even youtube videos so do a little research if your not sure.  Here is Midway's add on the same ammo.

In House Bill 13-1229(Universal Background Checks Law) Page 4 lines 26 and 27 as well as page 5 lines 1 and 2 clearly outline a specific exemption to the law.  Feel free to read it here:  http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/billcontainers/590C29B4C02AFC2F87257A8E0073C303/$FILE/1229_01.pdf

The exemption specified pertains to 'Curio and Relic' firearms.  Any gun that is 50 years old or older or any gun specificly outlined by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms is considered to be a 'Curio and Relic'.

What does this all mean to you?  It means you are lawfully allowed to sell any weapon that is 50 years old to anyone legally allowed to own a firearm in the state of Colorado WITH OUT A BACKGROUND CHECK!!  That means no fees, no hassles.  Now that you have been educated a bit, ill tell you what I have for sale :).  Please pass this information along.

For sale I have a Chinese Type 53 Mosin Nagant.  It's chambered in the standard 7.62x54r round.  This round is about equivalent to a 30-06.  Ammo for it is incredably cheap, about 0.25 per round or less.  The type 53 is a clone of the Russian m44.  They are exactly the same.  

This gun was made in 1955.  The guns bluing looks pretty good.  The stock doesn't look to bad for a t-53 as most stocks for these are pretty beat up.  It's missing a very small peice of wood right at the butt plate.  It does not affect the function of the gun at all.  There is some light pitting on the bolt, not on the bolt face however.  It had a bit of surface rust that I scrubbed off.  The gun is complete and looks like it will function just fine.  I have not shot it as I have 5 of these.  The other 3 I have shot and they function beautifully.  I have no reason to believe this one wont as well.  The bolt locks up nicely and it dry fires just fine.  Has a very smooth trigger pull.  I have my Curio and Relic licence so this will have to be logged out of my book properly so I will need to see a valid CO ID or a valid copy of your c&r licence.  

Check into obtaining a curio and relic licence yourself.  It only costs $30 and allows you to buy firearms online(c&r qualified only) with out a background check and they can be shipped right to your house!

I would like to meet face to face in the fountain/south Colorado Springs area.  I can ship but you will have to pay shipping and it will need to be transferred through a valid FFL.

Asking a very reasonable $129 obo.  Will also look at possible trades for firearms only!!  I don't want pot or tattoos!!"

Unlike rests that require heavy weights, the DLX uses compression damper technology to progressively absorb recoil; thus eliminating damage to gun, stock, or bedding. After each shot the gun returns to battery to put you right on target. The rest is constructed from powder coated welded steel, and the set includes a remote hydraulic trigger release to eliminate any human motion contamination. Convenient and portable it weighs just 13 lbs. With the compression damper in place it will handle anything from a .270 WIN up to a .375 H & H. With the damper removed and the optional spring pack (included), installed, it will handle light recoiling guns such as .223 / 5.56, .22-250, etc.

""ATI Factory 10 Shot Magazines 9mm for HP9 FS9 CS9 American Tactical Imports Pistols New Blue Steel models HP-9 also Beretta 8000 Cougar with 1/4 inch protrusion $29 per on 3 or more. Here is ATI’s factory 10 shot magazine for its well made, slick-finished FS9, CS9, and HP9 series of pistols, modeled and named after John Moses Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Italian influence, rather than Belgian, is more in evidence on the pistol itself as well as on its magazine. The tell-tale marking on the magazine is its patent number 5386657, a Mec-Gar patent. These magazines also fit the ATI FS-9 and CS-9 pistols. Interestingly, it will not fit a 92F series Beretta, but it works just fine in the Beretta 8000 Cougar pistols with only a quarter inch or so of protrusion past the butt of the Cougar’s grip frame. Construction is smooth bright blue finished steel, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer extended floorplate and cartridge follower. This magazine flush fits the grip frame of the HP-9 pistol, as opposed to its standard issue extended twenty rounder.  Replacement pricing on this magazine often approaches $40 a piece for the ten rounders, even more for the issue magazines that usually come with the pistols.  Single Mag price is $39.00"""

Yes, this gun is around 20 yrs old but it still ROCKS like a Gen4. The trigger, frame, slide, barrel and sights, and mags are all in great shape. The mags are 17rds, the one on the left is a Gen4 (ambidextrious mag release slots). This Glock doesnt show its age at all. The only things that have been done is I just recently replaced the guide rod with a stainless steel drop in unit from Ilovemyglock dot com. I will include the OEM guide rod and spring, theres nothing wrong with it I just wanted Stainless :) And it has the Pierce grip plug so there is no open hole in the end of the grip. The only reason Im selling this is to buy a Glock 30.

I will also include the holy grail of 9mm ammo... 100 rds of Winchester Ranger SXT's! These are also known as 'Black Talon'. It was the best money couldnt buy back in the day but was banned for law enforcement use in the 90's due to the way it expands. It was found to be very difficult to remove from the deceased and many criminals were buried with the bullet still in them. This was determined to be cruel and unusual by the libertards. But us decent common folk can still use them for personal protection, yay! I recently found some stashed away that were forgot about. They still shoot great. But be thrifty about it, these are very rare. Check Gunbroker dot com. There are modern day versions of this ammo (sold in 40 rd boxes with the words Black Talon) but that isnt the real mccoy. These are, dont waste your money on knock offs.

The Mariner®, with Mossberg''s exclusive Marinecote™ finish , is ideal for hostile weather environments, coastal environments, boat patrol, etc. The Mariner is the ideal choice when a vehicular-mounted shotgun is subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation on weapons. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action.3"" Chambered in 12 Gauge Heavy-Walled Barrel, Metal Trigger Guard and Safety Buttons Built to Mil Spec demands.

They include:

- CMP 1943 Remington M1903a3: Minty bore, all bluing at about 97-98%, VERY accurate rifle. All parts appear to be ""R"" marked. I have the CMP certificate of authenticity for it, original owner bought it from them in 2002 and never shot it.

- 1928 Springfield M1903: Very nice bore, SUPER clean stock, metal finish is around 85% with a greyish look, very nice rifle and an outstanding shooter.

- 1944 Springfield M1 Garand: Tight shiny bore, appears to be all correct, very clean and nice stock, metal is in great condition. Very accurate (as Garands typically are).

- 1943 Remington made M1903a4: Gunsmith built, beautifully done and as close to as an original as you can get. NOT A GIBBS OR CREEDMOOR BUILD, this was built on an original/non-welded barreled action. Stock is ""K"" type and is simply beautiful, all metal finish is 99-100%, bore is like new. Has original M73B1 Weaver scope in great condition, crystal clear. Comes with leather M1907 sling.

- BCD 4 Kar98k LSR Sniper: Another gunsmith build, this was done by a gentlemen on gunbroker who has an expertise in mounting LSR and SSR mounts. Mount was hand-fitted to the shape of the receiver wall. Chamber has a bit of corrosion, but should be easily fixed. Very accurate, only problem is the chamber which just makes the shell extraction hard, other than that it is a BEAUTIFUL rifle with about 100% bluing. Has rare late-war ""D"" marked Gustloff milled trigger guard (without lock screws). Scope is a repro PE scope which is essentially brand new. Also comes with leather sling.

Here's a few things I'm interested in:
- Remington 700 5R in .308 with threaded muzzle. An AICS stock would be nice too, but the OEM stock is just as suitable.
- Remington 700 XCR long range model in .308
- Remington 700P in .308 w/26"" barrel
- Nice AR15, must have at least a 18"" long heavy or bull barrel with flat top receiver
- AR10 rifle, minimum 20"" barrel, flat top receiver
- G41 rifle
- G43/K43 rifle
- Israeli HB FAL

I am somewhat open to other offers, but the list above pretty much covers strictly what I'm looking for.

It is a great shooting rifle with a wonderful trigger. The #'s match on the bolt, receiver and magazine floorplate. The bore is in wonderful shape. I bought this from the last person who owned it as a project. He had refinished the stock. It turned out alright but I was going to redo myself. I reblued the receiver and the front end of the barrel. It turned out real nice. The rifle really groups well even with Surplus ammo. This rifle was shooting really high at 100yds as is normal with these so I installed a Brownells front sight blank and I havent had the chance to file it down. It's all ready for you to get it sighted in all perfect the way you want it. I installed a new, stronger spring for the firing pin. I installed a k98 floorplate with the bolt stop. (The original one will be included with the sale). It also comes with a Yugo bayonet, sheath, frog and leather ammo pouch. 

I also have ammo for sale for this. It's 1950's Yugo Surplus ammo. Most of it on stripper clips.

We created this and it will be happening with ammo very soon.
All the fools went out and spent their hard earned money on WAY overpriced firearms (some still doing it for ammo) you know who you are and now the shelves are filling up with orders placed a year ago with no one to purchase. If you are selling, do not show me the retail price. Take it and subtract $25% because that is what anyone can get it for almost everywhere. I am not talking about a chain like DICK's or Academy Sports! They are not a complete rip off but they are NOT a good deal anymore.
Just like buying a car, do your research. You are reading this so you are not completely inept. If someone says 550 rounds of cheap as .22 ammo is any more than $18.50, tell them to fuck off!"

Just got spoiled with the a/c unit in my new car and never drove the skylark since. It needs new tires and a battery and it should turn over on a drop of a hat like it always did.

The interior is nicer than my 2010 charger. Paint is perfect. some pics make the roof look sun damaged but it is just dust. paint is very nice when washed and buffed out. Also professionally installed all kenwood audio system. Kept all original radio and speakers in and the kenwood in the glove box and the speakers in there own boxes I put on top of the back seat by the rear windshield. I have over $8000 in this beauty.

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. . Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. . Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. . Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. . Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. . No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. . Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. . Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. . Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half- cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. . High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm."

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. . Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. . Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. . Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. . Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc."
