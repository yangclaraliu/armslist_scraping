The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V5 Lightweight is approximately five ounces lighter than the standard V5. It's perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs. The DDM4v5 LW is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

With hotter loads exiting the muzzle at nearly 2000 fps with around 2000 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle, the .454 Casull is an impressive cartridge. This is a VERY POTENT handgun!
 To give you a comparison of how powerful it really is, the venerable .357 Magnum has around 500 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle. The Taurus Raging Bull 454 really is like holding the power of a raging bull in your hands! Capable of releasing 5 of these powerful rounds in a matter of seconds makes the Raging Bull a formidable weapon. To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull. The rust resistant stainless steel matte finish helps ensure good looks for the life of this revolver."

 FNH FNS-40 .40 S&W PISTOL 14+1 BLACK FINISH- WITH NIGHT SIGHTS, 3 14-RD MAGS, TAC RAIL – MODEL 66942

The FNS 40 is the result of years of research incorporating the most precise engineering and product development to bring the most highly-advanced striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and personal defense market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a pivoting hinged trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short travel to reset. The matte black polymer frame comes with four interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. The fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for easy access without snagging on holsters or clothing. The contoured frame-mounted manual safety is ideally placed for positive operation by either thumb. The FN FNS offers a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide is equipped with front and rear cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed combat sights with a Deep-V rear sight that allows for better visibility of the front sight for faster sight picture and target acquisition. The FN FNS also is equipped with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.

One of the best carry weapons in the world.. They call these M&P's ""The Glock Killer"" because they out perform glocks and look 10x better while doing it. 

comes with 2 magazines 12+1, manual, back straps, carrying case, lock, EVERYTHING that came with it. It also has a 1911 style ambidextrous safety along with ambidextrous slide release and a swappable mag release for lefty or righty.

Reason for sale: Basically I bought 5 guns.. 3 compacts, one full size gun, 1 rifle. I normally carry a revolver and was weighing my options, the gun I decided to keep was a full size gun for a bedstand gun, the compact I liked the most was this m&p 9c, it was better than the m&P shield especially because I'm lefty but I liked the more rounds and the all around feel to the weapon more. But I want the full size gun and can't keep both financial wise. So in other words this gun is truly flawless. I'm not selling off my problems like most gun sellers, I just need the money.

This gun is not cheap - http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Smith-Wesson-MP-Compact-Handgun&i=422363

You can't find it in a store for less than $550-$650 then you add tax and processing fees..

my price is $500, no tax, fees, paperwork or anything like that.

I really need cash but will consider cash + trade.. $350 + shotgun.. deals like that I would consider for the right guns. (Not only shotguns make me an offer with any gun)"

The SR-556/6.8 retains all the features of the original SR-556 that make it an outstanding value in the AR-style rifles. The patent-pending, two-stage piston delivers a smooth power stroke to the one-piece bolt carrier, which softens recoil, aiding both shooter comfort and durability of the rifle. The four-position gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to the ammunition being fired and environmental conditions present. A chrome-lined, cold hammer forged barrel provides accuracy and longevity, Troy Industries Folding Battlesights™, Quad Rail and rail covers add considerable value to the package, as does the Hogue® Monogrip®, six-position stock, sight adjustment tool, and the padded carry case, all included with the SR-556/6.8."

I'm putting this gun up for sale...I'd really like to unload it.  It has ONE problem...I'm telling you up front:

  It is a CAI-made Polisher underfolder, US made receiver and barrel.  I know, that ain't great.  AND...the front trunnion is installed crooked. (see below picture).  It looks bad but it has not affected function once, and there is NO extra wear marks from it and is actually about as smooth an action as I've had.

The PLUS is that it is extremely accurate.  Do a google search even, this run of Polish Underfolders were made with REALLY tight barrels, with brown bear this thing was turning in .75"" groups at 50 yards.

  So there it is, the downside, plus the plus side.   I am wanting this to move, I believe the plus of good accuracy outweights the bad.     Parts count is:
 Receiver
Barrel
Trigger group (3).
Pistol grip.
 Slant Break.
  With a US barrel, receiver and trigger group, you can slap on almost any type of surplus furniture as long as the PG or muzzle is US made.

I am listing this for a relative. It was purchased just a few days ago as a carry gun. I warned them it might be heavier than they like since they were shooting my 642, but they did not listen. Guess what, I was right and they want the lightweight .38spl model. This gun is very rare and sells at Keiths for $785+$10 new. The gun features an upgraded trigger, unique fluted barrel with full under lug, and factory installed trijicon night sights. It is also cut for moonclips (moonclips included). It really is an awesome gun for carry if you want a full powered .357mag revolver."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh Mossberg 500 Special Purpose Mariner 12 gauge Shotgun! The Marinecote finish has been proven to last longer than stainless steel, and also makes for much smoother action throughout. This model also comes with a pistol grip kit to convert the shotgun to a home defense model, if necessary.



I only have ONE in stock, and it is ON SALE and priced to sell quickly for only $435.00 (cash price).




Mossberg 500 Special Purpose Mariner 12 Gauge Shotgun, Pump , 18.5″ Barrel, 3 in Chamber, Black Stock, Marinecote Finish, Pistol Grip Kit- Mossberg 50273
The Mariner®, with Mossberg”s exclusive Marinecote™ finish , is ideal for hostile weather environments, coastal environments, boat patrol, etc. The Mariner is the ideal choice when a vehicular-mounted shotgun is subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation on weapons. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action.

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

 Beretta CX4 Storm 8045 .45 acp Carbine w/ 16.6″ Barrel, Two 8rd Magazines, Top and Bottom Accessory Rail – JX48520


The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The CX4 Storm 8045 Carbine includes Two .45 acp 8-round magazine. The barrel is 16.6″ and has a black synthetic CX4 stock.

 New, In Box! The Ruger SR9 series (and the FNS 9 Series) are reputed to have the nest out-of-the-box triggers in the industry. An excellent trigger is key to accurate first and follow-up shots. 

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Please do not contact me in attempts to negotiate a lower price unless you find a lower advertised price. I guarantee and will meet the lowest, confirmable, advertised, delivered price. 

If you are an Arizona resident, I am compelled to charge you the 5.6% Arizona state sales tax. If you possess a current Arizona CCW permit, I will not need to perform an instant background check upon you. If you do not possess an Arizona CCW permit, the instant background check requires about four or so minutes.

If you live out of state, I can ship this to your FFL for an additional $20.

If you have never fired an HK45 there is no other 45 like it IMO. Shoots as soft as my 9mm 1911's and is just as accurate as my 1911 45 pistols. It is the ultimate in combat weapon and there is no better HD pistol on the market. For you USP fans... this blows them away. I have owned well over 10 USP's and there is a reason I do not own any now. That reason is the HK45... Since I own 3 of these, I figure I will sell one to free up room for something else..."

A truly concealable Glock in a caliber that counts,  And, Glock is perfection!

This Glock has fired fired approximately 200 rounds--just enough to be correctly broken-in. It comes with the Top-of -the-Line Ghost 3.5-pound connector (installed), as well as the original 5.5-pound connector. The Glock barrel and feed-ramp are chrome-polished and  ""MOLON LABE"" is engraved on the barrel. It is gorgeous and has even improved function.

There is really no more-reliable, truly practical, concealed carry pistol than this beauty. The new Glock double recoil spring make this tremendous pistol so easy to control, and easy to  accurately place the critical first shot as well as follow-up shots.

Although bullet technology has made the 9 mm a much more useful self-defense round, the same technological improvements have been made in larger caliber rounds, including the 45 ACP. In terms of the per-shot effectiveness, there really is no comparison between current 9 mm and current 45 caliber rounds.

Less informed people say, "".40 Smith & Wesson is a great compromise caliber."" That may be a correct statement for FULL-sized, heavier pistol. However, for smaller, more practical, concealed carry pistols, the .40 Smith & Wesson round is not particularly desirable. This is because the .40 caliber Smith & Wesson is an extremely high pressure round. In a shorter, lighter pistol, this leads to significantly increased ""muzzle flip;"" it makes the accurate placement of follow-up shots more difficult and time-consuming. The recoil from a 45 caliber pistol is more of a push backwards than an upward snap; effective follow-up shots are easier.

In terms of rounds count, the Glock 36 holds seven rounds, including one in the chamber. There are those who talk about the importance of higher rounds count. FBI statistics show the number of rounds fired in self-defense situations to be far less than seven-even when dealing with multiple attackers. As an NRA instructor, I enlighten my students that there is a balance between concealability, lighter weight and comfort versus a less concealable, larger, heavier pistol with more rounds. A self-defense pistol is one that you want to wear every day. A larger, heavier and bulkier one will, even subconsciously, deter you from carrying it every day.

If a person is truly concerned about rounds count for some poorly guided reason, he should consider carrying the spare magazine. I carry a spare with a Pierce +2 extension in a particular pocket of my cargo pants. The combination of the loaded pistol and the second magazine is far more comfortable and less conspicuous. It also gives me nine more rounds, for a total of 16. That, in the opinion of many, may be significant and unnecessary overkill!"

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured.

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

The RM07 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 
With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life, turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.  
The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

Includes everything it came with when new, including the RM34 Picatinny rail mount which is not pictured BUT IT IS INCLUDED.

This optic was mounted on a S&W M&P Pro Series C.O.R.E., fired a couple hundred rounds and decided it’s not for me.
Great optic and is in “Like New” condition.

A lot of it is good to go, but after counting out 500 there's about 25 to 40 that are either dented or oxodized due to being exposed to the elements then repackaged.

While the blue convertible BN44X models are fairly common, there were only 537 of the stainless KBN44X models made and shipped to Davidson's in the early 1990's. Production was scattered through the serial number range 47-40974 to 47-62202. Most of the stainless 4-5/8"" guns you see are .45 Colt only. Never a cataloged model.
