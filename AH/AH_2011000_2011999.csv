In my 30 plus years of collecting firearms I believe I have acquired enough knowledge and expertise to know when a firearm because of condition has not been subjected to the wear of normal use.  Argentine 1911A1's were made on the same machinery as Colt 1911A1's and were made of the finest British, Swedish and German steel.  I have never seen a 1911A1 with a barrel as shiny on the inside as this one.  All numbers match except the magazine which is only 5 digits difference.  All systemas were originally finished in black oxide,except a few that were specially ordered for the Navy.  Many were later re-finished, most Navy pistols in parkerization. Only 6,226 Systemas were made for the Argentine Navy.    More information can be read on the 1911 Forum when you do a search on the Argentine 1911A1's. This pistol was manufactured in 1958 and is in great shape, see the pictures."

Enjoy uncompromising, quality and performance from our extensive PMC Bronze™ Line. All PMC cartridges pass rigorous inspection at our electronic powder-check station, which instantly and accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by as little as two-tenths of one grain, the system stops, and the cartridge is discarded. No other ammunition manufacturer can assure greater uniformity and reliability than PMC. These valued characteristics run throughout our entire line.
Our Full Metal Jacket cartridges incorporate a lead core bullet enclosed in a heavy copper topcoat, resulting in little to no expansion and deeper penetration of the bullet. Our PMC-FMJ provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semi-auto handguns.

It is a full carbon steel slide and frame and has a beautiful dark blued finish on it. This was my carry gun for a few years. It was shot little and carried a lot so there is a little finish wear on it. The most noticeable finish wear is on the backstrap and grip safety and is shown in the photos. There is also a tiny bit of finish wear on the front corners of the slide from holstering. This wear is barely noticeable. There are a few modifications done to this gun from stock (all performed by a gunsmith). It has a Wilson Combat grip safety, an Ed Brown Hardcore Extractor, and has had the series 80 trigger safety components removed and a frame insert installed in its place. This gives it a very light, but not too light, trigger. I have also replaced the terrible A2 sights it came with with Trijicon night sights. The firing pin was also upgraded with a Colt factory titanium firing pin. I will include the series 80 parts with the gun in case you'd rather have them on hand. Also for no extra charge I will have the series 80 parts put back in before shipping if you wish. Personally I much prefer the trigger without them. I am including 2 factory Colt 7-round magazines. Factory hard case included as well as the manual."

It is brand new, has never been fired. The cosmoline is still present on the receiver. 
This is a reliable Italian made Fausti shotgun and is constructed with the same high-quality materials that you'll find on guns that cost 2 or 3 times the price of this one.
The wooden stock on it has a beautiful grain and the nickel-plated receiver is finely engraved. It is hard to capture how finely engraved this gun is in a picture, but I tried my best to show it. This shotgun features a brass bead front sight, a top tang-mounted safety, automatic ejectors, a first barrel selector switch near the trigger, and a coin-finished receiver with heavy engraving. It includes two screw-in choke tubes and a soft case.
This gun has never been fired and it shows. It is in pristine condition, not a flaw anywhere.
I have priced it at $650 bucks, I am losing money on it at that price.. I have found a hunting shotgun that I want to buy, that is why this safe queen is for sale. I will only need a simple bill of sale to keep for my own records.

A special Collector item: A Colt Government 1911 (.45ACP) -- Special Custom Shop made to commemorate 200 years of U. S. Customs Existence.

Made in 1989 -- only 400 pieces made. The story behind it is the following: The US Treasury ordered 400 pieces of this out of which gave 350 to special US Customs agents. The other fifty they sold it ONLY to other US Customs agents who wanted to buy it as collector items. I know that because I bought it from the original owner, who was a US Customs agent (I saw his ID), now retired. This is #363 out of 400. He bought 4 of them back in 1989. It has gold roll marks on both sides, and a pair of grips that has the golden shield of the Department of the Treasury (back then US Customs were not part of the Homeland Security which was created after 9/11). If you are willing to pay $100 Colt will tell you in a historic letter the same things I am telling you for free. I know all of these because the guy who sold it to me showed me a letter from Colt (and I will try to make a copy of his letter and include it with everything else -- the letter is for a different gun #).

Now, this pistol is in MINT condition. It has never been fired. Just lubed, drooled over from time to time :-)

It comes with an authentic US Customs patch (which was added by the previous owner), an authentic US Customs shield (still in the wrap) that has the same number as the gun, a US Customs sticker, all in a beautiful mahogany presentation box with a key. Also includes the original paper box with the Styrofoam insert and the paper box. I will take more detailed pictures and post them later ...

$3,500 ... I take US Postal Money Orders, or a personal check. I will ship this to your FFL (FedEX overnight) for $50 extra, if you are in a different state other than WA or if you are in Eastern WA. If you send me a personal check, please expect me to send it out 10 days after I deposit the check in my account. Also, if you send me a personal check I want to see a copy of your ID and CHL.

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Precision-made, easy to handle and just as easy on the eyes, the Reserve Series provides an outstanding over-and-under at an outstanding price. These Shotguns share the same classic lines, craftsmanship and reliability associated with so-called ""high end"" over-and-unders without the high-end price tag. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over and Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. Precision machining keeps the action completely closed - dirt and debris doesn't get into the receiver, reducing wear and maintenance, while manual extractors provide a smooth, effortless operation of the action. This 12 gauge Silver Reserve Series shotgun is equipped with three interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads."

It has a Well p90 stock that has been gutted and the shell alone used, bedded to accept the the 597 receiver and barrel which is completely stock. Cutouts have been made in the stock for the charging handle and ejection of spent cases as well as for the magazine release and cutout on the bottom for a magazine well to accept either the included factory 10 round magazine or either of the 30 round remington magazines that are included 1 clear and 1 black.  There is two safeties the one on the trigger as well as a access door on the butt of the stock that you can open that allows you to engage the 597's cross bolt safety. It was made using a 20"" barrel to make the firearms overall length meet the federal guidelines 26"" minimum OVERALL rimfire rifle length there by also surpassing the guideline for 16"" minimum rimfire barrel length. I have built several .22 conversions this was my first one I did based on seeing many other internet forums where people did this with the 10/22 I just happen to prefer my 597s and model 60's a little more so thought I would give it a go. It shoots great runs as should be expected with minimal jams ftf fte than a 597 would in a regular stock out of roughly 3-400 rounds that have been fired in this rifle maybe 3 or 4 failures and I attribute that to the 30 rd mags as they tend to hiccup in all my 597's every once in awhile. There is no optic included so you would need to supply your own reflex sight red dot scope what ever you prefer. This was a brand new rifle that was bought to put into this stock I also have a original stock that can go with it if you would like. The clear 30rd mag has been used the black one is new. This is a very fun unique well functioning firearm that is a very close replica to the real FN p90 dimensions weight firing characteristics all similar yet fires the much less expensive .22lr in the same manner a m&p 15-22 would be to a .223 m&p ar. Will entertain cash offers not sure what to ask have several hours of assembly as well as cost of rifle mags stock etc... would really like to do some trading so make some fair offers.
