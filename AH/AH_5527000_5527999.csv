The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides.The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included.The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.Shipping available and gun is in excellent condition."

The only issue is the action/slide will not lock up in the loaded position. If you're good at tinkering it may be a simple 10 minute fix, I'm just not sure. There is also a crack on the butstock near the receiver end. The previous owner spray painted the furniture black, so I repainted over that in a lighter brown. There is also some dings/screw holes taken out of the forend as well from the previous owner who had a picatinny rail section on it. That's been removed though. I also removed most rust and have been keeping it oiled. The metal is actually in decent shape. This model is similar in takedown as an Ithaca 37, so if you're familiar with those,  it may be a very easy fix.I will also trade for a plate carrier/chest rig set up plus cash to equal $115.

I have replaced the mag followers with shorter ones that increase the capacity to 14 rounds. Also I have installed the ZR Tactical Ultimate kit. This kit accurizes the pistol and allows to remove the set screw for the barrel making it a floating barrel like a normal 1911 thus eliminating changing point of impact every time you torque down the set screw. Kit consists of a full length stainless pollished guide rod heavy duty recoil spring a ruberized recoil buffer a stainless pollished spring cap and barrel bushing and stainless pollished accuracy cone for end of barrel. The accuracy cone is tapered and fills up the end of the barrel bushing taking all play out of the slide so the sights are dead on every time the gun goes into battery. This is an excellent kit that cost $75 and the barrel bushing had to be custom fit to the gun with file work so it is a very tight fit . All original parts manual and tools included . I have $563 invested and an hour of my time fitting the barrel bushing to the slide. Call or Text REDACTED

It has a great trigger and is a very accurate shooter.I am the original owner, having bought this pistol new at the end of March of this year. Exactly 150 rounds of brass jacketed ammunition have been fired through this pistol at the local gun range. It has been carefully and thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every firing and has never been conceal carried. Has the normal friction marks on the barrel and chamber that all of the tilted barrel guns I have seen show after being fired, sometimes after just the test firing at the factory. I have never had a failure to feed or fire with this XD-S. These are great pistols...accurate, comfortable to shoot, durable, and easy to clean and carry. Included are the items that came with this package including the pistol, hard plastic case, stainless steel factory 7 round flush mount and 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazines, interchangeable back strap, paperwork, bore brush, and gun lock.I am also adding an additional stainless steel factory 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazine and a Pachmayr Tactical Grip Glove designed for the Springfield XD-S.Metal parts on the gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

The new M&P SHIELD with ported barrel and slide features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.
Why ported? Porting can help reduce muzzle rise during recoil. Considering that the guns have relatively mild recoil and rise for their size, the porting may make these into very soft shooters.
These pistols are produced by the Smith & Wesson Performance Center. This Performance Center model has an enhanced DAO trigger pull of roughly 5 pounds and the trigger travel is just under one-third of an inch. The gun comes supplied with one extended 8- round and one 7- round flush fit magazines that are made of genuine steel. A set of Hi Viz 3- dot fiber optic sights sit on top of the compensated slide, are extremely bright, easy to use and track very well. NEW IN BOX.

The Right 380. There are few firearms that are more recognizable than the iconic 1911 pistol. Legendary gun designer John M. Browning designed both the 1911 pistol and the mighty 45 ACP caliber it is most often chambered for. The rugged 1911 45 ACP pistol dutifully served as the official sidearm of America’s military forces for more than 70 years, and despite the design being over 100 years old, it continues to be one of the most popular firearms available. In addition to being the choice for elite military and law enforcement units, civilians choose the 1911 for everything from competition shooting to personal protection.
Browning’s 1911-380 is the Right Design, the Right Size, with the Right Features. It is The Right 380. The 1911-380 combines the proven 1911 design with another of John Browning’s inventions —the 380 ACP cartridge — in a package that is 15% smaller than the 45 ACP models and tips the scales at a mere 17-1/2 ounces unloaded. With a manual of arms similar to the 1911, the 1911-380 the perfect choice for concealed carry, home protection, shooters with smaller hands or recoil-sensitive hand gunners. NEW IN BOX.
Features
The 1911-380 is 85% of the size of the original - 1911 45 ACP model, making it ideally suited for concealed carry duty, and for a wider variety of shooters.
It offers a familiar feel - thanks to its single-stack magazine, is narrow and conceals well for its size. However, 45 ACP and 9mm versions of these guns are still large, heavy, and can be difficult to conceal depending on what the carrier is wearing.
It's Unique - Unlike other 380 ACP autoloaders on the market, the 1911-380 is the only authentically designed, full-featured 1911-style handgun currently available that is chambered in 380 ACP. The 1911-380 is slightly larger than all of the popular micro 380s, the grip is long enough for three fingers to fit comfortably below the trigger guard; the slide and barrel are longer, yet the 1911-380 only weighs 3-5 ounces more than subcompacts. These slight increases make a big difference when shooting — reducing recoil and allowing for more comfortable shooting, more control, and more accurate follow-up shots. A 1911-380 is still easily concealed with its smaller size and single-stack magazine that offer a compact, flat profile that fits easily inside the waistband and keeps the grip narrow for shooters with smaller hands.
Feels better - You get greater shooting comfort because the grip is long enough for three fingers to fit below the trigger guard. Shoots better - Yes, the slide and barrel are longer. But this greatly improves accuracy and function -- yet the 1911-380 only weighs 3-5 ounces more than subcompacts.
Follows up better - It is the perfect size to reduce recoil and barrel jump, and allow for more comfortable shooting, more control, and more accurate follow-up shots.
Conceals better - It is easily concealed with its smaller size and single-stack magazine that offer a compact, flat profile that fits easily inside the waistband and keeps the grip narrow for shooters with smaller hands.
Light, Crisp Trigger - One of the biggest performance advantages of the 1911 is a single-action trigger that provides a light, crisp pull that allows for excellent accuracy. The 1911-380 is no exception. The trigger and light recoil make the 1911-380 capable of extremely accurate follow up shots.
Safeties for ""Condition 1"" Carry - Unlike other compact, 1911-style 380 ACP pistols available, the 1911-380 includes both the manual thumb safety and grip safety found on the full-size model. Multiple safeties offer secure “Condition 1” carry. The 1911-380 thumb safety is an ambidextrous design that allows it to be easily manipulated by right- and left-handed shooters. A beavertail-style grip safety helps prevent hammer bite and allows a higher grip to help control muzzle flip.
Natural Grip Angle - The natural grip angle offers instinctual pointing and a feel that 1911 shooters are already familiar with. Low Bore Axis - A low bore axis provides excellent recoil control and shooting comfort. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety is easy to operate. Extended design is easier to reach with the strong hand.
Beavertail Grip Safety - The beavertail design prevents bite to the hand from the grip safety.
Magazine - The steel magazine body is heat treated for long-term feeding reliability and long life.
Flat Mainspring Housing - Makes the grip more comfortable for a wider range of shooters.
Frame - Engineering grade composite
Sights - Combat-style sights offer rapid target acquisition

It was manufactured in Japan and we estimate the date of manufacture to be approximately 1998. It was purchased used from Albright's Gun Shop in Maryland earlier this year for $3,055. This gun is light, beautiful, and easy to shoot, but I now have a 12 gauge and don't shoot this one as often so it needs a new home. The wood and engraving on this gun are outstanding for this price.

I'm in Franklin, WI. The best range is all the way out in Eagle, WI. I joined a club nearby, but they don't allow you to shoot by yourself. Due to work and range restrictions, I've only been to a range twice in the last year. I'm looking to change that immediately. Ideally, i'm looking for someplace that is already set up for range use. Otherwise someplace that has no neighbors would be perfect. Land with a natural backstop is a huge plus. Something like a large hill, cliff, ravine, or wooded area to shoot into would be perfect. Ideally I would like to push myself out to 1000 yards, but I understand land limitations probably wont allow for that. 300 yards would probably be the minimum distance I would accept. I'm also not looking to annoy anyone. Most of my shooting will be done with suppressors. Would prefer no nearby neighbors. A little bit about myself. Safety is my number one priority. I've been involved in shooting sports for a little over 5 years now. I mainly just shoot off the bench for groups. I am wanting to get into long range shooting. I'm super busy with my businesses so i'm just looking for some private land to shoot on at my own time. I will have my own targets and stands. I will always clean up after myself and leave your land looking as it did before I got there. I will also respect your time and restrictions. I will call/text before coming to make sure it is okay. If you have land that meets my needs or some thing similar please email or pm me. I will get back to you ASAP. We can discuss your land, payment, and a tour of the property. Properties can be anywhere within 30 minutes of Franklin, WI. Thank You"

It has a great trigger and is a very accurate shooter.I am the original owner, having bought this pistol new at the end of March of this year. Exactly 150 rounds of brass jacketed ammunition have been fired through this pistol at the local gun range. It has been carefully and thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every firing and has never been conceal carried. Has the normal friction marks on the barrel and chamber that all of the tilted barrel guns I have seen show after being fired, sometimes after just the test firing at the factory. I have never had a failure to feed or fire with this XD-S. These are great pistols: accurate, comfortable to shoot, durable, and easy to clean and carry. Included are the items that came with this package including the pistol, hard plastic case, stainless steel factory 7 round flush mount and 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazines, interchangeable back strap, paperwork, bore brush, and gun lock.I am also adding a couple of additional items I purchased after buying the gun: stainless steel factory 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazine and a Pachmayr Tactical Grip Glove designed for the Springfield XD-S.Metal parts on the gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."
