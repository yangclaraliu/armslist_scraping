Problem is my house got robbed 2 months ago and someone got held up down the street from me yesterday so I'm looking to make a trade for a handgun. I can add money. Honestly I'm really open to any handgun, just show me what you got and I'll consider it. I'm always in between Milledgeville (college), and alpharetta (home), as well as most weekends traveling in Georgia to different cities for rugby games so I'm kind of open to trades out of any city. My only problem I've had with the gun is that the magazine is OEM, so considering the spring in the mag is 70 years old, it'll push the rounds in, but when you get to the last 3 or 4 rounds it doesn't have the strength to push them in. Nothing a new magazine, or a new spring for a magazine wouldn't fix. Fires 303 british, mag cap is 10+1, and has the good old queens markings on the barrel. Shot probably 50-60 rounds out of it since the time I bought it. Looking to keep the scope but I wouldn't mind selling it along with the gun anyways. Comes with the buttstock sleeve/ammo holder as well as the five or six rounds I have left."

For sale is the original Ruger 10/22, original Ruger 10/22 stock, HTA 90/22 PS90 imitation stock, 4 Butler creek steel lip 25 round magazines, 2 Ruger brand 25-round magazines, discreet carrying case, and one factory Ruger 10 round magazine.  I also ordered and installed the extended magazine release and extended bolt open arms. These are part of the Ruger 10/22 but can be uninstalled easily. They make magazine changes much easier than when using the default/standard Ruger factory release mechanisms.

The Ruger rifle can be removed from the HTA hardware at will and returned to its original form. I am willing to sell the HTA stock alone but not the Ruger alone. Willing to throw in a box of ammo at the right price. I've fired maybe 600 rounds through this. Very reliable with solid point bullets or copper jacketed stuff. Some failures to feed with very soft lead tips (as on Armscor or crappy Winchester ammo). The HTA stock has a tri-rail at the front for mounting the sites of your choice. I have personally been using a red dot sight but pretty much anything would go. Price shown does not include the red dot.

The suppressor is fake and removable (you can run with the Ruger barrel showing if desired). The rifle is NOT an SBR in the HTA stock, it is legal standard length both total length and barrel length. There is a safety at the HTA trigger and also the actual ruger safety is accessible as well. The Ruger charging handle can be pulled, or there is an ambidextrous charging handle that you can use to chamber a round.

I take good care of my things. Nothing wrong with any of this stuff but need the cash and not using this much. I have all the boxes, manuals, etc., from both the Ruger and the HTA stock purchases. Also a few extra hardware parts and the instructions for assembly/disassembly.

I'm selling it because I'm no archer. It spends 360 days of the year in my closet. I take it camping a couple of times a year to play around with. I'm ok if it doesn't sell right away but would be really happy if it found a good home with someone who truly appreciates what it is.

I built this last month but since acquiring a Mini-14 Tactical I don't have much reason to keep it around. This has had precisely one magazine through it - either 10 or 20 rounds of PMC .223, I forget how many I loaded.

Specs:

* Aero Precision X15 lower with pictogram markings
* Palmetto State LPK upgraded with Magpul MOE+ grip, MOE trigger guard
* Palmetto State hammer-forged 16"" mid-length gas upper, gov't profile barrel, stock handguard
* Milspec buffer assembly with PSA M4 stock
* BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle w/ large latch
* UTG fixed rear sight (basically a carry handle sight minus the handle)

Let's say $700 for the rifle itself? I also have the following magazines:

* 5 20rd black PMAGs (second-generation)
* 5 20rd Lancer L5 translucent magazines
* 1 20rd steel black E-Lander magazine

I could let go of each mag for $15 each or $150 for the lot if you buy the rifle.

Not particularly looking to part with any .223 ammo but if you need some we can work out a deal for a few boxes to be included with the rifle.

Will take 2 /34, 3, and 3.5 inch shell, 28 inch blued barrel with ribbed or raised sights on barrel, wood finish, in great shape. Wood butt stock has slight fading from use of a gun cleaner, Not bad. Gun was recently brought to a Great gunsmith in Vancouver who went through the gun and cleaned it ""COMPLETELY"". Gun has not been shot since then. Cycles like a dream and has shot ducks, geese, pheasant, and ruffed grouse. I have newer more expensive autos and over and unders so I am selling this one.

Obviously it was never even put on an upper since I never got one. The mags and lower I got new from the factory. The ammo is malaysian surplus. I have more pics if you want them just shoot me an email and I can give you a bunch. I'm asking $550 for the whole thing.

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

Zero buildup on the bolt carrier, and the dust cover and most of the receiver are in amazing shape. No bayo unfortunately, but it's not uncommon with the paratrooper length rifles. Riflling is nice and crisp and very strong, not pitting or fouling in the bore. Comes with a factory mounted site rail so you can have a proper scope mount on this. It was my original plan to put a medium power POSP scope on it, but do with it what you will. Comes with 350 rounds of hollow point, and 60 rounds of FMJ 7.62x39. I can take more pictures on request if you're interested. $600 OBO
