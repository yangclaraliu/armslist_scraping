Based on the serial number, the rifle is 50 years old, but looks brand new. I took it in trade to get a handgun in the deal that I wanted, but since I am disabled, I will probably never use it. It would be a real shame for this piece of American history to just sit in my safe.
If you are familiar with Winchester 94's, you know they can be used for everything from home defense to hog or deer hunting, but you also know that today's Winchester 94's are made in Japan, have a weird cross-bolt safety that nobody likes, and cost $975 new. Winchester has not made a 94 in the USA since 2006, but I have one for you right here if you want to own a true classic.
Feel free to call or text me at REDACTED
The rifle does not have a box, but it does come with two brand new boxes of Federal ammunition, and a butt mounted cartridge holder. The rifle is spotless and has been really well kept. The owner told me he bought it new in 1965 and could not remember ever firing it. It certainly looks that way. I'm looking to turn it into cash, but will consider trades or partial trades for quality handguns. I will entertain reasonable offers.
Please, let's not waste each other's time with ridiculously low offers. I have many more detailed pictures if you would like to see them."

When Beretta bought Stoeger, they shipped not only the design but also the machinery to the Stoeger plant in Turkey; the only difference from the Beretta Cougar is that the Stoeger Cougar is about half the price!Rotating barrel design makes this the softest recoiling 9mm I’ve ever fired; dead-on accurate, with 300 rounds fired and zero malfunctions. Great ergonomics and sights; only reason I’m selling is because I dislike external safeties.No shipping/no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga area."

My friend bought it new then traded it to me. Ok so here's the deal I was a dumbass I admit it. I converted it from 10 round only mags to accept 30 round mags. It didn't go as well as I planed. It shoots but does jam a round into the feed ramp sometimes. I also had to modify my mags for them to snap in place. It probably needs a new trunion I don't know I'm not a gunsmith. I haven't shot the gun in probably 2 years so I'm outing it on here for sale or trade to see what happens.

A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition.

The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.  The Ruger BX-25x2,10/22 Ruger 22 Long Rifle Tandem 25 Round Polymer Black Magazine is a 50 round factory magazine for the Ruger 10/22.

The lower is a hybrid Tennessee Arms Co Hybrid lower. I would encourage you to do some research on these lowers if you have not heard of them. In many ways they are STRONGER than aluminum while being 2-3 ounces lighter. Unlike traditional polymer lowers, these have marine brass fittings for the buffer tube as well as the grip threads which provided metal contact points for all threaded parts. Go to Youtube and watch some videos on these lowers...you will be impressed.Ok, here are the components that went into them. As you can see this is not low end parts.1.) 7075 Mil Spec Buffer Tube...many use 6061 Aluminum which is much softer.2.) Magpul MOE Stock3.) Magpul MIAD Grip or Stock A2 Trigger4.) Nickle Teflon Hammer & Trigger5.) JP Trigger Springs6.) Anderson Lower Vitals minue fire control groupHave you ever bought a lower and the trigger felt like crap? If you want a high end trigger many of them can cost $200 or more. These triggers are awesome. The triggers contact surfaces are polished, they are then coated in nickle teflon, finally they are lightly polished after coating them. When you combine this trigger with JP reduced power springs you end up with a trigger that has a pull weight around 5 lbs, and more importantly it is EXTREMELY smooth. 1.) Complete Tennessee Arms AR-15 Lower - $2352.) SOLD - Complete Tennessee Arms AR-15 Lower - $225The only difference between the two is one has a Magpul grip and the other has the A2 standard grip.I would also consider taking some parts out if you already have things you want to use. For example if you have your own trigger I could remove that and the springs and reduce the price. Or if you have your own grip or stock, or you want a factory stock. Just give me a call and I can go over the options.REDACTED-Sterling"
