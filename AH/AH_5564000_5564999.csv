This is the model with the M16 style front sight post and picatinny rail for rear sight,(currently has a Barska red dot sight mounted) and it folds in half for easier storage/transfer.(It doesn't fire in the folded position) It also has the folding bipod built into the front handguard, and a custom muzzle break. It comes with two KelTec 10 round plastic mags, a 20 round metal magazine permanently pinned to 10 round capacity, and has a slot built into the buttstock for either the 2 ten rounders or the 20 round mag for storage. This rifle doesn't have any of the defining Assault Weapon features, so it's legal without the bullet button on most AR style rifles. However, it's still semi-automatic so will be banned for transfer if the new laws go through, so get it while you can. It's in good, lightly used condition and well taken care of. I'm asking $600, and all trades will be considered. Mostly interested in handguns like the Beretta 92 series, or revolvers."

I replaced the tuning fork AAC Blackout with a VG6 Precision Gamma Brake, also have the cage to go over the brake for indoor range exercises ($175 upgrade, very flat shooting and minimal recoil).  I added a Magpul RVG that matches with the overall theme (hidden Magpul signs all over the rifle) and a Strike Industries sling.  Also have the giant factory case, two Pmags, and manual.  All this for $1600–when brand new the ACR Enhanced model is selling for $1675-2200 (used to be closer to $2500).
If you want the total package with rail covers, Geissele B-GRF (rapid fire) trigger ($200), Vortex Spitfire 1x Prism sight (etched reticle works w/o batteries, great if you have red dot astigmatism, $250), it will be $2000.  Text is the best way to get a hold of me.
Selling to get a scout rifle in .308 and a suppressor.  Also have lots of .223/5.56 if I sell the ACR.  Not interested in trades unless you have a Steyr Scout in .308."

(Photo: Auto-Ordnance)  Auto-Ordnance is offering a boxed set of two classics, the Chicago Typewriter, AKA Tommy Gun, and a 1911A1 pistol, in observation of the Tommy Gun’s 100-year anniversary. Though the .45 ACP semi-auto Chicago Typewriter is renowned for showing up in the hands of Prohibition-era gangsters, the new release highlights earlier history of the firearm, which pre-dates U.S. involvement in World War I. The faithful reproductions, finished in blued steel and walnut, come boxed together in a hard case bearing the “Chicago Typewriter” and Thompson logos. Both guns are stamped with the Thompson bullet logo. They’re sold only as a set; MSRP $1,971. This is a limited edition of 1,500. The Thompson sub-machine gun, designed first as a tool for clearing enemy trenches, was the brainchild of John T. Thompson, a West Point graduate originally from Newport, Kentucky. In the Army, Thompson studied engineering and artillery, and took an interest in small arms design. After retiring from the Army and entering employment as Chief Engineer at Remington Arms, Thompson designed the platform in 1916. He re-enlisted when the U.S. became involved in the war, eventually being promoted to Brigadier General. Thompson perfected the design after the war’s end, and was awarded a patent in 1920. By then, military applications were mostly moot, so he marketed the gun to police agencies and in the civilian market. Thompson never lived to see his design fulfill its intended use. Shortly after his 1940 death at age 79, the U.S. Army placed large orders for Thompson submachine guns for the World War II effort.

818,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5564818,For Sale/Trade:  Work / utility enclosed trailer,"Highland, Flint, Michigan",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, June 19, 2016",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"size / dimensions: 4x8Up for sale / trade is this work / utility trailer. It was left over by the previous owner after a move. It has a 4x8 box, as you can see in the pictures. It's built on a 4x6 frame. It looks to me like the previous owner used it as a carpentry/ enclosed work trailer given its overall design.As I mentioned previously (and you can see in the pictures), the trailer sports an enclosed box (fresh black paint job) with box with two sections. Upon opening the barn style doors, the larger upper cargo section seems fit for tools and other large cargo like saw horses, etc. It has racks on the side intended for paper files, PVC tubes for various hand tools, and even some built in dome lights (haven't tested if they work yet). There's also a smaller bottom section that looks like it would be perfect for hauling lumber and project wood. The top section floor / bottom section ceiling seems to bolt out in case you want to remove it to haul larger cargo.On the sides of the trailer, it has two side access doors equipped with two lift arms for each. Or as Elon Musk of Telsa would call them ""falcon wing doors"". This makes side access a breeze. It also has vents installed on the top front corners of the trailer for ventilation on those hot summer days. Around the front side the spare tire is mounted above the tongue. Trailer has chains, third wheel, and light connection at the front of tongue. I have not tested the lights but I will continue to clean it up this weekend.On the roof, there is a built in ladder rack with pvc rollers that make loading/unloading ladders a breeze. I also just finished up taring the roof with wet-stick roof cement for waterproofness. It's drying in the barn right now and curing up.Trailer is equipped with adequate reflectors per Michigan law, has mud flaps and rock guard along the back side (see pictures) and fenders are in good shape. Tires are in good shape as well. Trailer is currently untitled as it's a homebuilt and I'm going to continue working on it this weekend doing various other touch-ups. Depending on what time I get off work, I'm going to hopefully get it officially weighed to begin the titling process.I am a motivated seller, we currently have a few other utility trailers that we use far more frequently so this one is just taking up space. If you'd like any more info on the trailer itself, shoot me a text or email. If you would like to come take a look at it, contact me to set up a time and date. I'm will entertain all trade and cash offers. Worst I can say is no"
