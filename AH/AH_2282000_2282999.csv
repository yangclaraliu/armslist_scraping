I have a lot of the .380 ammo, all new in the box. If the gun doesn't sell, I won't sell the ammo, just putting that out there. I've looked at the Blue Book on this gun, and gunbroker as well, to see what they have been selling for, and I think between the two references this is a fair price to ask. This is a nice shooting pistol, you won't be disappointed in it's shootability or concealability."

This gun is surprisingly accurate with iron sites and was SPOT ON with my Vortex Strikefire red dot. Chambered for 5.56, but will shoot anything you put through it (including steel case). As you'll find in reviews of this rifle, many of them are hit or miss- this one is definitely a hit and is a very solid and reliable rifle overall that has had zero issues. 

Bolt gap is well within preferred spec at 0.012 without plus size rollers (I was able to fit 6 sheets of paper between it, the gap may be slightly bigger). Preferred spec, per the factory is between .010 - .018 inches and .004 - .020 inches is acceptable. 

Included are a super solid UTG P669 low profile scope rail, two 40 round magazines, two 30 round magazines and standard strap. I'll also include the carry handle and mount, which was removed to add the scope rail.

I just stripped down and degreased the rifle all the way down to rollers and firing pin, and very lightly lubed everything. This thing is basically SPOTLESS!

Out of town buyer pays to ship to FFL dealer. Local pickup preferred."

Problems: I think it needs a new sear or something based on my research online, because sometimes if I close the bolt too hard, the gun will actually fire without me pulling the trigger. Rimfirecentral has a forum about this specific rifle and those guys can probably help or a qualified gunsmith. I did shoot this for one session and no misfires, but I don't want to chance it anymore. It was very accurate, but I also found that the spent shells don't always eject properly, though most did. The ejector needs to be modified or replaced. Stock has two hairline cracks as shown in the picture.

The gun comes with a sear that I purchased from Numrich Gun Parts Corporation.
So basically a gun that needs some small fixes, but after that, it will be amazing. I think that's all!"

I have up for sale a used taurus pt-22 22 lr pistol. It is a great little pistol and shoots good. Only thing is it doesnt like the cheap bulk ammo I had. So occasionally liked to not feed the second round after the one put straight into the barrel. Was pretty obvious it was the kind of ammo because when I ran 25 rounds of good stuff through it, it had zero issues. Either way, it is a fantastic little gun and shoots great. This is a great way to get a small little pistol to conceal and a great gun to take fishing as a snake popper. Would be fantastic for conceal or a backup. This is the less common black, gold, and rosewood model. This will come with one magazine, the gun, and possible ammunition for the right offer. This will be as is, so please message me with any questions you may have.
Any questions or for offers please text me at REDACTED and we can try to make a deal."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The original wood grips also come with it.  I picked this up many years ago in MO at a police auction.  It shows wear to the nickel finish, the usual microscopic scratches, not a mirror finish, as well as some dings on the left side, where the loading gate would be if the dings were on the other side.  This is a nice little gun, shoots fine, operationally, everything is as it should be with it. This is a gun for folks with a smaller hand than mine, so I never really shot it much, maybe 30 rounds or so.  $300.00 OBO"

This was a special release gun made in 2004 and described here:

In 2004 SIGARMS released a limited number of specially serialized P226 pistols identical to those supplied to the U.S. Navy SEALs. The P226-9-NAVY is made to the exact specifications of the pistols supplied to Navy SEALs including special corrosion-resistant finish on internal parts, contrast sights, slides engraved with an anchor to designate them as Naval Special Warfare pistols and a certificate of authenticity. For commercial sales the pistol will come with two 10-round magazines. These limited production P226-9-Navy pistols will also carry a special unique “NSW” serial number starting with NSW0001.

This gun has likely been fired though not be me. It's been a safe queen since I've had it and is basically mint but you can tell it's been fired by the wear on the barrel hood. Other than that, it looks brand new. It comes with the original serial-numbered box and Certificate of Authenticity as well as thee 10-round mags, lock, and paperwork.

The price is $900 at an FFL in Pittsburgh (buyer pays for transfer) or $925 shipped to your FFL. I accept cash in person or personal checks (held to clear), postal money orders, or discrete PayPal for shipping. More pictures are in the slideshow linked below. Listed on other sites. Trying to raise a little cash so no trades, sorry. Thanks for looking!

Update 1: Great work everyone. Ad's gone. Hilariously, I got an e-mail from someone who supposedly bought the 223 from the gouger and was advised to find a different hobby I could afford. 

""Maybe you should stop whinning, if you can't afford the hobby, go try another one, like model train or something. I just bought those .223's off that guy, not only did he give me an extra 100 rounds free of charge, but he also met me at a location of my choice, which was far out of his way. Don't be mad guy, if your too poor to afford it, don't own a gun in the first place. Times are rough for everyone, and hating on each other isn't doing anyone any good.""

909,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2282909,For Sale:  Pulsar Digisight N750 Digital Night Vision Riflescope,"Houston, Houston, Texas","$ 1,455","Listed On: Monday, January 20, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The PULSAR PL76312 N750 DIGISIGHT Riflescope is designed for observation and shooting in twilight and at night-time. This riflescope uses a highly sensitive CCD array (with a range of operation illumination 0.00001 to 30000 lux); the image transmitted to the high resolution display OLED (640 x 480 pixels) is contrasting, crisp, and saturated. Thanks to the OLED display, this riflescope can be used within a wide temperature range from -4 to 122°F (-20 to 50°C) .

The PL76312 Riflescope is a multifunctional device that features several essential options for modern hunting, which includes screen display information on operation status (running time, low battery indicator, active function etc.). The menu has additional functions for image settings: gradual brightness and contrast adjustment, and SumLight signal processing program. The SumLight program automatically increases CCD array sensitivity under low light conditions. The riflescope can be zeroed not only in the traditional manner but also using the new one shot zeroing method. This makes the zeroing procedure significantly faster and more convenient.

This riflescope is equipped with a built-in laser / IR illuminator (780nm wavelength, safety class 1), which considerably increases viewing range. The weaver rail at the side of the body allows an auxiliary IR flashlight to be attached. The basic control functions (switching On / Off the riflescope and the IR illuminator, activation of digital zoom) can be performed with the help of the included wireless remote control. It also features a video output to conduct video recording to external devices without the use of additional adapters and camera or camcorders. If necessary, output video signal standard can be changed from PAL to NTSC.

This riflescope has 1 pre-loaded reticle, but the user can also upload another optional reticle from a reticle base available on the PULSAR website (downloadable). The color of the reticle point can be switched from red to green. The riflescope is resistant to bright light exposure. It can be mounted on a wide range of hunting weapons including those of large calibers (shock resistance is guaranteed if cartridges with muzzle velocity not exceeding 6,000 J are used).
This riflescope operates on 4 rechargeable batteries but can also be powered with an external power supply. External power supplies such as EPS3 or EPS5 (sold separately) prolong the operation time of the riflescope to up to 9 to 20 hours. The IR laser illuminator in this riflescope is fully compliant with US FDA Class 1 laser eye safety requirements.

Pics just show how the flashlight bracket can work in 2 applications- On the barrel and the Scope. (No Firearm included in the sale)

The Large scope is broke but I'm including it because it has a Lifetime warranty and Tasco will honor it by giving you 30-40% off their Wholesale Price of a new scope (I called them). Tasco is also Bushnell, Simmons, and a few other Optic companies.. and you can pick from any of the other manufacturers- It doesn't have to be a Tasco. EXAMPLE: Say you want a $300 scope.. send in this one and get the one you want for under $200- probably cheaper cause you get the 30-40% off their WholeSale price. And their wholesale has got to be half of what a store charges. $1000 scope cost you around $500 or so... Not a bad deal.

You'll Save my asking price for everything just by buying a new scope, so really all these parts are free. You just have to buy a new scope.. but who doesn't want a new scope?? I always do, but don't have a rifle.

Price is firm and I'm selling it ALL together... not piecing it out. Prices are listed to show how much a deal you are getting- not what I'm asking for every part."

Let me reiterate, this is a new 1892- not to be confused with the very common 1894.

The 1892 was made famous in western movies and was the most commonly used model back in the glory days of American Western movies. You'll see a Winchester 1892 in John Wayne's hands in most of his movies. Here's a little history behind the 1892: It was designed by John Browning as a follow up model to the big bore model 1886. Browning was commissioned to design the 1892 by Winchester to meet the need for a modern pistol cartridge repeater with the model 1874 by then nearing obsoleteness. Browning designed the 1892 using essentially the same extremely strong breech locking system of the 1886 but only smaller in stature for shorter rounds vs. the 1886 which was designed around the long and very large 45-70 Govt. cartridge. The 1892 breech locking system is actually considered to be stronger than the 1894 and unlike the 1894 with the 1892, when you actuate the lever down, it doesn't pull the guts of the mechanism half way out. Of course this is a necessary characteristic of the Model 1894 for it to be able to chamber the long 30-30 round but my point is, for a powerful pistol cartridge like the .44 Mag, the Winchester 1892 is just the perfect match. Winchester discontinued the 1892 way back in 1945 but in the last decade Winchester has produced several series of limited editions.

Concerning this specific rifle, when new this rifle retailed for $1,500 and there were only 500 of this octagonal 20"" barrel carbine made. The barrel is nicely engraved ""LIMITED SERIES - 1 of 500"". This particular series of the Model 1892 was offered by Winchester circa 2003 and it's getting rare to find them new in the box . Of those limited editions, I personally believe the octagonal 20"" barrel variation is the most desirable and the fact that this one is chambered in the readily available .44 Mag makes it even better. Most of the rifles in this series were chambered in historical rounds like the 38-40 which are more expensive and harder to find. Most dudes bought these as shooters and they are very popular at Cowboy shooting competitions but this one has been a ""looker"". This rifle was made by Browning's famous Miroku factory in Japan and the fit and finish is nothing less than stunning. The bluing has a high gloss and the walnut stock has attractive figuring in the wood grain with a satin sheen finish. The action is smooth yet tight and the famous compactness of the 1892 makes it just a pleasure to handle this fine rifle.
