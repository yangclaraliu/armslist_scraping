This pistol is literally brand new. Bought it a week ago. Haven't even cleaned it (gauranteed). Nothing wrong with it. I found a 1911 that i wanted. $425.00 OBO + buyer pays FFL costs. Cash is easiest and FTF is even better. Check or MO will have to clear first. Plenty of FFL dealers in area. Buyer must pass background check.
I'm located in the Philadelphia/ Fairless Hills area.

This rifle was designed to be well balanced, comfortable to shoot and 100% reliable. I did this by starting with a mid-length gas system and added Spike's full auto bolt carrier and H1 heavy buffer and wolf spring. This AR is a pleasure to shoot.

Barrel is mid-length, chrome lined, MP tested with 1:7 twist from Palmetto State and made by FN. The trigger is a very nice single stage Mil-Spec ACT by ALG Defense. I topped the barrel off with a Vltor VC-A1 flash hider. The VLTOR IMOD stock is rock solid and very comfortable. Magpul MOE+ grip and VLTOR sling plate help you keep a nice grip on things...and if that wasn't enough, I installed the squid grips on the 11 inch Troy TRX-Alpha modular rail. The safety selector is BAD-ass ambi and the charging handle is the VLTOR/Bravo Medium latch. I then topped the whole thing off with Daniel Defense dual aperture iron sights.

This is a thorough rifle; everything was thought of from end to end. I put about 60 rounds through it without any trouble. I just enjoy building these ARs more than I get a chance to shoot.

Feel free to ask any questions. Cash would be nice because I'm going to fund my next build, but I'm open to the right trade. I'm open to cash/other firearm trades or multi-gun trades. I'm not interested in anything else.

I may consider selling or trading the upper only."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEwf9CuIwuk

The India has every single feature they offer for a semi-auto .22LR conversion. Kit Includes: Right Handed Stainless Steel Action, 22 ECL (Evolution Chamber Lock), Live Round Extraction, Buffer Retaining Pin Relief Cut, Piston System Compatible (without removing piston rod), Magazine Stabilizer, Bolt Hold Open Actuator, 25 Round Magazine, Charging Handle, Removable Forward Assist, Extension Bushing, Stainless Steel Cleaning Jag/Guide Rod, Go/No Go Chamber Adapter, Compatible with Any Mil-Spec AR15 Upper, Magazine Loader. The Evolution Chamber Lock is a brass chamber adapter that locks into place eliminating all play between the conversion and upper receiver which has two beneficial effects. First, by eliminating all play between the conversion and receiver, reliability is improved. Secondly, for trainers and armorers, it makes it more difficult to remove and ""tinker"" with the conversion which greatly reduces down time due to ""unauthorized"" cleanings or dis-assembly."

It is number's matching and all original aside from the re cambering which was done for the Spanish police in a arsenal. IT IS NOT SPORTERIZED. Bore is very nice(no pitting and is clean) along with the wood, bluing is worn on receiver though! Shoots great but I don't have anymore ammo for it so my need for this gun has ended as I just bought a 8mm Mauser with 1,000 rounds. Nice thing about this rifle is that it shoots one of the most popular and available rifle rounds on the market, so no worry's trying to find ammo to shoot.

This rifle has an octagon barrel witch makes it more desirable plus a rear sight. I have had the rifle appraised between $2,900 to $3,700. I am in way to quick to trade or sell. Wiling to see what's out there for trade plus cash. Will not sell for cash out right. If YOU want a peace of history, than this is the right rifle for you! I will only reply to emails. If you have something to trade please include photos of what you have in the email. Please, I am not looking for hand guns just rifles and cash at this point. If I like what you have it must be face to face so please, don't ask for me to ship. It just won't happen!!! If you have any questions please ask away. Thanks for your time and interest."

Lower has scratches around rear takedown pins because the upper/lower fit is so tight that you have to tap the pin out.  The buffer tube nut is slightly loose and should probably be tightened.

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

I also have 4 Chip McCormick 8 round power mags that I will sell to the buyer for $15 (half the price of new) if they want to purchase them.

PRICE IS FIRM, I do not need the money. 
This gun is fun to shoot and accurate, I am no expert shot but there is a significantly noticeable difference in accuracy between this gun and my other pistols.  I am selling to purchase more practical guns.  If I cannot get the asking price I will keep it as a fun range toy.

Will consider Sig Sauer 938 Rosewood as partial trade, $600 trade value for new, $550 trade value for like new.

Full Leupold scope rail with torx bolts.
Harris swivel, ""S"" benhrest model bipod.
Custom bolt work including, Badger handle, silver soldered smooth, then the handle arm has been drilled, tapped and screwed to bolt,(It will never break., see last picture), and then it was all Teflon coated in black for a super smooth and quiet action.

5R specs:
Barrel

    The rifle has a stainless alloy barrel at 24 inches long. The barrel's twist is RH 1:11.2 (many other rifles like it shoot RH 1:12). Originally, the 700 Milspec 5R was based on rejected rifle barrels that did not pass inspection on the M24 production line. These rejected barrels were then fitted onto the Remington 700 body and retooled as the ""Milispec"" rifle with a shorter twist.

Weight and Length

    The overall weight of the Milispec 5R is 8.25 lbs. (3.75 kg) and the length is 43.75 inches, or roughly 1,111 mm.

Magazine and Trigger

    The 5R's standard magazine is a five-round internal box. The trigger is Remington's own X-Mark Pro. The X-Mark Pro trigger has a pull weight of approximately 3-1/2 lbs. with roughly 2 lbs. of adjustment capability.

Stock and Finish

    The stock on the standard 5R is the HS Precision Composite and the finish is a dark gray/black color. Similar to Remington's Varmint Synthetic stocks, the 5R's stock is speckled with green within the gray/black of the plastic. Unlike the M24, which has a black powder-coated floorplate and metalwork, the 5R's barrel and action are unfinished stainless alloy.

Rifle has maybe 60 rounds through it.
No box.

It was well taken care of.  Action is great and checkered stock clues that it could be a rare deluxe or semi deluxe model 1894.

The only blemishes are in the paint job and they are just minor chips on the handguard and flash hider which are easily covered and visible in the pictures below. The seller claimed to have spent $1100 in parts and accessories and I bought it for $850 but will let it go for $550 or $500 if you meet me within 45 miles of Newport. Possible trades are listed. Below is a list of the assembled parts. It will drop on to a regular AR receiver provided you remove the stock and get it stamped to make it legal.

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

""I am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.""

""I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class. The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.

Thank you again for the class.""
