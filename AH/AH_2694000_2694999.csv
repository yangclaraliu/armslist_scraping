The RWS Diana 460 Magnum is a powerful air rifle that delivers tremendous knock-down power with a velocity of 1,200 fps. Great for dispatching rabbits, squirrels, racoon and other small game. This is a very gently used rifle that probably has around 100 shots through it. Very accurate and just a dream to shoot with the T -06 trigger that is as crisp as any rifle I have shot, not like the typical air rifle trigger."

This gun, SN 938xx, was marketed as the utility version of the Model 41. The finish is a flat blue, it does not have the cocking indicator of M41sof the same period, the machining is not as detailed, the grips are of red nylon rather than the wood of the M41, etc. The slide and barrel of these guns can fit in the M41 frame, but not vice versa. The internals were identical and the guns shot as well. Only 4000 of the guns were made from 1959-1968 a number went to military shooting teams who had requested a more utilitarian version of the M41."

Reliable round with a long track record--issued as duty ammunition by the majority of US law enforcement agencies for many years.
Molecular bonding(a process similar to nickel plating) of this JHP's jacket material to its lead core allows for excellent weight retention and expansion, and ensures that it doesn't shed it's jacket--unlike traditional JHPs--during barrier penetration(i.e. glass, thick clothing, doors). Visual: http://www.speer-ammo.com/products/gold_dot_const.aspx


50 rounds per box, new and unopened.
Asking for:
$38 per box
or trade for 130-180 rounds of 9mm FMJ per box (depending on the quality)

These go for $25-$30 per 20 rd box online($1.20-$1.50/shot), which after shipping charges probably come out to be considerably more than that...
...not that you CAN order them online anyway; they are all either out of stock or back-ordered for like 6-12 months--almost impossible to get.

At $45/box you're looking at 76¢ a cartridge--a decent price for rare and excellent ammunition.

They do stick out slightly from the bottom of the mag well.  There is some wear on the slide; sights are tinted a greenish color??  Bore is good...I ran a box thru her at the range and found good accuracy at 15 feet.  Inexpensive red laser is zeroed about there.  There is a modification drilled into the front of the trigger guard which looks like it may at one time have had a different laser or flashlight bolted in.  Cant get it in the pic cause the laser covers most of it...doesn't seem as it should effect operation in any way.  Beavertail added to grip NOT INCLUDED!!  I will remove it before the sale.  No trades please....looking to recoup some cash on this one. Asking $450...will consider cash offers if reasonable.

I am the second owner, unknown on previous owner's round count, I have put exactly 25 rounds (20x PMC 38 special, 3x 110gr Georgia Arms Gold Dot 357 Magnum, 2x 145gr Winchester Silvertip 357 Magnum) through a qualifying course a week after I got it and haven't fired it since.

This is a dream to shoot, I was able to double tap with 145gr Winchester Silvertips and did not feel noticeable recoil because of the bottom barrel design like that of the Mateba 357. Gun is just a tad heavy for my taste. This it the version that has the red fiber optic front sight post. The gun is double/single with a short cocking lever. I have heard of people complaining that it is stiff, though I don't have any trouble utilizing it. The grip is the factory rubber grip.

Comes with a pancake holster from the factory, and I will include a Garret Industries leather lined appendix carry Kydex holster also.

I am mostly interested in trades, nothing in particular, mainly other handguns (multiples handguns considered with cash on my end if needed) AR parts and SPR optics (2x-10x) but let me know what you have, worse I can say is no. 

With that said, asking price is $750 but I am much more inclined to trade, these average 800 and go as high as 1k+ on Gunbroker. Trade value is $850."

It has been sitting in my safe and fired 3 times with about 50 rounds. I thought I wanted 1911 but I am missing the double action that I got used to while learning to shoot. It is also of note when you buy this gun you are buying a lifetime warranty for the life of the gun regardless of owner from Taurus.

 Original Polish PPS-43C in a semi-auto version. 7.62x25 caliber, considered a pistol due to overall length. Comes with three - 35rd mags. The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."

KNS Precision AR-15 M16 Non-Rotate, Gen 2 Trigger / Hammer Pins . 154 - Black (IN STOCK)

KNS Precision AR15/M16 Gen 2 Non-Rotate Trigger / Hammer Pins 
•P/N: NRTHP-154 - Black, Diameter .154 
•P/N: NRTHP-1555 - Black, Diameter .1555 
•P/N: NRTHP-170 - Black, Diameter .170 

These are the Generation 2 pin sets. These are the STRONGEST pins that can be produced and were designed to withstand the high impact of full and semi-auto 9mm, .223, and 7.62mm suppressed weapons. The pins are stainless steel. End retainers are black oxide. The dark earth and OD green have a phosphate base coat. An absolute must-have for all M-16 owners. They will also protect your AR-15. Special anti-creep retainers prevent wear on your irreplaceable M-16 or AR-15 receiver. 
•Pin installation tool & 2 Allen wrenches included. 
•No modification to firearm required. 

THE TORQUE SPEC ON THE SCREW IS 11 inch/lbs. MAXIMUM. 

The .1555 dia. pin is for worn receiver trigger and hammer pin holes. Being non-rotational, further wear is eliminated. They will also fit new receivers and will remove the free-play in match triggers. The .1555 will not fit Jewell Trigger System. 

The .170 size fits late model Colts. For Rock River National Match triggers use the .1555 only. 

 There is no strength difference between the Gen 2 and Gen 2 Mod 2 sideplates. 

The only difference is cosmetic. 

 IMPORTANT NOTE: The external width of some AR receivers may vary in the trigger/hammer pin area depending on the manufacturer. Our pins may be shortened a small amount by carefully filing material evenly from both ends of the pins. The being too long will not affect the function or performance."

 Springfield Armory XD(M) .40 Cal

Item Description

The Standards

In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber

Stiker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol

USA Trigger System™

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied

Personalization

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps

With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)agazine X-Tensions™

With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™

A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position

(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case

Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

Innovations

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

(M)inimal Error DisassemblyInnovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release

The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

(M)ega Capacity Magazine

The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

Technology

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Design

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations

(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

These are the Generation 2 Mod 2 pin sets. They are the STRONGEST pins that can be produced and were designed to withstand the high impact of full and semi-automatic 9mm and .223 suppressed weapons. They will also fit the .308 AR rifles. The pins are stainless steel. End retainers are black oxide.. An absolute must-have for all M-16 owners. They will also protect your AR-15. Special anti-creep retainers prevent wear on your irreplaceable M-16 or AR-15 receiver. 
•Pin installation tool & 2 Allen wrenches included. 
•No modification to firearm required. 

 THE TORQUE SPEC ON THE SCREW IS 11 inch/lbs. MAXIMUM. 

 The .1555 dia. pin is for worn receiver trigger and hammer pin holes. Being non-rotational, further wear is eliminated. They will also fit new receivers and will remove the free-play in match triggers. 

The .1555 will not fit Jewell Trigger System. 

 IMPORTANT NOTE: The external width of some AR receivers may vary in the trigger/hammer pin area depending on the manufacturer. Our pins may be shortened a small amount by carefully filing material evenly from both ends of the pins. The being too long will not affect the function or performance. 

 The .170 size fits late model Colts. For Rock River National Match triggers use the .1555 only. 

The only difference from the Gen 2 pin kit is the appearance of the sideplates. There is no strength difference.

 PLEASE READ the INSTRUCTIONS!!! Over-torquing the screws can casue damge to these sideplates."

Sig Sauer P238 .380 ACP

238-380-TSS

Item Description

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

SPRINGFIELD ARMORY XD-S 9mm BLACK

Item Description

SAFETY--- Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

ULTRA SAFETY ASSURANCE (USA) TRIGGER SYSTEM---The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

LOADED CHAMBER INDICATOR---The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

GRIP SAFETY---All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

FAIL-SAFE DISASSEMBLY---The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

SECURE GRIP TEXTURE---The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

MELONITE FINISH AND CARRYING CASE---To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

ERGONOMIC---Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

PICATINNY RAIL SYSTEM---A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

SHORT RESET TRIGGER---The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

SNAG FREE SIGHTS---The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

MOULD-TRU BACKSTRAPS---With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.

SLIM CONTOUR FRAME---The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.

SURE GRASP SLIDE SERRATIONS---The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol.

I'm a 1911 all steel gun guy. I tried to like a polymer gun but even with the upgrades it just doesn't feel right.   

Prefer a 1911 trade. The gun + tax + 33 round Glock mag + Ghost 3.5 trigger job + Ghost springs + the gunsmith labor to install it all I have close to $900 into the gun. Hoping to find someone in similar circumstances with a 1911.

This is an all numbers matching SKS in nice condition. When I got it, it had not been shot and was still fully packed in cosmoline. This Paratrooper also has an original metal ""cheese grater"" gas piston cover. This option is very uncommon.

The Paratrooper is a shorter barreled, shorter stock version of the standard SKS. All the action components and frame are identical so standard SKS upgrades will also fit the same. For reference, here is a photo of the different variations of SKS available, the Paratrooper is on top:

This is probably going to raise the eyebrows of gun traders like myself. I picked these up here and there just because the price was right. The 7mm was my deer/elk rifle for several hunts and does have a ding here and there but nothing major. The Marlin I picked up on a partial trade but really have no use for it so it just sits in the closet. The Model 220 I took on a partial trade a few years back. And again, I have no use for it either. They all function nicely and just need to find another home, as I am running out of safe and closet space. I want to let all 3 go for a quality handgun. I'm putting a total trade value of around $700 obo and I think that is fairly reasonable. That's 100$ on the 220.  $200 on the model 81 and $400 on the 7mm. I like Glocks, Walthers, Sigs, XDS in 9mm and maybe a quality revolver. Just let me know what you have to offer. I am pretty firm on the price but may be willing to work with someone who is interested. Thanks for looking!"
