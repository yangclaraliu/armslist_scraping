It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

This is a Parker Reproduction that was manufactured under contract with Winchester at the Olin-Kondesha plant in Japan. These guns were only manufactured for about 4 years but were of extremely good quality, in fact the parts are interchangeable with original late production Parkers! Some would argue that these are actually of better quality than the originals due to improvements in steel alloys and the chrome lined barrels which were not used in the old guns. This example is a DHE grade chambered in 12-gauge. While the 12-gauge is the most common bore in the original Parkers, not so with the Parker Reproductions where the 12-gauge is actually the most scarce (twice as many 28-ga guns were made, and 3x as many 20's). This gun is built on the 1-1/2 sized frame and wears 26"" barrels with two beads. The chambers are 2-3/4"" and the barrels are choked Improved Cylinder & Modified. It features Ejectors, a Single-Selective Trigger, and automatic safety. The receiver is engraved and has a case color finish. The barrels are rust blue in the traditional manner. The wood has pleasing figure and cut checkering. The pistol grip buttstock has a skeleton buttplate and there is a beavertail forend. LOP measures 14-1/8""; D@H is 2-1/4""; D@C is 1-1/4"". Overall condition is quite good with some moderate wear and handling from use. The case colored finish is strong on the receiver and screws are untouched. The finish on the barrels rates about 97-98% with a few minor marks but no rust, pitting, or dents. The stocks are sound and free of any cracks or chips. There are some normal handling marks as one would expect in a gun that has seen some light use in the field. There are no large dings, dents, gouges or ugly scratches although there are a series of very small shallow dents along the upper right side of the butt. Mechanically excellent with nice bright bores. It comes in the original factory supplied case with outer canvas/leather cover and includes the original snap-caps as well. This would appear to be a nice early example...serial number 12-00046."

Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

The rifle has the accu-trigger which helps place tight shots with an over-sized bolt handle.  I used this for squirrels with a Silencerco Sparrow suppressor, and I can only hear the hammer drop.  It's very accurate, and very quiet.  Ran out of squirrels, and have no use for it anymore.  The scope is a bit overkill for this rifle, but I wanted something I didn't have to replace.

The scope has an adjustable front objective for focusing in on targets from 15 to 300 yards, a very wide rear eye-piece, and has a 40mm objective with a 30mm tube to give a wide field of view making it easier to quickly acquire a target.  It has windage / elevation knobs that have an audible click, and a firm stance for tweaking adjustments.  Look up the reviews on it, and you'll understand why I chose it.  It goes for about $140-200 based on where you get it.  The rifle is $250-275.

Rifle + Scope = $350
Comes with one 10 round magazine, one 5 round magazine, scope sun-shade, optic cover, thread protector.  Gun has been shot approximately 30 to 50 times.

I love this rifle, never have had any problems with it and will miss it dearly but must sell due to moving to Louisville and hitting a rough patch with moving expenses. Asking $250. I think this is more than a fair deal. I will say this again the rifle is in excellent shape, shoots fairly accurate and is not a rusty club. I don't have time for flakes which seem to patrol this site a lot lately. I'm not down for an all day shoot and fun just to show you the weapon works as advertised, getting tired of letting people shoot for free and having to bust it down again and clean it. Serious inquirers only please!

The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

The PPQ comes with low-profile, 3-dot polymer combat sights. The rear sight is driftable  for windage, it comes with 6 interchangeable front sights for adjusting elevation. 

The slide and barrel are tennifer coated, meaning the gun resists scuffs, fatigue, and corrosion extremely well. On top on that it has a flawless custom OD green Cerakote job, which further provides corrosion and scuff resistance. 

It has three different backstraps, changeable by merely removing a pin to find that perfect fit. It is also built with a non-slip cross directional grip surface, which make sure this gun doesn't move in your hand. Front and rear cocking serrations provide ease of use when cocking. 

It has no external safeties, but 2 drop safeties and a firing pin block. 

The trigger is extremely smooth with a short reset. The trigger is right around 5.5 pounds and has a .4 in trigger  travel, and .1 in reset. 

Equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 custom rail. It comes with two all metal magazines one that holds 11 rounds and one that holds 13, and a Uplula inspired Walther Mag Loader. 

Here is a wonderful review by Nutnfancy on the PPQ M2 http://youtu.be/HcV7l4AjeXk

This particular pistol only has about 500 rounds through it, and runs extremely smooth.
It also comes with 75 rounds of .40 ammo. I have more photos showing the OD Green Finish, and the flawless job done on the coating. Feel free to reach out to me for more photos and price was just dropped from $650 to $600."

This deal is for the famed (and hard to find!) 2SUM package that includes *two* complete P250 9mm pistols that share a common FCU (Fire Control Unit).  One is full sized, the other is the sub-compact which is perfect for concealed carry.   The shared fire-control can be swapped from the full size to the sub-compact in 30 seconds or less.   I'll give you a free lesson.  :-)

The Sig P250 is ultra reliable and neither of these pistols has malfunctioned with a FTF, FTE or stove pipe.   The pair comes with the original case and original mags, and the PAIR has seen less than 100 rounds, so this 2SUM is LNIB (Like new, in the box).  Both pistols are finished in Nitron (sig-speak for parkerized), have SigLlite night sights.

I'll make thiis deal ONE BETTER and include a SigSauer laser sight, model CPL-RM-R.   This item sells for $100, so consider it free with this 2SUM we're listing for $700 or best offer.

Face to face in Florida only.  Bring a drivers license and/or a CWP, a copy of the license and be prepared to sign a bill of sale.   Felon's needn't apply - if it's illegal for you to own a gun, don't bother.

Outside of Florida, I'll ship to your FFL for $25 (flat rate to the lower 48).

Built in rangefinder and BDC. It's a great scope and have had no loss of zero when firing off my AK. The mount shown is the mount for the AK style siderails (simply slide it from the back, all the way forward and push the wing nut in and you're locked in place.) but I also have the original scope mount for the dragunov/psl style siderail. Numbers match on scope and dragunov mount.  This is a military issued scope, not a civilian produced. This is shown by the darker finish (civilian issued pso-1 scops have a lighter gunmetal/hammered grey finish) and the rangefinder is set for a 1.7m tall person/target (approx 5'6"") while the civilian issued is ranged for a 1.5m target.    
These scopes sell on Kalinka optics for 269$ plus shipping, and the AK siderail was another 25$. I am selling the scope with both mounts for 200 obo. May also be interested in saturday night specials or similar firearms."

It's had less than 300 rounds put through it. I've always been known to take care of my guns — this thing has been babied. There are some slight blemishes on it due to actually using this gun in the field, but nothing that defects the gun. It's almost a brand new shotgun. These guns are superb shotguns — the drop is phenomenal, the action is flawless. I have cycled everything from light dove loads to heavy turkey loads and this gun hasn't jammed once. All 5 choke tubes are included. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this gun — I am looking to get rid of it because it's not very shooter friendly for me. 

No trades. Price is firm, but I'm open as long as it's fair. I just had it appraised at Lotus Gunworks on 1/18/14, so I know what it's worth. It never hurts to ask if you want something bad enough. You might catch me on the right day. I need to move this before turkey season begins!
