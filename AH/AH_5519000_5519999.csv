Until repaired the gun shouldn't be fired, so I'm selling this as a repair-parts pistol. All other internal parts are in excellent condition (hammer, slide, flip-up barrel, grips, etc.) The pistol includes one 7-round magazine and the original blue case.The price is $120, cash only, no shipping. If you would like additional pictures please email me. Buyer must be over 21, have a valid NM ID, and sign a bill of sale. If interested please email me with your phone number and I'll call you back."

227,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5519227,For Sale:  3-PDR Cannon,"NE, Portland, Oregon",$ 950,"Listed On: Saturday, June 4, 2016",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"I have two so one lucky duck is getting the ultimate home defense weapon. Nothing says ""back off"" quite like a cannon. This will fling a 3lb iron ball over a mile. You think burglars are terrified when the first ball goes by their head? Watch them poo their pants in fear as you load a canister round (for those of you who haven't studied cannons for whatever reason, it's like a shotgun shell, but every lead ball is .58 caliber) and send that 'THRUMP'ing down the driveway. I am not responsible for your wife's reaction, but I can promise the burglar will never be back.The only work it needs is a good cleaning (some minor surface rust and dust from storage), and a vent (10 minute job with a drill press, but I highly recommend a professional gunsmith for it).
The 3PDR is a perfect hybrid between swivel guns and proper field artillery. Small enough that two men can lift the cannon into place without too much difficulty, but with large enough shot that anything in its path will wish it wasn't. The first strike is just as devestating as a 12-lb ball (the 12PDR just goes a lot further, doing more damage, hence why armies used ever-bigger guns). Effective range is 750 yards, maximum range is 1,750 yards. This is a ship-killer; it will go right through thick oak timbers.Cannonball mold available upon request. It's a custom job so I'm not sure what another would cost.
Shipping is LTL and is roughly $300 anywhere in the USA. Payment through my company Paypal only, or money order. Carriage not included, I only have the one. Barrel only.Naval carriages are simple affairs to make; anyone with a pulse should be able to make the 10 wooden pieces for a naval carriage. I am happy to help and send you concept art and my own designs for the carriage in the picture. I should note, pictured is my 1/3 scale cannon (same exact model, but a lot smaller), it's just no longer on my one carriage. I can take current photos if you wish, just email me.
Barrel is 275 pounds, 4 feet long, and the bore is 2.25"". It is dirty, but unfired. A 1/4"" steel liner and threaded plug give this cannon unlimited life expectancy (historical cannons had perhaps 2,000 shots maximum before being considered unsafe; not so with this cannon, shoot as much as you like)
I only have the one, when it's gone it's gone. No way this side of hell I'm selling the other one!"

The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. I also fitted this rifle with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired. Overall this rifle is in excellent condition.. Buyer Pays shipping."

The Sparrow 22 is the first silencer in the world to offer the patented multi part containment (MPC) technology, which allows the Sparrow 22 to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use.
Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. Until SilencerCo introduced the Sparrow 22, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner."

Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length.

This is the hinged-floorplate (FHSS) model not the Trophy Hunter with the removable magazine that is packaged with the Nikon Pro-Staff scope. It is also the new model Savage with the bolt release in front of the trigger guard but has the old Indian head Savage logo. It also features the Accu-Stock and Accu-Trigger. I only have about 30 rounds through this rifle. I purchased it for a out of state hunt and no longer need it. I paid $630 for the rifle alone. The metal and bore are in perfect condition. The stock has a few marks on it from walking through the woods but nothing substantial. I added a Warne 2-piece (steel) scope base and Warne Maxima (steel) medium height scope rings which was approximately another $50. Also coming with the rifle is a Nikon Monarch 3 3-12x42 scope. I paid $450 for the scope. If you don't want the scope I can take it off and sell the rifle for $500.If you have any questions or would like pictures please reply but please don't waste either of our times unless you are serious about buying or trading for it.

The Chiappa 2"" Rhino is a defense revolver which offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which ensures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With a 2"" barrel and a red fiber optic front sight, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. This version of the 2"" Rhino is DA/SA. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included. Manufacturer: Chiappa  Model: Rhino Caliber: 40 S&W Action: DA/SA Barrel Length: 2"" Overall Length: 6.5"" Rifling: 6-1x19"" Weight: 1.5 lbs Grips: Rubber Front Sight: Red Fiber Optic Rear Sight: None Frame Finish: Black Capacity: 6 Rounds"

With weight saving as the prime objective, 2A-Armament set out to build a lightweight solution for those looking for a solid platform to build on. The BALIOS-lite has all the same great features and aesthetics as 2A's standard BALIOS sets, but incorporates a significant weight reduction. The BALIOS-lite is perfect for those who participate in 3-gun, hunting, or any other shooting activity where weight is a concern. Both the upper and lower receivers are equally at home on a standard forged product from other vendors. The flared magazine well aids in rapid reloading, and the tapered transition under the charging handle prevents associated wear patterns from damaging the finish. They have eliminated the forward assist, and retained the port door cover on the upper receiver.     Brand - 2A Armament     Caliber / Gauge - Multi-Caliber     Finish - Hardcoat Anodized - Black     Material - 7075-T6     Pattern - AR-15     Style - Slab Side         Feed Ramps - M4     Take Down / Pivot Pin Type - 0.250 Standard     Trigger Pin Diameter - 0.154       Weight - 12.35 oz         - See more at: http://www.primaryarms.com/2a-armament-balios-lite-billet-receiver-set/p/2a-556-2/#sthash.UebEIwyj.dpuf"
