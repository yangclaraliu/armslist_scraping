J.L.D. Enterprises acquired all the blueprints and tooling from Heckler & Koch to produce these rifles for a short time with genuine HK parts before P.T.R. Industries bought them out. So this is the real deal, and not some C.A.I. CETME assembled from a parts kit. 

Asking 1200 O.B.O. Anyone in the local area feel free to make an offer. And by that, I mean MAKE AN OFFER. Don't e mail me asking what's the lowest I will go on the price, because I won`t answer. Tired of the dreamers and time wasters out here, it's worse than Craigslist. 

The only trades I would consider, would be for a Colt M1991 A1, 1911 45 ACP, or Beretta 92 FS  in 9MM or Cougar.45 ACP, or Springfield M1 A and cash to make up the difference if your trade is worth less than my asking price. Have cash to add for the latter.

Great Condition. Nearly brand new.  Have only fired a couple hundred rounds through it.  I love the gun I just think that it's not something that I need sitting in my closet not being used.  I do not have the money for the ammunition or the investment of this gun.  I heard about this website from a friend and thought I would give it a try.  It really is in great condition and I know someone will benefit from saving the money of buying one from a retailer.  I also have 50 rounds of ammo for it and ear and eye protection.  Looking for 500 or best offer.  Retailers sell it around 550.  Like I said.  It is pretty much brand new plus ammo and ear and eye protection.

I bought this gun when the scare was on from Palmetto in Ridgeland for $864. The Blackhawk accy's were another $50 and the extra mag was $11 so a little over $900 tax tag and title. I'm not one of these people on here that still think AR's are worth a gazzilion dollars. I am firm on my price. If you want to save yourself $150+ dollars on the EXACT same gun you are gonna walk out the door from palmetto with in regards to being new, here ya go.

326,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2189326,"For Sale:  Colt SAA - 1902 - 1st Gen - 4-3/4"" bbl","Thomasville, Greensboro, North Carolina","$ 3,500","Listed On: Saturday, October 5, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1st gen Colt SAA, in .32WCF.  Serial number is 226xxx.  Very little original bluing left; maybe 10%.  There isn't any rust, its just so old that the case blue finish on the frame and hammer is gone, as is the bluing on the barrel and other pieces.  Action is tight and timed well, 4 good clicks on the hammer.  All serial numbered parts match, the rifling is crisp and the bore is shiny; all chambers in the cylinder are shiny, with no visible pitting.  Grips are original, with noticeable wear from a right handed shooter.  Small crack at the bottom of the left grip, but it hasn't fractured to the outside yet.  Small 'bushing', made from the same material as the grips, sits between them where the grip screw pulls them tight.  Appears to be original, but I haven't seen anything like it from Colt before.

Original base pin was bent and mauled pretty badly by vise grips; replacement is in now, from a 1904 SAA.  Original will be included, in case you want to try to repair it & use it instead.  Ejector seems to have had a 'field repair' done on it; seems to be the original piece, but it broke and appears to have been welded back on.  These things were tools, back in the day, and they were often treated that way.

I had a local SASS/Colt SAA guru smoke it over pretty good, and while inside it, there were a couple of hiccups...the bolt was tweaked a little, and it broke when he was trying to bend it back into place; it was replaced and fitted properly.  The sear and bolt spring snapped during reassembly; it was replaced.  The base pin latch assembly was missing from the gun, he used the one from his 1904 piece.  

I have the Colt Letter, verifying that the gun was shipped to Townley Metal and Hardware Company, Kansas City, MO, in May of 1902.  The letter will go with the revolver when it ships.  I have MANY pictures of the revolver and can provide them upon request, or take specific pics of whatever you want to see.

Blue Book puts the value at $2,000-$4,000; at the NRA show in Houston this year, I spoke with several Colt Collectors & dealers, and got values from $1,500 to $5,000, with offers from $1,200 to $2,000 (they 'wanted a little room' so they could make some money on it).

I'd like to get $3,500 for it.  Shipped to your FFL or FTF in central NC.  Price is negotiable, but lowball offers will be rejected out of hand."

Bersa Thunder is one of the many derivatives of Walther PPK design. Since the supply of the military surplus Makarovs and CZ 82s have dwindled, Bersa has become the most economical way to own a gun similar to that owned by Agent 007 for half the price, and no loss in accuracy.

James Bong, as it happens, knew what he was doing when it came to the choice of firearms. 380 ACP is the most powerful Western caliber that is practical with a blowback action. Since in a blowback gun the barrel does not move, the gun is surprisingly accurate for its size, and has a very manageable recoil.

I upgraded to the vented and railed stock as well as a Limbsaver Recoil pad.  

The Kel-Tec is a cool platform that will accept any AR mag.  It comes with 2 ten round mags that fit into the folding stock.  The gun does fold for storage, but can not be fired that way.  This fact allows this variation to be CA legal.  

The Kel-Tec bolt system is piston driven, and there is a bolt hold open feature.  All standard AR mags fit and drop free.  The weapon is SUPER !! lightweight ! Standard weight around 5 lbs., which makes it a nice shooter.

I also have the original forearm/bipod combo, box and manual, as well as the ""Dynamic Deflector"", which is more robust cocking handle than the standard.  I tried the deflector as I shoot Ambidextrous, however, it wasn't a big improvement over the std handle when shooting left.

Are you like me, picky about your weapons?
You cant find a mark, nick, ding, scratch, or smudge on it, no apologizing for it.. 
You will be proud to show your buddies, pals, family this new gun.
It comes in the Kimber case with all books, manuals, papers, everything Kimber sent.
This gun comes from Kimber's custom shop with lots of features and the full ""melt"" treatment that makes it an excellent carry gun too.
This gun will leave you smiling with its superior condition.
You can spend more, but you cant buy a nicer gun even if you do buy a new one.
One minute after you walk out the gun shop door you own a used gun, so save up front by purchasing this gun instead of paying new prices plus all the extras on top of it.
You wont pay any taxes or fees on this purchase either.
No paperwork to fill out either unless you desire a bill of sale.
I will happily provide a bill of sale to any party if desired.
I have had several Kimbers, other CDP'S, and Gold Matches too, this is as nice as any.
I am always open to trades, if they make money sense to me, so feel free to offer.
I have priced my gun very realistically if you are seeking a high end name brand pistol.
Be realistic if you are pricing your trades, no modern gun is worth new cost anymore.
I am in Washington daily, and st Charles and chesterfield several times weekly.
I might travel to meet elsewhere if my schedule fits, and it is interesting to me.
I have .45 ammo to sell you if you need some too, fairly priced for gun buyer."

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console is Console Vault's flagship product. Taking full advantage of General Motors' model change in 2007 that allowed a much larger console, Console Vault crafted an amazing vault that took full advantage of the ample space now provided. 

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console Vault features an awesome secret compartment at its base, providing an extra dosage of security and covertness for your valuables. The hidden compartment may be used for extra secure storage, and should you not wish to take advantage of this feature, simply remove the access panel for additional space. We've seen some customers attach a holster to this area with velcro, enabling them to keep their firearm in place while traveling. 

 As with all Console Vault products, installation is incredibly simple and installation time requires only about 5 - 10 minutes.

 Suburban Floor Console Features:

•Massive 12-Gauge cold rolled plate steel, welded tab and notch seams
•Superior 3-point locking system resists prying
•Bank Vault-style hinge latch pins
•Drill-resistant locks
•Easy 10 minute installation

I picked this up in a trade about two years ago.  The gun was as issued, all numbers matched, however, the front sight and Grenade launcher/Flash had been cut off.  

The Yugo barrel is turned to accept the front sight block and the barrel was hand cut right past the sight block in the groove left from the turning.  The cut was nicely done, button crowned and properly lapped, however, the gun wasn't cycling well due to pressure/gas block issues.  I stick measured the barrel per ATF reg. and it is 17 and3/8 inches long.  

I replaced the original on/off adjustable Yugo gas block with a Murray's Stainless steel fixed block, and that totally solved the gas/cycle issue.  I also upgraded to a Tapco stock with an ATI adjustable buttstock.  

The gun comes with a Tru-Glo 2x red dot, Tapco Mag, and plastic gun case, along with the original stock and fixed mag.  I also have a bolt on front sight and flash, if you want.

This gun is now a fun, light, carbine that is great for the Pig!!  I have always been able to reliably cycle the 156g Softpoints, and the gun is accurate for an SKS.  Usual 50 yard groups are 1-2 inch.  

I am pulling together cash for a new build so trading is not my first option.  I do work out of town and I am only available on Sat 8am-9pm or Sunday 8am-5pm.  Please Email contact info and I will respond!  Thanks seven seven 5v354three seven 9 seven"

Prior to Sabre top brass getting in hot water they were one of a few suppliers to the United States government. If you see U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world using a Browning M2 machine gun, 7.62 mm mini-gun or M16 rifle, chances are very good you’re seeing Sabre products in action. Sabre maintained very high standards allowing them to retain ISO 9001-2008 certification, a rarity in the industry. I am a FFL holder and live in the greater Nashville area (Sabre was headquartered in Nashville). I have been and continue to be a huge Sabre fan and personally own many Sabre rifles.

Colt Official Police .38 Revolver Mfg. 1944 with Holster 

On butt of gun has inscription of H.P.D. no 901 

This is a used condition revolver....it still shoots great. Still fully functional self defense weapon for male or female. 

I've shot it and cleaned it after wards, then it just got put up for 10 years, so I figured I'd see if anyone else would have more use for it. I do not have a box for it or any papers as I inherited it. Just a leather holster that came with it.

It has wear on the grips, the left is better than the right one and holster wear. The bluing is discolored. Best to look at pics and see gun first hand. Overall its in good shape for a gun from 1944. That's based on the serial number I looked up on Colts website and an independent website.

I've been watching them on gunbroker the past few months and they are listed anywhere from $425 for much worse condition up to $800 in better condition. 

So I figured I'd split it down the middle and ask $600 obo cash or open to trade offers for something I can use for home defense or fun with the kids. 

Make me reasonable offer, worst I can say is no thank you. 

Email me your number and I can text you more pics

Must be legal and show ID. I'm a private seller. CWP preferred.

FTF in Clermont area only. Must pick up near me, I can't drive to meet outside of Clermont due to family health issues, sorry.

Thanx for looking......... 

I prefer to sell but if you have something that is a deal, I might consider it. 

See other listings too.......

Would trade this and a Gen 4 Glock 27 less than 50rds for a nice AR only.  

Prefer Spikes, but open to Colt, Rock River, Smith, Bushmaster, or other companies  factory built   (matching upper and lower) 

Open to other Gun trades for just the Colt ......"

Blued Monson-made, 10"" Heavy-vented barrel with Tasco 3x20 scope (which is clear, not foggy) on a B-Square mount.  This DA/SA revolver has the rear-sight, which is sometimes removed (and lost) when a scope is mounted.  It will come with a nice padded gun rug (which is very large, but it still does not quite fit).

This is in quite good condition, except for a small dent in the shroud, which does not affect accuracy nor disassembly; the bluing is not affected.  The bluing on the frame has some plum coloring, which is often the case with Dan Wessons, especially the larger frame models.

 Original photographs from ww2
 You simply can not go somewhere and buy one of these like a lot of military collectibles
 I am relinquishing parts of my ww2 collection so that others may enjoy them.
 This is an alligator skinned leather photo album from the tours of the very first anti aircraft/anti tank unit that Germany created for world war two
 I Flak/Regt 5 
 Alligator skin/leather is in really good shape for it's age and you have to see it to appreciate it.It has a leather strip tied that is binding the pages to the album.Pages are in great shape and still have the onion paper dividers so the pictures don't stick together.
 I have all of the photos removed so they can be viewed without man handling the album it self.(almost 100 pictures)
 There were only six of these units created and they never existed before ww2.This was the very first unit created and remained in service the longest (unit created 10 January,1935 and remained in service until the end of the war in 1945)
 http://www.ww2.dk/ground/flak/flargt5.html
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_corps 
 This album chronicles the units tours through the war.

 Some of the pictures are nicely captioned and dated and include pictures of bombed and burnt out vehicles,artillery,soldiers digging graves and trenches,the huge range finders they used and also a lot of candid shots of the soldiers smiling and having fun playing soccer in the dirt,stacks of wine bottles,playing music ,hanging out in their field tents,etc

 Anyway,i have decided to let this piece go.This is a must have for anybody who is a ww2 buff.Like I said before,this is simply not something you can go out and buy and there will NEVER be another one

 I have added a few pictures here but can take and email more although it would be best to meet and let you see it in person.

Wood is good on stock, except where some bubba decided to embed a belt buckle into the stock, rather than use a proper K98 sling. This has been carefully patched up with successive layers of oak laminate and finish matched back. If you wanted you could always get another stock, or chisel the recess back out properly. I've just left it flat, because this rifle is just a shooter for me.

Has many weimar/nazi eagles in tact - not peened out. The receiver has been sanded however, so markings are very feint. I cannot determine the year and factory on this.

It has been tested successfully out to 200 yards and gives good groups.

Safety works great. Bolt cycles smoothly. Firing pin may need some attention, as once in a while, the pin does not touch off the primer. This could either be a replacement part of perhaps just stretching the spring out, or cleaning out and smoothing the bolt.

Bore in good shape. Crown is clean, no dings. Numbers don't match, but I don't think I have ever seen a turkish mauser with matching numbers. This rifle has been tested out to 100 yards and shoots small groups. This is an Ankara, manufactured/stamped 1945.

There is a stock repair on the right side, which has been neatly done. The stock is sound and there are no issues with the repair, i.e. it's all solid as a rock.

Everything functions well and the rifle is reliable.

Bluing probably about 70-80%.

It's a clean, accurate gun, with a great trigger. If you have never shoot a mauser, I believe you may be in for a treat. This is just a little more than the price of a mosin nagant, but it's street's ahead in terms of quality, accuracy and function. Bolts on mosins are really shiity and sticky, bolts on mausers have been copied by all great modern day manufacturers. This rifle has a smooth bolt and bullets cycle effortlessly.  This represents a better purchase than a mosin, if you were looking for a better milsurp rifle.

I have 8mm surplus mauser ammo which I can sell for 50 cents a round. Reason for selling is I just don't take this girl out on dates anymore (i.e. don't take it to the rifle range)."
