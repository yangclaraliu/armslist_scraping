With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock
configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no
rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from
5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine.
With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a
close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the
Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This
rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications -
with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've
nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an
innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components
for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate
blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density
composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the
ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven
reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine
release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle,
ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's
hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you
have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

 It is a very good carry gun, and fits perfect in everyone's hands.  It is a compact weapon with under a 2"" barrel.  It easily fits into pockets or hides well holstered.

I just gave it a full detail strip and clean, along with some fresh gun oil.  It works as smooth as butter!  The wood grain grips are my favorite thing about this, in person they have a deep red tone I think accents the blued finish well.

This is the most accurate black powder pistol I have ever shot. Ruger Old Army stainless steel, 7.5 in. barrel, with adjustable target sights. It comes with the original wood grips as well as a Houge one piece grip. There are some small areas of light pitting in the surface, I can send close up pics to show details. The bore is shiny and rust free, I have always cleaned it right after shooting it, and always remove the nipples and apply anti-seize as part of the process.
I also have a Stainless Steel Kirst Konverter cylinder for .45 acp that makes for fun shooting that I may consider selling as a separate transaction for $325.00. It's perfect for the times you want to shoot the Ruger at an indoor range and requires no modifications to the Ruger.Please include a phone number if you email and want a response or you can call me at 304-41-85.

I've also got two WWII era canteens with the crossflap pouches and a canteen cup from the same time period.  One canteen is a Vollrath with 1943 markings, the other a 1945 Vollrath.

These pouches were USMC Issue during WW2, and are 3rd Pattern Crossover Canteen Covers, all known as rabbit ear pouches.   Here's a link to a similar setup from Ebay, pulled down when this evening.  He's asking $200 for the one in the first link, second link the guy is asking $150.  They are the only two canteens/covers of this type on ebay.

This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two factory 25 round mags. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if treated properly.  Thanks for stopping by my listing.

Hello,

For sale locally in the Roanoke Valley is a Lee Enfield No.5 MK1 (jungle carbine) chambered in .303 British. This one was made in 1945 at the BSA factory (M/47C) and is in decent shape for what it is. There are a couple issues not too uncommon with an old surplus rifle. You could certainly bring it back to it's old glory. The rear sling loop is gone, the top wood hand guard and barrel band are not on it, and the flash hider could stand to be replaced. All issues are cosmetic and should not effect function of the rifle. What you see in the pictures is what you get.

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01interchangable with every other P-01, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

This particular P01 is equipped with Hi Viz Fiber-Optic Sights, and comes with two 14 round magazines, a custom IWB holster made by Foxx Holsters, hard plastic case and still carries the Nato Stock Number on the slide. Fit and finish are superb and this gun will shoot better than you can at 25 yards. Feel free to text me at REDACTED, with further questions."

This is the real thing, all numbers match with original hand grips, two magazines and 100 rounds. At some point in its life someone polished the barrel removing the original bluing. The rest of the weapon is respectable not museum but clean. She is a solid firing example of this historic firearm. This might be the only change you get to own a working firing example under $1,200. I’m not foolishly thinking this handgun is worth thousands but aside from the polished barrel is a very solid reliable and fun gun to shoot with excellent rifling and function. Again this is the real deal.

From the pictures you can confirm that it is new as well. I currently own a P229. this is the same in every way except for the size. Sig did a great job creating this new model with even better internal engineering and design. 

Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12 rounds of 9mm giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count. Featuring a lightweight alloy frame with Full-size SIGLITEï¿½ Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts.

From the full-sized P226ï¿½ to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same. The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

As part of the Extreme family of handguns, the P224 will feature the distinctive black and grey Hogue Piranha grips, SIGLITE Night Sights and SRT.

DELU & CIE LIEGE BELGIQUE"". They were made from 1908 until WWI interrupted production in 1914. Many later ones were made with a grip safety, but the earliest ones were not. Instead, they have a very positive conventional safety as pictured on the left side. This one has some pitting as seen in the pictures, but after all it is over a hundred years old. It may well have been buried during the Nazi Occupation, so it has some history. I wish it could speak. The bore is good, the internals are nice, and the feed ramp is clean and sharp. They were basically a copy of the Baby Browning of that time, and it shows. When I first handled it, that was exactly what I thought it was.  

I have just cleaned it up but have not shot it. This is the last one of my .25 Auto collection to go, and it is my favorite. Google search these to see the history. There is a little information in English on them - enough to let you know what it is. Also you will see that in a bit better physical condition they bring $350-$500. Felix  Delu was a quality maker on par with FN, and it shows. 

A couple of cool features of this little (very little) all steel pistol are the hold-open notch and the true gutta percha grips. Gutta percha was an early non-synthetic form of plastic. The grips are embossed with the company logo and are in nice shape with no chips.  Takedown and assembly is the same as a Browning or Colt from the same era.  It is a concealed hammer fire action, by the way. Safer than a striker fired single action.  The sights are a channel on top of the slide, and do not protrude. These were made to be carried in a vest pocket so they are snag free.

At any rate, this is a decent representative piece, and I have never seen another one like it in person. It was made about the time that Teddy Roosevelt was president, and when Belgium was the world leader in arms production. All proof marks are present so it should be quite safe to shoot with modern ammunition.

Email me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you so we can meet. I used to put my number in these ads but I got lots of Nigerian princes texting me that they wanted to share their fortunes with me. Sorry for the inconvenience."

A very well made Signal Salute and or Pyrotechnic Mortar Cannon. It is made of all steel construction with some special features. The Barrel can be friction locked at any angle between 70 degrees upward to a negative 8 degrees below level angle of fire. There is a locking lever which will give you a 30 degree or 45 degree set angle of fire. There is no vent because this was designed to be ignited at the muzzle using the standard pyrotechnic style of ignition. A tennis ball happens to fit the bore with a slight resistance. If you preferred a fuse vent, that could be drilled as necessary by the new user. This item must be checked by a qualified Pyrotechnic Expert before use because the art of safely using items like this is a paramount concern. All charges of powder etc. are carefully studied and monitored. There is no vent so therefore we are selling this as a cool display item. Item is not intended to ever be fired.
The mortar weighs 71 lbs. The barrel is 38.5 inches long. The barrel tapers from 2.75 at the muzzle to 3 inches at the breech cap threads. The breech cap is 4 inches outside diameter.
PICTURES AVAILABLE UPON SERIOUS INQUIRE
This item would be very expensive to have made at any modern machine or welding facility.

For some reason, the guy that I bought these magazines from had wrapped them in camoflauge duct tape. I knew the duct tape would leave a mess when I removed it, but I bought them anyways because these USA Magazines have the reputation for being the only detachable steel magazines that are reliable in the SKS. I stripped one of the magazines down to bare metal and it's ready for some fresh paint. I originally had intentions of stripping them both down to bare metal and repainting them, but I recently had to sell my SKS due to financial problems and now these magazines are of no use to me anymore. $25 firm for both magazines

North American Arms mini revolvers are equipped with a unique safety giving its owner maximum protection against accidental discharge. The North American Arms safety cylinder feature allows the gun to be carried fully loaded. There are halfway notches between the chambers. The hammer is lowered into one of these notches after the gun is loaded. When the hammer is pulled back to the firing position the cylinder rotates to the next chamber. Note: The traditional half-cock position is to be used for loading and unloading only.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

The Izhevesk arsenal only produced this weapon for 3 years. 1943-45. It is in 95%+ condition. Very very minor use wear. Teak wood grips, not the Bakelite you see more frequently. Also included is a matching holster in very good + condition, cleaning rod and a nearly full box of 98gr PPU 7.62x38r ammo. The box is full. Take a look at the first pic & see how interesting these rounds are. they are seated fully in the casing for the gas seal system. I just can't express enough how cool this old timre really is. This is single or double action and is collector grade, not the common beater shooter grade pieces you often see. Several more pics upon request.

If you are not familiar with this weapon, do some reading. It's a very cool old gun. It uses a gas seal system and is the only revolver that can be suppressed. When the hammer is pulled back, the cylinder advances forward sealing the round in the barrel increasing pressure and delivering a healthy punch to the target. Ballistics are similar to a .38. When the hammer is not engaged/drawn back to fire, it is impossible for the weapon to accidentally discharge, even if you smacked the hammer WITH a hammer.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

Bottom ejection which makes it great for either right or left handed shooters and does not hit the person next to you. This gun is in excellent condition ( I would say 96% ) with fancy walnut wood. Ithaca makes the best pump shotguns and John Browning designed them. John Browning has designed more American masterpieces then any other gun architect. 

While the photo shows this shotgun with a long barrel, I plan on keeping that one (unless I get an offer I can't refuse!) but am offering a short 20"" barrel in either rifled (deerslayer with sights in 98%) or smoothbore 20"" no sights 95%). Your choice of short barrels for the price of $415. (only one barrel for this price). All barrels are Ithaca parkerized grey. 

These barrels will also fit Ithaca 37's with serial numbers over 855,000. I have tried them on Ithaca 37's. They work great. I will consider selling barrels separately.

$400. This is less than half the price of a new Ithaca Featherlight. Will sell for $550 with both 20"" barrels. The barrels can be changed in under 2 minutes. Rifled barrel for super ACCURATE shooting out to past 150 yards. A rifled slug barrel really transforms the shotgun into a large caliber rifle.

This Luger is much more rare than most of the vintage guns out there, and is a perfect addition to the collection of any serious P-08 or Luger collector.

AF2011-a1 double barrel PiStol The AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes actually as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all times. The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings. TYPE: geometric lock, semiatutomatic double barrel hammer pistol ACTION: short recoil, Colt 1911-A1 system CALIbERS: .45 ACP, .38 Super Auto TRIggER: double hammer with single spur, single trigger set with double spurs. SAFETIES: left lever safety (Colt 1911) with half cock hammer safety and grip safety MAgAZINE: 2 single magazines, paired with single floor plate, 8+8 rounds FRAME: 39NiCrMo steel machined from casting SLIdE: 39NiCrMo steel machined from solid SIgHTS: interchangeable back, fixed or adjustable TOTAL LENgTH: 220 mm bARREL LENgTH: 125 mm TOTAL HEIgHT: 145 mm TOTAL wIdTH: 50 mm TOTAL wEIgHT: 1.850 Grs. unloaded SPECIAL FEATURES: the pistol comes with dedicated polymer security carry case, with cleaning kit and special take-down tool, User Manual and 1 year global warranty.

When Gaston Glock introduced his Austrian duty pistol into the U.S. market, American gun-buying habits were transformed. Despite (or because of) the furore surrounding Glock’s “plastic” pistol—supposedly invisible to airport metal detectors—consumers and police departments were fascinated by the “wonder nine.” When they shot a Glock the resulting revelation spurred sales to unimaginable heights. The original G17 was lighter than all-metal pistols of comparable size, held more ammo and proved to be as trusty as a canine companion. As Gen4 enters circulation, the question looms: has time been kind to the Black Labrador of pistols?
Glock introduced the Gen4 Glock 19 in the middle of 2010. As befits the gunmaker’s evolutionary approach, the move from G19 3.0 to 4.0 was about as radical as a member of the John Birch Society. I received my Gen4 G19 in the usual black lunch box emblazoned with an XXL Glock logo. As someone who believes discretion is the better part of avoiding a Terry Stop, I would have preferred something more subtle. That locks.
Kudos to Glock for packaging the G19 with three fifteen-round magazines (accounting for part of the $50 up-charge from Gen3). In states that have enacted profoundly ignorant “anti-spree killer” high-capacity magazine laws, a buyer receives two emasculated ten-rounders. In Massachusetts, where new Glocks can’t lawfully be sold by any MA dealers to any MA consumers, buyers will receive nothing but the box, empty.
The kit includes the minimalist Glock speedloader, cleaning tools and a manual in 47 languages (including Sanskrit). There’s also a gun safety booklet tucked into the box, in case a buyer thinks The Four Rules of Gun Safety are a Tolkein thing.
I always found Glock pistols to be unnecessarily ugly, and as ungainly looking as broom-handled Mausers. Certainly, I’m aware that they’re fighting guns and not objets d’art, but still, there’s no reason for Glocks to look like they were designed by the local plumbing contractor.
The G19 Gen4 is not a bad-looking gun. I know. Crazy, huh? Those who like the “all handle, no slide” look of the G17 need only to add a palm swell to restore the iconic ugly look. With no palm-swell installed, the G19 is a well-proportioned piece. The sandpaper finish adds a touch of je ne sais quoi (that’s French for WTF), and the gun looks put-together, not thrown together. I’d still be embarrassed to display this pistol next to a Kimber Solo Carry STS, but the G19 has come a long way, baby.
The Gen4 design sports the same the finger-grooved handle of the Gen3. Owners who thought that the grooves were groovy on the Gen3 will find them no more or less groovy on the Gen4, since they’re the same groovy grooves. Those, like me, who hated the grooves will continue to hate them with great passion and conviction.To improve the G19′s grip-ability in moist conditions, the semi’s handle now sports a highly textured finish, bringing all of us one step closer to the elusive goal of shower carry. Since all things Glockian must have a snappy name or a number, Glock’s hard-charging marketing mavens call it their “Rough Texture Frame (RTF)” technology. Not to rain on other guns’ parades, but RTF is GTG (Good to Go); it makes an appreciable difference in humid or precipitous precipitate situations.
The obvious big deal here: Glock’s Smith & Wesson M&P and Springfield XD-chasing “Modular Back Strap System.” As it sits in the box, the G19′s handle is more slender than the Gen3, decreasing the distance-to trigger by .08”. The pistol can be used as it comes; the handle is completely finished with the aforesaid RTF.
Should the G19′s handle prove too small, the owner can add either a medium or a large palm-swell. The medium attachment adds .08” to the present handle, bringing it back to Gen3 dimensions. The large back strap adds an additional .08” to the handle, making it suitable for the hands of a mountain gorilla.I experimented with the palm-swells to determine my best setup. By way of comparison, I shoot my S&W M&P 40c with the medium back strap installed, so I first tried the G19 with no back strap. Hooray and hallelujah, the handle geometry was as comfortable as a cashmere sweater on a chilly day. Finally, I had found a Glock that didn’t feel like a block. That’s the good part. The bad part was that the trigger now seemed too close. I installed the medium back strap to lengthen the distance twixt palm and trigger. This resulted in a trigger length that was perfect, but made the stock too thick for my hands. Just for giggles, I tried the large back strap. It made the gun very clumsy and brought back unfond memories of the Desert Eagle that I recently tested. I settled on no back strap as the best compromise for me.
Changing backstraps is easy, but, like any gun club you care to mention, not tool-free. Glock provides a small and a large pin to hold the selected back strap in place, and a little T-shaped punch tool to push the pin in or out of its hidey-hole. The process starts with knocking out the small pin, which is already installed in the pistol.Thumb pressure it all that’s required to push out the pin. The owner mat then snap an extra back strap into position. Push the correct-sized pin into the hole to hold the whole shooting match together, and that’s that. Installing the medium or large back strap with the proper pin takes just a minute and presto chango, the pistol is re-sized.
The hexagonal rifling of the G19s barrel carries on Glock’s tradition of polygonal rifling—as opposed to conventional lands and grooves—across its pistol line. Glock claims its rifling creates a tighter seal of bullet to barrel and reduced barrel fouling. While the data remains in-house, gunmakers have been using polygonal rifling since the 16th century. So we’ll call it good.The Glock 19′s new dual recoil springs have been the G4′s headline attraction—and not in a good way.According to Glock, the new dual-nested springs were included to soften recoil and lengthen the spring’s lifespan. Similar springs have been used in handguns for a long time. Yes but—how do you improve on perfection? More to the point, Glocks have been good, reliable and strong firearms, springs included. Why fix what ain’t broke?
Reduced recoil? 9mm Glocks have never recoiled harshly. Perhaps they were flippier than some and less flippy than others, but nobody thinks of flippiness or harsh recoil as Glock characteristics. Increased lifespan? That didn’t work out so well. The new springs—called the “Recoil Spring Assembly (RSA)” in Glock spiel—was troublesome. At best. Owners reported Failure to Feed (FTF) and Failure to Eject (FTE) problems as soon as the first Gen4 G17s hit the market.
Users cured these FTF and FTE problems by installing a set of Gen3 springs with a little adapter. Glock moved quickly to head off a PR nightmare and offered replacement RSAs to its customers. In Glock-speak, this was called an “upgrade,” not a recall.
The replacements seem to be doing their job. Today’s buyers may plunk down their hard-earned cash without fear that their springs will fall by summer, leaving them with a winter of discontent. Moreover, the middle-school rumor mill that we call “the gun culture” is all quiet on the Glock front, reaffirming that the new springs are working as they should across the Glock pistol line.Glock polymer sights, with their single dot front and funky, squared-off U insert in the rear, have never been a favorite of mine. The sights on my G19 tester were worse than I remembered. Not enough light passes along the sides of the front sight, so shooting with “equal light” is difficult. The problem isn’t that the front blade is too wide, it’s that the 6” sight radius is too short. Were the sight radius longer, the front blade would block less of the rear and all would be fine with the world. Alas, the sight radius won’t change, but the problem can be rectified by installing better sights.
The G19 weighs under 21 ounces and seems even lighter. While the gun does seem a tad top-heavy, it still balances like a ballerina and points well, too. The gun’s geometry remains unchanged from Gen1, so Glock fans will be comfortable with the Gen4. Down to business . . .
I first loaded five rounds of crappy range ammo into a 15 round mag. I used a traditional 6 o’clock hold to get a good feel for the pistol’s true point of impact. At five yards, I was an inch and a half low-left. I noticed that I was depressing the trigger with my fingertip, not the pad. I never shoot with my fingertip, but with the small backstrap on the gun, my fingertip just went to the trigger automatically. I had to really concentrate on using the pad of my trigger finger with this pistol.
My next two shots, using the pad, rectified the low part of my marksmanship and hit in the same hole. After tiny adjustment of my sight picture, I was on target with two in the red.The trigger was a revelation. I found it just a little bit mushy, but very light for one that’s rated at 5.5 lbs. The reset was not as “clicky” or crisp as other Glock’s that I’ve shot, but all things considered, it’s a damn good trigger. After running through several boxes with two hands and gaining tremendous confidence in the pistol, I decided to try one-handed shooting.
I was surprised that my first shot was a flyer, but then I realized that I had used my fingertip yet again. Making the proper adjust m
