 Savage 96901 B.Mag .17 WSM Bolt-Action Rifle, 22 Inch Barrel, 8-Round Magazine, AccuTrigger

The B.Mag isn’t simply a re-chambered version of an existing platform; Savage designed this rimfire rifle specifically to handle the high velocities of the 17 Winchester Super Magnum with design features typically reserved for their centerfire rifles. In order to maximize accuracy in this long-range shooter, the B.Mag utilizes Savage’s thread-in barrel headspacing system, rear-locking lugs and a cock-on-close bolt capped off with the light, crisp AccuTrigger. It has a flush-fit center-feed rotary magazine. B.Mag also has a soft rubber buttpad and hidden action-screws in a lightweight, black synthetic one-piece stock.

https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA31RCO-M150CP

The TA31RCO-M150CP is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's M4 weapon system. It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included). 

The TA31RCO-M150CP also includes: 
1 Thumbscrew Flattop Adapter (TA51)

Secures with the D-ring and the long rail section clamps down on top of a Flat rail to really lock a rifle up tight. I have a CASV-EL on my AR.. Love it... Everyone that has bought one loves them.

Vltor Description: from website. 
The CASV-M is designed for the popular mid-length gas system rifles. Taking from the same battle proven design as the CASV-EL, the new CASV-M is extended to fit the common midlength or “Nine Inch” handguard design. The CASV-M features a removable lower handguard section and removable rail sections. The area forward of the top rail can be filled with a short rail, or used to mount the optional flip-up sight assembly (see page 21). The CASV-M will work with a Carbine Length gas system; however, a low profile gas block must be used."

THIS IS A MUST HAVE AMMO FOR ANYONE.
This bullet was purposely designed to break into 9 separate paths. Once the bullet penetrates its target, high velocity fragmentation will increase the effect of temporary and permanent cavitation. The 8 fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. This causes multiple wound channels that will effectively hit vital organs for the eventual complete termination of interest. The main mass base of the bullet can continue its path and cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched.
The G2 Research R.I.P. 9mm features
* 16"" Penetration 
 * Up to 6"" diameter spread 
 * 96 gr projectile 
 * 2"" grouping at 25 yrds

Nobody but Les Baer who knew there was a need for a high performance rifle that could serve as either a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle. For 2012, Les has sweetened the pot even a little more by adding a few additional high demand law enforcement features including a new LBC national match carrier, a six position M-4 style collapsible stock, and a very special LBC flip-up front sight.

As a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle, the Les Baer Police Special is the new class of the law enforcement market. It’s loaded with the thoughtful, businesslike features that make it a serious pro, and it’s intentionally devoid of the amateur gee-gaws that cheapen the purpose and limit the usefulness of a police rifle for real police work.

Features include:
• LBC forged and machined upper and lower receiver • Removable carry handle with rear sight • Picatinny flattop rail on upper • LBC National Match carrier, chromed • Precision bolt and extractor • 16” precision button rifled steel barrel with 1 X 8 twist • LBC flip-up front sight • six position M-4 style collapsible stock­ • Special Picatinny 4-way handguard, free floated • Lockable sling swivel mounted on stud on 4-way handguard • 1” nylon sling • A2 style flash hider • Bead blast blue finish on steel parts • Anodized finish on aluminum parts • Timney Match trigger group • (2) 30-round magazines

What it does: 

The Apex Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit features a solid polymer trigger body, with center pivoting safety. This kit will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as, significantly reduce the uptake and over travel (varies). It produces a trigger pull as close to a 1911 trigger as possible in a polymer frame pistol. The Polymer Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break. The rounded trigger face provides the user with a comfortable surface for the firing finger. The kit comes with 2 trigger return springs; one designed to produce a 4lb trigger pull, and one to produce a 5.5lb trigger pull. These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs."

The bluing is near perfect. THE WOOD IS BEAUTIFUL, and it still has the original FN butt-plate. I did my research and the barrel matches the receiver. This is the plain 26"" barreled shotgun, non vent/ribbed. You could probably look around for a long time and be pressed to find a 42 year old A5 this clean. The bore is about as bright as it can get and it has the modified choke.  There have been some questions about its originality..... Here are the answers. This shotgun is dated 1972, Browning went to the square, or flat knob in 67. The FN butt plate is the hardened plastic type that Browning also went to in the late 60's. The older butt plates were made from horn. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. Thanks! I'm mainly looking to trade for quality handguns. Colts, Sigs, Kimbers, or multiple Glocks, Walthers,etc. had a FFL buddy of mine look it over and he said anywhere from $900-$1100 price tag. Just let me know what you have to offer.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

When it comes to Texas CHL, Spartan Defense wants to promote a high level of standards through our concealed handgun courses, based in Corpus Christi. Although, concealed carry is valuable in any given critical or dangerous moment(s), it is a huge responsibility. Part of this responsibility is knowing both the state and federal laws of your location but there are other legal and moral responsibilities that must be considered. At Spartan Defense we will mentor you and train you in the legal lay of the land and in accordance with Texas concealed handgun laws and make sure you know how to respond after a justified use of force or deadly force. At Spartan Defense We Teach a State of The Art Class with incorporated Videos that are humorous yet educational. We Do Not teach from the perspective of a police officer. We do not stand and lecture for 10 hours and we do not read the entire law book verse by verse. Instead we teach from a civilian legal perspective since all licensees will be carrying under the authority of a civilian license. We at Spartan Defense want to make sure our students understand all the legal repercussions involved when using the firearm in self defense so they can better protect themselves not only physically but legally. We challenge our students with situational analysis questions to better prepare them for real life encounters. As a added bonus our handgun license instructor is the only NRA personal protection instructor teaching CHL in this area of Texas and incorporates there expertise' into the class.

Taurus PT-709. Great condition, never had a jam, fired 150 rounds through it. Original owner.  I'm selling to finance an AK, so if you have an AK I'd be willing to trade the gun + cash. This gun comes with two mags. The trigger takes some time to get used to, so I'm more than happy with you getting a feel for it before you decide to buy it or not. You can bring snap caps if you have them.

Prefer to meet in the Kirkland area. 

Please have a CPL. Bill of sale required for my records only. I will create one for you as well if you wish."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100 round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired. Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters. Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum.

About my business: I am a small, home based business that specializes in providing my customers with some of the lowest prices in the state of Utah on new firearms as well as providing excellent customer service and support. As a home business with no additional employees, I have very low overhead operating expenses, and as such, I pass these savings on to my customers. I sell ONLY Brand New, fresh from the factory firearms which are covered with full manufacturers’ warranties. I DO NOT deal with refurbished or remanufactured merchandise of any kind.

As a home business, I operate “By Appointment Only”. I am here nearly all the time, but I do have to occasionally step out to run errands.

LEGACY ARMS CITADEL M-1 .22 LR – Legacy CIR22M1SMMG

“MOONSHINE MUDDY GIRL” EDITION

Straight from the pages of history … the greatest conflict of modern times, World War II … comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exacting specifications of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction rifle comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge.
Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews, and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the “United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1″, its official military designation.

Unique camo stock

Citadel M-1.22 are ready for fun plinking!

The M-1.22 features an adjustable rear sight, semi-automatic blow back action, 10 round magazine and polymer bayonet lug. The M-1.22 has an 18 inch barrel with 6 groove rifling in a 1:16 rate of twist. It’s overall length is 35 inches and the stock is cut of a traditional M1.
