These rifles were stored in the Ukraine by the former Soviet Union, refinished and sent to the U.S. I have owned and shot this rifle for the last 5 years. This bolt-action firearm is in remarkably good condition with all the cosmoline long-since removed. Chambered in 7.62x54R, a caliber that falls between the American .308 and .30-06 in power and ballistics, these rifles are great shooters and suitable for vintage military matches or hunting big game. Each has a top-loading five-round magazine. Rear sights are adjustable for elevation and outfitted with range marks in meters. Front sights are military post-and-globe style. You can mount a scout scope on this beast using a picatinny adapter in place of the rear sight for even better long range accuracy. This rifle comes complete with bayonet, sling and original field maintenance kit. I'll also throw in a few boxes of ammo so you can take it to the range right away. You can usually find additional ammo online for anywhere from $0.20 to $0.30 per round if you buy in bulk which makes this a great range gun (incredible power to cost ratio).
I priced it the same as you can find online, but if you're local you can save both tax and shipping.

Reason being is Taurus does not sell their parts directly to the customer or even a gunsmith. All other wheelguns are relatively easy to fix. 

  For revolver tuning the fee is 60$.
For a full detailed disassembly cleaning and oiling and tuning the fee is 90$. 

Traditional Rust Bluing of a Revolver is 180$ This does not include polishing. 

Polishing is all done by hand and is 80$ per hour. 80$ per hour covers expendable tools like polishing stones, emery cloth, file use, and hand numbing work.

 It is always best to bring in a well cleaned revolver, but if you must have me clean it then you will pay for it. As of yet I know of no one that can tune a revolver so I'm offering this service to fill any voids in repairs. I personally love hunting with my Dan wesson 44, and my S&W 357, and carry my Ruger S. Six 22mag every time I'm working my land, so I can understand the frustration with folks having to send their pistols off to be worked on. This service often times can be accomplished within 48 hours, If parts need to be ordered a repair time will be quoted and adhered to before the service begins. 

 I will not claim to make 60$ per hour. Often times it takes me a couple hours to tune a revolver and longer to clean one. Sometimes special screw drivers are required to be made just to service these gems. These skills are a dying art and something that should not be forgotten. Auto repairs run 100$+ per hour, so why would you pay a gunsmith 20$ per hour to tune a machine that may blow up in your hand?

  I am a professional craftsman, and will operate as such. I do not do rush orders and never will. Each firearm regardless of price or make will receive my complete care and attention. Prices will be quoted before service and will be witnessed by the customer. Retrieval of a repaired pistol will be after service is paid for. 

I will not ship or receive arms under my FFL license. 

I look forward to hearing from you and helping you resolve any issues with your sixgun. God Bless and Happy Shooting"

This comes with (3) 13 round magazines, adjustable backstraps, lock, case, manual, warranty card, and BONUS IWB leather holster. I also have some target and Underwood PD ammo whose price is negotiable. I set the price at $600 for a reason. Yes you could go to glockmeister and pay $549 and get free shipping (best deal on the internet), but then you'd have to pay at least $50 to a local FFL and $52 dollars and change in sales tax which is still better than $650 plus tax at Wade's. Then if you wanted a nice holster you'd go out and drop another $50. Want to stoke it with some premium Underwood 155gr? You'd spend another $50 (inc. shipping)… So, all in you're looking at $750-$800. Kind of makes $600 sound like a steal. If you know Glocks, you know that this is the sweet spot in terms of concealability, power, capacity, and inexpensive and widely available ammo.
CPL and valid driver's license are a non-negotiable condition of sale.
Thanks for looking."

Also, comes with a Colt leather Holster which is also in great condition (No Box). The Colt “Snubbies” were often favored by Police Detectives and others over the Smith & Wesson Chief’s Specials, as the Colts had a full 6-shot capacity, as opposed to the 5-shot S&W. The all-steel pistol has a polished factory blue finish, and checkered wooden grips (these un-marked grips are the correct factory grips for this period). The bore is shiny, and DA trigger pull is very smooth. Overall a beautiful gun. It sits in my safe and I have no use for it."

I have a number of these extremely high quality and hard to find signals available. They are a 50/50, multi use, day / night signaling device. When activated one end releases a dense orange signal smoke for use during the day while the other end contains a bright signal flare when the igniter ring is pulled. Each end operates independently so one can be used while the other is kept in reserve. These types of devices are utilized extensively in aviation survival kits and have been a popular item for special operation groups given their compact size. All units are expired but the ones I have tried work great. I have a number of these available, price is 12 for $160 and I will include the original metal packing can. These are perfect for camping, hiking, go bags, paintball, or any other number of uses. Email with any questions.

It has very few accessories!

Now, along comes Canik 55, a Turkish company who makes this pistol for the Turkish Military (they also make aerospace parts for Lockheed-Martin, Boeing and Airbus). Similar to Bersa, the Argentinian company that makes the Thunder 380 (the clone of the Walther PPK which has proven to be every bit as reliable and durable as the Walther at a small fraction of Walther's price), Canik 55 makes the TP-9; it is an extraordinary clone of the Walther P99, with MANY more included accessories, at a small fraction of Walther's price!

Like the P99, the TP-9 has a marvelous and unique trigger system. You would enjoy Googling the P99's trigger for an explanation, or viewing the links I've provided below.

For example, it includes a large, hard case filled with: 
-Two (2) different backstraps to customize the grip
-A Serpa-type holster with both paddle and  belt attachment options
-Two (2) 18-round magazines
-Cleaning Rod and Brush

The TP-9 has:
-Outer steel parts are poly coated to prevent corrosion and to help lubricate the slide and frame.  
-A black chrome lined - cold forged barrel 
-An ambidextrous top-slide-mounted decocker for super-safe carry
-Click adjustable 3 dot sighting system 
-Cocking indicator 
-A front accessory rail 

Barrel: 4″, Overall: 7.25″, Weight: 1.65 lbs.

You can Google reviews of Walther's P99 and as you can see, the Canik TP-9 will mirror those reviews.

Here are some links to direct, unbiased reviews of the TP-9:

Other info: 
Putting this out there for a feeler. Got this recently from another Calgunner and was planning on turning it into a project gun for trap and skeet. However I'm having second thoughts and don't know if I really want to put that kind of money into it. 

It's a shooter's gun with bluing wear on the receiver but none on the barrel; I'd say its 80%. For those not familiar with this shotgun its 26"" VR skeet choked bbl with machine engraving on the receiver and extra fancy wood. 

Serial number is M47XXX so it's an earlier gun with a ribbed trigger. Later model barrel without the screw on the vent rib. Previous owner replaced the buttplate with a old school Pachmayr recoil pad. 

Asking $800 OBO or trade. The only things I'm really interested in trades are an O/U, Remington 1100 or Wingmaster plus cash

I was a small arms master gunner and squad designated marksman while in the military and take great care of all my weapons when it comes to handling, shooting, and cleaning them.

A little about the gun, the gun isn't even broke in yet. i'd say 300 rounds give or take 50 have been put through it. The spring is as tight as the day purchased. Comes with all original gear. *(Wood Grips, Holster, mag holder, 3 mags, case, and cleaning rod). In addition For the package, I added VZ stealth operator ii ($70 shipped) grips that really give this gun a pop. A leather/kydex IWB holster ($40) and 605 rounds. 450 rounds of target FMJ, and 50 rounds of smith and wesson JHP, and 95 rounds of various other hollow points and 10 premium hollow points.

Selling gun because it's just too nice for me (lol) but really I keep it put up, and it only comes out to show off. A real collectors piece. Asking $1250 for the package, which is more than fair, considering these retail with wood grips for that. I will entertain reasonable offers, low ballers will not be replied to. IE i'll give you $800 for a $1300 gun.

Cash is king. Will however consider a partial trade of the price for a CZ75 SP01 Phantom and other CZ's depending on what you have.

Also, if you offer me a trade, please offer the boot amount if the weapon is obviously of lower cost. Not really planning on trading into a loss, but I am extremely fair with trading for equal value."

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Current retail price on this is between $1.25/round and $1.50/round - I am only asking $1.00 per round for cash offers.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

There may be a small percentage of brass picked up at the range that may or may not have been previously reloaded.  There may also be a small percentage that has been de-primed or that has live primers. (In buying and selling guns, I end up with ammo that I am unsure about, so I pull the bullets and dump the powder)  The live primers are probably still good, but I make no guarantee.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.

There may be a small percentage of brass picked up at the range that may or may not have been previously reloaded.  There may also be a small percentage that has been de-primed or that has live primers. (In buying and selling guns, I end up with ammo that I am unsure about, so I pull the bullets and dump the powder)  The live primers are probably still good, but I make no guarantee.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

As it is piston driven and has an adjustable gas system, virtually any .223/5.56 round, even steel cased Russian ammo, will function well.  It accepts all AR magazines and cleaning the rifle is extremely easy! This is a collector's item but it's much better as a shooter. This rifle in particular is extremely accurate. I'm only letting this go as I want to move onto a .308. Thanks for looking."

Wilson Combat® belts are cut from only the finest top grain cowhide or sharkskin with a cowhide inner lining for additional rigidity and proper support of your firearm. The beautiful double stitching and solid brass belt buckle produce a stylish look that will easily complement a wide variety of clothing. Our belts are sized to be used in conjunction with Wilson Combat® holsters and magazine pouches for maximum performance and enjoyment. The best way to determine your belt size is to take your existing belt and measure from the attachment point of the buckle to the hole in the belt that you are currently using. Then choose the belt size that is closest to this measurement. If this is not possible, your belt size will usually run about two inches larger than your pants size. We space our belt holes every three quarters of an inch instead of the standard one-inch spacing for a perfect fit. Belts are available in 1 ½"" width and waist sizes from 30 inches to 44 inches in two-inch increments."

One of my AR's is a gorgeous LMT Defender 2000 that has had fewer that 500 rounds put through it (all top-shelf brass, no steel-case crap). I have a few high-end AR's but this is my only one that has been a virtual safe queen. There literally is not a single use mark on it, it looks brand new. It's an all-original LMT, purchased earlier this year, that I have tastefully upgraded with useful, high-end parts -- a Troy Battle Sight rear flip-up BUIS (dead-on co-witness), a Troy Carbine-Length quad-rail, an ERGO grip, Spike's billet trigger guard, a Magpul CTS butt-stock and B.A.D. lever, a LaRue Tactical buffer tube and Tubb Precision spring, and an AIMPOINT PRO up top that co-witnesses with the Troy BUIS and standard front A2 sight post. I even have the original LMT box as well.

At **today's** prices this rifle is easily over $2,000 to duplicate, using the best street prices.

This isn't some cheap Rock River, Bushmaster, Windham Walmart rifle or a Frankenbuild. No, this is a beautiful rifle, and is ready to be YOUR go-to battle rifle. If you're interested feel free to email or call. I'm in Northeast Alabama, and I have my own 150-yard rifle range if you want to come by and give her a test-drive.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I have a number of AR's, and I'd like to finance the purchase of a high-end OPMOD PVS-14 G3MM NVS system.

WHO CAN BUY:  Anyone of appropriate age who is legally eligible under state and federal firearms restrictions -- i.e. no felony convictions and/or no domestic violence arrests.

The stainless steel barrel is just 3.5"" long. The grip frame is roughly half an inch shorter than the standard frames. The shorter barrel and shorter grip frame result in a 32 ounce pistol that is an excellent choice for carry. This model has a stainless steel slide and frame, with the flat surfaces polished and the rounded surfaces left matte, giving it an attractive, almost two-tone look. The red Cocobolo grips stand out against the stainless, and feature the Springfield Armory logo. The low profile combat sights also make this a good carry pistol. The rear sight has smooth corners. The sights have three tritium dots embedded in them for low light shooting. This pistol is fitted with a match trigger, with a pull of five to six pounds, just right for a combat pistol. The ambidextrous safety is a plus for competition shooters doing weak hand drills, not to mention southpaw shooters. Shipping to your FFl $25.00.. Very Low Round Count. VERY NICE.
