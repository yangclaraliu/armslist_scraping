Was bought from a gun collection. Was told it's never been fired. It's the centennial model only made 1 year. It's a beautiful gun. These are better than the new Marlins owned by remington. It's a 1970 pre safety. Would consider trading for a glock 43.

The MP5 is the ultimate close-quarters weapon. Created for use in very confined spaces, it is optimally suited both for active engagement of individual targets, and for personal defense. Up for sale from my HK collection is a MP5 built by Turner Fabrications out of Mesa, AZ. Mike Turner has an outstanding reputation for being an excellent HK smith, right up there with TPM Outfitters, Investment Grade Firearms (IGF), and Parabellum Combat Systems (Ghilliebear). Don't be fooled by the cheaper, poorly built weapons like Vector, Bobcat, Coharie, Special Weapons (SW), Atlantic Arms (AA), Pakistani Ordnance Factory (POF), or MKE. This is as close as you can get in quality and accuracy to a genuine German HK mp5 without paying $6-7k for a factory HK weapon. The welds on this pistol are cleaner than some of my factory HK roller locking weapons (HK 91, 93, etc.). This comes with a full auto bolt carrier and was fully tested by Turner Fab to run flawlessly in semi and full auto, so it would make a perfect host for your registered auto sear or trigger pack (NFA rules apply). Comes with the following upgrades: clipped and pinned SEF trigger group (extra $100); shell deflector ($125); and hammer forged 3-lug ($50) to easily accept a suppressor (silencer). This has been a safe queen since I bought it and has spent its entire life in a climate controlled environment. It has a very, very low round count and will last a lifetime. No optics have ever been mounted so there are no claw marks from rails or scope mounts on the top of the receiver like some other MP5's out there. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one 30rd curved mag. Private sale if local, with no FFL fees or BS to deal with, or I can accept a certified check or USPS money order and shipping will be $35 to your FFL from a private individual, or an additional $25 if my FFL must ship it. Please be sure it is legal to own in your state/area."

Brand new, never fired! The MP5K is the ultimate close-quarters weapon. Created for use in very confined spaces, it is optimally suited both for active engagement of individual targets, and for personal defense. Up for sale from my HK collection is a brand new SP89 (mp5k) built by T.P.M. Outfitters out of Carrollton, TX. Ken Clark and Matt Sidley of TPM have an outstanding reputation for being excellent HK smiths, right up there with Turner Fabrications, Investment Grade Firearms (IGF), and Parabellum Combat Systems (Ghilliebear). Don't be fooled by the cheaper, poorly built weapons like Vector, Bobcat, Coharie, Special Weapons (SW), Atlantic Arms (AA), Pakistani Ordnance Factory (POF), or MKE. This is as close as you can get in quality and accuracy to a genuine German HK SP89/mp5k without paying $6-7k for a factory HK weapon. The welds on this pistol are cleaner than some of my factory HK roller locking weapons (HK 91, 93, etc.). This comes with a full auto bolt carrier and was fully tested by TPM to run flawlessly in semi and full auto so it would make a perfect host for your registered auto sear or trigger pack (NFA rules apply). Comes with the following upgrades: clipped and pinned SEF trigger group (extra $100); shell deflector ($125); and hammer forged 3-lug / threaded barrel ($50) to easily accept either type of suppressor (silencer). This has been a safe queen since I bought it and has spent its entire life in a climate controlled environment. Condition is nothing less than flawless as the day I got it. No optics have ever been mounted so there are no claw marks from rails or scope mounts on the top of the receiver like some other MP5's out there. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one 30rd curved mag. Private sale if local, with no FFL fees or BS to deal with, or I can accept a certified check or USPS money order and shipping will be $35 to your FFL from a private individual, or an additional $25 if my FFL must ship it. Please be sure it is legal to own in your state/area.

Columbus/Harris Co., Columbus, GA, Georgia",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, June 19, 2016",Handguns,no type,38 S&W Special,no type,no type,"Hi guys, up on the trading block is my beloved old Smith & Wesson Model 15-4 Combat Masterpiece. I'm not dying to let this go, it's mostly just another case of boredom and an urge to see what else is out there.I bought the pistol several years back from a popular on-line dealer, and had it transfered through my regular FFL/gunsmith here in Columbus. I've fired it two, maybe three whole times, just a few cylinders each time, and it's a fantastic shooter. It's clearly had very few rounds run through it. To the naked eye, there's virtually no visible turn line on the cylinder, and no visible flame cutting  under the top strap.It has a 4"" pinned barrel, adjustable rear sights, ramp front sight, and original grips numbered to the pistol. My information dates this serial number as having a 1979-1980 manufacturing date.The pistol is in almost immaculate condition, which is a big reason I'm considering letting it go: I never wanted to carry it, or even shoot it much, because I wanted to keep it in this pristine condition !!! (yeah, I know, that's a little twisted!)So, my trade interest are something I won't mind dragging around a little, like one of those stainless snub-nosed Ruger SP101's with the badger boot grips that I've seen floating around lately, or maybe a 4"" GP100, or possibly an early gen 3 Glock 19 or 17.That's all that really comes to mind, but it can't hurt to ask.Any interested party must be legal to own firearms, and a legal Georgia resident over age 21. I'm a regular here on Armslist, with my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go.Thanks for looking........"

Condition of the firearm is excellent, with little to no wear marks on the firearm other than some very slight wear on the bluing of the barrel near the chamber. The holster has a unique rubberized exterior that sticks to the confines of your pocket really well which means that when you draw the firearm, the holster wont come out with it nearly as easily as some of the others I have tested. The firearm comes with one factory 6 round magazine (both the flush and factory extended plates come with it).The price for the package is $240 firm, and you can either reach me by email or call/text (text is preferred) at 417-719-039four. I will not be available to do deals today (06/19/16, Sunday) but im available to deal with you tomorrow pretty much all day. I can meet you in the Springfield/Nixa/Ozark area, and my rules for deal making are simple: You assume all responsiblity of the firearm and are legal to possess it when we conduct the deal, I do NOT require a bill of sale but I will do one if you want to, and do not waste my time with no call no shows, last minute ""will you take its"", or anything of the sort.
