The comfortable design of the all new XD-S™ feels so natural, it’s like an extension of your own body. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control.

With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S™ offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S™ offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a 9mm or .45ACP in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

 Right now we have a larger quantity of 22LR available than any Walmart near you. As a dealer we may never see this much 22 again. This is in fact our first shipment of ammo ever, and as an independent dealer with no big-box store buying power, we were lucky to receive it. So we're selling it. Despite wanting to keep it and spend the next several years shooting it all ourselves. No limits on purchases, with pricing half that of many online retailers.

190,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2903190,"For Sale:  Bravo Company Manufacturing - BCM KMR 13"" keymod rail","Polaris, Columbus, Ohio",$ 269,"Listed On: Friday, July 17, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Description




BCM KMR-13

Bravo Company’s KeyMod™ Rail, 13”

Manufactured from an exclusive blended aluminum and magnesium alloy, it weighs 30-40% less than aluminum with the same strength properties. Also featuring a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement under heat generated from the barrel nut.

Handguard alone weighs 5.5oz!

Mounting hardware, 2.2oz, for a total of 7.7oz on a very long 13” rail.

The KMR’s propriety finish was originally developed for the Aerospace industry. It is a plasma deposition process which creates a stabilized ceramic-like surface coating with superior wear resistance when compared to anodize or even hard chrome. The stabilized nature of the coating means it has a higher corrosion resistance as well, due to the lack of ‘pores’ in the surface.

The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs' product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system.

The BCM KMR also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions.

In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system."

From Sig's site: The P220 Elite is a new breed of P220 loaded with features and designed to provide outstanding ergonomic performance. The Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG's Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite."

But it has been my EDC, anyone who has a Gen 4 knows the new finish gets wear/use marks(not thru finish). I't's never had any failure of any kind and about 2 months ago I had Hawk Tech do the trigger guard mod, which is taking it up about 1/8th an inch where it meets with the grip for a higher grip. If you know Glocks you know it's a very popular mods with the 19/23. I'm wanting to make the move to 9mm so I'm looking to sell or trade my G23, I will only trade for a GEN 4 Glock 17 or 19 with production date 2013 or newer. The older 9mm Gen 4's had some issues I don't want to deal with. It needs to be in perfect condition like mine minus some minor finish blemishes from use/carry, like mine. I also will need a bill of sale/transfer. If it's a trade I will put ""Trade under condition of perfect WORKING order, with 30 day period"" thats more than enough time to get out and make sure it runs right. Glock has a lifetime warranty but this is just to be safe and not have to deal with it. I expect you to be willing to do the same.

Again, except for some very minor scratches, the grips are in great condition as well.  The gun does not appear to have been shot much at all. The forcing cone looks great and the bore is in excellent condition.  The lock-up is tight and the action is very is smooth.  I fired a box of .38 Specials through it and the gun functioned perfectly.  Cimarron generally holds Uberti to somewhat higher standards for manufacturing their handguns.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR

This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

The gun shoots great and is a perfect truck gun if I must say so myself. The 30-30 is a great all around cartridge that won't let you down and has been proven time and time again. With that being said, rifle is a shooter and is in good condition with some honest wear, no wall hangers in this house. I believe the ser # puts it somewhere in the 70's so it's when Winchester was still making great guns and actually owned it. It's not a pre 64 but still a great timeless classic that will live in infamy. I also have a scope that's noting special but will get the job done if you don't prefer iron sights. It's got the quick detach mount already installed if you wish to go that route. I personally just love to let that gun run with open sights and do what John M. Browning intended it to do. Anyhow that's my speech let me know if you need more pics or info. Great gun, runs all day, ammo is everywhere, shoot straight, drink water, and change your socks.

Known for it's low price and as the original Saturday Night Special you will be the envy 
of no one if you use this gun for your personal protection. Prone to accidental discharge when dropped and FTF / FTE issues this thing is best suited as a collectors piece. Besides if you shoot some one with a .25cal all you're going to do is make them mad.

And hey it comes with this nice box, maybe that's worth something?  

Will sell face to face provided you have a valid Wisconsin ID and are not a prohibited person, or will gladly ship at your expense to an FFL of your choice. 

OK the price, I am selling this for a friend, mostly because I hate to see my friends carry junk, but because of that the price is not up for discussion.

Known for it's low price and as the original Saturday Night Special you will be the envy 
of no one if you use this gun for your personal protection. Prone to accidental discharge when dropped and FTF / FTE issues this thing is best suited as a collectors piece. 
Don't forget the cast metal slide on these things that like to crack after a few thousand rounds.  The lucky buyer will get an extra magazine! WOW! I dont think these guns ever made it through one mag with out an FTF so the extra one is wishful thinking. 

And hey it comes with this nice box, maybe that's worth something?  

This gun is the perfect throw down gun, you know for when you shoot someone only to find out he was just reaching for his cell phone, you cops know what I mean. 

Will sell face to face provided you have a Valida Wisconsin ID and are not a prohibited person, or will gladly ship at your expense to an FFL of your choice. 

OK the price, I am selling this for a friend, mostly because I hate to see my friends carry junk, but because of that the price is not up for discussion. I am hoping it goes to a collector with a sense of humor.  No trades, although I cant imaging anything someone would offer, chickens maybe?

Recent Review:
The smallest member of the Bersa family of .380's. Although the magazine capacity is a generous eight rounds in a single column, the makers have managed to make the butt feel even shorter than their standard pistol, added machined grasping grooves to the front strap and recontoured the two-piece, wrap around plastic grip that provides a good grip while still remaining small and snag free, no easy matter. I find this the most ergonomic .380 out there at the moment regarding grip feel. It is that good.

Hollow point ammunition is designed to flatten upon impact, and is ideal for a home defense setting where you want to cause the most damage possible to your target while avoiding collateral damage caused by shooting through walls.  

9mm ammunition is in high demand right now.  It’s sold out almost everywhere, and if your gun range has it, it probably has limits on how much you can buy at one time.  I just called my local Dick’s Sporting Goods, and they only have 10 fifty-round boxes.  No limits here though – first come, first serve.

BCMGUNFIGHTER Charging Handle (5.56mm/.223) w/ (MEDIUM) Latch

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.
1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.
2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation."
