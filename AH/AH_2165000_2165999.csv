Herstal is pretty much worn off or hidden due to reblueing. Redfield rear peep sight. Front and rear swivels for strap. I bought this gun a while back as a project that I never got to. Works just fine and kicks like a mule!! . Someone obviously re-blued this rifle and did a great job. For such an old rifle it is really sweet looking! The rifling looks good to me and it looks a little dark in pic but in person shines more. I think it has been re-barreled at one time because the numbers don't match the receiver and the bolt does not match either one. no numbers on removable mag (holds 5 I believe) or trigger that I can see. nice strong smooth action with no feeding or ejection problems at all. comes with extras including 2 bore brushes, laser sighter, about 15-20 rounds of Turkish ammo with bandolier, stripper clips and empty casings(I shot about 20 of these through it then cleaned it.), almost 2 full boxes of sellier & bellot 8x57 js. The latter possibly being unsafe to shoot through this gun, but I shot one through it with no problems. I was going to mount a scope on it etc., but I never got around to it. The only thing wrong with it is the front blade sight is loose and will fall out but that's an easy fix I'm sure. wood in excellent shape for age with just some dings here and there and maybe one small chip of wood that has been missing behind bolt for some time, but no splits or repairs that I can see. USPS MONEY ORDER ONLY! Three day inspection period. DO NOT FIRE THE JS AMMO THROUGH IT WITHOUT CHECKING WITH A GUNSMITH FIRST TO MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE! Turkish ammo is corrosive I believe so make sure you clean it immediately after firing. Buyer pays actual shipping cost. Guaranteed to function and fire as intended, and be in condition stated. Ammo and extras will ship in separate box to your door. OPEN TO TRADES, LET ME KNOW WHAT YA GOT!"

I'm not that big into archery.  I bought this compound bow in Sept. 2011.  A fiend of mine was trying to get me into archery.  I have shot it probably a total of 100 times, I got the bow string replaced at the end of last years deer archery season.   I have put wax on the string about once a month since then.  

This package includes the bow (draw length 29, pull weight 66-67lbs), 9 arrows, 3 brand new hunting tips, the left hand string release hook, new peep sight, and case for everything.
I also have a shooting stop that I purchased at the same time so I could practice in my back yard.  That will be included as well.  I don't really have a use for it anymore.   I have about 650 invested in the package.  I am not looking to get my money back, so first decent offer takes it.

Further, once the X26c is deployed, you can pull the trigger up to 2 more times during the 10sec burst to add 20 more seconds for the bad guy to be incapacitated.

This gun is almost 20 years old (19 to be exact), and yet looks like it just came from the manufacturer and landed on a Dealers' shelf. It's in pristine condition, with only a very, very,very slight 1/4 inch straight scratch along the exact edge of the slide where it sat in my computer desk, and another tiny pinprick dot (1/16 of an inch) also on the slide edge where it must've contacted the surface of the desk drawer. The gun was shot exactly twice in 19 years, probably the first weekend I bought it, and has sat in my computer desk ever since 1994... This is old school, vintage Sig Sauer P228 where it all began about 20 years ago, with its then adoption by the FBI as a primary duty weapon. It's interesting to see that the design of this gun has been so successful that it has barely been modified in nearly 20 years. Interesting too is the fact I did notice a few years ago they did try once to tinker with a re-design of the P228, but are now back again re-issuing this classic design calling it their M11 variant, but it is essentially this same gun, just with night sights. This gun is to Sigs, what the original 80's era Gen 1 Glocks are to Glocks...Comes with original box and original manual, 2 original 13 round mags.  

 That said, though the condition on this is truly mint and it's barely been touched in 19 years, I could see how someone might hesitate spending this amount of money on what is still technically a ""used gun"" (although probably vintage by now), and so I do have a BRAND NEW HK P2000 SK 9mm with night sights still available, just check my other ad links, it should be there."

LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC claims their barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4."

Up for sale is a .357 Magnum S&W Model 66-1 with a 2.5"" barrel. It was made in the late 70's or very early 80's and possesses the recessed chambers & pinned barrel that S&W used to put on all their Magnum guns...back when they still cared about the materials and craftsmanship that went into their guns. There is no MIM and no Internal Lock on this gun.

This example is in excellent condition, especially for it's age. It looks a lot better in person than in the photos...stainless guns are a little hard to capture well with a flash. There aren't any noteworthy scratches, gouges, etc. to speak of. Appears to of been fired very little in it's life, as is evidenced by the very minor wear on the topstrap, forcing cone and ejection star.

A previous owner somewhere in the guns life converted the gun to DA only by removing the SA notch off the hammer that's in the gun...so it currently only fires in DA. I bought a NOS hammer for it a couple years ago, but never got around to installing it (I very rarely fire my S&W's in SA). It will be included though, should the new owner want to convert it back to DA/SA.

The gun includes Hogue grips. No box/papers. This is a great example of a nearly perfect do-it-all gun. It's the perfect size for CC, HD, range fun, a truck gun, competition, etc. I hate to let it go, but I've got my eyes on something else right now.

Price is $650obo and a FTF meeting in S. Everett is preferred. Will want a look at your CPL, MIL ID, LE creds, or WAC badge. No weirdos.

""What the heck is that?""

Colt did a run of these that appears to be limited to 1000 units in the mid 90's. Although a production firearm, it is said they were actually built by the custom shop at colt and are fine tuned for accuracy. The trigger is super smooth and this thing is an absolute tack driver.

From the factory:
- Flattop reciever - low profile gas block.
- Hogue overmold free floating handgaurd
- Hogue overmold ergo grip
- Timney Adjustable Match Trigger - Single Stage (some say its a JP, but i don't think so)
- HEAVY 20"" Bull Barrel 1/8
- Choate buttstock
- Titanium Firing pin
- Extended Tactical charging handle

The gun comes with:
- Plano gungaurd hard case
- original colt shipping box
- original colt 10rd mag
- Optics - Multicoated 12x Simmons (Simmons best, but still cheap glass - rifle deserves much better)
- Harris BiPod
- Factory cleaning kit. (don't use this please - you will wreck the crown of the barrel)

Rifle has less than 500 rounds on it. Rifle is in great shape.

Asking $1800 for it, cash. I will use an FFL in my area (Sudbury, ma), Ill cover the transfer fee. I believe Undercover Arms in Hudson is the closest. Not really interesting in shipping this.

LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC claims their barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4."

I got the upper and lower and wanted to color fill but when i went to take off the paint from the logo it took off the finish.... so I sent it to WMD guns and JUSt had it (the upper/lower/hand guard and ejection port door) Nickel Boroned and a top coat of Burnt bronze which normally costs about $400 but i had a 50% off coupon :D. 
UPDATE 8/18/2013 (sunday) I took it to the range for the first time, zeroed it and fired 90 rounds through it, functioned flawlessly, no jams etc.. the benches there were carpeted so it didnt get any external wear.. very fun

I am not sure what the round count on this is, but my guess is it is well south of 500 and likely less than 100 based upon the condition of the gun. Cosmetically the gun is in perfect condition.

I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position made of metal and not plastic nor polymer junk. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. All parts and components are new and Polish made. The PPS-43C pistol comes with 1 curved box magazines, holds 35 rounds. Polish PPS-43C semi auto pistol ATF approved incl. 1 x 35rd. magazines and cleaning kit. Caliber: 7.62x25 mm TT,. Weight: 3.67 kg loaded, 3.04 kg empty,. Length: 615 Barrel length 250 mm,. Magazine Capacity 35 rounds.. Effective range:200 meters .
 Produced in Poland at the famed Radom plant, this new production PPS-43C is a semi-automatic derivative (FOLDING STOCK IS FIXED SPOT WELDED) of the Russian PPSH-41 full-auto, sub-machine gun developed during WWII for the Red Army in its fight against Hitler. The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with one (1) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

The metal is decent, there is some sort of chemical damage on the receiver but it's only cosmetic. The bore is dull and lightly rusted. I wrapped the whole gun in friction tape to protect it from rust and to make it better to grip, since I keep it in my basement. I also put an eye-hook into the butt of the pistol grip so that you can attach a single-point sling.

Seeing as how it's technically not brand new I'm asking what I feel is a reasonable price based on sources I've found online. Please note, this knife is NOT a blem."
