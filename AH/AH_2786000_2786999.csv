Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

I tired to price competitively, Gen 3's are arguably as good if not nostalgically better than the Gen 4 pistols.  The recoil bar is one piece unlike the two piece of the gen 4's.  But, there are no back-straps to change out...if that's something you like, then Gen 4 is for you.  Otherwise, excellent pistol and reliability for great price.  Usually the 3rd generation Glock pistols only came with 2 mags...I am including an extra mag, which can usually run an extra $30!  But, all in for $475 obo.

AMMO shown in photos not included.  Just keep my pistols ready to go.

Hello Armslist. 

I'm moving to 9mm as my primary round so this 45 is on the block in favor of a 'range toy' 1911. It's a great shooter and has never misfired, failed to feed, failed to eject, or even struggled to work like you would expect. It may not be much to look at but it WORKS and if you do your part it will put that chunk of lead right where you tell it to. Takes everything from the cheap steel case on up to match grade ammo, I've tried 230 grain and lighter 185 grain and they've all popped off and feed the next just fine. Has about 500 rounds through it all told.

Comes with the pistol, XD Gear magazine loader, double mag pouch, holster, and five 13 round magazines. I'll throw in a left over 50 round box of TulAmmo brass cased just for good measure.

475. I will take a trade for Remington R1, Rock Island, or other bare-bones 'GI' 45ACP 1911s from a good name with a few magazines.

(also includes the case, required nanny-lock, cleaning brush, XD paperwork, and factory first-round too)"

Our most popular holster and THE most comfortable and concealable holster available.

The SuperTuck® is our most popular rig and is adjustable for ride depth AND cant, it's our most stable and comfortable rig and offers the following features as well.

1) All SuperTuck® holsters now come with our new SteelClip clip. Spring steel with a corrosion proof, chip proof coating along with a proprietary design makes our SteelClips the best clip on the market. Bulletproof construction and a decorative design that won't give you away, only from CrossBreed™.

3) Premium grade leather for the backing! Available in our Black Cowhide, Tan Premium Hard Rolled Cowhide and our Natural Tan Horsehide when available.

This leather is selected, treated, and hard rolled exclusively for CrossBreed® Holsters. This process creates the same comfort and moisture resistant qualities as our horsehide holsters. CrossBreed's® Premium Hard Rolled Cowhide is available in a light tan color and is a great alternative when our horsehide is not available.

Our SuperTuck® Deluxe is THE most comfortable and concealable holster available, there might be prettier ones, but NONE will out-perform the SuperTuck®!

Spike's Tactical Fake Can/Suppressor

The Spike’s Tactical CAR-1 Fake Can gives you the looks of having a 10.5” suppressed rifle but doesn’t come with all of the expense and paperwork that’s required for the real thing. This is how it works; The CAR-1 shrouds back over the barrel of your rifle concealing part of it inside of the CAR-1. This is what gives the illusion of a suppressed SBR and of course, no stamp is required. Keep in mind, this fake can is just for cosmetic looks and does not provide any sound suppression whatsoever. The CAR-1 should only be used with barrels with Carbine length gas systems. 

Spike's Tactical fake cans are made out of solid 6061 Aluminum bar stock for strength and topped off with a durable Anodized finish. The length of the can is 5.5” and has a diameter of 1.25”"

Hello! I'm interested in selling my 2nd year production Kar98k. Some parts are missing (handguard, front barrel band, sights), but besides that, all parts are here... and they all match the serial number of the receiver ""3995"" (some parts are numbered merely 95, the last two digits of the serial number). You'll notice that even the stock has the serial number ""3995"" which I tried to photograph. The number is faint and hard to catch with a camera, but it's there (see pictures). This gun is NOT drilled and tapped for a scope, although it is an excellent candidate for a sporter. It is in its original chambering, 8mm.

Please note that despite the missing parts, this is a functioning firearm. I bought it in its current condition with the intent to replace the missing parts, but never got around to it...

This is your chance to own a very early, non-Russian capture, all numbers matching Kar98k (all the parts that are here, anyways) for a good price. I am aware of all of its short comings and have a minimum price in mind. I am open to offers. 

You can reach me by responding to this posting OR by texting/calling me at REDACTED. I will NOT ship, but I am willing to travel for a sale. Just let me know. Thanks for looking!"

It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

Russian 7n1 sniper ammunition. With the development of the Dragunov sniper rifle, the Russians felt the need for something more accurate than mass-produced machine gun ammo. Their answer was the 7n1 round. This ammunition is match grade and produced in extremely limited quantities for military use only. It is the most accurate ammunition available for your PSL/Dragunov rifle. Not only was the round designed for hair-splitting accuracy, but it was also developed with steel core and a hollow spot in the nose of the bullet with a lead knocker behind it. This means that upon impact into a person that knocker moves forward into the hollow spot, destabilizing the bullet and causing it to tumble into the target creating massive injury.

http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinAmmo030.htm

This excellent quality ammunition was almost unknown in the United States and very expensive when found until April 2006 when a small quantity became available. Interestingly a significant amount is dated 1997 which is extremely recent for ""surplus"" ammunition. However, the 7N1 load was replaced in 1999 with the 7N14 load which has an armor piercing bullet and is also designed for sniper use. Other than the packaging this ammunition is indistinguishable from standard Soviet steel core light ball unless the bullet is sectioned to expose its unique structure. This ammunition was designed specifically for use in the SVD semi-auto sniper rifle but should perform well in any type of rifle chambered for 7.62x54r due to the close tolerances and high quality control exercised during its manufacture."

6mm Remington Ackley Varminter
A Classic Groundhog Gun That's Deadly Accurate to 900+ yards
Other Guns of the Week >
Richard Franklin, owner of Richard's Custom Rifles in Virginia, is one serious varmint shooter. The farther the critter, the more fun it is to hit. With his favorite long-range caliber, the 6mm Remington Ackley Improved, he regularly nails groundhogs at 600 to 900+ yards. Here is his latest 6mm AI, a BAT-actioned 14-twist that drives a 75-grain V-Max at a blistering 3860 fps. With a classic-styled laminated walnut stock, this flat-shooting, hard-hitting rig delivers ""maximum mist effect"" even at the longest ranges.

Choice of Caliber--Why the 6mm Rem AI and not a .243 Ackley
When asked why he prefers a 6mm Rem AI over the more common .243 AI, Richard replied: ""I've probably built over one hundred 6mm AIs in the last three years. It's been my favorite long-range varmint cartridge for years and years. Over the years I've put together heavier-caliber rifles hoping they would be a better windy-day long-range varminter than the 6mm AI. I have always gone back to the 6mm AI because it is so hard to beat. High velocity with explosive bullets is a varmint hunter's delight (unless he is skinning out the critters). The other school of thought is to use VLD bullets at a much lower velocity (VLDs do no not like to be shot so fast). It is true that the VLDs will reach out at much longer ranges and buck the wind better, but they sometimes pass right through a critter leaving only a pencil-hole. The wounded varmint will then drag away to his den. Prairie dogs are easily killed with the VLDs due to P-dogs' small body mass, but on larger varmints, such as groundhogs and coyotes, you will get a lot of cripples. My favorite 6mm AI is set up with a 14-twist HV barrel shooting the 75gr V-max at 3800+ fps. My second favorite setup is with a 10-twist HV barrel shooting the 87gr V-Maxes. The reason the 75-grainer is my favorite is that 80% of our hogging is at ranges of 800 yards and less and the 75-grainer works its magic at these distances.

Comparing the 6mm Rem AI with the .243 chamberings, I think the 6mm Rem AI comes out on top. The 6mm AI is ALL the cartridge any varmint hunter needs. It will do anything you want to do with varmints, any kind of varmint. And in a 10-twist, it is the best 1000-yd varmint caliber you can get your hands on period. The long-necked 6mm AI will have less throat erosion than the short-necked .243 or .243 AI. The 6mm Rem AI will also hold a little more powder than a .243 Ackley. For long-range varminting, sending light bullets at ultra-high velocities, I just think the 6mm Rem has better case design than a .243 Win. With either case, definitely go with the Ackley version. The 40° shoulder gives you a little more powder capacity and both the shoulder angle and the reduced body taper give you better brass life. A case with no taper won't stretch as much as a tapered case.""

Gun Specifications
Richard's rifle features a BAT Machines SV (short) RBRP action with fluted bolt, a Holland recoil lug, and a BAT +20 MOA Weaver-style scope base. Richard prefers the short action for stiffness, but this requires pulling the bolt to remove a loaded round. The stock is Richard's Model 010 in a three-layer laminate--outer layers of fancy walnut with a 5/8"" center strip of curly maple. The stock is bedded with Richard's own stainless pillars (with escutchens). These pillars, one of Richard's ""signature"" features, are hand-made from barrel stock provided by a prominent barrel-maker. The 010 stock has a wide, stable beavertail that extends just rear of the recoil lug area for added strength in that area. The straight comb is as high as it can be made and still be able to insert a bore guide. With some actions a cut has to be made in the top forward part of the comb to allow the bolt to fully open. (Richard's Model 007 has a similar design, but with a shorter beavertail, and a roll-over comb--see photos at bottom of page). The stock has quite a bit of drop from the grip to the toe. Richard tells us, ""this is important for the varminter who shoots from bipod and improvised rests. The drop makes it much easier to adjust elevation with your rear bag."" The barrel is a 27"" Krieger 14-twist, with six lands and grooves. A BAT trigger guard and Jewell trigger round out the component list.

For optics, Richard runs an 8-32x56 Nightforce Benchrest scope in Burris Signature Zee Rings. Why would Richard trust a $1250 scope to a relatively inexpensive set of rings? Richard explained: ""The Burris Signature is the best ring design ever, in my opinion. I'll never buy another kind of ring. I've never seen 'ring rash' from the Burris Signature rings. A lot of people make money off gimmicks. The Burris Signature rings do the job better than other rings that cost two or three times as much. The Burris nylon inserts align to the scope, so they don't transfer any stress from the mounting system to your action. If conventional rings are not lapped perfectly, when you tighten them up you'll be bending something, and this will transfer stress to your action. Not having to lap the Burris rings is a huge advantage. Additionally, with the +/- inserts you can load 20 MOA or more of elevation into the rings. That way, with a lot of cartridges, you don't really need to spend extra money on an angled scope base.""



Load Development and Accuracy
Working up a load for this rifle was simple. Richard tells us: ""I've been shooting the 6mm Rem AI for over 15 years. Whenever I build a new one I start with the 75gr Hornady V-Max, seated pretty far into the lands, pushed by 51 grains of Vihtavuori N160, working up to about 52 grains. N160 seems to be perfect for the case, yielding great velocity (about 3860 fps) and excellent accuracy. This gun is a 14-twist, and I normally shoot the 75gr V-Max. As far as I'm concerned, the 75gr V-Max is the best factory bullet you can shoot. It's the most consistent, with a better BC than other brands in the same weight range. But to get a 75 to stabilize in a 14-twist, you have to really boot 'em out there fast--you need to smoke 'em out at 3750 fps or better. The faster you push a 75 the better it's going to shoot. 

I've also tried the 65gr V-Max. It gives great velocity, but it doesn't have the BC of the 75-grainer. With the 65, I recommend 47.5 grains of Varget or 47.5 grains of IMR 4064. Both of those loads will push a 65gr V-Max about 4,100 fps. Some 6mm Rem AI shooters prefer to shoot the 87gr V-Max from a 10-twist barrel.The 6mm Rem AI set up with a 10-twist barrel to shoot the 87gr V-Max is about the ultimate long-range varmint caliber one could ever want. With a BC of about .400, the 87gr V-Max is a great performer out past 600 yards where it will surpass the 65gr and 75gr V-Max. It cannot be launched as fast as a 75-grainer. The 87 starts out a little slower but at 1000 yards it is going faster, hits harder and is flatter shooting than the lighter V-Maxes. (Note: the loads mentioned here are all fairly stout; they may be too hot for your rifle and your conditions. ALWAYS START 10% LOW and work up.)

But overall, I prefer the 75-grain V-Max over its heavier and lighter breathren. The 75 offers the best balance between velocity and BC. We varmint hunters like very high velocity for a flat trajectory and explosiveness (the ""red mist"" effect) on the target. With the 75 you can use a slower twist, and that means less drag in the barrel. So the slower the twist, the faster you can shoot. Keep in mind, however, that not all 14-twist barrels will stabilize the 75s. I've found that some 14s just won't shoot them fast enough to stabilize. I can't really tell you why--it could be that the twist rate is slightly slower than claimed, or it could be the bore diameter is a little tight. Every barrel is different. If you want to be safe, go with a 13-twist. My 14-twist works great with the 75s though, and I feel I get more speed with a 14 versus a 13-twist.

One last thing about bullets. I've tried the Noslers and I'll stick with the Hornadys--they're much more consistent, and they're more accurate for me. Some folks have tested Noslers and V-Maxs with a Juneke machine and they found a higher defect rate with the Noslers. You'll have more bad Ballistic Tips in one box than in several boxes of V-Maxs. You can't beat the V-Max for accuracy. As far as primers go, I use Federal match primers, with the exception of using CCIs in hot loads in small cases such as the BR and PPC families of cartridges. The CCIs will not pierce as easily as the Federals.

Case-Forming the 6mm Rem Ackley
In the past I've used Winchester 6mm Rem brass. I have found Winchester 6mm Rem brass to be more consistent than the Remington-headstamp brass. I have a .274"" no-turn neck, so with Winchester brass I could just load and shoot--the case forms fine with no special tweaking. Recently, however, I've switched to Norma 7x57 brass. This takes more work to form, but I think I get more consistent brass in the end--and it lasts a bit longer. Making the brass is a three-stage process. First I run the cases through a 6.5-284 die to just touch the neck and bring the neck diameter down. Next I run the brass through a 6mm Rem Ackley Improved die. But with the Norma 7x57 brass, that leaves the necks a little thick for my .274"" chamber. So then I'll neck-turn, taking about .003"" off the neck-diameter, ending up at about .271"". I'm real happy with the Norma brass so far. The primer pockets seem to hold longer than the Winchester and the accuracy may be a bit better. Once Ackleyized, with the 40-degree shoulder, the cases are very stable.

By all accounts there were only about 500 imported with the G3 marking before HK jumped on SA with both feet telling them they couldn't use their product designator. These rifles were made with HK tooling and equipment sent to Greece for military use. They are for all intents and purposes HK rifles. I have just about every damn thing you could want for this other than the German military .22 conversion kit (Which is available if you look). For starters, on the rifle itself I installed a tac-latch mag release. The normal paddle mag release is not present on any 91 as they were imported and this makes mag changes MUCH easier. I have also installed the correct bayonet adaptor/end piece at the front of the cocking tube so that you can mount the issue bayonet. The bore is immaculate and the overall condition is exceptional. This has been a safe queen for many years and has had AT MOST, 500 rds. through it. There are 34...yes, you heard correctly, 34(!) mags, a mix of aluminum and steel German issue. I have both stocks, the fixed and collapsible, both forends (Slim military and wide HK), bipod, bayonet and scabbard, German issue cleaning kit, Factory HK 3 point sling, spare parts supply including three sets of bolt rollers, extra stock and forend pins, firing pin, extractor, etc., and a rear sight adjustment tool. There is also a translated military manual for the rifle and accessories that covers just about anything you would want or need to know about the rifle. Now on to optics...included is a German military issue Hensoldt 4x scope WITH reticle illuminator, scope can and camo pouch, and cleaning kit. The glass on the scope is crystal clear and bright! The first round I fired with it mounted center punched the x ring and the rest of the group was sub MOA @100 yards, so yeah, it's accurate it as well! Also included is a heavy duty snap on stock extender designed to allow you to shoot with optics and have a proper cheek weld. It's rock solid when mounted and makes all the difference when using the scope. Now on to the green monster....Yes, there is also a fully functional German military night vision scope included. This was made by Zeiss and is in great working order. It has an aiming point reticle that can be dialed up and down in intensity for shooting or just observation. I would say it's comparable to a Gen 2+, better than the AN/PVS 4's I used in the late 80's early 90's to be sure. It comes with a beast of a hard case, extra mounts for MG's and AT rocket launchers(!), manual, tools, and cleaning cloth. It uses C cell batteries, not some hard to find military only battery. Lastly, I have the German military Picatinny Rail mount for the receiver. It is milspec and has a NSN number. With that you could then mount any number of red dot type sights to the rifle. And finally it all comes in a nice OD green padded nylon case complete with backpack straps and many pockets. Not willing to piece it out, it all goes as a package. I'll eat the shipping on the rifle itself, but the shipping for the night vision will be on the buyer. The scope and case weigh in at 30 lbs. All the usuals apply, thanks for looking"

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, the action has been redesigned utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price.
