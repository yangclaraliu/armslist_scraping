The M96 is chambered for the .223 Remington/5.56 mm NATO cartridge, and uses STANAG 4179 AR-15 magazines. Barrels have 1-in-9 twist ratio as is common for .223 Remington semiautomatic rifles. The M96 is gas operated, with a fixed gas cylinder and moving piston connected to the operating rod and bolt carrier. All variants are equipped with a gas regulator, which allows fine-tuning for low or high powered cartridges, outside temperature, etc. and is probably unique for a civilian rifle in this caliber. The bolt carrier has been specially designed for strength and slow cyclic rate for improved reliability. The M96 bolt is a six-lug design somewhat similar to an AR-15 bolt but with larger, stronger lugs. The M96 receiver is stamped stainless steel with a special blackening treatment.

If the firearm is currently non functional all I ask is that you have all the parts or can tell me what exactly needs to be purchased to make it functional. My preference would be any semi automatic rifle,  or handgun but I will consider anything for the right price. I don't care about lack of finish,  a little rusting or pitting here or there. The only thing I'm really concerned about is price and where you are located. I will likely not purchase anything for more than 100 for non functional and 300 for a functional weapon. As far as location I prefer that you be a 30 minute or less drive from west Toledo."

Level III will stop all handgun and shotgun caliber threats and most rifle threats. 5.56x45 and 7.62x39 armor piercing will be stopped with no problems with multiple hits to the same area. 7.62x54R and 7.62x51/.308 are also stopped. .338 Lapua and .50 cal will make it into Swiss cheese (obviously)

Features: The plates are made with a cut near the shoulder to allow you to properly and comfortably shoulder your weapon. They also have a build up of protective coating that will trap and deflect any shrapnel created from bullet strikes. The plates are also curved to the body for comfort and mobility.

The Plates and the Plate carrier are brand new and unused. I decided that it was just too heavy for me so im just taking the loss and buying soft (lighter/weaker) armor. There is absolutely no wear and tear and yes Body Armor is completely legal. 

I will also throw in the mag pouch that holds three rifle magazines and 3 pistol magazines and the large Utility pouch since i wont be needing it anymore.

Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Hey everyone,
I have up for trade or sale a S&W ""Hand Ejector"" 32 S&W Long 6 shot revolver. Its serial number dates it to right around 1951 shipment date. It has matching numbered grips, cylinder, and frame. This gun still locks up tight and still shoots great. I actually had her at the range earlier with no problems and she shot great for me! I would keep this as a great little collector but I would rather trade or sell her to someone who could appreciate her a lot more than myself. Im open to most firearm trades but please be fair with your values and I will do the same. For any cash or trade offers either message me on here or shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can try and go from there!  I can shoot more pictures or the serial number to interested persons via cell or message on here. This gun is not perfect and shows her age, but a really deep clean and scrub would be very appreciated on her!
Thanks for yalls time and happy shooting!"

This will come with original blue Sig Sauer box, 2-8 round magazines, and paperwork.

I would consider a trade for an M&P Full Size .40 S&W (hopefully VTAC) plus cash or ammo on your end.  Considering this P220 SAS Custom Shop is as rare as Unicorn Tears and was a +$1000 gun when bought new, someone should get a heck of a deal.  Even the cash price being asked is below current Blue Book (+$900).

You can text me if you have any questions or offers at REDACTED.  I can meet pretty much anywhere in the DFW area for the right deal."

- 3 dot sights adjustable for windage and elevation

Gun was purchased with intent for conceal carry however, I finally got some trigger time on it today and decided to pass on it because I did not care for the trigger in regards to a carry gun.  It is a heavyish however crisp break, it would make a really nice home gun and if you like the trigger, the profile of it is really nice for a more discreet carry. I ran 200 rounds through it of various ammo, and it functioned flawlessly,  was surprisingly accurate, and the ergos of it allowed for a real good control during rapid fire.  I am very impressed with the gun and like I said, in my mind, would make an excellent home gun however for my personal preference in carry guns I didn't care for it very much, based purely on the trigger.

The gun will come with its hard case, manual, 2 mags, adjustment keys, and Ill throw in a box of Federal 9mm and 13 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty.

It is in pretty rough shape, and should be retired somewhere over a mantle.  At some point, someone appears to have bead blasted and painted the barrels.  (whimper).  I was able to remove the paint in a test area with some acetone.  If I keep it, I am going to strip it, put on cold blue, and hang it up.  It does seem to be missing some hardware under the forearm; there is a spring and pin assembly that is loose under there.  

The barrels have some small deformations.  The stock has been cracked and repaired.  The action is still nice and tight, and the lock lever is a little bit left of center.  

Still, this is a pretty nifty looking piece of history.  Original buttplate intact.  

If you buy this, I will make you sign a document that you acknowledge this is a damascus barrel shotgun and is dangerous to be used with modern ammo.  Possibly with any ammo.

As shown, the kit includes the pistol, Crimson Trace Laser Grips, 4 Kimber 7-round magazines, a Milt Sparks Versa Max II with 1.25"" belt loops, and a Blackhawk Serpa with belt loops and paddle. Also includes the box, but not the manual.

Also included is my Wolff Spring collection: 3 recoil spring assembly rebuild kits, and a hammer spring. Kimber recommends replacing the recoil spring set every 1,800 rounds, so I stocked up.

NIB, this setup runs $1,390 ($800 for the pistol alone), and a 3 month wait for the Milt Sparks leather. This is a perfect piece for someone who's going to carry and shoot it, not just admire it.

If you want most of the kit without a piece, I'm willing to remove the following and reduce the price as noted:
Laser Grip, -$50 (you'll still have the stock rubber grips)
4 magazines, -$30
Milt Sparks VMII, -$45
Note: this is not an offer to sell these items separately for these prices. They are worth more, and you should buy them as part of the package."

This pistol is a blast to shoot, but I've got a couple other project ideas in mind.

   Fresh in on consignment! We're proud to offer up this Colt Defender, the 1911 perfected for concealed carry. The stainless slide rides on an alloy frame for reduced weight, and the high-grip radiused beavertail combined with the bushingless bull-barrel yields shocking accuracy. This Colt has a very low round count, internals are immaculate. Shows minor holster wear, but is still in very good shape. Being on consignment we don't want to tamper with it, but we can do a full high-luster polishing of the stainless slide for the new owner of this fantastic weapon. Includes 2 factory Colt 7rd mags.

   These don't pop up used very often, don't miss out on this awesome .45!

I have for sale a brand new Special Edition Precision Target Rifle made PTR 91 rifle chambered in 7.62 Nato, otherwise known as 307 Winchester. The rifle comes with factory box and lock. The rifle is brand new and has not been fired since leaving the factory. By purchasing this rifle, the buyer agrees to leave the rifle in its original configuration and not alter the weapon, especially the trigger pack in any way. It is a federal felony to convert this weapon into a machine gun. This rifle is a US made HK 91 variant made of new components, and not surplus components like some other variants. The barrels are made by Thompson center to the highest accuracy standards. The internals are made from scratch at PTR, this is the only way to make them superbly accurate. The Nato green furniture is brand new and not surplus furniture. The rifle comes with lifetime warranty on the internals from PTR. 

The rifle comes with ten HK G3 magazines, one mag is brand new, it's the one that came with the rifle. The other 9 are surplus German army mags, the 9 surplus mags are used, the rifle is mint, just look at the pictures. The rifle comes with ten high capacity 20 round nato magazines, these are the best mags made for any HK 91 Variant.
