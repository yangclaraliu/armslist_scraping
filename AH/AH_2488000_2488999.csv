Saw these in the case at Gander Mountain for $649 yesterday. I'm asking $525. Call or text Kyle REDACTED. Happy holidays!!

Factory Description:

Designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Some sling plates may not be compatible. Includes SSAR-15 SBS , interface block, hex key and instructions.

As responsible gun owners we have to be vigilant about keeping guns out of the hands of people like this. He is blatantly, and ham-handedly, baiting for me, and others to commit a felony. 
We are in times when the news media and government interests are looking to manufacture any excuse to infringe upon our personal rights. Now we have to contend with people like this, whether legitimately trying to purchase a firearm, or looking to manufacture evidence as an excuse for further encroachment, messaging law abiding citizens to entice us to break the law.
Please stand with me and refuse to be party to such criminal negligence as dealing with people like wes. 
If he is not actively working to take our rights away, then he's certainly too stupid to own a gun. 
As for me, I refuse to be party to such criminal negligence as enabling a person too lazy to look up the actual laws, and so stupid as to actually believe in such a manufactured propaganda as a ""gun show loophole.""
I ask that you will stand with me in this noble fight against stupidity, against the thousands of wes's in this world looking to harm us."

This is a awesome 1911. mechanically well taken care of. Cleaning after every use. about 500-600rds down range. NEVER had a jam, failure to feed, stove pipe or anything like that. 
THIS IS NOT A SHOW GUN! it does have a little holster wear. I used it as my cary for quite a while. trust this gun with my life. the only big cosmetic blemish is on the left side safety lever. i filed it down a little because it would dig into my hand pretty good shooting it.
Other than that, great gun! Will come with 3 8rd ACT MAGS 2 7rd ED BROWN MAGS original case. Houge dimpled grips. original grips Blackhawk holster(Holster only, no attachments) limber fobus holster, and mag pouch.

The Sightmark Ultra Shot QD Digital Switch Reflex Sight was created to satisfy the demand for a lightweight, durable and accurate sight. This sight is perfect for close range, fast moving targets and is equipped with a digital switch button on the side to adjust variable brightness settings. No longer will users have to mess with a tedious dial, but can enjoy the added convenience and sleek look of a push button.
The Sightmark Ultra Shot QD features a quick detach mount that is perfect for quick removal when iron sights or other accessories are used. To adhere to shooter's demands for durability, the Sightmark Ultra Shot QD Digital Switch is equipped with a protective, aluminum shield hood for added protection, making it even more durable than the basic Ultra Shot.
The Ultra Shot QD sight features a matte black finish that eliminates reflection for a military, tactical look. An alternative to overly expensive mil-spec models, the Sightmark Ultra Shot QD comes with the quality expected from the Sightmark brand and is protected by the Sightmark Limited Lifetime Warranty.

Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button."

All Daniel Defense Cold Hammer Forged AR-15 Barrels are constructed of Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel that is hydraulically shaped by carbide steel hammers around a precision machined mandrel to form the chamber, lands, and grooves. This Hammer Forging process creates a defect-free bore with the most consistent chamber possible, and each of Daniel Defense's barrels undergoes a Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test to ensure this standard of perfection is achieved. All stripped barrels come equipped with an A4 Barrel Extension with extended M4 Feed Ramps for enhanced feeding reliability and a pre-installed locator pin.

This barrel has been finished externally with a protective Melonite treatment that surface-hardens the metal. Also referred to as Salt Bath Nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. 

This 18"" AR-15 Barrel features Daniel Defense's exclusive Strength 2 Weight (S2W) contour for the perfect balance of barrel weight and stiffness, while the 5.56x45mm NATO chamber allows for full compatibility with both surplus mil-spec and commercial ammunition. The barrel's 1 in 7"" Rifling Twist Rate is ideal for use with medium to heavy weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. Proudly manufactured in the USA.

I'm selling my barely-used Sig Sauer Mosquito 22LR. I'd be surprised if this has more than 250 rounds through it. Anytime it has been taken to the range it has been carefully cleaned afterwards (and I doubt it's been to the range more than 5 times).

The Mosquito is 90% of the size of the P226 and is a great gun. Easy (and inexpensive) to shoot.

I have a friend who had never really fired a handgun before who was going through her CCW training course. With barely any practice (less than 10 rounds) she qualified with this firearm.

Why did I buy it? It's a Sig Sauer. Plus, a 22LR. And, it has a thumb safety (important feature for me: I know, lots of people don't use them and I understand). However, I haven't purchased any other Sig Sauer's and am now standardizing on Ruger's (and, of all things, the Ruger thumb safeties flip the opposite direction).

You can see the condition of the firearm in the photos. Included with the gun:
- 1x 10-round Sig OEM factory magazine
- The original case
- Registration card, user manual
- Ruger gun lock
- Spare recoil spring (the reason many semi-automatic 22's have a reputation for not reliably feeding ammunition is the varying quality of 22LR ammunition - to give you an idea of Sig Sauer quality: they knew that is what causes issues with semi-automatic 22's and included two springs with the Mosquito --- a stiffer one that works best with higher-powered/premium 22 ammo, and a looser spring that works better with bulk/regular 22 ammo). Speaking of how the firearm handles 22 ammo: it's done quite well, and I just use bulk 22 (not the higher-powered 22). I don't know if I have the stiffer or looser recoil spring currently in the firearm.

I am selling a Ruger LCR in 22 WMR (Winchester Magnum Rimfire), also known as .22 Magnum. The revolver has had 250 rounds total through it. The first 100 rounds shot fine, but would take a little more muscle to extract the spent casings. I had Ruger replace the cylinder and crane and then ran another 150 rounds after that. All fired/extracted fine, no issues at all.

The revolver will include everything in the box that it comes with when purchased new (gun lock with keys, zipper carry pouch to store the revolver, manual, etc) Also included with the LCR are two 5-Star speed loaders. As for ammunition, I'm including 400 rounds of Armscor JHP that can be used for practice, and 100 rounds of Speer Gold Dot personal protection ammo. That's 500 rounds total. You can't go wrong with Ruger. They will take care of you. Their customer service is one of the best in the industry.

This bundle can be an option for those who are looking into a CCW weapon.

I am *only* selling the bundle together. I will *not* sell anything separate. Cash *only* no trades at this moment.

All together, I am asking $450 FIRM. I will only meet locally (I'm only willing to drive so far, depending on distance). I'd prefer to meet at a gun shop, if possible (I've met other previous buyers at a local gun shop called The Gun Zone). Must be willing to sign a bill of sale and have a valid form of identification.

If interested and/or have any questions, e-mail me at paulmishima(at)gmail.com

Thanks and Happy Holidays."

Zero scratches on it, a few hundred rounds through the tube. The OD green & stainless slide is a color combo Springfield stopped producing about 2 years ago, very tough to find. Also XDM's are virtually impossible to get in CA, for the average citizen to obtain one in the state legally, you have to purchase it from a sworn peace officer, which I am, and that officer or the FFL must pin the mags to legal capacity prior to the weapon transfer, which I will also do. I originally purchased this gun to carry on duty but I just like my Sig more. I will consider trades for other pistols, preferably Sig or Kimber but you can let me know what you have, however, I am not interested in Glocks. The pistol comes with all goodies and paperwork from the factory. Thanks for interest."

Also, the bolt handle has been redesigned and bent down and to the rear, the barrel chamber has been plated in chrome, and there are also some minor changes to the trigger and firing pin.

The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its convenient bullpup design are the intense power of a magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.

The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. the ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. this careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds."

However current examples on the market have little to no accuracy and limited frangibility. DRT is the first company to figure out how to stabilize the bullet in flight to achieve high accuracy and full dispersion of the powdered core in the wound cavity creating extensive Terminal Ballistics.

DRT lead-free projectile is a revolutionary round. The bullet breaks apart on contact with a solid surface. The handgun ammunition is made to be an all-purpose round, disintegrating into a cloud of dust on steel but yet is effective on an organic target. It is a target and a carry round.

Our round can be fired by law enforcement officers without any fear of ricochet or pass through, or fear of injury or death to innocent bystanders from ricochet or pass through.

The pistol has some minor wear marks as it has been a daily carry weapon since new. It has custom sights red in front green in rear for faster sighting. I would like to sell but would trade for the right item plus boot. I'm looking at $550 cash or $650 trade value. The increased asking price is due to the holster and sight work and  because the M1 is getting hard to find. I'm interested in trades for shotguns semi auto rifles and 7.62x39, 7.62x54r, 12 gauge shells, 5.56x45, 9mm, .22lr, and reloading equipment. I am not interested in an even trade because I need cash to recoop from Christmas unless you are wanting to trade a higher value item without boot. If you email me I will respond. If you include a phone number I can text pictures tomorrow. I don't have any on my phone tonight."

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2488989,For Sale:  Barrett Mrad,"california, California, United States","$ 5,500","Listed On: Wednesday, December 25, 2013",Rifles,Barrett                                                                                ,338 Lapua                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This MRAD is equipped with a Leupold Mark 4 rifle scope which has a 4.5-14x variable zoom and a non-illuminated reticle. The scope is mounted on Barrett's ultra-high rings. The rifle was once fired by our ballistic specialist with 20 rounds of Black Hills 250 grain ammunition. The barrel and bore were cleaned after each shot and was given time to cool down as to break in the barrel. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. Rifle will ship in original Barrett hardcase"
