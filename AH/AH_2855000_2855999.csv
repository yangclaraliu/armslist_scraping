Awhile back I started making the transition from the AK47 to the Ar15/M4 platform, and this Sig was my last holdout. But, it's time for us to part ways as I have another project I want to work on and I have too many firearms as it is. 

Up for grabs is a gently Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($199 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 
- 2,000 rounds of Hollow Point and Soft Point ammo ($500) - made by Wolf, all are the polymer coated kind for better performance. Non-corrosive and recent production.

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical needs. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $3000 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $2300. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. I prefer to deal with CHL/CCW owners (like myself), but no required. 
I am not looking to, or interested in, splitting up this package up. Please don't ask me how much for just the ammo, the magazines, etc. Lowballer’s need not waste your time or mine. I know what this is worth, and if you know what it is, then you know what its worth as well. 

Thanks for looking."

Awhile back I started making the transition from the AK47 to the Ar15/M4 platform, and this Sig was my last holdout. But, it's time for us to part ways as I have another project I want to work on and I have too many firearms as it is. 

Up for grabs is a gently Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($199 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 
- 2,000 rounds of Hollow Point and Soft Point ammo ($500) - made by Wolf, all are the polymer coated kind for better performance. Non-corrosive and recent production.

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical needs. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $3000 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $2300. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. I prefer to deal with CHL/CCW owners (like myself), but no required. 
I am not looking to, or interested in, splitting up this package up. Please don't ask me how much for just the ammo, the magazines, etc. Lowballer’s need not waste your time or mine. I know what this is worth, and if you know what it is, then you know what its worth as well. 

Thanks for looking."

Will consider all offers. We can work out a deal with cash and partial trades if you like.
I unfortunately I won't drop the price below 750 (unless a trade is involved). This retails for 1300 plus tax and shipping and Handling. Not to mention the 7 week waiting period for it.

You must meet in Oak Harbor, Coupeville, Anacortes, or Burlington. Maybe further for a good deal.

Price is $400. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the Akron area.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives. 

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better. It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives. 

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better. It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back. Zeal will change your life.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives. 

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better. It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back. Zeal will change your life.

I already have a good deer rifle and this would just become a safe queen. It's a great looking gun and would probably be a good bush gun with the shorter barrel, that's just not really my style. Or maybe something to seal up and bury in the back yard if you're worried about someone taking your guns.

I don't know much history on it other than it appears to be something like a Lee-Enfield No. 1 Mk. 3 receiver with a newer Remington 30-40 Krag barrel and a nice stock. It is really comfortable to hold up against your cheek. Also, it uses an internal magazine instead of an external magazine. I have two rounds left in the box of ammo that came with it. The previous owner also painted the sights for higher contrast, though they could have done a little neater job with it. It's a solid gun for a small price. If you want more pictures of anything specific feel free to ask. I realize as a collector piece this thing isn't anything special since it's not original, but its a solid and good looking rifle for someone wanting something to shoot."

* EDIT * I appreciate the $30-$35 offers, but I paid more than that for these and it isn't worth it to me to part with them for less than $50. I don't HAVE to sell these, but thought I'd offer them in case someone really wanted but couldn't find them. I'm perfectly fine with just keeping these - I love 'em."

Runs and drives, but engine is leaking some oil. Could use a bit of love an attention -- bought as a hotrod project and was planning on dropping in a 302 or a 2.3 turbo, but have changed directions and am focusing on my other hotrod(s).

Open to trades for quality firearms.  

This is a great easy project to make a 35 MPG classic driver, or a tire burnining hotrod. Perfect for father-son bonding. The little pinto can be driven away, but I would poke at the engine a bit more before doing so if it were me. It is currently sitting at my buddies hotrod shop in Carlton on a trailer. Delivery could be arrange for a reasonable fee to him.
