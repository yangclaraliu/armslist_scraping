It is a scrubbed German K98, Here is a description I found on the web of what these rifles are, it does a better job than I can in describing it.


It was originally manufactured in WWII by the Nazis. It came into the Yugoslavs possession and after the war, the Yugoslavs arms industry was in such wreckage they were unable to manufacture new weapons so the decided to repair, refurbish, what they did have. They started with the many German rifles they had acquired. They surveyed what they had, scrapped for parts weapons that didn't seem worth repairing. They did not strip everything down to parts like the Russians did. They just repaired as needed to make a weapon serviceable. Part of that refufrbishing process included scrubbing off the original German markings and applying their own when they refinished the rifle. 


The rifle I have is stamped ""PREDUZECE 44"" along with ""mod 98"" on the receiver. The mod 98 shows it is a German made receiver. The gun is in excellent shape. It has nice wood, nice blueing, and an excellent bore. There are a few smaller German markings on some of the parts that still remain, but all the major marks are gone.


It is numbers matching as stamped on the stock, receiver, mag floor plate, and bolt. All the numbers on the rifle match. You can clearly see the Mod 98 stamping showing it's German heritage. There is no Yugo crest on the receiver, indicating it may have been intended for export out of Yugoslavia. There is obviously a repair in the stock that was done at the factory and the stock is solid. I tried to get a picture of the bore and this is the toughest picture to get on any rifle, but the bore is in excellent condition. This rifle is in really good condition and shoots great.

I would like $350 plus shipping for the rifle and I also have 600-800 rds available to sell with the rifle if the buyer needs ammo."

Nazi proof marked and 
marked with three easily visible eagle over 88 markings (one is on the left side at the very front of the frame and is visible only when the slide is pulled back. All of the markings have been highlighted with a white marking stick, but it is easily removeable if you choose. Aerosol gun oils (like Rem Oil) and/or gunpowder solvents (like Hoppe's No.9) will quickly and easily remove it. It has no import marks and is not a Russian capture. All original with all matching serial numbers (with the possible exception of the magazine as they were not serialized, so there is no way to know for sure). Aesthetically, it is in pretty good shape, even with the fair bit of bluing wear on the high points from handling and the holster, and the underside of the frame, in particular. the metal where the bluing is more worn appears that it may be starting to get a little patina to it. It does darken up a bit when well oiled.

Rifling appears strong and well defined. No damage or uneven wear spots, and rifling goes the complete length of the barrel and is nice and strong. The safety works, as does the de-cocker function. It's loud and doesn't really look or sound like it's working correctly, but I have tested it, and it is working as it should.The grip panels are in great shape with only one small spot (just under 1/4"" in diameter)on the top of the right side grip panel where a very thin layer of the surface has come off. There are also two small nicks on the right side of the slide, and a roughly 3/8"" diameter spot of shallow pitting with extra bluing wear, also on the right side of the slide, and the two roughly 1/16"" long scratches on the underside of the barrel. Other than that, the pistol has no damage that I have seen.I have not fired this pistol since I bought it close to a year ago, so I can't say anything about it's accuracy, but based on the looks of the rifling, and the fact that everything feels nice and tight, and looks and feels well machined and fitted. I would really expect it to shoot very well. 

I believe I have mentioned every little thing I can see or think of, and the pics should give you a good idea of what it looks like overall, but if you would like to see more, I took plenty of pics, and can take more if you want to see something that I don't have a pic of, or if you have any questions, just let me know via email at: REDACTED

Buyer will pay actual shipping cost to their location via UPS Next Day Air Early A.M., UPS Next Day Air or UPS Next Day Air Saver. I will need to receive a copy (emailed scan, fax, or hard copy via USPS, are all fine) of your FFL03 or of the FFL01 dealer for the address it will be shipped to. Payment with money order, certified/cashier's check or personal check accepted, however I will hold shipment until payment clears the bank (typically 4-5 days). Payment via PayPal also accepted, however, please don't use any firearm related words/terms in Paypal comments/notes when sending payment, as Paypal may block the transaction, at a minimum.


Added 2/18/14:
Since others have emailed and asked about it, the reason I state I will need to receive a copy of the buyer's FFL03, or of the FFL01 that will be receiving and doing the transfer for the buyer, is that I am required by the BATFE to put the receiving FFL's name and address, or name and license number, in my ""bound book"". So to ensure that the name and address are correctly spelled, those of the actual receiver, etc for my book, also to ensure that the sale and shipping are 100% legal and someone isn't just claiming to have an FFL, or claiming it's being shipped to an FFL01 for legal transfer when it really isn't,  either scenario making the sale illegal. It's not worth me risking prison just to sell a gun, especially when sending me a copy of the license is so quick and simple. I'm more than happy to supply a copy of mine to the buyer and/or receiver if they so desire."

I bought it a several months ago for my birthday, having done my research and thinking it was going to be the perfect end-all carry weapon.  For the right person, it is.  Frankly, it was just too small and light for me.  I have carried many guns, and this is the most carryable pistol I have ever tried.  Extremely light (14 oz.) and low-profile, you can literally tuck this in the back of a pair of sweat pants and hardly know it’s there.  It’s like a large clip-on pocketknife!  But I have big hands and it just didn’t seem to be the right fit for me.  I prefer something that I can grip better, and will shoot a heavier round.

This 5-shot J-frame revolver is a special collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Rich Wyatt of American Guns (Gunsmoke), with modifications made to the standard alloy-frame model 637 Airweight that qualify it as a S&W “Performance Center” gun.  The bobbed hammer, polished trigger and action make it smooth-shooting and snag-free.  Add to that the patented DeSantis Clip Grip, which allows easy IWB carry without a holster, and you have probably the finest lightweight carry revolver on the market.  The right grip panel (made for right-handers) protrudes slightly, acting as a “clip” that hooks on your belt or pants to hold it easily and snugly in place.  It’s beautifully made and sports the Gunsmoke logo on the barrel.  Keep in mind that since it’s a S&W J-frame, the grips can be replaced with any round-butt J-frame grips.

The gun shoots .38 special or .38+P for a little more punch in a self defense situation.  This really is a sweet shooting gun, and I only put maybe 30 rounds through it testing on the range.  I’ve kept it a while thinking I’d change my mind, but find myself always grabbing a heavier gun when I carry.  It just wasn’t my style.  I paid almost $550 for it at Impact Guns.  I don’t  have the original hard case, but will provide a soft zippered case for it and 10 rounds of Hornady XTP self defense ammo to get you started."

I fired this rifle only once last weekend to sight it in. I only needed 8 rounds at 100 yards because this rifle was in the black right out of the box. After that, I cleaned it with CLP, applied a light coat of Lubriplate grease on the moving parts, and got it ready to sell. There is very minor chipping of the paint around the gun, mainly on the mounting areas, but it does not detract from the appearance overall. Still a sharp looking rifle and is one of the finest shooters and most accurate rifles I have ever built.  I hate to get rid of it, but unexpected expenses arose recently and I have to take a loss. 

The rifle and all above parts were purchased by me and I have around $3600 into it. Also included is the factory boxes for the rifle and scope, all original paperwork, and (1) 10 round Springfield Armory factory magazine. I would like to get $3350 OBO for the whole package, but am open to offers. If you would like to purchase the rifle without the scope and scope rings, I could do $2550. Other than selling it without the scope, I am not interested in selling other parts separately so please do not ask.

I am very much open to trades, but I will need at least $2000 cash or credit card (+3% card fees) first. We can discuss firearms for trade for the remainder of the balance. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking."

I actually bought a couple of these pistols and was going to give my Dad one, but didn't realize he already had one, so I have this one for sale. 

The PF9 I have is my daily carry gun and it's just about perfect for that. If you carry inside the pants or need concealment when only wearing shorts and a t-shirt, etc, then you can't beat the PF9. You could get one of the little wimpy .380's that are exactly the same thickness,  but I'll leave that decision to you. 

If you've looked around, you know that you can't find good 9mm or .45 compact carry pistols very easily right now. They are hard to find. Call Texas Guns on Bandera and ask them how much they are getting for their new Kel-Tec PF9's....$450 plus tax. Nope, I'm not kidding...give them a call.

FTF deal will go through my local gun shop so you will need an Ohio driver's license and be able to pass the instant background check. I am selling a lot of guns so they must go through a legal transfer so I don't run afoul of the ATF/firearms laws. Sorry if that is a deal-breaker but that's the only way I can do it!

Hammerhead is engineered and tested to work with mil-spec forged AR-15 lower receivers. While the product may work with billet lowers, these lowers often have wide variances in dimensioning that could impact the fit of this product. It may be necessary to modify the product to fit on any given billet lower.  Modifications to the product void the warranty.

CONNECTICUT: The Connecticut State Police have stated that they are currently still sorting through the new law and have no legal opinion on the Hammerhead stock adapter at this time.

This is a used scope but it is in virtually new condition. The lenses are perfect. No scratches. The finish is matte black and there are no scratches on the tube. It comes with the box, all paperwork (including the mil dot instructions/ chart), the Nikon cloth and Nikon flip-up caps (the rings will not be included). The Nikon lifetime warranty is transferable to third parties. It features side turret adjustment knobs for quicker sight adjustments. It was mounted, sighted and used to fire 120 rounds at the range. The scope was never carried through the woods or used to hunt. It has been well kept.

The scope cost $450 when it was purchased. I'd like to sell it for $330. I'm open to reasonable negotiation on price as well as trades or trades plus cash. Contact via email or call or text (706) four-9-one- 1638. No calls or texts after 9 pm please."

Bolt and internals have been professionally polished and are as smooth as butter.  The entire gun was stripped, cleaned, professionally converted and then duracoated in black and re assembled.  The gas port was professionally drilled from 2 ports to 4 ports for increased reliability and gas flow (for shooting the wal-mart stuff).  I have almost $500 in gunsmithing on this gun with the duracoat, polishing, drilling, conversion and assembly.  Extra parts added for the conversion and/or to increase reliability are as follows:

I have well over $2,500 into this gun.  It has had only quality parts and quality work put in/done to it.  This gun eats everything you feed it.  I love the gun but don't fire it enough to justify having it.

I am asking for $1850 FTF in Springfield for the entire setup...Without the Slide-Fire I would take $1650.  I may ship to an FFL out of state but buyer is responsible for shipping...If I get my asking price I can include some slugs/buckshot as well.

Has several proof marks but im unsure of the maker. Shoots great and its a very tight well built gun. I have 15 shells that go with it and you can still get fiocchi shells that are comparable to .410 shell prices. It would be great to add to your collection and chances are you may never see another. The gun is in good shape and is smooth bore. I am not gonna let it go for what you can buy a common guage single shot so please dont ask. I am open to trades I really dont want to sell unless you make an offer I cant refuse.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

 The FM13 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.62"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight.      [NSN: 5855-01-547-6387]

It's all original, and in fantastic shape, whether you want to keep it, as is, to shoot or collect; or beef it up and trick it out with today's modern accessories. There is hardly any wear on this rifle, with only a couple inconspicuous dings. The internals and barrel bore are immaculate, as well as the bolt and carrier. I was very lucky to find this specimen; and will do my best to keep the price down to make it affordable to most M16 enthusiasts. 
The COLT logo and magwell stamping is very strong, while the manufacturer stamping and selector switch markings are a bit light, but certainly definitive.
There are mags offered with this rifle.I test-drove each of these mags to make sure they feed properly. There is one original COLT 20-rd mag, and another 20-rounder from Adventure Line MFG (Colt look-alike). The three 30-rounders are also from Adventure Line, and the P-mag is once-used. All functioned perfectly. 
And, although it might seem trivial, there is a minor scratch (actually it looks like a little glue or paint) on the buttstock, that i just wanted to bring to your attention also. 
This is a really nice, un-molested specimen of the M16A1 1970's-1980's model. For this price, it's a real bargain, indeed.

Rifle is semi-auto operation and loads from a detachable 10 round magazine, but like the SKS it's really designed for top loading with stripper clips. 

It's a very robust and well built piece like all VZ/CZ firearms are. The Czechs take their weaponry seriously and this rifle is no exception. Bayonet is side folding unit attached to the rifle that lies out of the way when not in use, but that opens and locks in the fixed position in a somewhat similar fashion to the SKS.

Condition is excellent and both metal and wood are at least 95%. Bore is excellent as too and I'm confident that this will be one of the very nicest VZ52's you'll ever see. 

Rifle comes with a spare original magazine in excellent condition, plus an original sling and cleaning kit which are excellent as well. 

Additionally 10 boxes of original 7.62 x 45 ammo are included. Ammo is original Czech military (S&B produced) from the mid 60's with lacquered steel case with FMJ bullets. 

Finally a kit for converting this rifle to fire the universally available & inexpensive 7.62x39 round is included. It's basically a steel  insert that reduces the chamber dimensions to match the 7.62x39 round. This kit has never been installed and is brand new in it's original packaging. Having this kit installed by a gunsmith is recommended unless you are well versed in firearms and their operation. 

Asking $750.00. FTF only with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be a Florida resident of proper age who can legally own a firearm to purchase.

It made for a beautiful display, and it was the very first thing any new visitor asked about whenever they walked in. 

Short story is that I purchased this rifle over 30 years ago from a retired neighbor who's full time hobby was restoring old guns. Especially those from the turn of the century up to WWII. He did amazing work with a careful eye for details and that is certainly evident with this rifle. 

All of the metal and wood are completely refinished/restored and the bore is very good with no rust or pitting. I'm not really sure what type of finishes he used but the end result is quite beautiful and has withstood the test of time. 

Mechanical function seems to be 100%, but like with any firearm that is nearly 100 years old you really need to have it inspected by a gunsmith before firing.  

My old neighbor told me it was fine to fire with the proper 8mm Lebel ammo it was designed for, but I never did. He even gave me 20 rounds of original ammo that is loaded on the Mannlicher style stripper clips that the rifle uses, and these are included. 

There is also a correct original French 'knitting needle"" style bayonet included. Bayonet has a brass grip and is in very good shape, however it does not have a  scabbard. 

Finally a very attractive leather sling with blued steel hardware is included. I assume it must be a reproduction given it's excellent condition but it did come with the rifle when I purchased it over 30 years ago. 

Whether you want to use this as a display piece as I did, or get it checked so you can take it to the range - I think you'll find it just as interesting and attractive as I did. 

Asking $600. While this rifle is going on 100 years old it still falls short of the legal definition of an antique. Therefore buyer must be a Florida resident of proper age who is legally able to own a firearm.

The only rounds this thing has seen would have been from the factory testing if there was any.  I haven't even performed the first cleaning yet.

So, if you have one you wouldn't mind letting go of that you KNOW is from 1983 I'd love to hear from you!  If you're not sure and would like to check your serial# for the year here is the Remington Co. # to do that: 1-REDACTED.  The ser.# is a letter followed by six numbers and ending with a letter (a first or last# that is a ""0"" zero is really an O.  Or, if you'd rather e-mail the ser.# to me I can check.  In the event someone has one they'd sell from '83 I would want to check the ser.# for sure also.  In checking with the company, they tell me 870's made in 1983 will have a serial# starting with a letter V and the number will start after 944603.

Product Information
Shop more DPMS products The DPMS Lo-Pro AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver.

The result is a clean, minimalist appearance that is both fully functional as well as lightweight.

The Lo-Pro Upper is equipped with a 16"" Target-Crowned Bull Barrel, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. Additional features include heat resistant GlacierGuard polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle and complete bolt & carrier assembly. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.

I am selling slightly used and one of the best designed tactical headsets ever build. This headset is still in use by Army Special Forces, MARSOC and DOD contractors in most tactically demanding places all over this world. 

I used this headset during my tour in Afghanistan, one deployment with the United States Marine Corps.

Here is information taken from manufacturers website. 

Quiet Pro hearing protection
The QUIETPRO+ Intelligent Hearing System is a fully automatic hearing protection and communication device. It provides enhanced hearing and hearing protection for the infantry soldier when performing mounted and dismounted operations. The upgraded QUIETPRO+ incorporates a number of functional improvements gained through the experience of the 50,000 users that reliably use the QUIETPRO in daily combat operations.
MOUNTED AND DISMOUNTED HEARING PROTECTION
The high performance in-ear device reduces the users exposure to continuous and impulsive noise when both mounted and dismounted. It features adaptive digital Active Noise Reduction technology to ensure stable and effective electronic noise reduction.
FLEXIBLE RADIO AND INTERCOM INTERFACE
A new software programmable, binaural interface for user defined stereo or split ear capabilities. Compatible with all current and future communication systems.
EXTENDED FUNCTIONALITY 
A selectable ‘whisper’ mode that enables extended use in low noise operations.
INCREASED USER CONTROL - DUAL CHANNEL WIRELESS PTT
Up to 5 wireless PTT remote control devices can be simultaneously used with a QUIETPRO+ system. Optional wired PTT controls are also available.

QuietPro is the worlds most advanced in-ear digital hearing protector and communication headset for use with military tactical radios and intercom systems.

The uniqueness of the QuietPro Bergsmyr comments, is that it combines all key requirements for communication, hearing (situational awareness) and hearing protection needed by the solider. “First it is a communication headset. It has microphone and loudspeaker and it works in high noise environments. It also provides situational awareness (SA). When a soldier is using the system, as long as there is low noise around, he can maintain his ‘normal hearing’ in terms of high sound quality and directionality. As a result he can recognise where the sound is coming from as if he wasn’t wearing any headset at all, identify the sound and consequently, feeling comfortable about his SA, which is critical.”

This SA functionality works up to a certain noise level and is then designed to shut down in steps to protect hearing. Bergsmyr explains, “We have a very smooth transition through that phase, but when noise gets high enough, then you need protection.”

“Let’s say you are on patrol. Typically you want to hear as well as normal or often even better which is possible with our amplified listening. Suddenly, there is an attack. Then you need to be protected against shocks and blast but, at the same time, you need to hear sound that isn’t damaging to hearing. The quality of the SA is critical. If there isn’t a high quality broad frequency presence on both the SA and the talk through functionality, then soldiers won’t use the product.

“QuietPro has a very high quality talk through, an SA feature that can also be amplified if you want to. If you want to break into a room and you are on the outside you may want to listen through the door or walls first. In that case you can amplify the talk through up to four times your natural hearing. This is also a useful feature for patrolling, on observation posts and in silent operations.

The third factor cited by Bergsmyr is the QuietPro’s high quality, high capability hearing protection. “QuietPro combines two approaches. When there is high impulse noise, it immediately shuts out the surrounding sound but opens immediately as sound levels drop to safe levels. That is a unique feature of QuietPro.”

Nacre uses a self designed microchip which is able to shut out the sound immediately, hence no sound above impulse threshold levels will ever be let through. Bergsmyr explains, “We defined the systems to do that because it’s extremely important to protect against impulse noise as this is the most dangerous threat to hearing in a combat environment.” This instantaneous shut-down is essential to protect the user against impulse noise from various weapons. Slower competing systems using some milliseconds to react will not be able to fully protect against every impulse noise resulting in possible hearing damage.

The other aspect of hearing protection is protection against continuous noise, largely generated by vehicles. Bergsmyr explained “That requires a different functionality because you need to adapt in a logical way as things can change very abruptly. QP uses a very sophisticated algorithm to adapt to continuous noise. We never protect more than necessary. Over protection is equally as dangerous as under protection.” This digital Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is automatically activated when needed, and is one of the main reasons in achieving high-level hearing protection and subsequently the ability to provide clear comms in continuous high-noise environments. While competing in-ear products struggles to achieve protection in the mid-twenties, QP provides an impressive 30 to 40dB of protection depending on the circumstances.

With a large U.S. government defense contract for as many as 650,000 pistols and related accessories in the balance, Taurus was one of many companies to respond, submitting an upgraded 24/7 design they dubbed the ‘OSS’ model. When the USSOCOM request was at first delayed, and eventually indefinitely shelved, Taurus decided to offer its submission to the civilian marketplace[7] where it garnered much attention and popularity, eventually winning the National Rifle Association (NRA) Handgun of the Year award in 2005.[8] The OSS models feature a 5.25 inch match grade forged barrel [9] and a 3 position safety system - the bottom position enables the pistol to fire, the middle setting puts it in 'safe' condition, and the upper decocks the striker. This arrangement results in several carry options for the user as the gun can be carried with a round in the chamber ‘cocked and locked’ in ‘Condition one’ (striker cocked with safety on), or the arguably safer ‘Condition Two’ (striker decocked and safety off, requiring a revolver-like DA pull to both cock and fire the pistol), or even with the striker decocked and the safety on. The OSS retains the loaded chamber indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked.....This pistol comes with factory papers and factory box and ill add a leather holster.It comes with 2-12 round Mags and 50 rd of ammo.Just read what other pistol mags write up about this pistol.This one is the all black one."

Gen 3 Glock 20 SF factory production near the end of 2012 with many upgrades and ammo. The 10 mm cartridge has more energy at 100 yards, than a 45 acp at point blank. Even range rounds are potent. Drop-in kits are available to convert to most any caliber that exists.
-The mighty 10mm cartridge
-KKM Precision Stainless match grade threaded Barrel and compensator-allows for more accurate follow up shots and reduces muzzle flip.
-All new springs for optimal performance in defensive and competition purposes while retaining all Glock safety features.
-Stainless guide rod/captured 20 lb. spring
- CNC aluminum, non reciprocating rail mounted floating red dot mount.
-laserlight combo 210 lumens led/red laser with pressure switch optional
-recoil buffer
-3.5 lb. Ghost inc. sear  connector and springs
-8 magazines all Glock OEM 15 ROUNDERS with two being 20 round extensions by Arredondo 
-TruGlo tritium fiber optic nightsights
-Over 300 rounds of assorted Ammo, 100 range rounds,the rest defensive rounds, with most costing over a dollar a piece(Doubletap),(Buffalo Bore),(Hornady Crit.Def.) many still in packaging. Hard cast lead ammo included. Barnes lead free bullets included also.
most of this ammo is flying at 1300fps and above, up to 1600 FPS>
-All original OEM parts come with gun. Unused stock barrel and springs included and gun can be converted back to stock.
-KKM barrel and compensator drop in kit was over 300.00 itself. Full 5 inches of bore.
-gun has been fired 110 times to test springs and ammo, and is very accurate. I have targets to prove.
 I went through an assorted box of 50 Doubletap 600-750 LB/FT, and then a box 50 of range rounds-550LB/FT, with no problems.
-The 10mm cartridge can and will out shoot a .357 mag. and is closer to a .41 mag as far as ballistics go. It is often the carry choice for outdoors men in more remote areas where you are likely to encounter bear or large and dangerous game. Look it up.
 If I DON'T GET CLOSE TO, OR MY ASKING PRICE, BY TAX TIME,( 2 WEEKS OR SO) I WILL GLADLY KEEP IT, And finish it as a racer project, not far to go.
-Know your laws and rights. I will simply ask you for ID and to sign a bill of sale for my records. No kids or thugs please

-Don't want to get rid of it but I just don't shoot much any more, moving, and would rather have cash AND OR A WORKING VEHICLE, at this point.
PLEASE LEAVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL IF YOU WANT A QUICK RESPONSE. I HATE TO PLAY COMPUTER TAG!!!
-You may text only to REDACTED. State your intentions and offer. I will get back to you asap. Gun is pretty much new and shot very little.The hardware is easily worth my asking price and the ammo is a plus. I can go cheaper if no ammo is wanted but understand that this is a package deal.

I'm not honestly sure what brand it is as I got it second hand on my AR, but I'm about 90% sure its an AIM sports model 4 which retails for around $70.
It is of very sturdy construction and solid aluminum.  Designed to fit on an AR with a carbine length gas block.  Has a little bit of surface wear here and there but otherwise is in great shape.  I will also include a Knight's Armament vertical foregrip with it.

I swapped it out for a magpul handguard and would like to get a matching magpul stock and pistol grip.  I'd like it in OD green to match my handguard but would be ok with black one's.  Would also be interested in a stock with a cheek riser on it.

If you don't have furniture I'm also looking for either a red dot scope or a 4x or so scope that will go onto my receiver rails.

If you dont have any of these things I'd also be interested in a CAT M4 bolt cleaning tool and .223/5.56 ammo.  I have a number of mags so I really don't need anymore.

The wood finish is all original with some minor dents and dings. There is a hairline crack on the left hand side of the hand guard directly behind the rear sight and another at the toe of the butt. It includes the correct original short cleaning rod."
