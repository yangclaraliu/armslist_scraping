100,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2578100,For Sale/Trade:  WTT: Drenalin Compound Bow for Firearm,"South, Bend, Oregon",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 19, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is an amazing Bow, here is a review from one of the bow magazines:
""The Mathews Drenalin is yet another innovative solution from Mathews engineers. It's a lightweight and high-performance bow with good stability and great wall at full draw. To achieve such characteristics, Mathews engineers completely re-designed the limbs that are now more narrow, very tough, and durable. With the width of 1.1 inches the limbs are about half as wide as typical bow limbs, which contributes significantly to the Drenalin's trim appearance. According to Mathews, SlimLimbs last over twice as long as conventional limbs. To complement the new limbs, Mathews came up with a new and compact limb-pocket system. The limb pockets are secure and thin making this bow even lighter. Many hunters and archers agree that the Drenalin cam system is exceptional. This is a fast bow with a smooth draw cycle and a solid back wall. Many hunters who shoot this bow say its StraightLine Perimeter-Weighted Cam system allows for a very smooth draw and let-off. After testing this bow some shooters even say it feels a few pounds lighter in draw weight compared to the setup. To achieve high performance, the Mathews design team engineered a non-adjustable eccentrics system. This bow is equipped with Mathews Six-Point Harmonic Damping System integrated into its riser, cable guard, and string suppressors. All these dampers are designed to eliminate noise and vibration. To conclude, the Mathews Drenalin is a lightweight yet high-performance bow with a great draw cycle. It weighs over one pound less than its main competitors but at the same time it doesn't lose in speed. This lightweight technology makes the Drenalin a great choice for mountain hunters or anyone thinking about carrying a lightweight and fully loaded package.""

The numbers don't match originally.  When I bought it they were electro pencilled in.  I did polish out the bolt and it cycles fine.  It is a hexagonal receiver and the bore has the absolute sharpest rifling I have ever seen on a Mosin, and surprisingly, has not been counterbored.

Good lockup, has a bit of wear (under grips) but overall good. Pics from my phone dont really do it justice.I am looking for $590. I research these a lot and found that price extremely fair, but I am willing to hear offers as the worst I can say is no.

You can't ask for a better ""entry level"" 1911 than this one.  No FTEs/FTFs with the ball, SWC and HPs I've shot.  The previous owner had a trigger job done by a gunsmith. This gun has a VERY nice trigger and shoots very well. He also widened the rear sight himself for faster target acquisition during cowboy matches (the reason he purchased the gun). He apparently took a little too much off the right side as I had to drift the site pretty far to the left for it to shoot on for me at 15 yards.  Had thought about getting a new rear site but never did because it worked great as a woods gun for me which is why I got it. Some use marks and scratches but nothing terrible.

It is easy enough to change out the sights to Trijicon night sights for around 130 bucks which INCLUDES the tools or you can get a new GI rear sight for around 15-20 bucks if you prefer that.

Two Checkmate Ind. mags included, 8 round

Edit | Favorite
Everything from the stands to the target are made by myself right here in NH. All by hand, no automated machines used. No china products here either, no cheap rebar, no low grade materials, only the best! These targets will withstand shots from rifles up to .308! And all handguns! Shoot your .223, 7.62x39, 5.45x39, 9mm, .45cal, .22, 44mag and many more at these targets and get an instant audible sound over and over again.

Enjoy not having to go and reset your target every few shots and being able to tell right away if you hit your target.

I have circles (gongs) from 6'' in diameter to 16'' going up in 2'' increments. I also have 16'' silhouettes. The ones in the picture are the 10'' gong, the 16'' silhouette and the stand taken apart.

Stands use no tools and go together in less than 30 seconds. And will hold a 200 pound person just to show you how strong they are built.

I won’t make you email me for prices either, all the info is right here. I know a a fact that these are the best, quality priced targets anywhere.

From Les Baer's web site
Les Baer’s new Piston Style AR is another truly innovative idea whose time has come. It replaces the AR rifle’s traditional gas operating system with a brand new Baer-designed piston system that works as smoothly and reliably as any semi-auto you’ve ever owned or shot. After R&D, Les Baer has finally decided that this new design is ready for its unveiling and the amazed comments are sure to follow. Both of Baer’s new Piston rifles are extremely well equipped with loads of extras and both are guaranteed to shoot 1”MOA with match ammo."

A GREAT buy @ $1,571!!!  This is essentially the price of the rifle w/ $550+ of FREE upgrades & accessories!  Don’t forget the fact you’d pay sales tax on all of this, which would be another $125+ (assuming a 6% sales tax).  Long story short, you’re getting over $2,250 worth of fun for a great price.

So why am I selling you ask?  That’s a valid question.  While I have REALLY enjoyed owning this rifle, money is tight in my household and I don’t really have the time or money to shoot much these days.  I plan on buying a dedicated .22lr upper for my AR-15 so I can shoot 22lr for cheap and then I can use the rest of the money for a .22lr pistol of some sort.  Long story short, I’d rather be able to shoot much more often and keep my skills in order than have an awesome AR-10 that my friends are jealous of that sits in my closet because I can’t afford to go shoot 7.62mm/.308 very often at all.  In fact I’ve only put 300-500 rounds through this AR-10 since I’ve owned it for that very same reason.  It’s a blast to shoot and is very accurate and extremely reliable.  I’ve NEVER had a single misfire/misfeed.  I followed the break in procedures verbatim out of the manual and have kept her clean following all of the normal cleaning procedures (I was in the Army so it’s sort of ingrained in me!).

If you're interesting in meeting up to take a look, call or email me via the info below.  You'll have to come to me out in Covington, so I hope that's okay.  If you're from out of town or another state, we can work out shipment to an FFL if you're wanting to buy but can't come to get it in person.

This is one of the early Model 19s (late sixties vintage). It is the 4 screw model with standard case hardened trigger and hammervery slight.

Otherwise the only blemishes are two areas were the previous owner allowed moisture under his rubber grips and small areas of rust started. The grips have been changed to a set of S&Ws with speed loader cutout. This pistol is very good shape for a fifty year old S&W and reflects the quality typical of that period."

HB 1589 Hearing - Tuesday, January 21 - 1:15 PM

COME FIGHT THE WORST ANTI-GUN NH LEGISLATION OF THE YEAR -
BANNING PRIVATE GUN SALES

As we warned in an earlier article on the Pro-Gun New Hampshire website, www.PGNH.org, state representative E. Elaine Andrews-Ahearn (D - North Hampton)( See pic Below) has filed a bill to ban private sales of all firearms -- rifles, shotguns, handguns -- in New Hampshire, forcing them to go through a licensed dealer (FFL). Violation would be a FELONY. PRO-GUN NEW HAMPSHIRE URGES ALL NH GUN OWNERS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS OF THIS BILL, HB 1589, TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, AND TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC HEARING: Tuesday, January 21, 2014, at 1:15 p.m. Because the legislature knows that this bill will infuriate gun owners, the hearing is scheduled not for the small committee room but for REPRESENTATIVES HALL in the State House.



This bill is a state-level version of last year's failed effort to do the same thing at the federal level, namely universal background checks, which we wrote about earlier. (See the website http://www.noubc.com.) The statement within HB 1589 that it's not gun registration is laughable; every gun transfer through a licensed dealer is recorded, and it's certain that registration will follow. As has been proven all over the world, over and over, sooner or later registration leads to confiscation.

The text of the bill can be read at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2014/HB1589.html .

It's interesting that the Speaker of the House has scheduled this bill to be heard by the NH House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee instead of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, which has jurisdiction over gun bills.

Go to http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?code=H43 to see the committee members. While you can click on the link titled ""Email Committee Members"" to send a message to the committee office, it's better to click on the name of each member to get their individual email address. Paper mail to a home address is more effective than email, however, and the committee page includes a link,
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/CommitteeMailingList.aspx?code=H43 , with the mailing address of each committee member. In addition, you can contact the bill's sponsors, as listed in the text of the bill, through the House Roster, at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx, and the Senate Roster, at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/Senate/members/senate_roster.aspx. PLEASE BE CIVIL in your mail and messsages! PGNH members, please remember our bylaws' Statement of Principles, which calls for mature and honorable conduct.

At the hearing, you can fill out a ""pink card"" if you want to speak, or sign the ""blue sheet"" to say if you support or oppose the bill but don't want to speak. If you plan to testify, keep your time (which you list on the pink card) very short (no more than three minutes) unless you want to wait all afternoon to be called. If you attend the hearing, especialy if you plan to testify, we recommend you go early, as we expect Reps Hall to be packed. Note that no firearms are allowed in Reps Hall or adjacent areas of the State House.

THIS BILL MUST BE DEFEATED.

I've been looking into reloading for quite sometime, and now that my younger brother has also expressed a strong interest, I can't hold off any longer. What I'm looking for from local advocates, is advice on where to start and what with. I recently treated myself to some nice parts for a build, so funds are a bit tight. Hoping to find a simple older press/ spare gear that someone has sitting around unused since they've upgraded? Anyone with equipment for sale, or advice on where to shop around and what to look for kit wise would be greatly appreciated. I will primarily be reloading .45, .38 special, and potentially some .223. Thanks in advance for helping out the young, responsible shooters and future reloaders of your community!"

The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry
firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless
appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. PPK/S is the 1968
""Sport"" version, with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931 design. The
top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.
