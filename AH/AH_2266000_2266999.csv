Yes, you could put down $300 more and get a Kel-tec. But without the light, grip, and red dot/laser.
And can you pop the the barrel off a KT and throw a much longer one on? Done you want to be the only one shooting skeet, or hunting geese with a Bullpup, 28"" barrel?

And if you get bored ( doubt it) throw the classic stock on. Or a pistol grip. The 870 is the most versitile shotgun, and this stock may well be the most useful accessory."

I've collected old military arms & flare guns for 37 years and have only seem similar pistols two or three times. In fact many more of the wartime models were imported and are much more commonly seen, but you can look and look and may never find one exactly like this. There must not have been many brought over.  

This pistol was made in 1957 and was issued to East German troops. It's really in great condition and has 90% or more of it's original metal finish. The grips are excellent as well and the bore is bright & shiny with no signs of rust, pitting or corrosion whatsoever. It's all metal construction and was made at a time when high quality was the norm. It's construction is far superior to the more modern versions from the 70's & 80's that relied heavily on plastics.  

Everything is perfect mechanically and this pistol can and will fire. It's also safe to shoot with the flare and smoke cartridges it was designed to fire.  

Pistol comes with a correct & original East German black leather holster with shoulder strap. Correct leather lanyard. Plus 26.5mm cleaning rod and cleaning brush.Additionally there is an adapter that allows the more common and less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired.  

Finally there are (8) live 26.5mm rounds included: (2) orange smoke, (2) white parachute illumination, (2) red star & (2) green star. There are also (6) 12 gauge Red Meteor shells made by Orion.   

This is a true collectors item that you can have some fun with since shooting it won't devalue it as long as you clean it up afterwards.  

Asking price for the whole setup is $350 with pickup in Brandon. You must be at least 18 to purchase."

Features: Slick side upper receiver, standard ar charging handle, 5.45x39 phosphate BCG, stainless steel barrel, muzzle brake, rifle length free float quad rail, stippled knights armament rail covers on sides, ergo rail ladders on top, Magpul AFG (angled fore grip), red laser with pressure switch, truglo red/green dot sight, and one ASC 30 round mag.

I have about $720 into this upper with the extras, and I am asking $550

With the modern 5.45x39 ammos, this upper runs flawlessly (WPA, wolf, monarch, tula, golden bear, barnaul, etc).  All of these ammos are easy to find under 25 cents a round!
I do not recommend the old military surplus ammos (the spam can stuff from the 1970s) as many of the primers are seated very deep and do not fire reliably in AR-74 style rifles.  From my experience, they run around 70-80%, which is quite annoying.  But with the modern ammos I have had zero failures of any kind.  I believe I have put about 400 rounds through this upper.

But at 25 cents a round with the newer manufactured ammos you can play all day long, dumping mags and haveing a blast with an Upper that wont break the bank!

NEW IN STOCK NFA TAX STAMP REQUIRED, ALL NFA RULES APPLY. WORKS WITH 22 LR, 17 HMR, 22MAG, 5.7X28 The 22Sparrow is the first silencer in the world to offer the patent pending Multi Part Containment (MPC) technology, which allows the 22Sparrow to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use. Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. MPC technology has made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner. Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.Silencers are legal but they are regulated on a per-state basis. It is legal to purchase and possess silencers in 38 states. However, for dealers, manufacturers, peace officers, or a law enforcement or government agency,Individual, there are additional states where you can own a silencer. ALL NFA RULES APPLY PRICE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE $200 TAX STAMP ...Need ffl and will need 50.00 overnite USPS,I Will take more pictures for serious enquries..

1904 Manufactured Winchester model 1894 30 WCF which later became 30-30. Patented August 21, 1894. Serial # 320408. Nickel Steel barrel. Especially for Smokeless powder. This gun has nicks and scratches in the stock typical of a 109 year old gun and someone has re-lacquered the stock and fore grip but it was not sanded down so wood fits as original by the color and condition of lacquer would estimate it was done 70 to 80 years ago. Barrel retains 90% plus of it's original bluing!!! Barrel bore is 90% plus and shiny. Tube has nice brown patina but only has 60% or so of the original bluing. Receiver has 50 to 60% or original bluing and then rest is nice brown patina. Action is very solid this gun was shot very little internals function like new and springs are still good and tight. 20"" barrel with full length tube. Original butt plate with some cracking in the wood towards the bottom of the butt plate. Claimed to be owned by famous Texas Ranger John R. Hughes 1855-1946 then later by his Son Franklin R. Hughes who's initials are inscribed in the stock and who was responsible for the re-lacquering. I have no paperwork to substantiate this claim. This rifle was purchased from a gentle man By the name of Franklin R Hughes Jr. who said he was John Hughes grandson. From the age of the gentleman and the stories his grandpa use to tell him I believed him. Historical or not nice old functioning and shooting 1904 Model 1894"

3rd) WWI Eddystone (Remington) M1917. ""E"" marked parts. Very good condition, very nice accurate shooting collectible.  $900 (prefer trades)

4th) Rare, Generation 1 early Vietnam era M72 LAW Rocket Launcher. This is NOT to be confused with the common generation 2 and later M72's.

Completely  original.  The history on the gun is that it was manufactured in 1917.

It was rebarreled at that time, with the barrel being dated June 1939 (Springfield Armory barrel).  It is in excellent original condition, but bore is dark.  As it is a ""low serial"" number gun, it is recommended that it not be shot.
Cabela's appraised it at between $1000 and $1100.  Obviously they won't give me that for it.  So I'm taking offers above $675.  Don't bother offering less than that because at that point, I'll simply sell it to Cabela's.  But I'm open to trades of equal value.  REDACTED"

I am selling my AR15 I bought from a friend who works at Mega Machine shop after they got the 'ok' from Colt to produce their own for their company workers and friends I was told. The upper is a basic Colt model with 16 in barrel with muzzle flash suppressor. The lower receiver is built by Stinger Arms & Mega Machine shop here locally near Seattle area. They have a good reputation for reliability and durability and I haven't had a single jam or problem what so ever and put roughly 200 rounds through it. Inside the chamber looks flawless even with flashlight. Bolt slides smooth and it is the model with the dust cover so sand and dust cant get in. Gun is is 90-95% new condition cosmetically. Accessories include - Adjustable butt stock, 30 rd mag (the good kind), aluminum quad rail with 90 deg angel fore grip that's easily removable and just basic sling which is actually quite comfy. Comes with stock 20 rd mag and 5 other aluminum mags and some stock parts.  Any questions feel free to email or text 2536321722. Also interested in partial trades for nice .300 caliber hunting rifle. Asking $1200 due to like new condition w/ some ammo and extras but open for offers. Sorry Stupid pics wont load right now trying to fixThanks for looking - Jason"

This is very similar to the Savage 10 FCP, but comes with a few extras including such as a threaded barrel with 5R rifling, EGW 20 MOA scope base and knurled tactical bolt handle. You won't find this on Savage's website as it seems to have only been sold to Military/Law Enforcement at discounts. I had never seen one before so I bought it on the spot. I purchased this brand new and completed the Savage-suggested 50-round break-in last week (takes ~4 hours). In the end I decided I have more rifles than time and I prefer my 24"" and 26"" barrels, so this one is up for sale. Here are the specs:

Savage Accustock with Rubber Pad
Savage Accutrigger (adjustable 1.5-6 lbs)
20"" Heavy Barrel with 5R rifling (if you don't know what this is, google it, awesome stuff)
Threaded Barrel with Cap (Standard 5/8"")
EGW 20 MOA Mil-Spec Picatinny Rail
Tactical Knurled Bolt Knob (I would be willing to knockoff some money if you are willing to trade the tactical knob for the standard Savage knob)

Scope and bipod NOT included.

To be clear, I am not hurting to sell, so please no low-ball offers. Cash is king, CCW preferred. I also have a LNIB set of Burris Tactical 30mm Scope Rings Available if interested (pictured below with one of my scopes - scope not included).

This gorgeous gun has exceptional wood.  Everyone who sees it comments on what a great piece it is.

Details:  Nickel false sideplates, pistol grip, adjustable comb, competition-style wide rib with mid-bead.  It feature a single selectable trigger, manual safety and a beavertail forend.  It also features flush-mount chokes: 2 SK, IC, 2 MODs, IMOD and a FULL.  As I said the wood on this piece is gorgeous.  I have seen several examples of the 400 series and none had wood this highly grained.  It features a high-gloss finish.

The gun is in pristine condition with just a couple of minor exceptions. There is/was a very small crack at point of the right-hand side plate (always a hazard with a gun with sideplates).  The crack was professionally repaired by renown local stockist and fitter, Don Nix, of the Rockford Illinois area.  There are also two very small nicks at the back of the stock.  One on the comb and one on the stock itself.  It is very hard to see either of them and neither appear to penetrate past the finish.

The gun also comes with an Orvis Battenkill green canvas and leather take-down case.  The case features a very plush fleece lining and comes with both a handle and a substantial adjustable carrying strap.  I did have it personalized with my initials.  The case alone sells for $169 new.

Potential purchasers should also know that the gun was not used very much by me.  I would just use it at the club occasionally for recreational games of skeet or sporting clays.  Never been in the field (I don’t hunt anyway).

I also want to assure potential purchasers that I am an honest guy: if you’re not satisfied with your purchase, just notify me within two weeks of receipt and pay the return freight and I will happily return your money.

I am asking $1,990 obo.  I will pay freight.  It is my understanding that a sale between private parties does not require an FFL and this is the way I would prefer to go (in order to keep expenses and hassles down)."

The CZ 52 pistol is a roller-locked short recoil-operated, detachable box magazine-fed, single-action, semi-automatic pistol chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge (the gun was originally designed for 9 mm Luger caliber but due to political pressures had to be redesigned for the Soviet then standard pistol cartridge). It weighs approximately two pounds unloaded. Military models feature either a parkerized finish or a gray oxide coating, while some CZ 52s were arsenal re-blued in the 1970s. These re-finished guns are usually marked as such.

This gun has a 26"" ventilated rib barrel marked ""special steel"" with a modified choke finished off with a twin ring gold muzzle and front bead. The only detraction to this gun are two small cracks in the butt stock just forward of the cheek piece where the receiver tongue meets the wood (I'll forward the pics to those interested). This is very common to the A5 due to it's action designed by John Browning. I have loads of additional pictures that I'm happy to email for serious inquiries.
