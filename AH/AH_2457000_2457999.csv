Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Chicago Pneumatic CP-860 1/4"" straight die grinder, brand new in the box, I put a fitting in it with 12"" of 3/8"" air line on it per the manual and oiled it, never used, all papers in box. this was made in Japan, apparently these are heavy duty die grinders. 

Some of this is expensive stuff, just looking for a fair price/trade, not looking for full retail.

I will devalue things on my end if you want more than one of these items and have a quality firearm to trade. And I have cash to add as well

The radical SpeedBead System handles many of the factors that make wingshooters miss, and turns poor shooters into good shooters and good shooters into great ones. With the SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus. The optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering your shooting style is not necessary. And with 3-1/2 inches to 4-1/2 inches of eye relief, there is absolutely no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your hand gripping the shotgun. Should the common CR-2032 five year battery ever fail, you can revert to your front bead without visual obstruction. For a better view on rising targets, there are 1/8 and 1/4 risers available.

It currently wears a 2x20 Nikon Force XR scope. Somewhere I still have the factory rear sight. The scope is mounted with a weaver bolt on scope rail, so there is no permanent alteration to the gun. Don't really want to get rid of it, but I rarely shoot it, and ammo is too expensive for me to really get into shooting it. I bought it with the plan to hunt with, but I don't see that happening. Gun shoots great, and is clean. I value the gun around $450, and the scope and rings at $200. The scope and rings are a year old, and have a box of ammo through them. The scope is the silver finish, while the rings are the black finish. Doesn't match I know, but they were christmas gifts and I didn't care that they didn't match.
Total trade value would be $650. What I am looking for, Marlin 1895 in 45-70 with some ammo, S&W 686 357 mag, a CZ rifle in 22lr, 22 mag, or 17 HMR, or a CZ 12ga Canvasback O/U or a Henry Rifle chambered in 45-70. I might even consider a trade for an AR of some sort.

For the Marlin, I would prefer a JM stamped barrel. Not too picky about trades, throw me some offers, worst I can say is no. Not looking to add any cash, just trade what I have. The transfer would have to be done at a local FFL, I know a guy that does them in the Levittown area for $20, so if you are close, it can be done cheap. I can get more pictures upon request, just PM me and I can send them. Would prefer to deal FTF near Levittown, NE Philly."

It is worn from me taking it on and off for storage purposes. I would recommend getting a side mount with adjustable elevation since the one I am selling does not allow you to use your iron sights. Great optic. I've shot it about 6 times. Everytime I'm done at the range I took it off to clean my rifle, and each time I put it back on it held zero at 25 yards perfect. Only reason I'm selling it is because I upgraded to an EOTech.

Note on the extra barrel and stock: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, do your own research. 

My understanding is that you can put a 10/22 barrel and stock on a charger and use it as a rifle. You CANNOT put a Charger stock and barrel on a 10/22, that becomes an SBR, but because the charger is a pistol you can add the shoulder stock and barrel and be ok as long as it is over 26 inches total. 

Again: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, do your own research.

With the full package you basically end up with 2 guns you could switch between.

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 magazines holding 12 rounds each for the handgun. Each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING!

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

I will include two boxes of Federal Ammunition Self Defense hollow point ammunition with this package.

I am located in Peirce County, but I will travel a reasonable distance to meet a buyer."

I'm selling this not so common, leaning toward rare, Winchester Lever-Action 22 Magnum.  This is the model 9422M and is fitted with a Vintage 4 Power scope setting on Weaver high-mount rings so you can see the iron sights under the scope.  This rifle was built in 1972 and looks almost new.  There is not a nicer one for sale within 500 miles of Albuquerque!  The action is flawless and the blue is 98% to 99%.  Very Very minor marks in the wood, you can't see them from more than 2 or 3 feet away and what you can see for less than 2 feet is no minor I hate to even mention it but I am trying to be honest in the description.  I have done my homework and I know the value of this rifle.  The sell for over $1000 in this condition but I am offering it for sale, as pictured for $850.  I am open to reasonable cash offer and possibly a partial trade.  I'm not interested in low-end, cheap or junk weapons.  I don't shoot a bow or shotguns so I'm not interesting in anything thing other than a quality handgun or 357 caliber lever rifles made by Marlin, Winchester or Henry ONLY!

The barreled action sits in an XLR Industries Evolution Chassis which takes AICS pattern short action magazines. The chassis has an extended 15"" forearm over the standard 12"" along with the upgraded fully adjustable stock and folding mechanism. The barrel has a spot in the duracoat where the paint has chipped off, other than that the paint has held up very well and shows no signs of chipping or flaking. The chassis has 2 very minor wear marks on it that are shown in the pics, other than those marks it is completely flawless. I still have the original box and everything the chassis came with when shipped to me at the beginning of June 2013.

I hate to sell this rifle, but it is time to fund a custom build I will be doing for my other rig. This rifle is a very good performer with a variety of ""match loads"" and especially with my 175gr SMK handloads. This sale will include the barreled action with Weaver 20 MOA scope base, XLR Industries Evolution chassis, and one AICS pattern .308 5 round magazine. The scope and bipod will not be included in the sale.

This rifle in my hands is yielding excellent groups averaging .7 MOA for me. I know I am not the best of shooters so it is capable of better, especially with better tools and equipment than I currently have.

Save yourself some money and a 10 week wait time on the chassis and pick this one up for $1450."

I bought it 10yrs ago & have put around 1500rds thru it with FLAWLESS performance, ZERO FTF's or FTE's, ZERO misfires... ZERO.         
   you'll find guys dissing wasr's saying that they are garbage, crap, ect...  Mine has always performed flawlessly for me & everyone else that has ever shot it. It has always been well maintained & kept oiled.  I would not hesitate to use this rifle to defend my life if need be, without question.  This ""low end, cheap piece of crap, unreliable"" wasr (as some call them) will eat ANY ammo you feed it without issue, regardless of what country the ammo is made in or if the gun is dirty or what have you. It's an AK and it does exactly what AK's were designed to do, WORK.    
  It has a ATI folding collapsible stock & pistol grip on it, 14:1 LH threaded barrel with slant muzzle brake. Comes with 3 steel 30rd surplus mags & 430rds of FMJ ammo.  
 $650FIRM CASH for everything listed. CCWP preferred, Bill of Sale is a must & you must be a FL resident.  text/call me at 772-214-82 one four  if seriously interested.   
  If you can get one cheaper from some online company or local store then go fill out the paper work, pay the taxes, fees, shipping...ect  & do it. Don't bother telling me that you can, just go do it.  
    I do not ""need"" to sell it and am firm on the price.  Only reason I am selling is I don't shoot it as often as I'd like to now that I have kids and I could use the cash to put towards moving cost & buying a house.   I don't really want to sell it & will gladly keep it if it does not sell, just giving someone else a chance to own a great reliable AK."

http://gunsupplyoutlet.com/home/124-glock-magazine-gen-4-glock-19-9mm-luger-15-round-polymer-black.html

This is a NEW factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Made in Austria.  Bulk packaging (minimal or no plastic packaging).
Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.
If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load.

NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols."

I am the original owner - gun is about a year and a half old. Comes with original box, stock, and pistol grip. I will also include whatever ammo I have left: 5 Winchester hollow point slugs, 5 Winchester PDX home defense rounds, and two 25-count boxes of Winchester birdshot. 

This gun has only been to the range a handful of times. Never been hunting, exposed to rain, thrown around, dropped, or banged around in the back of a pickup. It has had somewhere between 200-250 rounds through it. Never failed to feed/fire/eject. It's a Mossberg, what would you expect? There is a little bit of wear on it, but it's the kind that comes from normal use. I am very fond of this gun, but it's part of my collection that is being sold to make room for others. You will feel like a total badass the second you pick it up!

Price is $300 OBO, would make a great Christmas present!
