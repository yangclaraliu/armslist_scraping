This gun was made around 1917, it was chromed sometime in the 60's and it was used for parades, I have only shot around 350 rounds through it, the gun shots flawlessly, looks great, I only have 1 mag for it.
I'm looking for $1400 firm, Lowballs please don't waste your time or mine I don't need to sell my gun I'm just looking to get something different, I may consider a gun of less value plus cash, I have a preference for a 9mm conceal and carry type gun a sub compact would be fine.
I would appreciate serious inquires, I work 2 jobs and my time is limited, again my cash price is firm, I believe it's a fair price for the gun and for what it is, if you don't agree keep it to your self and don't waste your time inquiring or offering your opinion.
I apologize for the been blunt but there are too many strokes and tire kickers out there.

Buyer must have a valid FOID card, I will draft a bill of sale with a transaction number from the Illinois State Police website.

We have seen this edition, make and model of shotgun sell from $500-$800+ so for $300, you could get a really good deal!  If you make a good offer, you could get it for even less!!!! I know if i had the cash on hand, i would most certainly buy it, and I am picky with my guns!

I installed a Magpul MOE collapsible stock. With the stock and pistol grip this rifle has fantastic ergonomics. The cheek weld is perfect for the factory iron sights. I left the factory handguard and milled a spot for the addition of a Magpul MVG. The MVG is not included but can easily be installed of you choose to. The gun will come with one 30 round mag. The rifle uses standard AK mags since I have installed the necessary bullet guide. The has exactly 120 rounds down the tube and it shoots great.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

They, in turn, post here or on gunbroker at extreme mark ups. If you purchase this ammunition from these individuals, you are part of the problem. There is no scarcity of this ammo, only degenerates who see a way to make an easy dollar. So to all of you on here selling bulk 22lr ammo for ungodly high amounts, shame on you. Please understand you are taking the enjoyment away from many children, including my own, who can only handle the recoil of 22lr. I was at the gunshow this past weekend looking for reasonable prices and met a man named Ricky who had a vendors table. He had close to 80k rounds of 22lr for sale. He informed me he worked at a Walmart in Austin and had been picking his way through the 20$ boxes to mark up and sell for 90$. This is outrageous. So please be aware this is what is going on, and lets put an end to it. If there is no market for 10-25 cent a round for 22lr, there can be no salesmen and things may return to normal."

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

As a result, the optics have absolutely no imperfections; they are lightly used and well taken care of.

Aimpoint PRO comes with original packaging as well as a rubber cover from Aimpoint. The rubber cover was put on the optic since the day of purchase. Aimpoint PRO also comes with the standard mount that was received new with the optic.

Aimpoint 3x Magnifier comes without original packaging. No signs of wear. No scratches. Crystal clear and great magnification. Also includes SAMSON quick flip mount. This mount is SOLID and flips to side very quickly.

Selling this setup because I don't get out to enjoy it very often. I am spending much more time at the golf course now that the weather is turning around. I would rather invest the money I receive from this sale into golf clubs.

Please email or text me with any offers. Asking $900. I will also be happy to provide extra pictures. The pictures that were taken of this combo were taken with my Macbook Pro webcam and are not especially detailed.

-145 rds. of TulAmmo 
-Carry bag (5 individual mag pouches on side, but plenty of room inside for the rest)

Low serial # - ZAPAP005XXX

This was my first rifle I purchased so it was treated very well. Cleaned after every outing, no bump-firing, etc. Zero weapon-related malfunctions, only problems I ever had were feeding from Tapco magazines. 

Almost zero magazine wobble since this wasn't one of the ban-period rifles that had their magazine wells dremeled out to accept double-stack magazines. Matching serial #'s on all parts. Bolt cycles very smoothly. Thumbhole stock gives an excellent length of pull and is quite comfortable. Barrel is threaded so you can attach any muzzle device you want, currently has a door/glass breaching flash hider. 


18+ with valid AZ DL, local sale only. Just need a photo of your Arizona driver's license, no bill of sale needed.  Not interested in trades since I'm putting money from this toward school.

Located on the East side in Gilbert, but can travel within reason to meet. 

Thanks for looking!

Daniel B. Wesson II (1916–1978) was the great-grandson[1] of one of the founders of Smith & Wesson Company in which he worked from 1938 until 1963. He earned his degree[2] in Material Science and Metallurgy and controlled the quality of his production strictly.
The first interchangeable barrel pistol produced was the W12, or the Dan Wesson Model 12 which was chambered in .357 Magnum. The barrels and shrouds for this model were interchangeable and used an exposed nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange which helped to center the barrel and properly secure it. Later, this design was refined into the Model 15 which still used the flanged barrel assemblies, but which had the nut recessed inside the flange in order to give the pistol a more conventionally finished look. Further refinements to the model 15 resulted in the Model 15-2 which is the most well known as well as the best selling Dan Wesson model. The 15-2 used a roll pin inserted into the frame as a centering dowel combined with a precisely drilled hole in the shroud assembly to facilitate proper shroud centering and alignment, thus eliminating the flanged barrel shrouds. The 15-2 also introduced more barrel offerings, including lengths of 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 inches, venting, ribbed shrouds, shrouds with full underlugs, and plain solid shrouds. The pistols could be ordered as ""Pistol Pacs"" with 3 (initially) and later 4 (or more) barrels shipped inside a fiberglass briefcase with barrel changing tool and clearance gauges; however, many pistols were sold with only one barrel- though owners could choose to purchase other barrels later."

The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target.

-----------------------------
Selling a lightly used Waffen Werks AK74, it was made in early 2013 and has had less than a thousand rounds through it.
The stock is nice looking although not pristine, being an original Bulgarian set. The receiver is US made and well made; the rails are parallel, rivets are in the right spot, and the fit and finish are great. The barrel is chrome lined, as is the muzzle brake. The rest of the parts are from a matching Bulgarian rifle.
It comes with 2 magazines; a 30 round Tapco and a 45 round bakelite from the eastern bloc, which both looks and works excellently, both are pictured.
Not pictured is the ammo, around 1300 rounds or so of Ukrainian 7n6. I bought 2 tins of ammo (2160 rounds) with it, one remains totally unopened and the other still has about a quarter of it left. I've cleaned the gun thoroughly every time I have taken it out - all 3 times. Also comes with an aluminum side rail with a quick detach mount (not pictured).
I paid over 1000$ for all of it, so I am looking for 800$ or best offer, which is less than the gun and a tin of ammo, not even factoring in the shipping and FFL fees you would have to pay."

Barrel: 28"", IC/M a very rare configuration, double triggers, does not have AE, splinter forend, solid matte rib, great example of a pre-war model 21, very clean and a tight shotgun. Both barrels are mirror bright inside. Condition: Blueing - 100%; This Model 21 has been professionally reblued in my opinion - the barrels & the receiver. I do not know if the shotgun was sent back to Winchester to be reblued. Refinishing or Restoration: There is disagreement as to the effects of refinishing a Model 21. Many shooters and at least some collectors prefer a professionally refinished gun to a badly worn one. Stock: 93-95%: with normal handling marks"
