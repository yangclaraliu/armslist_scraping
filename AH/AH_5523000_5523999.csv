Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16ï¿½ barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.Specifications:- Caliber: 9mm- Barrel Length: 16""- Operating System: Closed bolt, delayed-blowback patented KSV System- Capacity: 17 Rounds- Frame Material: Advanced Metal Components; Advanced Polymer Composite- Length: Extended: 38 1/2"" and Collapsed: 35 1/4""- Height: 6.80""- Weight: 7.80 lbs (Unloaded)- Finish: Flat Dark Earth"

Pricing is as follows: 1:$200. 2: $185 per safe 3 or more: $175 each. If you want to buy a large amount, we can work out a little better deal based on the circumstances.Original msrp was around a thousand each.Designed for a retail store, but would work great at home as well. Perfect for ammunition and/or hand guns.As you can tell, these are two door drop safes. The top section has a drop slot just above it where you can put a money bag into without opening the combination lock. The bottom locks separately and has four anchor holes in case you want to further secure it to the ground. Weight is 250 lbs and it is 20"" wide and deep, and 30"" tall.The top compartment is on a time delay where it only opens when a manager was at the store from 8am-5pm. This helps prevent theft from employees at night if you use it for a retail store. If you do not need it, it should not be a big deal as you can put the stuff that could be needed urgently in the bottom compartment. I have the combinations for all the locks and they are fully functional.These Front Load Deposit Burglary Chests are made of steel. If needed, I can load them myself into your truck bed or trailer, or assist in loading in an SUV. Please provide your name/number if you want me to call you and set something up."
