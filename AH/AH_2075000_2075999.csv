This gun shoots 1/2"" on a bad day using cheap ammo. Put Norma HPBT 168 gr and you get dime groups easily. I have shot this out to 900 Yards at a 18"" x 38"" and is very accurate. I just bought this rifle in May of 2013. I broke this rifle in very carefully. After unpacking from factory box, I ran a clean through using a gun brush then used solvent to make sure there were no any shavings. After my first initial shot, I ran cloth and solvent after each bullet for ten rounds. Then repeated this process after every five rounds, then after every ten rounds until I got to 50 rounds. Cold bore shots are usually right on the bullseye every time at a 100 yds.

If you have a firearm for trade please let me know what brand, model, finish, and condition its in and what goes with it. 

Please send pictures of trades.

I especially like .22LR or .22magnum firearms.

Thanks

 American Made Classic - Thompson Center (T/C) Renegade 50 Caliber Percussion Cap (Cap Lock) Muzzle Loader Rifle. She will fire both real blackpowder and synthetic (Pyrodex) and has a heavy 1"" octogonal barrel. 

The pretty walnut stock and barrel bluing are flawless condition.  It has vibrant case colors on the lock plate. This rifle was never fired, and always meticulously oiled.  The T/C lock uses reliable coil type main and sear springs. Lock tumbler is stabilized by a case hardened bridle and has a fly, to prevent the sear from catching on the half-cock notch when firing. Quick release, hooked patent breech with front wedge tenon, allows the barrel to be removed for cleaning, without tools, in just a couple of seconds. Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Ramrod is threaded for cleaning tools. 27” barrel, 42” overall length. The bore’s rate of twist is 1 in 48, which works great for a patched round ball or maxi-ball. 

It goes without saying that local is preferred but I will ship this black powder gun to your door for $40 (anywhere not prohibited by law). Copy of drivers license or ID is required for age verification and obviously make sure you can legally own this gun in your State, County, Town etc.

I'm not a business so Postal Money Order, and Bank Checks are the only accepted forms of payment for out-of-State buyers.

Locally I will entertain partial trades for (blueing gone, hacked stock, truck gun, rust but functional) a cheap .22 bolt, a beater deer rifle, or a beater shotgun.  But cash is king

But if you want a premium ak 47 read on......In almost every regard this is an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950's the Soviet Union, as part of its millitary aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt. AKM rifles were manufactured at the ""factory  54"" the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. The plant was supervised  by Russians prior to their abrurpt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. A semi automatic only version was introduced to the American public by the  U.S. division of Styer-Daimler-Punch in Styer Austria (this rifle comes standard with a styer barrel). For all intents and purposes this is as close to most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM. 
   The laminated wooden hand gaurds and buttstock are correct in every detal. The lower handgaurd has the propper swells, and the buttstock has been reinforced with the steel pins in the correct places. All the wood was imported from Finland but finished and fit in Egypt. The plastic.pistol grip was injection molded in the same molds used by the AKM. 
   The metal components are EXACTLY those of the Russian AKM. Small recesses on each side of the reciever directly over the magwell serve as mag guides.and instantly distinguish this as an AKM. 
    Rear sights are graduated to 1000 meters (with 300 meter battle sights marked ""p"") instead of the ak47's 800 meter maximum. Chambers and bareel are hard chromed. 
     No doubt about it,  except for the selectfire option and the markings on the reciever this IS a Soviet AKM! 
      No more than 2000 were brought in before the importation ceased making these a very rare rifle. You will not find a cleaner one. i have searched for the last 14 months. I appollogize for the long winded history lesson but ive had so many rediculous offers because people wont do their own research so i thought i would provide what i could find about it. thank you and god bless America. have a nice day."

Christensen Arms CA-15 Recon Gas Piston AR-15 rifle with Burnt Bronze finish. Gas Piston operation. The barrel is Stainless Steel, Match Grade and hand lapped, turned to a proprietary contour and then wound in Carbon Fiber, resulting in a lightweight barrel with the accuracy of a target bull barrel. Christensen Carbon Fiber barrels are three times stiffer than steel barrel of equal weight. 

The Christensen Arms patented carbon layup process produces a barrel shell that has zero thermal expansion coefficient, which brings shot after shot consistency. There is a Titanium bird cage-style flash hider with defense point serrations. This rifle has a Timney trigger system Made in the USA with a pull weight of 3 pounds.

The lower receiver is a precision milled 7075-T6 aluminum forging, and the upper receiver is an eye catching proprietary 7075-T6 aluminum billet design with heavy walls and top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure installation of optics. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron coating acts as a protective finish and polishes the receiver each time it cycles. Oversized takedown pins are installed for easy cleaning or receiver changes. A MagPul ACS stock is installed, as is a comfortable Hogue pistol grip. The Handguard is a proprietary Carbon Fiber design with top and bottom mounted rails.

This is a truly premium AR-15 rifle.

Imported by Kimber when they were in Clackamas, OR, this is one seriously reliable piece of gear.

Daewoo is a proven name that makes some outstanding firearms, and this pistol is no different.  Favored by Korean Police, it is the .40 version of the ROK Military's DP-51 9mm sidearm.  I bought this gun because I was very impressed with the DP-51's performance, and was looking for a .40.

It is based on the Smith and Wesson Model 59 Semi-autos, with one slight modification.  Daewoo incorporated what they called ""Triple Action"", which is a way of preserving the single action trigger weight in a double action pull.  To achieve this, after the pistol is cocked, with the weapon on safe and the finger off the trigger, simply move the hammer to the home position.  When you go to fire, simply pull the trigger.  The first half of the trigger travel feels virtually meaningless but returns the hammer to the cocked position, allowing for that crisp and clean single action pull to fire the weapon.  It's hard to explain, but I've never handled a DA/SA pistol that could put a round on target faster than this gun, and I've handled a few.

It has a 4.17"" Barrel, comes with the original 11 round magazine as well as 2 10 round magazines (bought during the ban).  It has some cosmetic wear, but is as functional as it was the day I brought it home.  I've put just north of 1000 rounds through it in my almost 2 decades of owning it with zero failures, and it served as my home defense gun for the entirety of that time.  I trust it completely.

Unfortunately, they are no longer imported, though Lionheart Industries has started rebranding the 9mm DP-51 (and selling them for $5-800) and they are doing well.  Holsters for the new Lionheart Pistols should work for this one as well, if you are interested.

I will miss this gun when it's gone, but I have to make room for my next gun, and it's time to make another believer out of someone out there.

I will only sell to local Missouri residents with a driver's license or preferably, a CCW permit, and will require a bill of sale. Outside of Missouri, I will require payment upfront including $20 for shipping, and the contact information of your licensed FFL"

The ACOGs are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with
tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.
Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using
fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional,
precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

However, due to lack of time and being a little too unfamiliar I am reluctantly putting this up for sale or trade. I was told that the engine turns over and fires. It does not have all the parts, hence why I had plans to restore it. Restored or continued as a bobber, this will be an awesome bike.

The rifle we have up for auction today is a new in box, unfired (except at the factory) Colt model R6600DH. The Delta HBars are incredibly accurate due to their 20"" heavy barrels and the fact that they were hand picked at the test range because they shot better groupings than the other Colt AR's. This rifle has all the original Colt packaging and comes with the original aluminum carrying case. Bundled in the case is all the factory packaging, including the original sling, all the original colt paperwork, original mags, cleaning rods, Tasco scope paperwork, etc.
