Trades considered.I can also change out the target sights for XS Big dot sights if you intend to carry this gun. THat would be a total of $430 (These sights go for $110-$120). Basically, you'd get them for 30 bucks, and I'll even install them. I can also change the gun back to a decocker if you you prefer that, and are not comfortable doing it yourself."

The upper was put together by ASI, has a chrome bcg, extended charging handle, round aluminum free float tube and a 24"" bull barrel (SS match grade, 223 Wylde 1:8) with a quiet muzzle brake (that is seamless with barrel).

I have ~$2,400 invested in the whole rifle and scope. I'm willing to sell the complete upper with scope and mount or the complete upper alone (w/o scope). I will not sell the scope or lower alone unless the upper is sold first.Trades: I'm interested in nice .357 revolvers, ""tactical"" shotguns, sa/da 9mm Sigs and generally nice 1911s.

This ia an awesome firearm but am looking around for thing else. I have put a ton of money to build this Tommy Built rifle. If you are looking to buy this rifle the initial asking price will not include the Optic as it is a very rare optic. We can discuss addtional money for the optic. As far as trades go. I would be looking for partial/full trades for up scale rifles, trucks/Jeeps, and thing of that nature. If you wish to contact me other than email you can call/text me at REDACTEDplease don't hesitate to ask for additional picturesAgain amazing collector rifle!!!"
