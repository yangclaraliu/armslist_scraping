As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS3 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of one-point attachment for direct action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments and quick-release, positive-locking hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system. Used in conjunction with the Magpul ASAP® plate (sold separately), the MS3 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS3 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS3 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand. The MS3 incorporates a new low profile quick-adjust Slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless, sling adjustment. Webbing length has also been increased for a comfortable fit with all body types and armor configurations."

Drum Magazine that will work with any 223/5.56 caliber AR.  This is brand new and comes with everything you see in the picture.  The loader, graphite, durable carry case and the drum itself.  The picture is a stock picture I pulled off of the internet, but only because I wanted to get this out right away.  It is the exact one you see in the pic and I will have no problem sending anyone who wants them, a couple of actual pics the evening.Again, this is brand new.  It has never had a cartridge loaded into it.  I ordered it for my brother through a local gun store, wrapped it up for his birthday and right before he opened it he told me that he traded his 223 in for a .308, so I unwrapped it myself and put it away.  Now I am going to sell it to put the money towards getting him some other accessories he is looking for.However, if you have any type of firearms that you care less about parting with and you would like to make a trade of some kind, please shoot me any offers.  Can't hurt.  If you just want to pay cash for it, it is a good quality one and cost me 217.58 with tax and all.  However, I know I have to take less for it in order to entice a buyer so I am willing to go as low as 170.00.  Wish I could just take it back and get a refund, but my receipt states all sales final and when I called, they were very clear with restating that to me. (ha ha)So if you are interested, please shoot me an email and I will get back with you as soon as possible.  I will consider shipping as long as it can be paid via PayPal.  That is the ONLY out of state option I will offer.Thanks"

I currently have one male and two females left.  They will come with AKC Papers. 
The male is turning 8 weeks old on Tuesday.  He is Mostly black with some white on his chest and rear paws and tip of his chin.  I do not expect him to become a black and silver but expect him to remain black.  Based on his smaller size, I am expecting him to be a larger toy rather than miniature so he may only weigh 10 pounds when fully grown.  He is very friendly and inquisitive.
I also have 2 Salt & Pepper Females that are turning 6 weeks old on Tuesday.  The larger and lighter one will be a true miniature schnauzer size and should weigh about 12 pounds.  The darker and smaller one may remain toy size.  They are very friendly and will be getting their first round of shots this coming week.
These are fully AKC registered and I am asking for 700 dollars each or will trade for interesting firearms of equal value.  We are currently taking a $100 non refundable deposit with the remaining $600 due upon receipt of your puppy and papers.
You can text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33 for pics or offers.  I like AR's, Nice 1911's, etc.  I would really like an original vaquero, stainless in 45 colt."

I currently have one male and two females left.  They will come with AKC Papers. 
The male is turning 8 weeks old on Tuesday.  He is Mostly black with some white on his chest and rear paws and tip of his chin.  Based on his smaller size, I am expecting him to be a larger toy rather than miniature so he may only weigh 10 pounds when fully grown.  He is very friendly and inquisitive.
I also have 2 Salt & Pepper Females that are turning 6 weeks old on Tuesday.  The larger and lighter one will be a true miniature schnauzer size and should weigh about 12 pounds.  The darker and smaller one may remain toy size.  They are very friendly and will be getting their first round of shots this coming week.
These are fully AKC registered and I am asking for 700 dollars each or will trade for interesting firearms of equal value.  We are currently taking a $100 non refundable deposit with the remaining $600 due upon receipt of your puppy and papers.
You can text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33 for pics or offers.  I like AR's, Nice 1911's, etc.  I would really like an original vaquero, stainless in 45 colt."
