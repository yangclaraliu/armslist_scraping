This is a slightly used (~100 rounds) RRA LAR-8 AR10 (.308).  This comes with the A2 buttstock, hogue grip, free float tube, two stage trigger, star safety selector, standard charging handle, and five 20rd magazines.  It's a little bit dirty, but otherwise in great condition.  It has the RRA LAR-8 Stand Alone Rear Sight Assembly and RRA Detachable Front Sight.

Rock River Arms has a reputation for high quality accurate firearms and this rifle is no exception.    With iron sights I've been putting 1"" groups in paper from 100 yards and .5"" groups with a scope.  The bull barrel provides great accuracy and stays cool for many shots.

Looking for a unique roll mark and color that won't win any beauty pageants, this might be for you. Swapped some of the photos in this ad to show some of the rough spots...I got a lot of emails really quickly, and wasn't sure if everyone caught the ""ugly mother"" part of the ad. More photos available when you contact me. Just added- last photo is of where the receivers meet. The coating was originally too thick for the mounting pins to insert correctly, so I sanded the coating down, and got a little too deep in a couple spots, as evidenced by the couple shiny spots. No effect on function at all. At the request of an interested party, it took this rifle out to the range this morning to see how it handled steel casings. Not only did it chew through 10 rds of tula without a hiccup, but I got a 6 inch group at 50 yards with an old red dot I hadn't sighted in :-) 

Everything the upper was used on a rifle that I put about 300 rds thru, then decided to part out the lower for another project. 

I stripped the upper apart, picked up a brand new Tactical Machining Frankenstein blem lower, and triple coated the receivers and no-name quad rail in Alumahyde 2. You can still see some dings and wear marks underneath the coating, and I had to whip out the sandpaper to thin the coating where the receivers meet so that ya wouldn't need a hammer to put the pivot and take down pins in.

It does come with a Brand New Premium Palmetto State Armory Bolt Carrier Group with laser etched logo and c-158 shot peened and mpi bolt, and it fired and cycled 55gr brass 223 just fine for me.

Comes as ya see it, and I can send photos of any particular area you like just ask. Includes the pictures PSA steel 30-rd magazine. Shipping would be $20 to your ffl of choice, or avoid shipping and other fees by meeting me a little east of Pittsburgh.

This pistol was made in Italy (some say these have better fit/finish). Purchased new just a couple of months ago, exactly 272 rounds through it. The 92a1 is the best 92 series factory pistol you can buy. The 92a1 is improved over the 92fs and other variants by the presence of a Picatinny rail for mounting light/laser, the addition of 3(!) 17-round magazines (the 92fs comes with 2, 15-rounders), a squared and checkered  trigger guard, and maybe even best of all, the front sight is dovetailed and easily removed by a sight pusher or any gunsmith for the addition of night sights if you choose (the 92fs and other variants require expensive drilling/modification by the factory/gunsmith to remove/replace the front sight). Like other 92's, this is an all metal pistol. It's slightly more expensive then the 92fs, but definitely a better choice. Original box/papers. $575. Also have new, in package Hogue rubber grips for an additional $15 if you would like. Thanks."

It's made by H&R under the Savage or Sears name I believe. Model 200. It has the barrel cut down to legal length and the stock cut into a pistol grip. The wood is beautiful. The metal is decent, there is some sort of chemical damage on the receiver but it's only cosmetic. The bore is dull and lightly rusted. I wrapped the whole gun in friction tape to protect it from rust and to make it better to grip, since I keep it in my basement. I also put an eye-hook into the butt of the pistol grip so that you can attach a single-point sling.

This is everything you need to reload .45 ammo. You can buy other die sets to reload other calibers with this system. I have been reloading for a couple of years with this set up. It works well. I don't have the time to continue reloading. Everything is in working order. The press is an older model, but has been maintained well as the pictures show. The case tumbler kit and everything else like brand new. I can send pictures of those upon request I recommend doing your homework before beginning reloading if your new to the hobby. It's exciting making you own ammo but can be dangerous if not properly educated. I actually learned a few years years ago by watching youtube. I will be glad to provide tips for any perspective buyers that are not veterans at it. Must be willing to come to Montgomery area to pick up, as I don't want to carry this package far. I plan to break it down and carefully package in a heavy duty sterilite container, once an agreement to purchase or trade has been. This is a professional set up.

554,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2092554,For Sale:  Israeli UZI,"N. Columbus, Columbus, GA, Georgia","$ 1,400","Listed On: Friday, November 22, 2013",Rifles,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is an authentic I.M.I. ( Israel Military Industries) UZI, the civilian-legal, semi-automatic version of the classic sub-machine gun. These have been (and are still) used my military and police agencies around the globe, as well as numerous ""special operations"" types, including our own Secret Service. 
This rifle is the UZI B Model, imported by Action Arms, and is chambered in 9mm., and features a very sturdy collapsing stock, fully adjustable sights, both a traditional safety located on the receiver, as well as a grip safety (like a 1911) . It also has a ventilated barrel shroud that I put on it  (just 'cause they look so cool !!) 
 I've owned this rifle for about 10 years, having purchased it from the original owner, one of my oldest freinds, who originally purchased it around 1980.
The rifle is in excellent condition, has always fired flawlessly, and is surprisingly accurate.
 Included are 7 Israeli magazines ( one is a 25-rounder, the rest are 32 round mags), 4 of them are virtually brand new. Also included is the original canvas sling and mag pouch, as well as the original ""dummy"" barrel ( short presentation barrel, for looks only.) The heavy-duty,nylon case seen in the pic is included as well.
Asking $1400,firm, and this price is right in the middle of the range that these have been going for since well before any of the recent Assault-Weapons panics, so it's not an inflated price at all.
For what it's worth, I also have the original owners manual, but I can't find the damned thing !!! I would happily drop it in the mail if/when it ever pops up again.
Any prospective buyers must be Georgia residents, over 18, and able to prove it with valid Ga. drivers license. To sell to an Alabama resident, we'd have to do an FFL transfer (not difficult or expensive, but legally necessary.) 
I'm a legal Georgia resident with my Georgia concealed carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
Please respond via e-mail with any questions........thanks for looking. 

edit: this price is a even more reasonable than I thought going by these others on Armslist:

This is more of a feeler ad to see what offers I might be interested in. I have a 1999 Honda CR250r that I am interested in selling/trading. I'm mainly looking to get rid of it because I have no way of transporting the bike any longer. The bike has sat in my garage for over a year and I feel that it is time for it to go to someone else who can actually enjoy it. The bike is bone stock with the exception of the handle bars being replaced a while back.

PROS: 
Mechanically sound
Runs great
Absolutely no issues with the bike
Comes with both Rear Paddle & nobby tires
Comes with Jack stand 
Comes with Triangle bike stand
Comes with 2 gas cans. One has gas in it.


CONS: 
Plastic is slightly rough on one side.
Fatty pipe has a small dent, but does not affect the bike in any way.
I no longer have the title for the bike. I went to register the title into my name with the DMV and because the bike was previously registered in another state, they required me to take the bike down to the DMV to have them inspect the VIN. Because I have had no way to transport the bike, I was unable to comnplete this and they are still holding the title at this time."

This baby has all the tacticool shit you could ever want strapped all over it. You get this bad boy and you will be the envy of all the guys in the neighborhood.

  You won't ever have to buy ammo for it because all the guy's at the range will bow down before you and offer up their 5.56 to you as homage to your ultra-coolness and just to see this ninja bad ass go off.
   I am looking to trade for an FAL of equal bad ass quality. Now this is important, a FAL nothing else. So save your HK-91/FAL hybrid. Yes kids there is a genius out there who thinks they are the same thing because it has ""Century"" stamped on the side of it.  I must say I was excited at first when I was contacted by this Einstein. 25 years of gun buying and selling and this hybrid escaped my knowledge?  But alas, it was just a case of full on dumb ass. Some how a Century CETME became the guise of a genetic impossibility.  Like a Liger. The mythical lion and tiger mix, bred for its skills in magic. 
  Again this is for trade only. Selling such a bad ass rifle is against the ninja code and would go against the powers of all things cool. So please don't ask for a cash price.
   With this trade I will include a box set of Milli Vanilli CD's for your listening enjoyment. And to show off your manhood. That's right kids.. Milli Vanilli.."

The lower is an N4 lower (NOT chainsaw) that was built by me. The lower hardware  used was colt with a factory Noveske Trigger I transplanted from another one of my factory complete Noveske rifles. The buffer and buffer tube is from PSA. Magpul stock and grip. Noveske QD sling end plate as well. Castle nut has locktite and is properly staked.

If you'd like to test shoot this rifle you must come to me just east of Springfield OH. Other than that I can meet anywhere near Columbus or Dayton and anywhere in between.

If you want I can add a set of MBUS to this gun as well. The rear will fit under the scope and mount. If the price is right I will add ammo too.

NO trades at this time unless it is partial and part cash and well worth my while. I am pretty firm on price but I will entertain reasonable offers. Key word being REASONABLE.

( Israel Military Industries) UZI, the civilian-legal, semi-automatic version of the classic sub-machine gun. These have been (and are still) used my military and police agencies around the globe, as well as numerous ""special operations"" types, including our own Secret Service. 
This rifle is the UZI B Model, imported by Action Arms, and is chambered in 9mm., and features a very sturdy collapsing stock, fully adjustable sights, both a traditional safety located on the receiver, as well as a grip safety (like a 1911) . It also has a ventilated barrel shroud that I put on it (just 'cause they look so cool !!) 
I've owned this rifle for about 10 years, having purchased it from the original owner, one of my oldest freinds, who originally purchased it around 1980.
 The rifle is in excellent condition, has always fired flawlessly, and is surprisingly accurate.
 Included are 7 Israeli magazines ( one is a 25-rounder, the rest are 32 round mags), 4 of them are virtually brand new. Also included is the original canvas sling and mag pouch, as well as the original ""dummy"" barrel ( short presentation barrel, for looks only.) The heavy-duty,nylon case seen in the pic is included as well.
 Asking $1500,firm, and this price is right in the middle of the range that these have been going for since well before any of the recent Assault-Weapons panics, so it's not an inflated price at all.
 For what it's worth, I also have the original owners manual, but I can't find the damned thing !!! I would happily drop it in the mail if/when it ever pops up again.
 Any prospective buyers must be Georgia residents, over 18, and able to prove it with valid Ga. drivers license. To sell to an Alabama resident, we'd have to do an FFL transfer (not difficult or expensive, but legally necessary.) 
I'm a legal Georgia resident with my Georgia concealed carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
 Please respond via e-mail with any questions........thanks for looking.

ANIB less than 50 rounds through this. Purchased May 2012. Still has factory lube on it. Never carried. Only fired to make sure it functioned well. A nice carry gun. Comes with case, cleaning brush, locking keys, holster (had for another gun this is the last gun I have that will fit it and I have enough holsters laying around) and 50 rounds of FMJ ammo. Will not split up. This is my last 9 mm so no reason to keep ammo. Will meet in Clinton or Powell areas. Will not ship. Will not trade. Thank you for looking.

Bought on April 11, 2013 and received a week later but found that I already have the same exact model. I thought my first one was EXPS-2 but it turned out to be EXPS-3 as well, so I am selling the one I just bought. Got it from Bass Pro Shop online and now it's unavailable anywhere, selling at purchase price with receipt. Never registered, never used. This is the fastest way to acquire a sight picture for initial and follow up shots, a staple in competitive shooting. The EXPS is better than the XPS because the built in QD mount raises the EXPS 7 mm so it eliminates the need for an extra riser mount yet still allow a lower 1/3 co-witness, also the controls are locared at the side instead of the back for much easier use especillay if you plan on having a magnifier behind it. EXPS-2 is not night vision compatible which is important for night competitions and hunting. EXPS is the best sight for Close Quarter shooting but is also good for long distance up to 500 yards with a cheap 3x magnifer, I use PA."

If you don't know about Armalite AR15's, they are one of the only rifles on the market that come standard with a two stage trigger.  The reason I bought this rifle over any of the others is because of the trigger.

I have owned this gun for nearly a year, but am selling because I have no time and no place to shoot it.

It has had less than 300 rounds through it.  Less than 60 since being Cerakoted.  As you can see in the photos, the upper, lower, barrel, and EOTech hood have been Cerakoted in battleship grey.  This really makes the gun unique.  I have never seen another AR like this.

Here is what has been done to/what comes with the gun:

EOTech EXPS2-0 w/Battleship Grey Cerakoted Hood (Matches Rifle)
Primary Arms 3x Gen III Magnifier w/mount
Rainier Arms Raptor Ambidextrous Charging Handle
Troy MRF-C 7"" Rail - Cerakoted Black
Magpul MIAD Enhanced Trigger Guard - Black Aluminum
Magpul Ladder Rail Covers - Black
6 - Magpul PMags - Black (2 Are New/Sealed in Packaging)
2 - Steel Mags
Total of 340 Rounds (PMC Bronze and some Federal)

Also comes with original manual, hard case, original rail cover, original charging handle.

I am selling this as a complete package for $1,900.  I will not consider any trades.  Cash only, no checks, no cashiers checks, no money orders, no PayPal or anything else, so don't ask.  Cash Only.  The Rifle and Optic Setup (EOTech and Magnifier) alone are almost worth my asking price, so I believe the asking price is more than fair considering all the other extras that are included and the very limited use this rifle has seen.

If you would like any additional photos of the rifle or any of the other equipment, feel free to get in touch with me and I will do my best to get the photos you request."
