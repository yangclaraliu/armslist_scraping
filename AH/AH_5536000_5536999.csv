The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame.  The stock is a post WWII Overton Stock with evidence of a faint DOD cartouche stamp. The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.Stock- OvertonME- 2Do not have a chamber guage, but throat wear is minimal.

These TBRs require modification for fit up.  You must remove material with a file or sand paper from the inside channel were the TBR rides over the cross pin. This TBR makes use of the existing spring on the OEM surplus bolt release being replaced.  These TBRs were never tumbled, so another recommended modification is to remove any sharp or pointy edges from the outside of the TBR lever.  The entire modification should take 20 minutes with a small file, not including any desired touch up paint or cold bluing after modification.About 20 of these are already in operation on both CAI vz2008 and CSA Sa. Vz.58.  No user has reported issues to date of any problems, either modifying, installing, or operating the TBR.While we have also modified the TBR to fit on the CSA vz.58 variant, these work best on the CAI vz2008 in conjuction with the OEM surplus magazine release.  They will NOT work in conjuction with other TMR (magazine releases) such as King Gun, without additional modifications.This video is a basic review of the TBR:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgaL1oYb8lM&spfreload=10Polenar Tactical Bolt Release - Gen 1 PrototypeContact me with any questions or comments."

All markings and cartouches are visible. It has a good bore and functions fine mechanically. Serial #33858.The Starr carbine was produced in two versions: the Model 1858 and the Model 1865. The Model 1858 could fire linen or paper cartridges made by Starr, and could also fire similar cartridges made for the Sharps carbine. The Model 1865 version fired used their own 52 Starr cartridge In1865, the government ordered 3,000 Starr carbines chambered to use metal cartridge. These proved to be successful, and an additional 2,000 were ordered. With the success of the Spencer rimfire cartridge the Federal government (perhaps) revoked the original contract with Starr, and requested manufacture of the newer cartridge model that would chamber the Spencer 56-52 metallic rimfire cartridge, and the Starr manufacturing plant began production of the NEW cartridge models with the next sequence of available serial #s i.e., in the 30,000 range (Maybe … ). The rimfire cartridge model was successfuly tested in January 1865, and between March 28, 1865 and and April 11, 1865, 5,002 Starr rimfire cartridge models were manufactured, however, not many of these models were actually used in the Civil War, as they were produced too late. The earlier percussion-Starrs were delivered and issued in greater numbers to units during the Civil War. Starr Arms Company had been the fifth largest supplier of carbines and the third largest supplier of .44 caliber single action pistols for the war. After the war had ended, and with no further government contracts, Starr could no longer compete with larger manufacturers like Winchester, Sharps, and Colt, and the company closed its doors in 1867.  NO TRADE .....

If you want to buy this Rifle new it is a Distributors Exclusive through Lipsey’s and the Rifle retails for $346.00. The Rifle is in excellent condition showing minimal signs of use. I bought this Rifle new and fired less than 200 rounds through it and have always taken good care of it. There are no scratches dings or dents in it anywhere. There is some powder residue around the action from being fired but that is it and other than that the Rifle looks like it is new out of the box. The rifle is very accurate and groups very tightly it just needs to be sighted in because I never touched the sights sense I purchased it. Over all a very fun Rifle to shoot and I would love to keep it however I have too many and I have to let this one go. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify.

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.
The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

The stock has dings, dents, and scratches consistent with a 150+ year lifespan. Brass shows a nice patina. The Barrel is 8 ½ inches long with a brass blade front sight brazed to the barrel. It has substantial pitting inside and out and the bore is quite dark.
