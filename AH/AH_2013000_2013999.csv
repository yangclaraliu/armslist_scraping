I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

The lights work and look great, I just got 4 more that are bigger and use a larger size bulb so I'm selling these.
A set of four with case are selling on eBay (see links) for 475.00 plus 75.00 shipping. Another listing is for just one light and they want 180.00 for it. You can read up on the specs of these lights in the links also.
Get two here for only 125.00 bucks!
These work great in an attic, working under a vehicle, lighting a large party tent, garage, shed or what ever you can imagine. I personally have some hanging from rafters up in my attic. They have hanging straps with clips/hooks on each end, with waterproof switches and fuses built into each one. I measured one and they are just a little over 49"" long, not including the power cords. Just plug one into an outlet or extension cord and the other into the first one. Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy!

Threaded Barrel. Have a 40$ compensator or muzzle break that goes with it. Doesn't do much just looks cool.
I have the box and bag it came with. And two mags.
For the right offer i have 5 more mags i bought for it.
I paid 420 for the gun new plus the five more mags so Im wanting 350 just for the gun and for a little more ill throw in the other mags so you would have 7.
400 will take everything. Thats sell the extra mags for 10$ a peace which you will never find for that price and no i wont sell just the mags. 
I will throw in a box of Federal Auto Match 325. Brand new.  325rounds if someone buys it this weekend. 
And a 40$ holster.

From Wiki...Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK.

Also from Wiki...The RPK functions identically to the AK-47. It also uses the same 7.62x39mm ammunition. It has a similar design layout to the AKM and AK-47 series of rifles, with modifications to increase the RPK's effective range and accuracy, enhance its sustained fire capability, and strengthen the receiver."

It works perfectly, I can't recall it ever malfunctioning since new. I had the barrel threaded, a very difficult thing to do on a Sub 2000. The precision rifle gunsmith, turned the barrel on centers to press on a precision threaded sleeve. It's the ""right"" way to thread a Sub 2000's thin barrel. I've since used it with my Osprey silencer, and it works VERY well. To thread the barrel, the front sight had to go, so I added a quad rail and a primary arms red dot(included in auction) on a quick detach mount. This allows the rifle to still fully fold, yet the sights return to zero every time. It's a great setup. No trades , Only serious buyers should contact me!!!"

They boast the perfect combination of proven design and reliability. Features include: rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. Simply stated, Mark III Pistols offer the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.
