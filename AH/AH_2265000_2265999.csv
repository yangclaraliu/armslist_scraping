Comes with Factory Hard Case.When things go bump in the night nothing settles your nerves more than having a shotgun nearby that you know tips the odds in your favor. Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers. More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, you will need this"

This rifle is in the flat dark earth color.  It comes with the 16"" mil spec1:9 twist barrel, forged aluminum lower receiver, A2 style pistol grip, with a 6 position ATI Strikeforce adjustable stock and cheek rest, making it perfect for shooters of all size.  This is a 5.56 rifle making it compatible shooting both 223 and 556 rounds.  The same manufacturer that produced the upper and lower receivers on this rifle also make the receivers for Colt.  What really ups the value on this rifle is the EOTech optic system.  This system allows the shooter to quickly shoot with both eyes open and full range of vision.  It has red optics and a bright and dim switch to allow operation in full daylight or very low light situations.  I never registered the optics and still have all papers and the box so you can register it to you.  Accessories include the optics, a blackhawk single point sling, the original metal 30 round mag and two 30 round Pmags.  I have had this rifle for roughly 2 months and have barely shot it.  The only reason I am getting rid of it is because I need to make room for guns for cowboy action shooting and I am moving to colorado and I can't hunt with this size caliber there.  This is a very beautiful and clean gun, so the pictures do not do it justice.  If there are other pictures that you would like please don't hesitate to ask!"

Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers. More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, you will surely need this"

This sweet has been mated to a light weight polymer lower with a poly adjustable stock to reduce weight to make this a great compromise of weight , size , and accuracy. This rifle comes with flip up battle sights and one 30 rd pmag. The barrel is a 16""x1"" stainless steel free float  bull barrel. I have reduced my original asking price quite a bit because I need to sell it and it deserves a home where it will get used and not just collect dust. I am asking $1150.00 obo. I believe this is a great price for a good quality ar-15 that offers a lot more then your average mil spec assembly rifle. I will also throw in 20 rds of green tip ap ammo for the person who accepts this deal."

I've owned it for about 1 year and have run 300-400 rounds through it, so it's well ""broken in"".  Vector (the builder) recommends around 500 rounds.

First made in Israil, the Uzi was also made in South Africa and Germany.  When banned from import, a US company bought up all of the parts stored in those countries, and others, and starting building them here.  That company (Action arms) went out of business and the present builder is Vector Arms, of Utah.  My gun came with a German submachine gun ""lower"", so the fire selector is marked ""D E S"", for full auto, semi-auto and safe in German.  The full auto function is blocked off.

I built the gun to may taste, but have all of the stock pieces to return it to ""factory"".

I've added a verticle front hand grip, which was a later modification made to the submachine gun to provide better control.  On the side of the grip is a small section of Magpul rail, which allows for the installation of a lazer or flashlight (not included).

The factory bolt handle has been replaced with a small horizontal one, which doesn't tear your hand up like the original.  In addition to the folding metal stock I also have the wooden stock, which was designed for the submachine gun.

Other extras include:  9 factory 32 round magazines in three IDF (Israeli Defense Force) canvas pouches.  Other IDF items include a factory front sight adjustment tool, a magazine loading tool, a magazine ""coupler"" for quicker mag changes.  Other items include the original front grip, bolt handle, spare magazine release w/ spring, handgrip screws, and barrel release lever spring.

An Uncle Mikes range bag is included, along with about 550 rounds of 9mm ammo.

Buyer must be over 21 and provide AZ ID.  Prefer CCW.  Some handgun trades considered plus cash: Kimber, Colt, Sig."

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

Cody @ 520-723-nine255 or text REDACTED The colors for these vests are in ""Desert Tan"", ""O.D. Green"" and ""Black"" The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large"" MIL–A 46100 steel plate is military spec armor steel. It exhibits high-hardness that is approved for use within the Department of the Army and is available for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense. The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. (Ar500 is target material, Not intended use as Body Armor). Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. If you do try to buy ar500, ask them if it stops a .30cal AP M2. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 hangdun. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 13 pounds. I've personally shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches and ETC.

This little guy looks like the Colt Detective that I carried in the early 80's except for a shortened ejector rod.  It would be an excellent ankle holster, home ""Go To"" or glove box gun as it ain't the best looking.  I did what I could with the surface rust, but it shows some past lack of maintenance.  He came from the Marion Police Department gun auction last week, that would explain the lack of care.

I ""detailed"" this piece; thoroughly cleaned it inside & out, removed the surface rust  where I could get to it, and properly lubricated it.  Since where was no holster, I could not treat the leather upholstery.

I'm selling my beloved Baby Eagle. It's been an all time favorite of mine. It handles like a CZ, since the design is based off the Czech's; it has a very strong solid feel to it and the grips allow a natural pointing angle. It has a great double action / single action feel, very clean break and a light pull afterwards that invites double taps. These things are sturdy and know how to take a beating, however I've never abused it. This one has never been fired but I have shot my friends exact same one, 

Here's what you get:

Baby Eagle II Full size .40, Steel frame with pictanny rail system
Box papers, shell casing from factory that it has been tested.
