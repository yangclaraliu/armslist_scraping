I went to meet him in a public place tonight (12/03) but when the time approached he explained that he was unable to leave his house because his wife had left for work. I dumbly agreed to meet him at his house which was located off of Foy Lockamy Rd in Jacksonville. I called him for directions because my gps didn't take me exactly to a home. I was told there was a black Ford Taurus in the driveway, and stayed on the phone with him while pulling in the driveway. 

I told him I was there, and then was told ""Step out of your truck if you want to see your wife and kids again."" I put my vehicle in reverse immediately, narrowly avoiding being stuck in a ditch.

I have had this for over 35 years and while I love the thing it is just time to sell it.  I have only put a 100 rounds or so though it and it has just been sitting in the safe.  With the factory 4x scope you can shoot some great groups and still use the iron sights.  This is a very well designed and built rifle done by the same guys that did the M16.  They wanted to take care of some of the issues from the original design and the AR 180 is the result.  
It comes with the original documents, a hard case, sling, scope, 4 mags and a lot of shooting fun.
I am open to some trades don't hesitate to make an offer."

About 150 round through the rifle and never had any problem. This rifle will cycle anything you feed but it'll dent any case you cycle it. The dust cover is extremely tight.

3. Burris Signature 1.5-6x32 (I have this posted on here already so I will list the original description below):
""Burris Signature 1.5-6x32. Made in USA scope. These scopes have great glass and are built rugged. They are a step ABOVE Burris Fullfield's. I own a few Fullfield's and can confidently say the Signature is significantly better, especially in low light. The only issue since new is it has a tiny dust spot on the inside of the lense Only at 1.5 power, size of a pen dot. It is at the VERY EDGE of the glass and again ONLY at 1.5 power. It doesn't show in your field of view unless you look for it at the edge. It never bothered me so I didn't send it to Burris. Burris will clean the dust spot off for free if you want and I have the return form to do it. However, I just never seen the need since it's only at 1.5 power and on the edge. It has a no questions asked Lifetime Warranty. It is in great condition and this is NOT a cheap scope. It sold at $400 new. (Reticle picture shows the small dot at the top edge of the reticle)""

Runs cool and stays on target for double taps, zero muzzle flip.

The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Elite 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, mine being the 12.5"" rail gives you an additional 2.5"" more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.
Rail covers not included for posted price.
