Upper was bought from a friend who worked in the PSA factory and sold it brand new to me, the lower was bought from a guy who worked in a gun shop who had built the lower himself brand new. I threw on a few parts here and there, but when I say all PSA I mean all PSA (PSA buffer, PSA LPK PSA barrel, PSA flash suppressor, PSA upper, PSA lower, PSA bolt carrier, PSA charging handle). lt was built on all brand new parts and has only been fired 23 rounds to test performance. 

It has a forged psa lower, psa upper, psa 16 inch HBAR barrel, Midwest industries hand-guard (Probably the most ventilated handguard on the market), magpul b.a.d. lever, magpul trigger guard, magpul pistol grip, magpul ACS-L stock with storing capacity, mbus gen-2 flip up sights, blackhawk single point sling, lowpro gas block, J&P lightened trigger components (not installed but will come with rifle), 2 30 round MOE polymer mags, 100+ rounds of various ammo (remington etc.)..................All in all, this is a performance tack driver. Selling it because I'm scaling down on the few rifles I have.....I just personally prefer 7.62x39 over .223 so I'm finally putting this one on the market. If you look at the components, condition, add ons/extras, and the history of the parts. I believe 1200 is pretty fair for what this rifle's worth is. I'd be happy to exchange emails over offers, just shoot me one on here!

NOTE: I pride myself on honesty, so I will fully admit there is one part on this rifle that is not PSA.......and that is the buffer tube, it is a UTG. I know how incredibly irrelevant that is, but hey, as I said, honesty. 

ON TOP OF THIS: It comes with a pistol buffer tube as well."

Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for increased accuracy for engaging long-range targets; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for instant target acquisition in the short-range, sweep & clear role. Go ahead and compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s and you will be impressed!

If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This is a John Greco fixed blade fighter called the Probos, though this one has a little extra jimping that Ive never seen before on another one. This one is also a little larger than most others I do believe. I bought this one off of John himself at the knife show in Cambridge OH several years back.

Anyways, it has John Grecos standard construction, 8670 steel, black coating, leather sheath by Sherry Lott, Micarta Scales.

Really really solid piece. It has seen some use and I have rebeveled the edge with my Edgepro. The coating has seen some wear in the middle of the blade and the rest of it, including sheath, has a scratch or bump here and there.

Would really make a great user for someone. Hell, kydex a sheath for this one (Something I never got around to) and it would make a hell of a tacticool blade you can actually use.

Overall I would rate the piece at 80% but has tons of life left in it.

I am asking $135 shipped USPS Priority to anywhere in the USA.

Also, I will not deal with Paypal ever again so a POSTAL MONEY ORDER is the only payment I will accept.

I am also interested in trade or partial trades.

I am in Bridgeville PA 15017 , a suburb of Pittsburgh. PM me for more info or with an offer."

I'm putting up for sale/trade my Dan Wesson Guardian .45. This was my carry gun but it does not exhibit and carry wear whatsoever. I have personally put around 400 rounds through her with ZERO issues of any kind. This thing is a real tack driver, far more accurate than I am. I bought this beauty used at a gun shop nearby so I cannot tell you exactly how many rounds are through it. I do not have the box, but will include 2 Dan Wesson magazines, one of which is a CM mag. She has contrasting tritium night sights that are still good and bright. The only ""defect"" is that there are two small cracks on the ejection port side grip panel going form the panel screws to the edge of the panel; looks like someone over tightened them at some point. Purely cosmetic, but I try and be full disclosure. These things go for $1550+ new, The lack of box and small cosmetic blemish on the grips is reflected in my price.

I have a new CZ 75 P-07 in all retail packaging as sold. A really modern gun with a lot of the features of a much more expensive model. Easily a best buy for concealed carry and looks and performs well above it's price point. Look up some of the reviews and features on this one, like hammer fired, single/double action choices. Decocker setup with the optional thumb safety conversion piece included. This is the hard to find and more desirable 40 Cal version. I didn't find any other 40s in Ohio for sale here.This is a carry gun for many law enforcement officers. You get this one in the retail box, included is all the packaging, lock, paperwork, cleaning brush and extra mag. At 12 shot capacity, it is very concealable. This is a brand new in box condition gun. Test fired and that's it. You save transfer fees and tax. Face to face public meet only."
