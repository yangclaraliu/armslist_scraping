Im looking for a quality AR pistol with the barrel being no shorter than 8 inches (that can include the FH) prefer it not have an A2 sight but not a complete dealbreaker but i am not a fan of railed gasblocks so id prefer the gasblock under the quadrail and not visiable.

All stands are in great condition. I'm selling these because my younger brother is starting to hunt with me more, so I'm trying to convert everything to large 2 man stands. All prices listed are cash, but I do run a small fire arms shop and would be interested in any of those as a trade, large 2 man stands, or any other hunting accessories. But cash is king and the more you buy the better deal. 1) This is a 22 foot extra wide single man ladder stand. It has a wrap around shooting rail, stabilizing bar and has a very comfortable sling back seat. It has also recently been painted a flat green and brown. The only issue with this stand is it needs to have the canvas material replaced on the seat, a simple fix for anyone with a piece of fabric, needle and thread. I'm asking $110 on it, and for that price I will throw in a brand new ratchet strap. 2) SOLD! 3) This is an essentially brand new 16 foot single man ladder stand. It has padded armrests, padded flip up shooting rail, stabilizer bar and is in like new condition. The price on this one is $110 and at that price I will include a brand new, never opened double-thick seat pad and a ratchet strap. 4/5) These 2 lock ons are API Baby Grand Lite, in like new condition. These have larger platforms and seats than the newer models and are aluminum so they're much lighter and will never rust. The seats flip up and the platforms are coated with non-slip tape. The price is $110 each and will include brand new double-thick seat pads and new ratchet straps. 6) This is a brand new, never hunted, F&S lock-on. It comes with padded flip up seat with hot hands pocket, padded footrest and straps. The price on it is $75. 7) Lastly I have a package deal that isn't pictured. It is an API, just like the first 2, but with a swivel seat. The seat pad on it is faded and could stand to be recovered but still works just fine, it comes with a set of 15 foot tree steps and all straps needed to hang everything. The price on that package is $125. Anyone interested in any or all, please contact me for more details and pictures. And remember, the more you buy, the better the deal. Thanks for the interest.

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

This is a great quality BCG to complete your AR15 build, or just to upgrade it. Also perfect to use with a RDIAS if you are lucky enough to have one of those. It is constructed from all mil-spec and properly tested materials (many are not), and the full specs are listed below. Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It is an extremely hard and super slick coating that requires no lubrication and can be run completely dry if you choose. There are also many benefits to using the full auto M16 carrier in your AR15 - it makes for a smoother cycling and softer shooting rifle, especially in a carbine length, which equals less wear and tear on components. The BCG is not a regulated part, so anyone can own and use it as an improvement over the semi-auto version in any AR15.

Please don't email me just to ask is it still for sale, if it is used, if I will take less, or without including a phone number. If it is still listed for sale then it is still up for sale.

Pinned barrel. Case hardened hammer. Condition is beautiful and looks like it was hardly ever fired. Cosmetically, this is the one you want.  However, it does have a timing issue and requires it to be sent to Smith or a local gunshop. I talked to Carl Jarl Gunsmiths and he said he thought it would be a $40 repair. Smith and Wesson may also do the repair for free. I can’t stress how clean this gun is; it’s the closest to new that you will find. For many years until the semi-auto this was the carry gun for many police departments including Omaha Police. Asking $400 as-is. Priced to move. Located in West Omaha and can be meet buyers at Cabelas in LaVista. Buyer must show Nebraska Purchase Permit or CCW. X-Posted. Thanks."

I have a few brand new unissued GEN 2 packs. I also have a few GEN 1 previously issued and are in B Grade condition showing slight signs of use. All packs have fully functional zippers and buckles with no tears. Don't buy a crappy pack offline that's been through multiple tours. Get one local and see what your getting before you pay the shipping cost on a worn out pack. Most of these bags are used but most could be considered new, only a few show any signs of use.

Premium-quality aluminum alloy barrels are fully machined to precise, match grade tolerances from exceptionally hard 7075 aluminum. The 7075 aluminum is much stronger than many mild steel alloys and gives all the benefits of a thick barrel and improves the heat distribution for better accuracy. These barrels are light weight ranging from 13-18 ounces - less than half of the weight of traditional steel barrels weighing up to 60 ounces. A custom Beyer Match Chamber is inserted in all barrels. Barrel shanks are oversized to .001"" and may require a little sanding to fit receiver; .17 HM2 barrel requires a heavy bolt or bolt handle assembly. .750"" diameter barrel accepts standard AR-15/M16 gas blocks for extra mounting options. Recessed target crown protects the rifling at the muzzle. Overall our barrels allow for greater versatility for long hikes, full day at the range, increased endurance for youth shooting and ease of use."

I have been advertising it at $950 with 4 magazines, bulldog holster and gun.  You can look it up on the Kimber America site, here is the link:

http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/custom-ii/stainless-tle-ii

I have located the shotgun I want and I am picking it up on Friday.  So that is the amount of time I have before I need to go to bank.  I am dropping the price of this gun and magazines to $800 for the next 24 hours.  After that point I no longer need to sell it and I will put it back in the safe.  The gun is practically new, I have owned it for under a year and less than 200 rounds which means the gun is not even broken in.  Kimber says at least 1000 rounds.  I have another Kimber 45 and Sig Suaer that I use for my carry guns so I can afford to let this one go to further my cause.  

So I am dropping the price for the package I will not drop it any more. iIt is roughly at least    $200 off of what you would have to pay to get the package yourself today.

She used my Leather Holster which made a small area of wear on the rear of the slide. Gun is unfired and still in excellent condition but cannot be NIB anymore but does of course include everything it has new. so price is going from 430 to 375 firm

 Love mine and when the wife shot mine she did not like the feel of it so I kept hers unfired as I bought one for each of us.  I can easily say mine has become my everyday carry within a week of owning it and I own many guns..too many. I have put 600 rounds through mine and love it more and more. Being so slim the sights are so slim it is hard to miss your target. With the flush mag mine fits in many of my pants pockets...not all. IWB you forget its there and just like the M&P full size I have it eats any ammo I feed it. I believe this to be the best subcompact on the market right now with a amazing price tag. When money is flowing better I will be buying the 40 cal as well.

Rifle has been modified to accept double stack surplus mags with no mag wobble. Has chrome lined barrel and Tapco G2 trigger group and professionally polished rails and internals, eliminating rough action and allowing for smooth and flawless functioning without bolt sticking like some other Romanian AK's I have handled. Included is one Flambeau rifle case, sling, one ten round Tapco magazine, two 30 round magazine rebuild kits, and approximately 50 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition (mixed). Many hours of work went into making this gun function the way you want your rifle to function - without hanging up and sticking when you pull back the charging handle to chamber a round. California compliant magazine lock (aka bullet button) installed to make rifle CA legal, easily removed with Allen wrench if you live in a state that does not require one. Approximately 400 rounds fired total without any problems. Rifle was put in the safe and has stayed there for a few years following some training courses I went through with the rifle. Has some minor cosmetic wear on the finish and furniture from the training course action it saw, but nothing that a little TLC won't fix and have looking brand new again in one sitting. I had planned to do so myself, but I finally decided to part with several of my guns right now to cover unexpected medical expenses that recently came up. Willing to ship to FFL on buyers dime but prefer a face to face transaction at Gussler's in Santee. With the recent executive orders issued by President Obama, these are no longer being imported into the United States, so if you ever want to own one, get it while you still can. I have heard from several friends in different areas of law enforcement that Kalashnikov platforms (among other non-domestic ""assault rifles"") will not be transferable in 2014 when new legislature has been passed and/or executive orders have been implemented. Please no insulting low ball offers, I am not in a hurry to sell and they will be ignored.
