Savage 1899 in 32-40 cowboy cartridge. Beautiful condition, tight action, original bluing
with nice patina, great shape no pitting or rust, .Bore is super bright and great rifling.. Well taken care of and original finish. Stamped ""Savage High Pressure Steel Model 1899""on barrel.  Has added flip up rear and adjustable peep sights,
Stock is in good condition with slight handling marks. The base of stock has small piece missing at heel as was common with these rifles if you set them down hard they had a steel butt plate and narrow wood at heel and it would split a piece off about 3/8""
It was repaired/sanded. Also My Grandfather stamped his Name in the stock on action side.. Not too deep and could be taken out with some sanding.
 I have several (6) John Wayne boxes of ammo that go along with this beauty. Brass shell counter/window on side. The serial numbers on receiver, inside of butt plate,
and also engraved in stock and fore grip are all matching same number.. All Original 
My great uncle killed a grizzly out west on a hunting trip with this gun. Hit it in the  spine and dropped it.. 
Beautiful old time classic used in John Wayne movies and other western classics..

The Ammo itself in the original boxes is very collectible.
Very rare cartridge and very sought after as not as many of these were made.!

Thanks for looking. More Pics available if you like.. No problem
Cash sales only. Local pickup or I can package and ship to your dealer on your dime

This entire package is an excellent value.

The vz. 58 (model 58) is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia and accepted into service in the late 1950s as the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58 (""7.62mm submachine gun model 1958""), replacing the vz. 52 self-loading rifle and the 7.62×25mm Tokarev vz. 24 and vz. 26 submachine guns. The vz. 58 externally resembles the Soviet AK-47 but is internally a substantially different design based on a short-stroke gas piston, which shares absolutely no parts with the Kalashnikov design - including the magazines

The vz. 58 is a selective fire gas-operated weapon that bleeds expanding combustion gases generated in the barrel from the ignited cartridge through a port drilled in the barrel, 215 mm (8.5 in) from the chamber, opening into a hollow cylinder located above the barrel that contains a short-stroke piston. The vz. 58 does not have a gas regulator and the full force of the gas pressure is exerted on the piston head, propelling it backwards in a single impulsive blow. The piston is driven back only 19 mm (0.7 in) when a shoulder on the piston rod butts against the seating and no further movement is possible. There is a light return spring held between the piston shoulder and the seating which returns the piston to its forward position. The gas cylinder is vented after the piston has traveled back 16 mm (0.6 in) and the remaining gases are exhausted into the atmosphere on the underside of the cylinder via two ports. The entire piston rod is chromium-plated to prevent fouling."

The vz. 58 (model 58) is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia and accepted into service in the late 1950s as the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58 (""7.62mm submachine gun model 1958""), replacing the vz. 52 self-loading rifle and the 7.62×25mm Tokarev vz. 24 and vz. 26 submachine guns.

The two PSA's are brand new and still have the factory grease on them and the M1A has about 300-400 rounds through it but looks brand new.  

Guns are as follows:

Gun #1:

PSA AR-15 chambered in 5.56/.223.  Gun has a 16"" barrel with a 12"" Midwest Industries SS free float rail with rail sections (in my opinion one of the best rails out there).  Gun has 3 rail sections on it and more can be purchased and added.  Gun also comes with a brand new in box Vortex Strikefire red/green dot (cost me almost $200) with mount and 2x doubler for added magnification.  The PSA has all Magpul furniture, including stock, grip, and triggerguard.  Gun also has a magpul foregrip.  Gun is brand new and never been fired.  I got this gun and it has just sat in the safe.  Comes with one Magpul 30 rd PMAG

Price - $1,000

Gun #2: SOLD SOLD

PSA AR-15.  Gun is identical to the above model except I put aluminum flip up front and rear sights on this gun and did not put a foregrip on it.  Gun is brand new as well.  Gun comes with a 30 rd PMAG.

Price - SOLD

Gun #3: SOLD SOLD

This is my baby.  Gun is a Springfield Armory M1A Loaded in a Juggernaut Bullpup Chassis chambered in 308/7.62x51.  Gun is amazingly accurate and is shorter than the above listed AR15's.  Balances amazingly well and has no recoil.  Fantastic gun.  If you are unfamiliar with the Juggernaut Chassis here is a link to it:

http://jtactical.com/product.php?product_id=2

As you can see it is an $875 option in addition to the $1600 M1A Loaded gun.

Gun comes with a 20 round mag and a 5 round mag if you want to hunt with it (actually makes for a great deer rifle and a great conversation piece around the camp fire).  If you want the Falcon Menace 3.5-18x56 illuminated scope and Burris PEPR add an additional $400 (this scope is no longer made and one of my favorites so I am happy to keep it).

Price is SOLD without scope and mount and SOLD with scope and mount.

Feel free to make offers...I may take some trades but really need cash to keep the wife happy.  I am NOT interested in Century AK47's.

May be interested in a nice Over/Under Shotgun.

The bolt release button is located under the rear of the stock well away from the trigger for added safety when unloading a live round from the chamber. Dual loading port doors and side loaded magazines provide for super fast reloading without the hassle and awkwardness associated with other pump shotguns.

OVERVIEW:
Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

KEY FEATURES:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
Sling swivel studs built-in
Includes Modified Rem Choke

508,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2490508,For Sale:  Bighorn Short Action (tactical),"Windsor Bear Arms, Fort Collins, Colorado","$ 1,199","Listed On: Monday, January 27, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a brand new Bighorn short Action Tactical model. It has the 8x40 base screw tapping.

Our Action Features

The Bighorn Arms action incorporates many simple ideas:

The action fits into standard Remington 700 stocks.
It uses any standard trigger that fits a Remington 700.
The sight bases sit on the same elevation to eliminate misalignment.
The bolt has a floating head so the lugs are always squarely in contact with the receiver and not affected by the alignment of the bolt body in the receiver.
The action also has a gas block to help prevent gases from a blown primer or case failure from reaching the shooter. This is especially important when the loading port is near the shooters face.
The materials used to machine and build the actions are aerospace quality.
The bolt head is carburized to maintain good core strength and high surface hardness to prevent galling on the lugs.
The bolt and bolt head have an NP3 finish, which is an electroless nickel-based finish that is Teflon impregnated.  This provides a smooth sliding bolt.
The rear tang was stiffened to support the heavier barrels.
The action is rigid in order to support the heavier barrels. To do this meant closing the action on the top; and on repeaters, removing less material on the bottom. (Closing the action on the top meant top loading of magazines was not possible).
We examined and tried many magazines and bottom metal:· The Surgeon bottom metal with the Accuracy International magazines was the top choice for the tactical .308/.260 market. These are available in 5 and 10 round capacities.
Some accessories that are handy and available:

The Picatinny rail with 20 MOA of angle. This rail extends forward of the action, allowing for some of the larger tactical scopes to be positioned forward providing the shooter more eye relief.
The action comes with 8-40 scope mount threads.  The 6-48 threads are available on the SR2.
The action is also available in a left-handed version or left-hand/right port and right-hand/left port.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh Walther PPK/S .22lr Pistols.  These iconic semi-auto pistols come with a 3.35” barrel, Black grip, and large 10-round magazine. This model also features a beautiful nickel finish.

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $379.00 (cash price).

Once in a great while, a firearm becomes so popular that it becomes a cultural icon. Like a great car or movie, a great firearm can become a true classic. The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. More than ever, the PPK is a statement of sophistication.

Developed in 1931, the Walther PPK continues to thrill the shooting public and the legend lives on. The PPK/S, with a longer frame for one additional cartridge, and the PPK are now both produced in the USA. Features of the PPK and PPK-S include a firing pin safety, manual safety with decocking function, double action and single action trigger and extended beaver tail.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh Walther PPK/S .22lr Pistols. These iconic semi-auto pistols come with a 3.35” barrel, Black grip, and large 10-round magazine. This model also features a beautiful nickel finish.

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $379.00 (cash price).

Once in a great while, a firearm becomes so popular that it becomes a cultural icon. Like a great car or movie, a great firearm can become a true classic. The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. More than ever, the PPK is a statement of sophistication.

Developed in 1931, the Walther PPK continues to thrill the shooting public and the legend lives on. The PPK/S, with a longer frame for one additional cartridge, and the PPK are now both produced in the USA. Features of the PPK and PPK-S include a firing pin safety, manual safety with decocking function, double action and single action trigger and extended beaver tail.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh Walther PPK/S .22lr Pistols. These iconic semi-auto pistols come with a 3.35” barrel, Black grip, and large 10-round magazine. This model also features a beautiful nickel finish.

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $379.00 (cash price).

Once in a great while, a firearm becomes so popular that it becomes a cultural icon. Like a great car or movie, a great firearm can become a true classic. The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. More than ever, the PPK is a statement of sophistication.

Developed in 1931, the Walther PPK continues to thrill the shooting public and the legend lives on. The PPK/S, with a longer frame for one additional cartridge, and the PPK are now both produced in the USA. Features of the PPK and PPK-S include a firing pin safety, manual safety with decocking function, double action and single action trigger and extended beaver tail.

Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius.
