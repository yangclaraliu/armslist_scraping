It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop. It is possible to tell if there is a round chambered by looking at the ""view hole"" next to the extractor."

As the title suggests, I'm selling my Sig Sauer P224 SAS in 9mm. It features a DA/SA trigger, hammer, and decocker. I've had it since July 2015 and intended on using it as a CCW. After carrying it for a few months, I decided that I'm not a fan of double stacked, compact handguns. I've fired 425 rounds (Yes. I count how many rounds I shoot.) through it and I've never had a single issue, as can only be expected from Sig. The sale will also include the original case, three 12 round magazines, and all original paperwork.
I'm also going to throw in an AlienGear Cloak Tuck 2.0 IWB holster. I bought it to use in conjuction with the P224, but I prefered a different holster instead. I wore it for about a week and placed it in my safe, where it's sat ever since. It will unclude the holster, and any and all spare tools/parts that originally came with the holster. I'm selling the two of them together for $750 OBO. 
I'm located in Yorkville, but willing to travel. If the buyer pays the full amount, then I will personally drive to the buyers house and hand deliver it, provided that the buyers house is <40 miles from my location, and the allotted 72 hour wait period has passed. I will also throw in 3 mags worth (36 rounds) of Winchester White Box 9mm JHP's if the buyer pays the full amount. Thanks for looking!"

I own 2 so I'm testing the waters with this one. It does NOT have the awful and infamous Taurus keyed action lock that comes on practically every gun they produce. Its a parkerized finish and comes with 2 magazines, 100rds of 124gr Winchester 9mm NATO (actual U.S military 9mm ammo) maybe some 124gr hollow points as well, and original box & paperwork (the case pictured stays with me). This is an excellent Beretta 92FS/ M9 replica with accessory rail and frame mounted safety/decococker meaning you can carry it ""cocked and locked"" safely unlike the Beretta... The beretta does not have a decococker and the safety is on the slide instead... Very un-ergonomic if you ask me. I was Military right out of high school, I know all about this platform. Not bragging though, just trying to be informative.They're not cheap knock offs like some people would try to make you believe. Taurus actually bought Beretta's Brazillian factory along with all the tooling and machinery. They also kept the experienced Beretta workers on payroll to continue making theirs. I honestly feel the Taurus is superior to the actual 92FS, but thats just my opinion. Like all Taurus firearms, this one comes with the best lifetime warranty in the game... Warranty is fully transferable, meaning it follows the life of the gun not just stuck with the original owner, which is me. If anything happens to it send it to Taurus in Florida and they will fix it or send you a brand new one."

T/C’s 5R rifling delivers superior accuracy by causing less bullet deformation, giving greater bullet stability over multiple shots. With an MOA accuracy guarantee, your Venture Predator is ready to take on predators from a distance. Size Matters. The Browning 1911-380 combines two of John M. Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved acccuracy. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort."

I bought it about it about 20 years ago from Krasne's Gun Shop in San Diego.  It has had at most 100 rounds through it. The bluing on the edges shows holster wear; however, the mechanical parts of the weapon are as new.I bought this weapon for self-protection because it so easily concealed. The advantage of the M8 is that the rounds are single-stacked in the magazine, making the handle of the weapon far narrower than it's sister, the M-13, which is double-stacked. Furthermore, the M-8 is lighter to carry than the M13, making it easier to retain in the waistband. I'm not knocking the M-13, I am explaining why I chose the M-8 over the M-13 at the time of purchase. Many people prefer higher capacity weapons; however, unless you are a law enforcement officer on the job, the chance of being in a gunfight requiring more than 9 rounds is nearly nonexistent. The accuracy this weapon provides out of a 4"" barrel is arguably second to none, further making more than 9 rounds unecessay. This weapon can be tucked anywhere on your waistband and be undetectable by anyone. There is sometimes confusion about the squeeze-cocker mistakenly being considered a safety; it is far more than a safety and in my opinion, it is the single most functional and coolest part of this weapon. When a round is chambered in this weapon, the hammer is always down, allowing the weapon to be carried in an extremely safe position. This is similar to a double/single action in which the hammer is also down when being carried. However, the huge difference is that on a double/single action, the first trigger pull is very long as the trigger cocks the hammer back and the subsequent trigger pulls are short. There is no doubt that without a huge amount of practice, having varying trigger pulls is a huge detraction to accuracy and a contributor to accidental discharges as the shooter gets trigger pressure readying for the second shot. For self-protection, it is doubtful more than 1 or 2 rounds will be fired before the imminent threat is defused; therefore, the accuracy of those first two rounds is critical, and to have varying trigger-pulls for the first two rounds in a high-stress situation is dangerous; it is dangerous to you because you lose accuracy on the first round, and it is dangerous to your bank account if the second round was unnecessary but accidentally discharged while getting trigger pressure for the second shot. When you draw the P-7, as you punch out to the target, your finger is on the trigger-guard and you are squeezing the squeeze-cocker. The ergonomics of the squeeze-cocker is so perfectly engineered and it feels so absolutely natural that it takes literally 10 minutes of practice to have it down. The squeeze-cocker is engineered, such that once it is depressed, you can almost let it go and it will not pop-back, meaning if necessary, you can easily adjust your grip without it snapping back to its original position. Because the squeeze-cocker pulls the hammer back, all trigger pulls are the same short pulls; there is no variation in trigger pull because it is not the trigger pulling the hammer back. Although the hammer is enclosed, HK engineered a pin that slides out of the back of the weapon so you can physically see that the hammer is pulled back.The P-7 has a recoil braking system using the discharge gasses so the recoil is very light. This P-7 is the later version with the index finger heat guard built onto the frame.I was a United States Border Patrol Agent for one year before resigning. During that one year, I carried this weapon concealed for my self-protection quite often. I later used my Border Patrol background to work part-time doing undercover armed security for 2 years. During that time, I carried this weapon on-duty, which is where the holster wear came from. I was never a sport shooter, so I only fired this weapon for qualifications for my firearms permit. That's why the round-count is so low.It comes with the original box and owner's manual. This is my favorite handgun of all time; however, divorce is forcing me to sell it immediately. My selling price appears to be very reasonable. It is for the guy that plans to shoot this weapon without being afraid to set it on the bench for fear of putting wear on a $2500 show-piece.  I need to net $1000 FIRM. I can ship it from my FFL to your FFL; however, shipping cost and FFL Ownership Transfer charges are the buyer's responsibility.Thanks for looking.Larry REDACTEDI was a United"

I've also installed a beavertail piece on the grip, which eliminates any possiblity of ""slide-bite"" , as well as slightly improving the grip angle (it takes all of 30 seconds to remove or install).I also have a spare recoil spring assembly for it  (which is never a bad thing to have on hand, for any semi-auto).The pistol is in virtually pristine condition, the only difference in this and a brand new one from a gunstore, is that someone else (me!) spent the money on a couple hundred break-in rounds. Price is $550, and obviously, no trade interests.Buyer must be non-felon,legal Georgia resident over age 21, WITH valid ID. I have my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go.Thanks for looking............M.  (edit: turns out I also have an IWB kydex holster for it.)P.S. almost forgot, I will not respond to brief, drive-by messages that say nothing but, ""do you still have it"", or, "" I would like to purchse it"", or, ""when can I view the gun"". Please say something that lets me know your a legitimate local buyer, not another scam-bot. Thanks again."

The grip diameter has been reduced, a slight right-hand palm swell has been added and overall weight reduced. The lighter weight results in increased comfort, control, quicker to the shoulder mounting, and faster target acquisition. The Mark V trigger has always been outstanding, and now we’ve made it even better with the introduction of the LXX Trigger. The engagement surfaces are precision ground and polished. Overall tolerances refined. A new, wider trigger face increases trigger-to-finger contact, all for a more consistent and comfortable pull. Adjustable down to 2.5 lbs., the new LXX™ Trigger will amaze you with every single round fired. The New Mark V rifles all come with our SUB-MOA accuracy guarantee. Our handlapped barrels ensure that the bullet’s flight path will be true and consistent and when combined with the enhanced shooter experience of the New Mark V, it is the best rifle you will ever purchase. Now, no matter which Weatherby® rifle you choose, whether it’s an Ultra Lightweight for sheep hunting in Alaska or an Accumark for whitetails in Texas, you can trust every shot will be right on the money - guaranteed."
