This rifle is created by Para USA (formerly Para Ordinance) and it is completely unique in the realm of AR15 platform rifle with its Delayed Impingement Gas System (DIGS).  This system allows for the only folding stock AR I have ever seen, as the recoil system is housed above the barrel.  YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS GUN WORKS AND WATCH IT FUNCTION BY GOING TO YOUTUBE.COM  AND TYPING “PARA USA” IN THE SEARCH WINDOW.  This will bring you to an amazing video showing how the gun field strips, and why it is the fastest, most accurate AR platform available. The DIGS system reduces recoil, getting you back on target much faster than the standard AR style rifles. The folding stock, when folded, reduces the overall length to 26.5”."

MOST of a mosin-nagant's collect-ability comes from:

1) The type of receiver it has (round or hexagonal)
2) The Armory it was made in (stamped on the top of the receiver)
3) The stamps on the top of the receiver.

Long story short, SHOW THE TOP OF THE RECEIVER in your ads. Or else us collectors don't know if you have the most common mosin ever made, or a rare/more desirable one.

Just a PSA. Attached is an image like the kind we're looking for. It shows the style of the receiver, the stamps, and the armory stamp. 

This is a 1943 Hex from the Tula armory (symbolized by the star), which is VERY rare as hex receivers had been phased out by then, thus this oddity was likely built from leftover/spare parts. But thats beside the point. Without this image/information, the seller might only be able to get $100 for the rifle. I'd pay $200-$250 for it depending on the condition of the rest of it. THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT. 

This will make selling it easier for you, and buying it easier for us."

Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode.

It is semi-automatic striker fired, polymer frame with stainless steel slide and barrel.  It is double-action only with no external safety or magazine disconnect, but it does have a very long, smooth trigger pull.  The capacity is 6+1.  

This includes the handgun with original box, paperwork, and trigger lock, along with an extra six round magazine, two Pearce Grip magazine extensions (for comfort only, doesn't add additional capacity), and an installed Talon Grips textured grip.  I'm also including a very well broken-in black leather OWB holster, the two original grip floor plates, and around 50 rounds of 9mm ammo (mix of Winchester FMJ and Hornady Critical Defense) in a 100 round ammo case.

This gun is extremely reliable and hasn't jammed on me once in the roughly 400 rounds that I've put through it.  It has a total length of less than 6 inches, and an unloaded weight of 14 ounces, making it ideal for concealed carry.  I've carried it in an OWB holster covered by nothing more than a t-shirt and it doesn't print unless I'm bending down.

I could go on and on about how much I have enjoyed this gun, but really, don't take my word for it.  Google it and read the reviews that other people have given it.  It's a real challenge to find anything negative about this firearm.

Asking $350 for the entire package.  I'm in Eugene, but I have business as far north as Portland in the week before x-mas."

From LWRCI:
""The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.""

Will pay up to $150 for a stripped or $300 for a complete lower. Cash in hand.

I also have for trade an m1887 Husqvarna Nagant Swedish revolver with a fair value of $450-500 that I would trade outright for a complete lower with a good trigger, stock, and name brand receiver. Or for three stripped lowers. I would do a partial trade for less value lowers with cash on your end. The revolver can be seen here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/2454266/seattle-washington-handguns-for-sale--m1887-husqvarna-swedish-nagant-revolver

Send me a picture of your lower with brand, trigger type, etc., and I will send you a cash offer. I will travel within Snohomish County to pick up it up or we can meet at the Norpoint shooting range here in Arlington. (Preferred)"

EMERGENCY OFF GRID 12Volt BATTERY BANK SOLAR POWER SUPPLY

2000watts (4600watt Maximum) NEW - NEVER USED EQUIPMENT (Only Hooked Up To Charge!)

HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT TODAY (27 Dec 13), SOME PARTS OF THE DETROIT AREA HAVE BEEN WITHOUT POWER FOR 4+ DAYS NOW?  TORONTO HAVE BEEN DOWN FOR 48+ HOURS!  THIS IS A NO BRAINER FOR ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE!  HOW WILL YOU SURVIVE IF IT HAPPENS TO YOUR FAMILY RIGHT NOW?

Complete, Ready For Immediate Power!  Cash and Carry

100% MORE IMPORTANT IN WINTER then all your guns and Amm0 in the world is heat for any Bug 0ut Survival.  Imagine today that you lose power.  How are you going to keep warm?  Burning wood is a beaker that can be seen for miles.  Without heat, more people will freeze to death then your guns can ever protect you from.  So if you think guns are your #1 needed protection item, you are 100% wrong in the dead of winter!    This power bank can help keep you warm during our below freezing temp's...

This Backup Battery Power Bank was designed to work as a Off Grid electrical system that you can use 24/7.  Imagine having your own, self generating electrical supply in your basement or garage!  This is a Complete Stand Alone setup, that is generating via Solar Panel (10watt).  I will include a brand new Battery Charger.

Package consists of:

4 - 12 Volt Marine Deep Cell Everstart MAXX Batteries (Brand New & Fully Charged) (90ah each)
1 - 2000 Watt (4600w Surge) Power Inverter New (3 Plug, Self Resetting, In Box)

1 - 10 Watts Solar Panel (New Never Used)
Includes All Handmade Custom Terminal Connections (MegaRare Specialty 0 AWG Gauge - the Ultimate Wiring that has No Loss/Stepping Down of Power)  No need to buy the Ultra Best custom wiring and ends, and make them yourself.

I made several New Backup Power Battery Banks for my families, and have this one extra; which I am offering here.  Imagine the peace of mind you will have knowing that once the power goes down, that you and your family will still be able to have electrical power!  In the Winter, you need these to KEEP YOU WARM!  No Power = No Heat!  You can plug in your Home Electronic Power Plug(s) into this Setup, which then Converts Power into Home Voltage!

You can plug in just about every home electronic device (Heater, Lights, TV, Computer, Microwave, etc.)  This will handle MORE electricity then what is on 1 Power Strip; with Max Surges that can handle over 2+ Power Stripes=Power!)

If you have a cabin up north, or a building (barn) without any power lines, or camping out of doors, this can easily be moved so you have power everywhere you go!

LIFE SAVING INFO:

NOTE:  I am offering here a Brand New (Unused) 4 Battery Bank (each 900+AH Marine Deep Cell), that can handle 2000 Watts to & 4600w Surges!  This means your total electrical load on this system is more then what a Power Strip can handle.  You can not run an entire household at one time, but it will supply backup power to all your items up to that wattage at one time.  It will handle a small heater, several lights, a computer, TV, microwave, and several smaller items at one time.  YOU CAN NOT use car batteries-they were not built for power storage!

This seriously can and will be a lifesaver!  If you do not plan ahead of time, you will NOT survive any upcoming disaster.  Don't you owe it to yourself and the protection of your loved ones to at least be somewhat prepared?  There are no do over's in life (or this disaster), and once it is announced, it will 100% be TO LATE for you and your family to prepare or protect yourselves.  Why not be in the top 1% who PLAN AHEAD.

With it now being Winter, how are you going to keep your loved ones warm when the power goes out?  Remember, NO POWER = NO heat, NO lights, NO gas (pumps don't work), NO money (banks & tellers down), NO food (stores closed), etc...  Can your family live life for 3 days without any of these?  Now how about 7 days...  Now do you understand how this CAN AND WILL SAVE YOUR LIVES?  Do not take it for granted it will always be available because IT WILL NOT!

If YOU don't do anything to protect yourself from a LIFE OR DEATH situation, who else will?   Don't blame anyone but yourself because you took life 100% for granted, and think that no disaster can ever happen to you.  Remember Katrina and all the people at the Superdome, and New Jersey?  Imagine a like disaster scale in Milwaukee; in the dead of winter yet...  Maybe if you plan now, you give them that chance...

ALL FTF firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

The M1911A1 established the features that characterize virtually every variant produced since. It featured an extended grip safety, a clearance cut on the frame behind the trigger, a knurled and arched mainspring housing, a knurled and shortened trigger, and wider front sight.
Modern M1911s have for the most part returned to the longer trigger and flat mainspring housing, while further enlarging the ejection port and drastically modifying the grip safety to let the pistol ride lower in the hand, enhancing control by redirecting recoil forces. The M1911A1 pistol served as the standard handgun for the U.S. military until 1983, when the 9mm M9 pistol was adopted"

The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state.[3] The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.

This pistol is Used. I guess it has had no more than 100 rounds through it. No problems works great."

The pistol is finished off with presentation walnut double diamond grips. This full sized, long slide pistol is a full sized frame and 6"" stainless steel match bushing barrel.

The grip is blended in with a slim competition speed chute, for smooth, quick magazine changes. The front strap checkering is a special checkering we worked with Vic Tibbets to implement.

If you wish to buy/trade for this weapon you are agreeing you can legally own a firearm in the state of Oregon. I will also be checking the persons drivers license to make sure they are an Oregon resident. I also have 300 rounds of quality FMJ that I would like to sell with this weapon.

I would like to sell this shotgun to help pay for other projects that I have going on right now, as I do not really use this firearm. I have test fired it to make sure everything works as it should (shoots and cycles correctly). The shotgun has a 3"" chamber, Made in USA, and holds 4+1 rounds. As you can see from the pictures, it  does have some surface scratches and scuffs on it. If you are interested, please email me, I will also need to see a valid Wisconsin drivers license or Conceal Carry Permit upon transaction. I will not ship the firearm or do an out of state transaction. I am also open to trades, just shoot me an offer of what you've got and I will consider (especially a Mosin Nagant). Shoot me an offer of what you would pay for it, I will consider. If you prefer, you can also text me at two6two-five65-eight10four Thanks, -Ryan"
