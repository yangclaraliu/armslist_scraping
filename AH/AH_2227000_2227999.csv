I am in the market for a full size Smith and Wesson M&P in 9mm or .40 (though 9 is preferred I have no issue with .40), WITH OUT AN EXTERNAL THUMB SAFETY. I recently purchased  an M&P and did not like the safety on it at all, but loved the gun itself. Hence my searching for a new one. I am on a bit of a budget but if you are fair with me, I will be fair to you. No lowballing. Please be a legal Oregon resident, with no criminal record. 

Thank you!"

Above are 2 links to the item I have for sale/trade. The first link is to the website itself and the second link is to the only AX556 lower that I have seen on gunbroker so far. I am wanting to deal locally so that is why I am listing it on armslist but if I dont get the deal that I want I will list it on gunbroker. This is an almost complete lower for sale, minus the trigger because I was planning on getting a Geissele but ran out of money. If you look at my images of the lower you will see I have the custom full auto markings on the lower which will cost you an extra $50 from the factory. Go to the AXTS website and you will see how nice the lower really is and how much work they put into this. The reason the lower is fully ambidextrous is they incorporated a pin the when you press the magazine realease button it also pushes up on the bolt catch so you can lock the bolt to the rear. I have also put on the foliage green magpul UBR stock, a spikes tactical ST-T2 buffer with a red springco buffer spring. It also comes with a magpul MIAD in Foliage green and the Battle Arms Development ambidextrous safety selector. I got the 90 degree selector because it is just more comfortable to me. So the price I am looking at selling the lower for complete is $1000.00. Yes that is the price and I am will to negotiate a little but not much. Also if you want the lower stripped and have nothing but a basic lower parts kit installed, which means I will take off the UBR stock and the buffer and spring on keep the safety selector and miad grip and include a basic A2 grip then I will sell the lower for $600. Yes I know what the price is on their website but I also know that there is a wait and it doesnt come with some of the parts that will be included or the custom markings. Let me know what you guys think."

They are manufactured with the same quality and standards you would expect from Beretta. If you're not familiar with Stoeger Cougars research the user opinions and you tube videos that are everywhere online, you will only find very positive reviews. These pistols are built solid like a tank, very dependable, last forever, and do not jam and misfire. They are easily one of the best pistols I have fired!

The modern Sig Sauer pistol story began with the P220. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45's right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220R features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear resistant Nitron finish, lightweight alloy frame with M1913 Picatinny rail, and the Sig Sauer four point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector."

Both of these pistols make great conceal carry guns, the P-11 being particularly well suited for pocket carry.
I am looking to trade for something sub-compact in .40 S&W. I am most interested in a Glock 27 or S&W Shield 40. Might also consider a sub-compact Springfield XD, or other firearms of similar size and quality in .40 S&W.
Please note that I DO NOT HAVE CASH. Do not ask for both of these firearms and cash on top, because you will not get any. I am simply looking to do a straight-across trade. Also please note that this listing is for the Wichita area- if you live in a different city, you will have to come here.

More popularly called the ""Model 12"".  This shotgun is a 16 gauge and comes with a non-vent rib plain barrel in Full Choke.  The barrel is 26 inches long.  

This gun is considered to be a Standard Grade with a plain walnut pistol-grip stock with a grooved slide handle.

It has a serial number of 438XX and was produced in 1914.

The gun is well used.  The finish on the metal is worn.  The bluing on the barrel is probably 50% or less and the finish on the receiver is 0%.  The gun, at one time, had surface rust on the receiver and breech end of the barrel but was removed.  The stock is in pretty fair condition considering a well used 99 year old gun but does show some evidence of oiling.  

Mechanically, everything seems to work well but could benefit from a good cleaning.

This is far from a museum quality collectors piece but is still a mechanically sound shotgun that could serve someone well for years to come or for someone needing a 16 gauge Model 12 just to have.  

I am saying the gun is in fair to good condition so I am asking $600.00

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever

USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device
USP Variants:
Variant 1:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Variant 2:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on right side of frame.

Variant 3:  Double action/single action without ""SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on left side of frame.

Variant 4:  Double action/single action without ”SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on right side of frame.

Variant 5:  Double action only with ”SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety) on left side of frame.

Variant 6:  Double action only with ”SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety) on right side of frame.

Variant 7:  Double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever)

Variant 8:  Double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever) SPECIAL VARIANT FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY

Variant 9:  Double action/single action with control lever (manual safety/no decocking function) on left side of frame.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes

748,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2227748,For Sale:  S&W Model 17 (no dash) 4 screw .22 LR revolver,"Hickory, Hickory / Lenoir, North Carolina",$ 550,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 16, 2013",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"WTS - S&W Model 17 no dash 4-screw .22 LR revolver. I bought this a while ago to get the custom N-frame target stocks someone had put on it, but it is an extra for me otherwise. Very good condition. Realistically retains 95% of original blue, but is a bit less than what one might call a 95% gun (but much better than 90%). The streakiness you see in the photos is oil, not in the finish. Has non-matching K-frame Magna stocks on it. Also has a trigger shoe with an adjustable trigger stop on it (came to me that way). Has scattered wear and scratches - the worst being some muzzle wear and other high edge wear, some grip wear on the left frame, and some scratches on the right of the barrel. Also has some scattered freckling, the worst being on the right frame and one side of the cylinder (see pic). The pic makes it look worse than it is, which I did on purpose. I angled it so the lighting really made the freckling pop out in the pic, but in hand it is much less noticeable. In regular light, you really don't see it at all. It shows most in sunlight. I'm guessing it was left sitting for a time on a surface that held enough moisture to freckle that side. With all that said, it is a nice looking gun, though in shooter grade condition.

Mechanics are in nice shape. Carry up is spot-on. There is no endshake. With the trigger unpulled, it has a bit of sideplay in the normal range for a gun of this era. The sideplay tightens up considerably with the trigger pulled, as in firing. Very smooth double action pull and a crisp, very nice single action trigger break. It has been shot enough to put light cartridge marks on the recoil shield, but will serve someone well for many years to come.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The serial number is 158XX which puts production in the late 1920's probably 1927 or 1928 maybe.  The rifle is in pretty good condition for its age.  

The bluing is turning brown on the barrel and receiver and is worn on the magazine tube.  The barrel is 24 inches long.

The wood is in fair shape considering this was probably someone's meat gun during the depression.  There is evidence of some oiling.  There is a small place on the stock that looks like it was carved out with a knife for some reason on the top near the receiver.

Mechanically, the rifle seems to be in excellent condition but would benefit from a good cleaning.

I am saying this gun is in fair to good condition or a little better so I am asking $500.

We will have quite a bit of 22lr, but we don't count on it lasting very long!!

We will have:

Remington Thunderbolt - Bricks of 500 rounds

Aguila Standard Velocity - Bricks of 500 rounds

Aguila Super Max 30gr HP - Bricks of 500 rounds

Aguila Golden Eagle Target - Bricks of 500 rounds

Our prices will be based on a medium ground between places like Midway USA, that are completely out of everything, and Gunbroker, where people are willing to pay $60-$70/brick for some of the Aguila stuff, and $50/brick for the Remington Thunderbolt.

Our prices will already have tax figured into them, they will also not have any additional charges tacked onto them for using a credit card.

We will not be limiting individuals on their purchases. So if someone wants to spend $1000 on however many bricks they can get for that amount we will let them. 

If you want to contact me and have some set to the side for you because you can't make it Saturday, but you can make it Sunday, I will be more then happy to do that, but if you aren't there by at least 1pm Sunday, then the ammo will be placed back on the table.

With Christmas here, bills piling up, and needing to downsize my collection, I am letting this beauty go. My loss, your gain! This is a WONDERFUL gun, that has never jammed, or given me one moment of trouble. I had it listed originally for $340 (with everything included), but am reducing it to $300 to sell it quickly.

If you are looking for an UltraCompact weapon for self protection, something to carry in your vehicle, or a powerful weapon that is easy to handle...this is YOUR GUN! It has a pussycat recoil, and will out shoot a Glock 30 everyday of the week!

I am NOT looking to trade, nor will I accept any less. This gun is in pristine condition, and fired less than 100 times. The ammo and holsters themselves cost over $70!
