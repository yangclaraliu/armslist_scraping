It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

(In buying and selling guns, I end up with ammo that I am unsure about, so I pull the bullets and dump the powder)  The live primers are probably still good, but I make no guarantee.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.

I am currently selling a 2014 Armasight Vampir 4x CORE Weapon Sight along with an Armasight IR810W Wide-Range Angle Adjustable Long Range Infrared Illuminator.

The scope has a quick release mounting system so you can zero it in and then remove it and put it back on, when needed. 

NOTE: You can NOT buy these scopes yet.  I actually have a close friend that works for Armasight and that is how I got it.  However, since I just purchased one of their Thermal scopes so I no longer have any need for this one. 

This scope is NEW CORE technology which means you don't have to worry about only placing it on lower caliber rifles like .223 and lower.   You can put it on 243, 308, 270, 30-06, 300, etc., and it will maintain zero and works great.

Research more on CORE technology for night vision and you will see what I mean.  Also right now Armasight offers the ""Spark"" which is a hand-held monocular.  Look that up and you will see all the amazing reviews it has.  Now imagine that in a scope with 4x magnification. :)

Please text me at REDACTED if you have any questions.

Below is some information I pulled off of the web to explain more about CORE technology:

CORE image intensifier technology in its brandnew line of Generation 1+ night vision equipment. The latest breakthrough in the electro optical manufacturing engineering has contributed to the development of affordable high performance CORE (Ceramic Optical Ruggedized Engine) Image Intensifier Tubes.

Unlike Gen 1 Image intensifier tubes, fragile by a virtue of being made from glass, CORE IITs are built up just like Gen 2 and Gen 3 by means of fusion of metal alloys with ceramic compounds. The CORE technology has resulted the optimal solution in the production of robust night vision weapon sights for restricted budgets The CORE image intensifier tube will also remain shock-proof against middle-size calibers. Big game hunting and other professional activities become available to many with the affordable CORE night vision technology nowadays. These tubes provide for superior image quality because their photocathodes feature the sensitivity of up to 350 mcA/lm. This is twice as much as the regular Gen 1 photocathodes output. The improved light amplification is backed up with two times increased image resolution - a CORE tube features up to 60 lp/mm resolution; and this performance level makes the CORE tubes peer rival to the existing commercial Gen 2+ image tubes.

2+ generation is primarily used by professional applications. Generation 2+ is primarily used by professional applications. This is because the cost of a 2nd gen unit is approximately € 500.00 to € 1000.00 more then a 1st gen NVD. The main difference between the 1st and the 2nd generation unit is the addition of a micro-channel plate, commonly referred to as a MCP. The MCP works as an electron amplifier and is placed directly behind the photocathode. The MCP consists of millions of short parallel glass tubes. When the electrons pass through these short tubes, thousands more electrons are released. This extra process allows the 2nd generation units to amplify the light many more times than 1st generation provides, which gives you a brighter and sharper image of the night vision scene, also in the very dark environments.

The 3rd generation is the latest technology level in the night vision industry. By adding a more sensitive chemical compound, gallium arsenide (GaAs), to the photocatnode, you get a brighter and sharper image in the end. The GaAs tube“sees” better in the darker environments, and the light amplification for the light gain many times higher than a common Generation 2+ intensifier tube affords (65,000 as compared to the Gen+ gain of 35,000). So that even in the scarcely lit environments you will enjoy a bright image of the viewed scene which your naked eye would see as a common dark “nothing”. Consequently, 3rd Gen NVD is by price vastly more expensive than an NVD of the 1st or 2nd generation. Typically a 3rd generation unit bids from € 3,000.00 and more. In the past twenty years such technologies were only available to the armed forces, the navy and the swat teams. Nowadays, they are accessible for civil professional users, too. To enable the Gen HD and Gen 3 tubes working asset in full, we have selected a number of the models of NVD’s that excel in the prime quality materials, versatile and ergonomic design of the body and electronics, and high-precision optical construction. Installed in such NVD models, the HD and Gen 3 tubes deploy their best virtues, relevant to the chosen professional applications. Outstanding Gen HD and Gen 3 night vision monoculars, night vision goggles and night vision binoculars will let you see farther the images of larger depth pitch, also under more adverse viewing conditions or even in the total darkness, and will stay faultlessly on the go for continuous hours of use."

  I've been away at the Colorado School of Trades where I graduated the Gunsmithing program with honors. I am a professionally trained gunsmith who specializes in Stockmaking for bolt action, single shot and lever action rifles. While I love helping a Customer create a one of a kind rifle I also possess other skills that I feel folks should be aware of. 

  The service I offer is the complete disassembly, cleaning, oiling and assembling of all types of firearms. The fee is 60$ for all standard factory rifles and pistols.

  For certain types of firearms, like Browning's Auto 5 and other similar designs with exceptionally small screw slots, or Purdy Shotguns, or even Colt Pythons, Additional charges will be applied due to the necessity to manufacture new screwdrivers in house to perfectly fit these screws. All services will be accomplished with absolutely no damage to the firearm. All firearms will be Cleaned then assembled to factory specs with synthetic lubricants provided by Tetra Gun Oils.

 If stock adjustments are needed or a new recoil pad is needed I will offer this service for 60$. The  new pad will be purchased in advance by the customer before work is done. 

If a diagnosis is needed for a firearm  I will be happy to look at it and help you find a solution. This service is 20$

If research is needed on a given firearm or product the charge is 30$ per hour. 

Dead on arrival firearms will not be accepted for a cleaning or work without first discussing a path to resolution. Firearms that fail safety checks will also not be accepted for cleaning services.

I am not liable for any damages to your firearm after initial inspection has taken place with the customer present. This means that after the firearm is disassembled and a broken part is found the customer will be immediately notified with the discovery, possible repairs and any immediate cost change. 

Scope mounting service will be 50$ this includes Truing of the rings, and lapping of the rings and a rough bore sighting. This will ensure even pressure along the scope tube for less scope fatigue over time. This is recommended for high power rifles and magnum pistols.


The shop charges  60$ an hour for labor and 30$ per hour for research and the tax is already included in the final price. 

Any damaged screws will be repaired for free and the initial inspection is free if work is to be performed. If a screw is completely unsalvageable then the customer will be notified and a new screw can be made to fit the firearm. 

All parts and accessories received with the firearm will be returned to the customer. All firearms are expected to be brought in unloaded with the actions open. If a stuck LIVE cartridge is in the firearm, than it will be brought to my attention immediately and left in a case or range bag until it is in my hands. All inspections will be with the customer present and only takes a few minutes. Any malfunctions or damages to the firearm will be noted on the repair invoice and any quote made on the services will be on the invoice. Once the customer signs the invoice the price is set in stone unless additional repairs are needed once the firearm is disassembled. The customer will always be notified first for any repair, or adjustment and all work is 100% warranted in my shop. Mis use is not covered. 


I look forward to providing you with a professional service . God bless and Happy Shooting"

There may be a small percentage of brass picked up at the range that may or may not have been previously reloaded.  There may also be a small percentage that has been de-primed or that has live primers. (In buying and selling guns, I end up with ammo that I am unsure about, so I pull the bullets and dump the powder)  The live primers are probably still good, but I make no guarantee.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.
