It is a very tight gun with no play between the receivers. Great buffer spring and tube, you can barely hear/feel the action during the shot. It's a very good setup for playing around at the range or hunting. I am no sniper by any means, but I can consistently hit a 12"" steel plate at 300yds every time and with low wind I can hit a target at 600yds with proper compensation for bullet drop and distance.

I have a Core 15 complete upper chambered in .300 AAC Blackout -  7.62×35mm.     

NEVER FIRED!!

This upper will mount on any standard AR-15 Lower and uses the same magazines as a .223/5.56mm rifle.   What this means is that if you have an .223/5.56mm AR, you can pull the two takedown pins, snap on the .300 upper and end up with everything the AR is known for - an accurate, reliable, lightweight assault weapon, but with a much heavier payload (115gr) and the stopping power that goes with it.   Excellent for medium to heavy game (large deer, elk, wild boar).   I built one using the same upper and it's a 1 MOA rifle that my 10 year old shoots with ease.  He's GOOD too!

The revolver comes with the original wood grips shown in one of the pictures as well as the hogue grips. Any grips for the 686 also fit this revolver. This was a police issue in Canada and thus has the markings on the barrel. This is an older Smith so no internal lock nonsense. Very smooth and tight operation."

This rifle has all kinds of premium build items. Nothing cheap on this rifle except the Red Dot Site and flashlight. Everything is else is high end AR parts. 

I am looking to sell because I am wanting to buy a Tavor. I have other AR's and this one is one of my lesser premium builds. In todays prices I have over $1700 invested. Willing to sell at a loss. I will list whats included and the prices that you can buy them for today to show the value of this rifle.

DPMS Base Rifle $800
Swap Spikes Tactical Lower with CMMG Parts Kit (add about $30, only because thats the difference between the DPMS lower and parts kit vs what I used)
Mil-Spec buffer Tube (included in base rifle price)
PSA A2 Buffer (I used this because its a little heavier than a carbine buffer so it reduces recoil slightly, helped with longer range accuracy) ($30)
Magpul OD Green CTR Stock ($80)
Magpul Grip with grip storage ($20)
Magpul OD Green Trigger Guard ($10)
Midwest Industries Gen 2 SS 12"" OD Green Free Float Rail system (Free float increases accuracy due to no strain on the barrel) Aluminum reduces weight and increases strength. ($190)
Magpul RSA (Rail Sling Adapter) ($24)
Buffer Tube dual point sling adapter ($15)
Magpul Black RVG (Rail Vertical Grip) ($25)
Troy Medieval Muzzle Brake (Decreases flash and recoil, adds a strike face for CQB) ($45)
Magpul MBUS Front Site OD Green ($50)
The Coolest addition, they said it couldn't be done. I added a tritium AR front site post to the Magpul MBUS. So now you have the tritium night site ability in a Magpul MBUS. The ultimate in night fighting ($50)
Primary Arms Red Dot site with quick release base ($80)
Midwest Industries flip up rear site ($70)
BCM Gunfighter Model 3 Charging Handle with medium latch ($45)
UTG 200 Lumen light with light mount on right side ($80) This is also not a premium item, I swapped out my Surefire light and put this one on here. I wanted to keep the Surefire, but this works just fine as well.
DPMS MPI Mil Spec BCG with Spikes Tactical Enhance ejector/extractor (only adding the $15 it cost for the enhance extractor mod, since the BCG came with the base rifle)

All of this adds up to $1660 that is today's prices. I have more due to buying some during panic prices and other details. This doesn't include shipping or taxes on anything as well as labor for installation. This is a hell of a rifle, with all premium parts. Consideration was given to making this an awesome shooter, lightweight and still be capable of giving an edge to anyone using the rifle in defense of life as well.

I called Glock and had them give me the DOB of the gun: Dec. 29? 1993

Because it is 20 years old this firearm obviously has seen some wear and the polymer frame shows it as well as the slide. HOWEVER there are no cracks in the polymer and the slide finish has zero rust or other serious issues!

This is just a well used Glock that has proven itself for 20 years and will still go bang every single time! I will gladly send more detailed pics of the frame/slide"

It is a very tight gun with no play between the receivers. Great buffer spring and tube, you can barely hear/feel the action during the shot. It's a very good setup for playing around at the range or hunting. I am no sniper by any means, but I can consistently hit a 12"" steel plate at 300yds every time and with low wind I can hit a target at 600yds with proper compensation for bullet drop and distance. It's an awesome rifle, but I don't use it much and looking to add a lighter rifle to the collection.

Comes with one 20rd Pmag, it fits better when you're shooting from a bench.

Description
The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their
protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Long Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo
Gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

I have for sale a used, but good condition, Beretta PX4 Storm Compact 9mm.  It comes with the box and 2 15 round magazines.  Somehow I ended up with 2 of them and one needs to go.  

The firearm is very reliable.  I have had it out to the range on several occasions and I have put around 400 rounds through it with no issues.  Feels great in the hand and is extremely accurate and easy to shoot.  The rotating barrel makes for quick followup shots.  I have been carrying one of these more than my Glock 19 and while it does weigh 2-3 ounces more, I hardly notice it.  Crossbreed holster makes carry easy and convenient.  

If interested, please give me a call.  You must have a lifetime carry permit or we can do transfer at FFL.  In any event, bill of sale will be done.  Asking $500.  I am not interested in any trades right now and I am firm on the price.  Thank you for your time and have a good night.  Don, REDACTED call/text.  Yes, I am local."

This upper will mount on any standard AR-15 Lower and uses the same magazines as a .223/5.56mm rifle.   What this means is that if you have an .223/5.56mm AR, you can pull the two takedown pins, snap on the .300 upper and end up with everything the AR is known for - an accurate, reliable, lightweight assault weapon, but with a much heavier payload (115gr) and the stopping power that goes with it.   Excellent for medium to heavy game (large deer, elk, wild boar).   I built one using the same upper and it's a 1 MOA rifle that my 10 year old shoots with ease.  He's GOOD too!

745,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2703745,For Sale:  Barrett/Swarovski HABICHT 10x42,"South west Montana, Montana, United States",$ 975,"Listed On: Sunday, February 16, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling a Barrett Swarovski HABICHT .50bmg rated 10x42 ranging reticle scope. This scope was made in Austria by Swarovski. The scope originally came to me as part of a package with my Barrett 82a1. It has been used at the range 1 time with only 15rds of 50bmg fired through the rifle while using it. After that it became a safe queen. 

This scope is the one that had the Christmas tree ranging reticle pattern. The ranging reticle was designed so that the shooter could aim at different targets at multiple ranges without having to adjust the elevation on the scope. The reticle acquired its name because the reticle is shaped similarly to a Christmas tree. The reticle is used with the trunk serving as the center of the target while the branches of different widths and heights serve as range and windage markers. It is a 10 power scope and the scope's ranges are from 500 to 2000m. 

The scope comes complete with the rings that came from the Barrett factory. I believe these are the Barrett factory 30mm adjustable rings. The scope also has a built in eyepiece buffer safety which the Swarovski factory manual refers to as a ""Telescopic recoil dampening of the eye-shield."" Also included are the Barrett lens covers; Swarovski factory manual and original Swarovski factory lens cleaning cloth with eagle imprint. 

It is in pristine condition and I am selling it for $975.00 shipped or OBO. 

Payment to be made in the form of United States Postal Money orders. If purchased at the full price of $975.00 I will pay for shipping, handling, and insurance. All others will pay exact shipping and insurance costs. 

All sales are final if you have questions please ask before buying. Although scope is in Excellent near NIB status scope is sold as is with no warranty by me."

I have tried to take pictures of two of those spots, the third spot was too small to get a picture.  That smaller spot looks like rust and it is barely bigger than a BB.  It appears that the two bigger spots were two areas of surface rust that were sanded down, but I am not certain about that.  One is the size of a quarter, the other is the size of a dime.

Century Arms Import. Has a FR 44 which stands for field repair 1944 on the left side of the receiver. If you know about scrubs they were early British made rifles used by the Brits in India than later sold to the Indian Forces. After the war and the British lost power in India, the India Army scrubbed the British Markings from the receiver and barrels and put a screw in the stock to match the no.1 MKIII they were producing. 

This rifle has the screw, but it serves no purpose unlike the Indian rifles. All matching numbers besides the magazine. The serial number is pretty low for a mass produced war rifle. Metal is in good shape, besides minor pitting on the left side of receiver. This rifle still has Brit markings on the barrel. The bore has strong rifling. This rifle is a great shooter.

also includes original cardboard box, papers and lock. perfect for home defense and other applications where you would need the length of an sbr but the power, and magazine capacity of a fullsize rifel . the stg is 28 inches long the length of a short barreled ar-15.
this is a sweet rifle and the best part is that you can buy a spare for just about any part other than the receiver.

Manufacturers Part# 31524
Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight."

The Coast HP6 High Performance LED Flashlight is a great choice for those who want a bright flashlight with a slim profile. A quick cycle switch allows you to select between a high output setting of 170 lumens or a low output of 34 lumens allowing you to choose the right level for your application. The Pure Beam Focusing Optic System with Slide Focus Control provides superior beam consistency from spot to flood, with no dark rings typically associated with focusing flashlights. The Bulls Eye spot beam pattern gives you a great focused spot with a maximum beam distance of 104 meters (341 feet), while producing an outer ring of flood light which allows you to see a broader area to the sides. Our Beam Lock System allows users to easily lock in their desired beam. Built tough, an impact-resistant, lightweight aluminum casing resists rust and corrosion. The HP6 also features an unbreakable LED and rubberized O-ring for reliable water resistance and durability. Backed by Coast's lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.

It appears that the two bigger spots were two areas of surface rust that were sanded down, but I am not certain about that.  One is the size of a quarter, the other is the size of a dime.  The barrel is in Muskogee.  I'd like to sell it--make an offer."
