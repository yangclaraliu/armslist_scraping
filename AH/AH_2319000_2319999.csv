This was a PI trade in.  The weapon has seen some duty use and has the wear on the outside to prove it, hence the low asking price.  The night sights are dim but function fine in normal lighting conditions.  V3 means it is an SA/DA w/ decocker.  I got a deal on a pair of these and sold one already.  I intended to keep this one, it is the nicer of the two.  I just purchased a new Glock and would like to free up some cash to cover that expense.

Ruger SR22P Compact 22LR Semi Auto Pistol, Purple & Black, 10 Rounds, 2 Magazines


Packed with versatile features, the SR22® is lightweight (just 17.5 ounces) and perfect for just about anything - plinking, target shooting and even small game hunting. It is easy to field strip, fun to shoot, and will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition (not just high-velocity ammunition).


Features:


The SR22 has light double-action and crisp single-action trigger pulls. Its external hammer is designed with a rounded spur for easy cocking and single-action shooting. The SR22 features a polymer frame and two interchangeable (no tools required) rubberized grips with angled serrations, allowing shooters to select either a slim or wider palm swell option. The aerospace-grade aluminum slide has serrations on both front and rear for better grip and slide manipulation. The easy-to-use underside Picatinny rail features multiple cross slots for variable mounting of most popular accessories.


The 3-dot sight system has a fixed front sight and a rear sight that is adjustable for both windage and elevation. A reversible blade allows shooters to select two white dots or a solid black blade. Other SR22 features include a stainless steel replaceable barrel, an ambidextrous manual thumb safety/decocking lever, ambidextrous magazine release, plus a visual inspection port to determine the load status of the pistol. The SR22 includes two finger grip extension floorplates that can be added to the magazine for comfort and grip. Each SR22 is also shipped with two 10-round magazines and a soft case.

This ammo has more feet pounds of energy and a higher velocity than the current loadings by the bigger manufacturers. I would advise against using this in smaller pistols or using this to train new shooters since this is loaded to near .41 Magnum specifications. Most modern 10mm is loaded to the same power as .40S&W, this DoubleTap is what 10mm was originally designed to be.

This is older stock that I bought for my Bren Ten several years ago, it's mostly 180gr JHP in plain 50 round boxes. I'm asking $50 per box, have up to 20 available (1000 rounds). If you're not happy with pricing feel free to make offers if you're willing to buy that same day. Worst I can do is say no. All deals will be in the quiet suburbs outside Baltimore.

Not to mention M2 mags being more expensive. The PPQ M1 will take SW99 mags, Baby Desert Eagle mags and P99 also. The M2 has the traditional side release button we all know.

It is an EXCELLENT shooter. One of the best triggers out of the box, hovering around 4.5-5lbs. One of the most accurate 9mm guns I have ever fired. You will not be disappointed. Comes with factory case, two mags, and Uncle Mike holster, and Blackhawk Serpa. 

I may consider trades, but no low quality guns. CZ's are ok. Let me know what you have. You never know what I will take. I am interested in the Mossberg 930 or other semi auto shotguns. Would take a basic PSA AR15. Or trades and cash.

Ruger Blackhawk 45 Convertible Single Action Revolver Black, 45 Colt & 45ACP


Classic Lines, Classic Feel, Modern Features. The Ruger® New Model Blackhawk® is the most advanced single-action revolver ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single-actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock, an all-coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame-mounted firing pin. New Model Blackhawk revolvers have earned a reputation as the best value on the market due to their durability and affordability.


Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge.

This is a CPO (certified Pre-Owned) Sig, meaning it was bought new, then sold back to Sig and was put through their CPO program ( http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/certified-pre-owned-sig-sauer.aspx ). This thing is as good as new, with only a bit of surface wear on the outside of the barrel. The bore of the barrel is the brightest and cleanest I've ever seen a bore. External of the gun looks great as well. The Hogue grips, 1 of the MecGar magazines, as well as BOTH holsters are brand new and have only been used about 5 times.

What you get:
Sig Sauer P226 9mm DA/SA
SigLite Night Sights
Hogue Rubber Wraparound Grips - OD (stock plastic panel grips included)
2x MecGar 18 round magazines
2x SigSauer 15 round magazines
MDJ IWB holster
Blackhawk! Serpa CQC OWB holster
Box with manual

What I want:
$600 firm
Buyer must be willing to meet in Geauga County.
Buyer must provide current CCW license and be willing to sign a bill of sale (we each get a copy).

Thanks for looking."

They will still accept a standard AR style upper so you can switch to .223, 300 Black or whatever AR caliber you perfer.

Great for shooting clays, home defense, and WOWing everyone at the range! 

The Green one is a Rock River Arms aluminum lower, built with standard military style sights, OD Green Magpul adjustable stock, carbine forearm, grip, trigger bar, and rail cover.

The Tan one is a GWACS Armory one piece composite lower, built with standard military style sights, removable carry handle, and FDE Tan Magpul rifle forearm.

Both are Safir Arms flat top railed upper receivers, 410 gauge bolts, and smooth bore 410 gauge 18"" threaded barrels. They also include three 10 round Lancer magazines that have been custom modified for the 410 shell. They have been ""tuned"" and checked out by a leading Gun Smith/Armorer and shoot great!

I'm asking $2000 for each or best offer, local sales prefer but with ship to FFL at your cost.

Handles and shoots like an AR-15, uses standard AR parts, way cooler than a Saiga, and is extremely unique and rare. The semi-auto operation is done through an ingenious hybrid gas piston ring blow back/recoil operated system, that is very reliable and keeps the chamber extremely clean. Only 50 rounds through each rifle for ""tuning"" and testing.

I bought them in a package from the importer and wanted to build them so others could enjoy them as much as I enjoy the two that I'm keeping.

Will trade for USC, SL8-6, ACR, Tavor 18', SCAR 308, KZ-9mm, FNX-45

Firearm is in mint condition. 50 rounds fired 
through. Its all black. no scratches. includes with it is the box and papers, 
and the two magazines it came with. well maintained, cleaned and kept. 

if you have something to trade i will only trade with if you have a valid 
Florida License and a valid Florida carry permit. no criminals or retards. ask 
yourself if you are retarded before responding to me or going out of your house 
that day. you can save lives. the boxes that hold the rounds are called 
magazines, not clips. if i get another person asking how many clips anything 
comes with i think you should jump off a bridge. 

for those of you who arent aware, glock is not an american gun. it is probably 
the one most seen in america because WE ARE GUN CRAZY. gotta get my guns. hate 
to say it but god made it that way with the austrians. it is an astrian gun. 
forged and built under the biggest balled auistrian in existence, other than 
Arnold Swartzee, by a tool and knife maker. 

now, this glock 17 fires the lightening fast round known to the dinosaurs as 
extinction but to us humans the 9mm. thank you to the germnas! for not only WWI, 
WWII but the 9mm round. the least they could do was give us that. making that 
projectile fire faster than a guy breaking into your home and shitting his pants 
once you pull out this puppy for protection is the freaking striker fire system. 
NO HAMMERS! sorry carpenters keep looking. The only safety this weapon uses to 
master is the one youll use on your girls clit stick. thats right a trigger 
safety! may be the scariest shit know to man or the smartest thing ever created 
to make life that much easier. more time to do man shit.

BUT WAIT THERES MORE! this mind blowing piece of engineering is made of the 
smelted down plastic from the toys no one buys from the dying kids in sweatshops 
that no ones knows about. and.... STEEL. but somehow.... this combination is 
fucking indestructible. im still baffled to this day. now. what can possibly get 
even more crazy than what youve already read? comes with a sun burning tac light 
on it. thats right all you sleepless zombies. all the stupid shit you do with 
guns during the day, even better, now you can do them at night! but this is no 
ordinary light ohhhhhh nooooooo. if you arent ready for this next part back step 
a page and keep on looking my friends. 

THIS is SO powerfull that if you have a retard break in your house and is about 
to some retarded shit you pull this baby out in the dark, flash the light and 
point it at him. you wont have to fire one shot. just call the fire department, 
why you ask? the light is so bright it will melt his eyeballs right out of his 
skull. now is that the manliest shit you've ever heard of? i think so. now grab 
a beer and your mouse and keep reading.

this gun will literally fire through the shit and keep going until you're dead 
or run out of ammo. and if you run out of ammo you might as well be dead because 
having no ammo sucks huge hairy balls. so stock up ammo and get ready to throw 
what ever you can at this pistol and get ready for the time of your life, for it 
will NEVER be the same again. a few examples of what she can go through:
- shit, piss, and corruption
-mud
-sand
-gas
-fire
-dragons breath fire
-water
-salty water
-stagnant mosquito egg filled water
-dust
-blood

-fish
-sharks
-snakes

-leaves
-cars running over it
-thrown out of anywhere

-buried for years under ground
-dragged by a car
-shot by a girl
-cleaned with food products
-dip spit
-motor oil
-sweat
-salsa
-butter
and many many many more things you could possibly throw in at on it.

if you are still reading or interested i am too. im looking to trade my piece of 
history away to one of the luckiest to stumble upon this. sorry for no pictures, 
if you're crying about that, well so am i. e-mail me for more info and pics.

I have a large amount of 22LR that I would like to sell or trade. I am pricing it substantially lower than what I see it going for at shows, and lower than what others are selling for in private party. I am basically selling for what I have in it. So if you can get it somewhere else cheaper than by all means do so. I am not trying to gouge, just recoup what I have in them. That being said, here is what I have:
-3 boxes of 525rd Remington Golden Bullet- $45 each
-8 boxes of 325rd Federal Auto-Match-$30 each
-5 boxes of 50rd American Eagle- $5 each
I am not placing any kind of limit to purchase on these so you can buy as many, or as little as you would like. These prices are for pickup in norman only. If you want to buy everything I will sell them all for $365 which is much less than what the market has them at. I would also consider trading some or all towards a Pink SR22 in good or new condition. Please shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal on it
