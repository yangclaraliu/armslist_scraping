Apparently a dremel can address some of that, but I have not done anything to it, other than look at it, wipe it down, and then wonder what to do with it.
It probably has about 100 rounds through it since new.
Its taking up space in my cabinet, so time to unload.

She's gonna lose interest in this and go back to selling Mary Kay, or body wraps or some shit, and thats when you make your move!  These are easily replaceable parts, and you know this because you are a man.  It literally took me 2.5 minutes to swap out a black grip and stock for these ""girl friendly"" parts... and I was hanging upside down, blindfolded... smoking a cigar... like a boss.

Maybe you know someone who is good with Photoshop, and all of a sudden you've got photo evidence on facebook that you have the first confirmed dinosaur kill in SC.  You ever seen that movie Commando with Arnold Swartz-something?  He had a gun like this, and he was cool as fuck!  A little known fact about that movie is that his AR started out Pink too, he just swapped out them parts.  You see the connection... that could be you.  Anyway hit me up."

Maybe you take her out once and let her shoot ""her"" new AR, but here is where shit gets real. She's gonna lose interest in this and go back to selling Mary Kay, or body wraps or some shit, and thats when you make your move! These are easily replaceable parts, and you know this because you are a man. It literally took me 2.5 minutes to swap out a black grip and stock for these ""girl friendly"" parts... and I was hanging upside down, blindfolded... smoking a cigar... like a boss. If you've been waiting for you chance to get an AR but have put aside your manly desires in order to support your woman's tanning and coffee habits, now is your chance! Don't let her read this shit, that will ruin everything, and then you won't be posting photos of yourself on facebook holding this beast looking like a stone cold boss... after you swap out the pink of course. Maybe you know someone who is good with Photoshop, and all of a sudden you've got photo evidence on facebook that you have the first confirmed dinosaur kill in SC. You ever seen that movie Commando with Arnold Swartz-something? He had a gun like this, and he was cool as fuck! A little known fact about that movie is that his AR started out Pink too, he just swapped out them parts. You see the connection... that could be you. Anyway hit me up."

Makes Rifle Run Cooler & Cleaner With Less Felt Recoil !!! Less prone to failures due to dirty gas system like standard AR15 rifles. 

Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Low profile gas piston block will allow the use of a free-float rail. 

This piston kit was removed from a brand new gun I bought and has never been fired or used. Comes with the gas block, piston assembly including op-rod, and bolt carrier. Just install a bolt of your caliber of choice in the carrier and it's ready to rock and roll. Why spend $1000-1400 or more on an entire gas piston upper when you can turn your current upper into a piston setup? These retail for $350, so my loss is your gain!"

*First Shipment inside the United States

*NEW black finish

*The special inside-out heat and surface, non-scratch treatment of the barrels will also outperform any other by allowing about 7% + bullet velocity as opposed to a non-treated barrel.

* LOWEST SERIAL NUMBERS POSSIBLE

*The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.

*Trigger by Powder River Precision. Breaks approximately 3.5 lb.
*Dawson fiber optic front sight
*Dawson fiber optic adjustable rear sight
*Powder River Precision grip enhancement (grip tape)
*Factory XD Gear, including holster, mag pouch and mag loader

Gun is in good condition; it was well cared for and used by the original owner to shoot IPSC for a few years before she upgraded to an XDm 5.25. I bought it for my wife, but she lost interest (okay, she never really had any interest) and I don't shoot 9mm.

The magazines shown in the picture are high capacity and not legal in Massachusetts.  Mass compliant mags for this gun are ready available online or in gun shops, or you can purchase and modify high capacity magazines.

Asking $795 O.B.O. This is priced below cost without the Massachusetts markup.  Those familiar with this gun know the quality of these upgrades, and how hard ithe gun is to find in Massachusetts. Terms are cash, FTF on an FA-10 in the greater Boston/metrowest area. Buyer must have MA LTC-A.  All laws to be followed.

PLEASE read the terms below.  If you contact me, either tell me ""I'll take it,"" or make me an offer, or ask me a question.  I hate responding to ""is it still available?"" emails or ""call me"" emails that end up being a waste of time.

I will listen to offers for trades, but the only trades I'm potentially interested in are a Beretta CX4 Storm carbine (9mm, 92FS mags), a Kriss Vector or a USGI M1 Carbine (IBM or Rockola).

*****

Standard Terms:
I am not a firearms dealer engaged in the business of buying and selling guns, I am merely a collector who occasionally sells a firearm from his personal collection.

All local, state and Federal laws are to be strictly followed. For those who are unsure of how to conduct a private transaction, I'm happy to answer questions and walk you through the process. However, any requests to violate the law will immediately end negotiations.

I prefer to conduct the majority of negotiations over PM, email or text. I'm not trying to be elusive, I just prefer a written record of our agreement.

I am happy to answer any and all questions to be best of my ability, however, please do your own research - I'm not a salesman.

All negotiations are to be conducted via email, text or phone call before the transaction. Once we reach a deal, negotiations are closed. If you show up to the transaction after we've made a deal and try to weasel another $50 out of me, I'll walk away.

You cannot ""try it out"" to see if you like the gun. I am not a walking show room. If we happen to be at the same range at the same time, and I have the gun that's for sale with me, I'll probably be willing to let you to try it out, but this is the exception, not the rule.

I cannot stress this one enough: when we reach an agreement (which could be as simple as ""I'll take it"" and ""it's yours,"") you've entered into a contract to complete the transaction. Unless the item is not as described (I take pains to make sure I fairly describe anything I sell, and I'll allow you all the time and leeway you need to inspect it), you're expected to show up when and where we agree and complete the transaction.

I reserve the right to sell to whomever I wish.

Please don't write ""call me"" with nothing else in your email. I'm not going to call you if I have no indication of your level of interest, if you want to make an offer, or what your questions might be.

Please don't ask, ""Is it still available? with nothing else in your email. That's just a waste of everyone's time.

I reserve the right to ignore ridiculous offers."

I am looking to trade or sell. $42 a brick for the Blazer and $40 each for the Thunderbolt.  I will not drive to Rexberg or Pocatello. I'm located in Rigby and will meet in Idaho Falls or Rigby. I will not ship anywhere or take checks. Cash only or trade. I know the price is high but I am not making anything on these. I do not have time to run to Walmart or Sportsmans so I simply bought a huge lot of it from a private party and paid a small fortune and don't like having that much cash invested in ammo so I would like to recoup some of it and keep the rest. I'm not taking a loss of even a penny so do not bother making offers below posted prices. Don't like the price then move on don't send me stupid emails.

Firearms that I will consider include anything quality, ranging from a tactical 12gauge to a nice conceal carry piece and everything in between. I am NOT interested in hunting rifles or ""bird guns"".(I have that covered)
I am also interested in quality wristwatches. Prefer Swiss made, but will entertain other ""countries of origin"" as well.

416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. This rifle has a 9"" lightweight quad rail handguard and low profile gas block. The butt stock is a B5 SOPMOD and the pistol grip is a MagPul MIAD. The sights are LWRC folding BUIS.

But back to the rifle: I did not realize how cool this thing was until I opened the box. With a full 16"" barrel this thing is still WAY shorter than your average carbine, making it very easy to move about and carry. It made me sad that I have other rifles in my personal collection and not this one. The flip-up sites are simple and precise. The ergonomics of this thing is insane. Everything is right where it should be. I cannot get over how small and light this thing is compared to other rifles.

Original owner, factory storage case, manual, and packaging included. This revolver is in near new condition. The outside is free of scratches and the cylinder and bore look perfect. The size and shape work excellent as a pocket carry gun. With the option of using .357 Magnum ammo there is a lot of stopping power for such a compact piece. You can't say that about the little 380 auto loaders out there! 

From manufacturer website:
If traveling light is the order of the day, look no further than the Taurus Protector. Featuring a fully shrouded zero-profile hammer that can be manually cocked/decocked in single action operation when needed - and five rounds of .38 Special +P or .357 Magnum ammo, the 851 revolver is the perfect choice for concealed carry when every ounce counts. The Protector features the Taurus Security System built in at no extra charge.
