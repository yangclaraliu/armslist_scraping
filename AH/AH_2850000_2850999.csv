I have a colt match hbar preban lower i am looking to sell. it is a large takedown pin and large colt fcg pin lower, but i have the adapter you need to use standard uppers on this lower. it does have a sear block, but a semi auto bcg or colt half moon bcg will work just fine. lower has a rock river 6 position stock on it and it does have one spot of wear from an ambi sling mount where the sling rubbed against the receiver. does not affect function at all, otherwise receiver is in excellent shape. 

I know you guys are going through tough times up there, i just saw a post saying that the .gov is trolling you all hard here on arms list. i assure you that what i am offering is 100% PREBAN and is 100% legal in CT. I also have over 140 A+ transactions on gunbroker and 200+ on ebay and will be happy to let you verify both. i ship next day after receiving funds since my mail delivers after 6pm. please feel free to contact me with any questions. this lower will be coming from ME an individual, to your FFL dealer. Please make sure they are OK with this. I can also ship from my FFL to your FFL for an additional 25 dollars. The price for the lower is a DELIVERED price as well, no extra shipping. thanks for your consideration, and sorry for the novel!"

It is the first frame mounted firing pin Colt and was introduced as the top of the line .357 named simply as such. Production started before and briefly co-existed with the Python. The 6"" seems much less common than the 4"" - but I don't know the numbers. This early production has the ""two-tone"" cylinder flutes (flutes and frame topstrap are matte, otherwise blue is polished).  Also as typical for the time, one inside grip panel has handwritten pencil numbers matching the serial number. Slight cylinder turn line and bluing wear at muzzle, otherwise pristine condition. Vintage original right hand Bucheimer thumb break scabbard holster included.  

Being over 50 years old and limited production, this is a must have for serious Colt collectors and prices will undoubtedly continue increasing.  I don't have the heart to add any wear to it.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

This rifle was manufactured a few years before Marlin switched to the current “Microgroove” line of barrels. Traditional Ballard rifling is preferable for those who shoot non-jacketed bullets. There are not many classic Pre-microgroove Marlin 30-30's to choose from these days.

C.A.T. M-4 Tool allows the operator to clean the weapon and restore the bolt and carrier group to tactical tolerance in a matter of minutes. In the field, with gloved hands, and in low light conditions if necessary. The tool is currently undergoing field evaluation by selected units deployed in the global war on terrorism.

Note: The CAT M-4 tool was designed to simplify weapons maintenance in the field, or at the range, for Soldiers and serious M4 and AR-15 shooters from all backgrounds.

With sustained high rates of fire, sand, carbon, and brass fragments from case rims and primers, can all accumulate to form a heat-baked crud around the locking lug area. Solvents, brushes, mops, and lug picks can all do a fine job of removing this baked on crud....when there's enough time and enough light to use them. The CAT M4 stainless steel scraping tool removes carbon build-up from the bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin flange. This is used with the AR-15."

This exceptional performance is accomplished in 2 simultaneous steps. First, the redirection of gas to a 30 degree rearward angle actually pulls the barrel forward, reducing felt recoil. Second, the redirection of gas vertically provides a genuine reduction in muzzle rise. The result allows the shooters sights to remain on target or realigned quickly providing faster accurate follow up shots.

I was contacted back by text from REDACTED. I was told by the person, to send a USPS money order to the person listed bellow. Once the money order arrived, they would send the rifle to my FFL dealer (yeah, right!). When I asked why, was the listing listed  under Eastern Oregon. The person replied they were doing business in Salem, OR. 

So peeps beware, the scam artist's are working at least one listing in Oregon. And my guess, there are several more.

Montana has re-created the now cost-prohibitive Brevex Magnum Mauser square-bridge action, with many upgrades from the original. The massively strong action easily swallows the huge 505 Gibbs, a relativity low-pressure cartridge that drives a 0.505-inch diameter bullet of 525 grains at 2300 fps. (6166 ft. pounds of energy). Ammunition is now readily available from several sources, suppliers. Hornady makes makes their fabulous copper-clad, steel jacked DGX for the Gibbs, so Cape buffalo become absolutely no problem. With considerably more slam than a 458 Lott, plus the added physical shock of such a large-diameter bullet, the 505 Gibbs has been handling elephant, buffalo, and anything else in it's path for over a century."

I have other accessories available for sale as well

The Phantom is all about combining full-sized shootability and firepower (18+1 rounds of 9mm Luger) with all-day carry comfort. The polymer construction and radically scalloped forged steel slide make the SP-01 Phantom one of the lightest full-size autos out there. In fact, it is a full 33% lighter than the steel-framed models, making it ideal for all-day carry.

http://www.cz-usa.com/products/view/cz-75-sp-01-phantom/

Retaining the superior grip geometry of the SP-01, the Phantom has less perceived recoil than models of similar weight and power, and is unmatched in its natural point of aim.

The Phantom features a decocking lever, accessory rail and two interchangable grip inserts to accommodate users with different sized hands. It has an 18+1 round capacity in 9mm and will also accept all previous CZ 75 model magazines (both full and restricted capacities)."

I have a Colt Diamondback revolver for sale, in the original box.  Original grips, original finish.  I'm not an expert on grading guns, but i've had a half a dozen Colt collectors say this thing is 95% of better.  I've never fired the gun, and there is very very light markings on the cylinder.  I can't tell that it has ever been fired, but it has some light wear on the very end of the barrel.  I'll take cash or credit for this gorgeous gun.  As always, price is negotiable.

It is an exellent training tool to help develope your shooting skills. It forces discipline, making you more accurate under pressure. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason.

This Norinco was purchased private sale and still in box, owner claimed it hadn't been shot.  Gun is in VERY GOOD condition and has seen less than 100 rounds through it since I purchased it.  What makes this such a great deal for you is all the extras that are going to come with this package.  This gun IS 922r compliant in its CURRENT CONFIGURATION and has included parts to allow you to set it up in many configurations.  Included in this package is:
Norinco 7.62x39 SKS
SG Works Bullpup stock
SG Works Front Tri-Rail
SG Works Extended Mag Release
SG Works Trigger link (replaces trigger to take away x1 foreign part if needed... not installed/not needed for 922r compliancy in its current configuration)
SG Works Bullpup Rear sling point
Tapco Gas tube for SKS (I purchased this to preserve the original sks gas tube/wood handguard)
Gas Piston (made in USA)

Want to switch back to original SKS configuration? I am also including all original pieces if you decide to go back to a traditional setup

Norinco wood stock with original gas tube (never removed from top handguard wood) and original gas piston.  Also included is a Spike style bayonet (purchased separately), cleaning rod, cleaning set that fits in butt-stock, rear leaf sight (removed for Bull Pup stock), and 10 round internal magazine.

Now for the extras: This package will include x2 20 Round Pro Mag magazines (made in USA), x3 Tapco 20 Round Magazines (made in USA), x1 30 round magazine, 40 stripper clips and a stripper clip mag adapter.  I will admit that I did have a few failure to feed with the Pro Mag mags and so purchased the Tapco mags to see if that would help (I have not had a chance to test them out at range yet) .  I did however have zero issues feeding with the original internal magazine.

Also included are  2 different vertical foregrips, one is a Quick Release UTG folding vertical/horizontal foregrip and a push button vertical grip/bipod that is spring loaded for quick bipod deployment. This package also includes a New In Box Bushnell TRS-25 Red Dot Sight (never used only removed from box) and a Sightmark Ultra Dual Shot NV Compatible Red Dot Sight (laser has been removed from sight as I didn't prefer it, but is included and easily reattached). The Sightmark does have x2 little nicks on intensity dial, but otherwise in perfect condition.  I will also include in this package a 2 point quick disconnect sling, a breech lock, the Tapco Intrafuse Gas Tube handguard that came with the gas tube, and a BlackHawk Tactical Rifle bag with spots for 5 mags as well as 2 other accessory pouches. 

This has everything you could ask for and more, it is a perfect compact defensive weapon which is rock solid and measures right at 30inches long.  I am only getting rid of it because my love for an AK is greater than my desire to keep this guy around.

I am pretty firm on the price as I believe it is a fair deal, but am open to trades for AK's or Saiga 7.62x39's.  I can be reached at REDACTED (TEXT PREFERRED)"

The rifle is used but in excellent shape. The only thing changed on it was the sights because the original rear sight wouldn’t hold adjustment. If you don’t like the sights I put on it there are places to get ones you might like better (like http://www.rmcsports.com/catalog.htm). The rifle will fire PA pellet as the name suggests but I preferred round ball and black powder. It is clean (as a used flintlock can be) and has no rust inside or out. Though there are some signs of use it still looks and shoots great. 

My rifle comes with all the accessories and case as shown in the picture. These are not the cheap plastic walmart muzzleloading tools either. The powder flask, charging flask and powder measure are all high quality brass. The round ball pouch and lock cover are hand made from leather and the ball starter is hard wood and brass. With hunting in mind, I have strings attached to almost all of these to tie them to myself to prevent dropping them in the woods. Pre-cut patches and cleaning tools are kept in small tins to keep from losing them. The reason I’m selling is I’m out of work and as much as I’d hate to give it up I really need the money. So my loss is your gain.

The sealed bag has 100 rounds in it plus the 30 rounds on stripper clips.  As you can see from the picture the ammo is Yugoslavian surplus ammo.  The ammunition in the bag has the star on the casing as well. 

8mm surplus ammo is getting harder and harder to find nowadays, and it is not getting any cheaper.  This ammo has a kick and has run flawlessly out of my mauser.  Some of the rounds required two strikes from the firing pin to fire the round, but I attribute this to the worn out spring in my mauser.

It has two tube magazines which the user of the gun can switch between manually.[2] Each tube holds a total of seven 2.75 in (70 mm) 12-gauge shotshells or six 3 in (76 mm) shotshells. Also it takes 27 1 inch shells.


OPERATION:

The Kel-Tec KSG shotgun is a manually operated, pump (slide) action weapon. Barrel locking is achieved by a swinging wedge, located inside the top of the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. The sliding forend is connected to the bolt by dual operating bars. The ammunition feed is from two independent tubular magazines, located below the barrel.

The user is required to manually select a magazine by switching a three-position lever, located behind the pistol grip. The middle position of the switch blocks the feed from both magazines and allows the user to chamber a single round manually. Switching the lever to one side brings the respective magazine into the feed cycle. Once one magazine is depleted, the user manually switches to the second magazine by pushing the magazine selection lever toward it.[2]

Rounds are loaded into the magazines through a large loading/ejection port, located at the bottom of the gun in the stock, behind the pistol grip. Empty shells are ejected down through the same port. A manual safety is available in the form of the cross-bolt button, located above the grip, making the gun fully ambidextrous in use. Sighting equipment (iron sights and/or red dot sights) can be installed using the standard Picatinny rail located above the barrel. A second Picatinny rail is provided at the bottom of the sliding forend, permitting installation of other Picatinny rail accessories. While not included with the stock weapon, perpendicular forward grips and back-up iron sights (BUIS) are almost always shown in photography and video demonstrations of the Kel-Tec KSG.

INCLUDES (3) Boxes of Winchester PDX1 Defender Ammo (shown in photos). Have more for sale but they are going fast."

Used by Germany in WWI, many German Officers carried these guns, private purchase, during WWII, and lots of them came back to the USA with returning GI’s. This example is pretty well-used. It has the Imperial German “Crown N” proofs and Dryese factory markings, there are no importers markings anywhere on the gun. The magazine looks chrome-plated, and it may be a replacement. The pistol has lost almost all of the original blue finish, it has lots of patina and freckling. The original checkered black hard rubber grips are pretty worn, the bore is still somewhat crisp, and overall condition is about 75%.

Selling my Colt government pocketlite because I have had it a while, never shoot it and have other carry guns. This pistol shoots very well and is in great shape. It is basically a 1911 scaled from a 45 to a 380. I have fired a couple hundred rounds through it and it runs great. Certainly one of the best looking carry guns ever. This is a classic and classy concealed carry or home protection firearm and is in good enough condition for a collection. I have 100 PMC and a box of golden sabers for it along with a custom leather holster. Also has two colt factory magazines. Thanks"

It has always been kept in the case, handled and cleaned professionally, and handles like a dream. It has only had 200 rounds (give or take a few) through the barrel. The interesting thing about the P250 is that it allows interchangeable barrels for 9mm and up to .45. I bought this kit with only the .40 barrel. Sorry it does not have a rail system integrated. It is a DAO but the cool thing I like about it is that I can watch the hammer drop as I pull the trigger and I know exactly when it will fire. As a sub-compact it is a 9+1 with the magazine the kit originally included. I purchased a full sized 14 round magazine for $50 that I will include. I am getting stationed to a european country that is not gun friendly (take your pick) and have to let this baby go. Due to its superb condition and low number of rounds I will let the whole kit (gun, 2 mags, carrying case) go to a good owner for $450."

Looking for multiple handgun trades or quality firearms only! If it's a long gun it better be one that can reach out and touch something, or a nice wood stock 270, 260 or something else nice for the misses + cash depending on what you have.  Feel free to ask any questions. Round count is approximately 400rds down range with not one hiccup.  know what this beauty is worth so all low ball offers will be ignored. It comes in the original blue Springfield box w/paperwork and all the gear from the factory as well. I have had several offers but nothing that has really grabbed me. Thanks!"
