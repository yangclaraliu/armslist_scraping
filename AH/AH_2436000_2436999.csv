Are you just wanting some color or accents done? I can do it for you and make it look however you want. I specialize in military style camo and can do basic blending that matches the environment around here. I can do digi, desert, urban, tiger stripping, ect. Ten years of marine corps infantry including instructing camouflage at ocs in Quantico VA has given me the skills to match just about any environment. I can do pretty much anything you need done. Deer binds, tree stands, you name it and I'll camo or paint it. I don't have set prices because I will work with your budget and also the work you are wanting done. I am painting/airbrushing, not dipping so don't be confused and any work I do is removable if you choose. I'll take your old paint off for a fee if you want to change or remove completely. I don't disassemble your weapon unless you ok it. I'm especially proficient with ar, glocks, and Beretta. I will make some samples upon request of patterns if you want to see what you will be getting before I start any work. If you have been looking to camo your weapons, hunting items, or whatever just hit me up. I am much cheaper than having them dipped and my stuff can be changed if you do wish to do so. 

I CAN DO DURACOATING. If you want duracoat, I will need a deposit up front because the materials must be ordered and takes 3-5 business days to arrive. I will not pay out of pocket for materials for the duracoat, although I do not charge for the labor until the weapon is finished and you approve. If you want the duracoat, go to the website and look around at what you want. I only charge a deposit of the materials that you wish to order. (plus shipping) 

Some examples of what patterns I can do: (these can be done with duracoat or airbrushing if you want cheaper prices)
Multicam (the current camo the army is wearing in Afghanistan) 
MarPat digital
Desert Digital
Army/ACU camo
Vietnam era tiger strip 
zebra/ leopard print (any animal print for the most part)
skulls, spider web, (working on zombie stuff so that will be available soon)
snakeskin 
Urban (divi, tiger striping, or normal patterns)

I can do most items you may want done such as:
Rifle cases
Pelican Cases
ammo cans
animal skulls
scopes and other optics
Deer blinds/tree stands
anything you want, I can usually work with, just ask!

These are just the common ones I can do, I am constantly working on new patterns and ideas so if you don't see one that you are interested in give me some thoughts on what you would like. I can pretty much do whatever you want done. Think about it like a tattoo for your weapon (or any items like ammo cans, tool boxes, boats). I can also do those patterns in any color scheme you want. For example the urban pattern with red like the spetznas wore. I can also do a detailed cleaning on your weapons for additional fee. I spent a decade scrubbing m16s, SAWs, M9, ect and know how to get it inspection ready. I can take even the dirtiest AR and make it brand new. (no chemicals or power tools just elbow grease and an AP brush) Text or call anytime but text works faster for me. I am 100% Disabled Vet and do not work FYI so I can spend a great deal of time getting your weapon back to you fairly quick. Semper Fi

I had this listed before without the mags or Reflex sight and have now decided to sell it all as one package. If you take a few minutes and price everything out, you’ll see that I’m offering a phenomenal deal.
I’ve put approximately 280 rounds through this weapon and I’ve had no issues firing/cycling the weapon whatsoever with both used and new, OEM (Beretta/Italian) and quality aftermarket US govt issue mags (Checkmate). 
With the Spike’s Tactical muzzle brake and Tacticool buffer installed, recoil is almost completely eliminated and muzzle rise is negligible. Night and day difference between current and stock configuration. You can now blast away in rapid fire and stay on target.
The cheap and fragile plastic stock sights (both front AND rear) have been removed and a Trijicon Reflex RX01-11 6.5 MOA amber dot with Weaver mount installed. The sight comes with dust cover, lens pen and polarizing filter. No box. 

Weapon comes with the following :
-Threaded barrel 1/2 x 28
-Spikes Tactical 9mm Muzzle Brake 
-US Machinegun Knurled Thread Protector
-Kel-Tec Railed Forend with Picatinny Rails
-Kel-Tec Trigger Shoe

-Tacticool Buffer Cylinder
-Magpul AFG (Angled Forward Grip)

This was originally purchased as a pistol, but the State of Michigan has since changed the legal definition of a pistol and these are now considered long guns.

$575 OUT THE DOOR (sales tax included)

Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. The Century semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. 

Will not operate with AK 47 mags.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Everything is factory, includes scope rings.  Somehow I misplaced two of the scope ring screws when taking off the scope a few days ago so you will have to order some from Midway or any firearms dealer should have them.

No rust or corrosion.  The stock has a few scratches from elk hunting in heavy brush. I planned on putting a new stock on it to match my other Ruger but decided to buy a new rifle instead.

The rifle has very limited rounds through it.  Was just shot to sight rifle in and it has killed a few bull elk.  I will include any ammo that I have left.

 Sig Sauer MOSS22PNK Mosquito 22LR 3.9"" 10+1 Blk Grip Pink Poly Frame Blued Slide 

Only 90% the size of a P226, the Mosquito, chambered in 22LR, is the ideal
 choice for hours of shooting fun. Its wear-resistant polymer frame and
 integral accessory rail is ergonomically designed to enhance accuracy and
 provide a better all-around shooting experience. Additional features
 include a rugged blowback system, fixed barrel and adjustable rear sight.
 It's also loaded with safety features including a decocking lever and the
 automatic drop safety you'd expect in a Sig Sauer pistol. It is further
 enhanced with an ambidextrous manual slide mounted safety, magazine safety
 and internal locking device. This model features a wear-resistant color
 finish over the polymer frame and a stainless steel slide with a blued
 finish. The frame finish, while wear resistant, is a decorative coating
 that can be expected to experience wear from holstering or accessory
 mounting.

The FN FNS-40 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.

Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.

The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.




Maximized Safety Systems
In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features Four Major Safeties:

Trigger Safety 
Firing Pin Safety 
Drop Safety 
Out-of-Battery Safety 



1. Trigger Safety
The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.


2. Firing Pin Safety
The firing pin safety prevents the stricker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.

 3. Drop Safety
Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled.

 4. Out-of-Battery Safety
When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled.


Enhanced Ergonomics
The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size."

It is made in the USA and a copy of the South African design.

* It is chambered in 410 shotshell , 45-70 government rounds, or .45 Long Colt.

* It is officially classified by the ATF as a pistol/revolver that’s why it has no stock or forward pistol grip. I guess in a way you could call it a revolver since the drum does not remove for reloading.

* It holds 12 rounds with a built in drum.

* These units are NOT listed as a destructive device. When the Street Sweeper became listed as a Destructive Device, Cobray used some of their tooling to create the LHC.

* The 45-70 pistols do have a grooved barrel and operates exactly like the 12 gauge units.

* This unit was completely refurbished. The main spring and trigger group were degreased and re- oiled to ensure a long service life. The unit looks and functions like new. Very few of these units exist and this is a wonderful addition to any firearm collection.

* Weighs about 12 pounds, has a 25 lbs trigger pull and can all be release in about 3 seconds.

* Very few of these are on the open market.

* These were made by Cobray, which also produced the Street Sweeper shotgun.

* If you”re wondering why Cobray chose that name (Ladies Home Companion), it’s because the Street Sweeper’s name was partially why it got targeted by politicians. Rather than choose something menacing, they went with something friendly."
