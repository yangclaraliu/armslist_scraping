I am the second owner of this pistol, and it has had 200 or so rounds through it. there are a couple of minor scratches on it that were there when I took ownership of it, but the camera couldn't pick them up. This thing has been treated like gold since I got it about a year ago. Never exposed to moisture, extreme temperatures, or novices. Just came back from Taurus a few months ago with a clean bill of health earlier this year (they will inspect, clean, and test your gun if you send it to them and ask really nice - even if there's nothing wrong with it), and of course, if it ever needs work, this firearm is covered under Taurus' awesome lifetime warranty.

I have some cash or we can talk possible trades or trade/cash if that's what you want to do. I am willing to work a deal, but AR pricing by people on this website is a joke. See below:

Palmetto State Armory sells a BRAND NEW .300 or .223 rifle with a sliding stock, A2 hider, and A2 front sight for 750-800 depending on which caliber is chosen. They are also including a ATI AR22 for 50 bucks when you buy one of their rifles. The 22 is worth an easy 300 as PSA sells them for 379. I was just there TODAY.

I don't have a problem buying a gun cash. But I do have a problem with the following:

1. You're PSA AR15 is NOT worth 1500 because you added a Chinese laser/light combo or some garbage SIGHTMARK or BSA red dot. Hell it isn't even worth that if you added an eotech and a surefire because it's USED! Even a magpul furniture kit is only 125 bucks!

2. I don't care if it's fired or not. Once it's transferred to you, it is a USED GUN PERIOD.

3. DPMS sells their AR15 base for 700, so that also is not a 1500 dollar gun.

4. I will NOT pay you what you have invested in total because it is USED. Regardless of whether or not it's been shot. 

Why would I pay 1400 or more from some of the clowns on this website when I can go back to PSA tomorrow and get a free 22 worth 350 dollars after buying a brand new AR15 in 223 or 300 for 800 dollars brand new!

Those that are willing to discuss reasonable used prices and or trades feel free to contact me. 

I might be interested in a M1A short barrel socom as well but again I am not paying new retail for a used gun I don't care if Jeff Cooper himself signs it or hunted with it or slept with it under his pillow.

The scare is over guys let's get real. There is no shortage of AR's and there will never be."

Size is 40 but Filson sizing is larger than suit sizing to accommodate layering. I am 5'10"" and 180 lbs and it fits me fine. It is made with 26-ounce Mackinaw Wool and is thick for superior warmth and maximum durability. Mackinaw Wool is 100 percent virgin wool, which can absorb up to 30 percent of its weight in water before getting soggy.

Perfect for hunting or hiking, the coat features plenty of pockets to stash your gear. The large rear cruiser pocket spans the entire back of the coat and can be accessed from either side. Four large front pockets snap closed to keep the contents from getting jostled out on a rough trail. There are also three utility slots over the upper left front pocket and two hand-warmer pockets to keep your digits from turning blue. The Inside left chest pocket offers yet another handy place to tuck away your gear.

The coat is unlined and features a six-button front and grey and black color scheme. Made in the USA, Filson's 10043 GB Men's Mackinaw Cruiser Coat is ideal for the all-American outdoorsman.

Here is a link to my item. Notice I am selling it for $150 LESS than retail if you were to include tax and shipping charges.

You can contact me at REDACTED or by email. Would consider trading for a pistol or shotgun of equal or higher value.

It replaces the guide rod / take down lever so there are no compatibility issues with accessory items (holsters/lights). It has ambidextrous on/off switch for righties/lefties and is easy to turn on when removed from your holster...plus it pulses so it's easy to see day or night. It's in great shape with maybe 150-200 cycles on it so it's almost like new....it even has new batteries with a spare! 
Based on a quick Google search, these run $350-$399 so $225 is a good price.
I'm located west of Indy (Avon) or can ship on my dime. Contact me if you have questions.

However...

This pics he posted are of a MilSpec model.  It is easy to tell given the combat sights, the standard beavertail (the Loaded has fixed night sights and a pronounced beavertail), and the non-ambidextrous safety.

This is also not a new Loaded since the case for the newer ones is the larger black case that looks like a XDm case.  I know.  I bought a new Loaded model (PX9109LP) in 2013.

Make me offer! Description of type of ammo below!! Open to trades 

45 black tip
Armor Piercing: Identified by a black tip, this general purpose armor piercing bullet uses a core of very dense, hardened tungsten steel. Contrary to common belief, it is not the “best” armor piercing 50 BMG round, but it is the best general purpose armor piercing round. Bullet weights are in the 690 grain to 705 grain range depending on year, model, and country of origin. Covered in a copper jacket, this round can be found with either a lead plug base or with the jacked swagged at its base for the gas seal. This is a boat tailed projectile.
16 silver tip
Armor Piercing Incendiary: Identified with a silver or “aluminum” colored tip (not to be confused with the pointy Hornady AMAX match round which uses a real aluminum tip). This is generally the best common armor piercing round. Used where fear of secondary ignition effect after piercing is wanted or not a problem. The round is similar to the armor piercing round in that it has a dense hardened tungsten steel core but slightly shorter, allowing a incendiary compound to be enclosed in front of it under the boat tailed copper jacket sealed with a lead gas plug at the rear."

I am selling this firearm because I do not intend on carrying it, and because it sits in a gun safe more than it is used.
Asking price is $450.00, all offers will be considered. NO TRADES. I feel this is a fair starting price due to the condition and extra accessories. Other sellers are listing this exact pistol for $600-$700. I have taken into consideration the fact that the factory case is not included, which affects value.
I live in the Arlington/Lakeland area and will travel a short distance for transaction but will not meet in certain parts of Memphis.

Look up the reviews on this sight! You will not be dissapointed! Honestly, when put side to side with my actual Eotech, this sight is just as good. If anything, its more bang for you buck because for this price it can't be beat.

The sight has I believe 5 different brightness settings. 4 really nice red reticle settings. Water resistant and shock proof.

For sale/trade is 900 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. I am asking far less than retail for cash offers.

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.
I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.
