The slide is an Ithaca slide with the serial number beginning with AF. This AF stands for Air Force. The slide for this pistol is Ithaca AFPG (Air Force Premium Grade), it was made somewhere between the years of 1958 and 1970 by Air Force Armories. They are distinguished competition grade M1911A1's for use by the Air Force Shooting team, very rare and very precise. Complete AFPG pistols sell for over $3,000 in 100% condition, this however is not a matching pistol. 

The frame on this pistol is still a mystery to me, even with all the help I am receiving I am still unable to pinpoint its origins. I can tell you lower is in great condition and has a very smooth trigger pull, reminds me of my Kimber. 

The grips on this pistol are Pachmayr grips made in LA, USA. On the inside of the grips it reads, ""Colt .45""

I'm selling my Springfield XDM 3.8"" Compact .40 S&W for $550.00.
I bought it brand new in April 2013 after I obtained my carry license. I carried it for a while, went to the range probably 3-4 times, shot a couple hundred rounds through it, works perfectly. 
The reason I'm selling it is basically I'm trying to get rid of all my debt. I bought the gun on a credit card, and the credit card still has a balance, and so I'm selling things I don't really need right now. 
It's a great handgun, comes with the case, holster, 2 different size magazines, 3 different grip sizes, the safety cord lock and keys, magazine holder, cleaning brush, and I think that's it. 

Give me a call if you'd like to come and take a look at it. Thanks!

Here is a chance to purchase a nice piece of history. This is a Ruger Blackhawk Old Style aka 3 screw. This gun was manufactured in 1970. It is not museum quality it shows holster wear and use. The action is nice and tight and gives you all of those nice clicks. This gun has not been reworked and is in original condition. (aka no transfer bar). I am not the original owner because I was born in 1971.

MAP Price is $416...use coupon code #aim.point20$ to receive a special $20 discount at checkout!!!

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery.
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles.
(Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
• Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
• QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount.
Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
• Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage,
fingerprints and scratches.

This is not a Ruger 556 it is an R-Guns AR 15. It is better quality than DPMS but probably not as good as a colt. the fit and finish is very good and the upper and lower are very tight. 

After working at Ruger I do not recommend buying a R556 due to reliability issues. I don't want to say how many of those parts went into the scrap bin, or how many returns they received. Stick with a DI gun.

Chambered for the .45 ACP, this pistol is constructed of stainless steel and remains in excellent condition showing very little use. It is the full sized variation and the barrel measures 5"" in length. There are no  scratches or dings and I'd rate this pistol at 99% or better. Excellent bright bore and the mechanics are in good shape as well. It uses standard Colt 1911 type magazines so extras are easy to come by"

I am not original owner--I bought this used at a gun shop a couple years ago and intended to carry it, but changed my mind and its been in my safe ever since---previous owner had some work done...had 2-piece guide rod installed (hex wrench), plus an ambi-safety (in doing so it left some marring on the right side--it has an idiot mark too) I replaced with genuine Colt stainless thumb safety (original Colt satin parts are not easy or cheap to come by!) If you wanted to put an ambi back on, it would cover the marks. Has Pachmayer wraparound grips on it, and I do have original Colt wood, black stained grips with silver Colt medallions. Includes 3 Colt magazines. Frame to slide fit is tight! Super nice Colt with some minor flaws.

Russian/USSR Military Mosin-Nagant 91/30


Description

The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 is a bolt-action rifle chambered in 7.62X54mmR. The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 was introduced to the Russian/USSR military in 1891 and stayed in service until the end of World War II. In fact, it became the standard issue service rifle beginning in 1930 to all Russian soldiers and, during WWII, commonly used as a sniper rifle. It has standard features for a military rifle of its time such as iron sights, wooden stock and bayonet stud. It was mass-produced and often rushed through production, however, it was still surprising accurate,
The 7.62X54R is a old Russian combat cartridge and has comparable performance to 7.62 NATO or .308 Win. rounds, which are popular for long-range shooting.

Last year I took it to the range for the first time. Since then, it has accompanied my son and me MANY times, and has been my part time concealed carry handgun. We probably have 500 rounds fired without one issue, absolutely flawless performance. I am selling because the gun is too small for my large hand. 

This pistol is largely unknown, except to those who have one. It is similar to the PPK. It has the distinction of being the smallest handgun ever imported. Great for concealed carry in the waistband, or in a pocket/pocketbook. If you care to see it in a review here is a nice/fair video from youtube.

I have 5 of these available.

These trigger packs do not contain the 2 receiver pins necessary to mount the trigger pack to the receiver. You simply re-use the ones that came with the original trigger pack, since they don't really wear out.

The older 10/22's had metal trigger housings and triggers. These ones I'm selling are the later polymer type.

I am paying sales tax out of the amount you pay me, so you won't owe any.

If you'd like me to ship the trigger pack(s) to you, instead of meeting me, I am happy to do that, but I add $3 to the cost. After the first one, there is no additional shipping cost, no matter how many you buy.

The SAM7SF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability
