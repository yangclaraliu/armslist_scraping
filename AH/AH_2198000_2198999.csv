This is a premium Polish AK47. These rifles are built on AKM stamped receivers 7.62x39mm rifle,  from a numbers matching unissued Radom (Circle 11) kits with original chromelined barrel, on a Nodak NDS-3 receiver. All parts have been finished to match and are in excellent+ condition. This gun is new from the American builder and comes with 1 military magazine. 
 Radom in Poland has been known for over half a century for producing some of the highest quality AK type rifles, in terms of fit and finish. The factory began by making the milled AK47, before moving on to the stamped AKM and AKMS series. These were themselves replaced by the Tantal and now Beryl. 
 In 2005, the US gov't decided to no longer allow parts kits to come in, with original barrels intact. So for the past half decade, all kits have had cut up barrels and builders have been forced to use various American substitutes. This is why nearly all other AK's on the market have non-chrome-lined or non original chrome-lined barrels. 
 These rifles were professionally built from a kit imported back when original barrels were allowed. So this rifle features a Cold Hammer Forged and chrome-lined 16.25"" piece manufactured by Radom. Serials match with this kit and it was built up on a Nodak Spud NDS-3 receiver by Allied Armament. The US 922(r) parts are: receiver, trigger group, slant brake, and polymer pistol grip. This rifle can accept any handguard, buttstock, and pistol grip designed to fit a stamped receiver AKM/AK74.

Beyond this, the Polish rifles feature the best and smoothest operating parts out there. These rifles are not being made anymore. There are a few out there that might function as well such as Arsenal but none quite as collectible. $1,250 includes a hard case and one magazine."

This FEG, Mark II APK is in very good condition (80-85% overall). There is only minor and normal wear due to use. Construction is all steel (trigger guard excluded) with fixed sights, exposed hammer, and slide-mounted safety/ manual decocking lever. Comes with original case and instruction manual, replacement ""target"" grip, and four (4) magazines in excellent/ like new condition. This is a great deal, as these magazines are rare and often quite expensive when found. This particular gun, being in the condition that it's in, would usually sell for $300 on its own.

I test-fired this gun, one (1) round with each magazine, using ""Federal"" Range and Target Ammunition, .380 ACP FMJ, 95 Gr. No failures or malfunctions occurred. The gun was then field-stripped, cleaned, lubricated, and stored in its case.

Contact: REDACTED or email via this site.

A valid CPL is acceptable if purchasing face-to-face. I'll accept cash, cashiers check, or money order at the time of purchase. All sales are final.

If shipping out of state (no Cali. sales, sorry) an additional $25 will be added to the total (shipping and handling fees), thus being $325. Payment may be made via PayPal. All sales are final.



Know what is required of you when purchasing a handgun. Know the laws of your state when having a gun shipped to you. A licensed FFL dealer is required when shipping is involved.

(Part of the rear iron sight is missing, but I've ordered the replacement from Midway and will install it before sale.)  Has a nice leather sling.

There are a couple of upgrades. The bolt release has been upgraded to the Volquartsen automatic release style. It also has a Volquartsen target hammer, which reduces the trigger pull to a smooth 2.5lbs. The magazine release has been upgraded to the larger Bell and Carlsen paddle style to make it easier to remove the magazines. Included are a stock Ruger 10-round rotary magazine and a Butler Creek steel-lipped 10-round clear curved magazine. A Wilson Combat Shok-Buff recoil buffer has already been installed.  If you don't like the upgrades, I'm including all the original parts as well.

I had this rifle listed before with a scope, but I'm keeping the scope and dropping the price.  I'm willing to negotiate on price a little, so feel free to e-mail me with offers.  I'm not interested in trades at this time.

Ok somethings come up and I need to raise some cash Will sell for $335. I will not negotiate. If I can't get that I will just sell something else.

Also I have some ammo

This is the perfect gun for the all around sportsman. The field/ deer combo has a perfect setup to hunt ducks/geese/ turkeys. Then simply change out the barrel and you have a exceptional deer slug gun. This gun is brand new and has never been out of the box. I had recently purchased another shotgun and won this one a few weeks ago. I deer hunt in a rifle zone so I do not have a use for the slug option either. Send me an email or text me at REDACTED with any serious inquiries or offers.

Other information: This one is out of my personal collection! This SA Loaded rings true in every way including the name! I took this one and Cerakoted it Blue Titanium, then sanded down to an Eclipse/Black Stainless finish. At least 7 hours of wet sanding and polishing went into this. This pistol had a full boat upgrade package! Wilson Combat adjustable rear sight, Red Fiber Optic front sight (Dawson I think... cant remember), Smith & Alexander Mag Well, Smith & Alexander arched Mainspring housing, Full trigger job: Breaks at 2 3/4 lbs, this was professionally done. It has a Wilson extended mag release on it, and VZ Operator II Predator Green grips! I also threw on new stainless grip bushings and VZ Turbo Screws! Based on my range log it has a total of 600 rounds through it. Mostly 3.9grs Clays and 230 LRN bullets or 200gr SWC. It has original box and two Springfield Magazines. All in all, this was going to be my single stack backup pistol but, I never ended up needing it!

First, is probably the rifle I will hate to see go the most.  I am selling my Talo edition Henry Silverado.  It is number 45 of 750.  ABSOLUTELY stunning firearm!!  The pictures do not do this rifle justice!!!  I bought the gun brand new and it has been out the box twice...once when new to admire, then it was wiped down and stored in my safe until I pulled it out for pictures to list it.

Do the research and you will see how this rifle has appreciated in the last 2 years and it will only go up.  These are very scarce and most people who own them are not letting go of them.  This is also in the first 6% of serial numbers.  Every serious collector needs this for their collection.

Bought this spring and never shot.  Unexpected hospitalization forces sale.

The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market.

First w gotta h&r model 733 32 s&w. Seems like everything but a few screws are there. Has some pitting and all, but should make a good project for someone. Next is a little 25 semi auto. The papers that were with the gun labels it as a colt 1908 vest pocket pistol. I'm not for sure if that's what it is, that's just what the parts list w it said. All that's there is the outside. No barrel or anything, just the outsides and a mag.

Looking to trade for something. Will take a $100 for both. I looked up both in the blue book the colt said $225 on the low end and the h&r I couldn't find. Now I do understand that's for a firing weapon, so that's not what im asking. Just looking to trade both for something. In Sapulpa"

Mil Spec Buffer Tube has Plate and Castle Nut, it's as simple as taking the old of and putting the new on. I am FIRM on price $800, I'm already losing quite a bit of money, the AR15 and parts alone are worth more, than add in sales tax on all of it and labor cost to convert. I would like it gone but I'm not desperate to sell, it is more than worth what I'm asking and I'd rather hang on to it than lose more money. So if you are not a serious buyer move on.

DPMS Oracle AR15 .223/5.56 with Free Floating Barrel and 3 Mags
Selling my DPMS Oracle AR15 chamber in both .223 and 5.56, It's my first AR15 and it has been well taken care of with about 400 rounds through it flawlessly. I Bought it NIB from Cabela's in July 2013, this year so it's still almost brand new. No Failures to Fire, no jams, no failure to feed, nothing its been perfect. I've shot most rounds while standing at 50 meters(150feet) and held 1 inch groups with an EOTech 517. It has much more in it with someone who can push it farther than I can. Has been cleaned immediately after every shoot, and lubricated. It's a very good AR15 that I've taken care of and modified. All work was done at Hawk Tech Arms. 

16' Barrel with 1/9 twist and M4 chrome feed ramps. Barrel properly broken in, so 1 round fired and bore snaked, done multiple times for recommended break in.
Upper and Lower Receiver 7075 T6
Converted too 10 inch Free Floating Rail for improved accuracy and handling. Rail is heavy Duty Aluminum but still light in weight with rail slot markings.
YHM Low Profile Gas Block with Carbine Length Gas System
Hogue Black Psitol Grip
Comes with the original Metal Magazine and two Tapco Polymer Magazines
Original Box with Paperwork
Also comes with original parts taken off. The Bulky Gas Block that had a lower height than the Receiver, Plastic Standard AR15 Hand Guard(Carbine Length), and Hard AR15 Pistol Grip. I am FIRM on price $800, I'm already losing quite a bit of money, the AR15 and parts alone are worth more, then add in sales tax on all of it and labor cost to convert. I would like it gone but I'm not desperate to sell, it is more than worth what I'm asking and I'd rather hang on to it than lose more money. So if you are not a serious buyer move on. Must sign Bill of Sell and show ID. Thanks.

Type: Grip Parts
Specific Part: Grip Sleeve
For Gun Make: Kel-Tec
For Gun Model: PF-9

Model #PF9GR-R: Synthetic Copolymer Polyisobutylene Rubber

***NOTE*** Gun in displayed image is not included in sale. It is merely there for modeling and representation. It is like the Vanna White of PF-9's; you can look, but not touch!

These CUSTOM MADE slide on grip covers are non-slip, fit like a glove to the original grip and a fantastic way to tremendously improve shooting comfort, grip, accuracy / control of your Kel-Tec PF-9!

Since this is a custom item, there may be some variance in your shipped product, as compared to displayed product.

This sleeve also reduces the infamous ""KEL-TEC irritation"" that the checkering of the original grip causes. I'm sure if you have owned a Kel-tec handgun, you know what we're talking about.

The Grip Cover can reduce slippage if your hand perspires or during wet weather range time! It is a very thin (1.1mm thickness) and light (6-7g) synthetic copolymer polyisobutylene grip that can really add some comfort, or even a bit of tactical flare (TACTICOOL?) to your EDC CCW.

Also comes with easy installation tool and instructions! (Not shown)

***NOTE*** Gun in displayed image is not included in sale. It is merely there for modeling and representation. It is like the Vanna White of PF-9’s; you can look, but not touch!

These CUSTOM MADE slip on grip covers are non-slip, fit like a glove to the original grip and are a fantastic way to tremendously improve shooting comfort, grip, accuracy and control of your Kel-Tec PF-9! This sleeve also reduces the infamous irritation that the checkering of the original grip causes. The Grip Cover can reduce slippage if your hand perspires or during wet weather range time! It is a very thin (1.1mm thickness) and light (6-7g) synthetic copolymer polyisobutylene grip that can really add some comfort, or even a bit of tactical flare (TACTICOOL?) to your EDC CCW.

*W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.)"

HK USP .45V1 which comes with the following:

-UTL
-5 X 10rd factory magazines
-Safariland drop leg holster (only holds USP)
-Factory 3 dot sights (installed MTM night sights are faded)
-Factory cases for both the USP and the UTL

I am the first/only owner of this pistol and the USP has only been shot at indoor ranges. Overall, she is a safe queen. Considering her pedigree, she can take a lot more punishment than I could ever dish out from a range session. It has never been carried - I purchased the holster on a whim. The UTL has always been stored with the batteries removed and from the pictures you can see it is in working order. The reason that I am looking to sell/trade it is that I want something that will be easier to carry (just completed my CCW course).

As for partial trades, I am ""interested in"":

SIG 220 (especially beavertail models)
Glock 21 or 30 (Gen 4 only please)
S&W Ladysmith model revolver in .357 (for my fiancé)
Lever action rifle in .44 Mag or .45LC
Ruger 10/22 (take down model only)
Surefire X400 Ultra

I'm also open to hearing what else is out there for trade. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in trading for 1911 pattern pistols, shotguns, or any other types of rifles than those listed (sorry). I'm also not looking to part with any cash in the trade.

Of course, cash always works as well. I'd put the trade value of the package at $1200. I can also include some ammo (with an upwards price adjustment) depending on the deal.

FTF in NoVA requires 2 forms of ID and BoS. I will provide the same for a trade. I am also willing to ship to your FFL for shipping costs."
