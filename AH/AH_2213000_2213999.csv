I can ship this rifle, but buyer will be responsible for all shipping costs and insurance.  Rifle must be shipped to a FFL and I must have a current copy of their FFL license before I release the shipment.  No exceptions.

If you are serious about buying this, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  If you are just kicking tires, don't bother.

It was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and early 1960s.

Egypt introduced an adjustable gas operated system, whereas the Ljungman had been non-adjustable. The Hakim system is adjustable by use of a special tool and is a simple, direct impingement type whereby the flow of gas impacts directly on the front face of the bolt carrier, propelling it to the rear, which unlocks and moves the bolt as it does so. The U.S. M16 rifle utilizes a similar system, except the flow of gas into the system in that case is not adjustable and a self-regulating device of the Johnson/Stoner type is built into the bolt carrier assembly. The Hakim features a Tokarev-pattern tipping bolt system as used in the FN-49, SKS and MAS-49 rifles.

While the Ag m/42 Ljungman fired the 6.5×55mm cartridge, Egypt owned large stockpiles of 8×57mm ammunition, much of it left behind during World War II. To take advantage of the large stockpile, the Hakim was further re-engineered to accept the larger 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, which also necessitated the addition of a permanent, non removable muzzle brake to help reduce the concurrent greater recoil.

The result is a very cool semi-auto rifle that shoots a heavy caliber bullet, yet due to the muzzle brake the felt recoil is minimal when compared to say the semi auto Garand m1."

 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

It is a replica of the Beretta M9 but chambered in a 22 lr. I polished the barrel and I replaced the stock black grips with some really awesome Hogue Zombie grips. They really set it off. I also have the original ones if you wanted to change them back. It came with 2 ten rd clips from the factory but I have purchased 2 more so it will come with a total of 4 ten rd clips. It will have the brush for cleaning, the owners manual and the nice foam lined hard plastic carrying case that came with it. I have shot several types/brands of 22 lrs through this gun and it only likes CCI Mini Mags. I will throw in 100 rds of these with purchase of the gun. I am asking $300 for the gun and accessories wich is a really fair price considering what I have in it. Clips were $25 each times 2, Grips were $75 bucks and the cost of the gun wich is only around 3 months old and comes with a factory lifetime warranty. I would be interested in trading for a pump action 12 guage preferably a Pardner or Mossberg or similar. I really like the tactical version that holds the shells in/on the stock. Would also consider a lower end 1911 style .45 semi auto. Maybe a Taurus  or Rock Island??? Let me know what you have. If interested please contact me. Thanks for looking."

Details

The Omega Z5, the work horse of the Omega line-up, .50-Caliber Muzzleloader from Thompson/Center features a sealed pivoting breech design for simple operation and hassle-free cleaning. This muzzleloader uses the forward motion of its trigger guard lever to pivot the breech block downward, allowing for easy access to the 209 primer pocket while reducing exposure to rain, snow and sleet. With its 28"" barrel, the Omega burns magnum charges with maximum efficiency, producing high velocities for flatter trajectories and increased downrange energy, and the sealed breech plug is specially designed to avoid the problem of crushing Pyrodex pellets which could cause a misfire. Cleaning the Omega couldn't be easier since there is no bolt, barrel or stock to remove; simply pivot the breech block down, unscrew the breech plug and you're done. 

Accepts magnum charges of up to 150 grains of black powder, a Pyrodex equivalent or three 50-grain, .50-caliber Pyrodex pellets
28"" barrel with Quick Load Accurizer muzzle system delivers exceptional muzzle velocity
Durable laminated-hardwood stock with high comb and tastefully scalloped cheek piece
Patented hammer and trigger mechanism permits the hammer to make contact with the firing pin only when the trigger is pulled fully rearward for rapid shooting
Adjustable metal rear sight with fiber optic inserts and metal ramp-style front sight with fiber optics help you achieve a finer shot picture
Sealed pivoting breech design allows for easy access to the 209 primer pocket and protects it from undesirable weather conditions
Removable breech plug eliminates the need to disassemble the muzzleloader for quick and easy cleaning
Sling swivel studs
Solid aluminum rugged rod
Drilled and tapped for scope mounts (scope mounts included)"

The PMAG X 4
The PMAG is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine with round-count windows. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.  The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Angled Fore Grip (AFG)
Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.  The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

XTM Rail Panels 
These XTM Rail Panels are a two-piece design that attach anywhere on a 1913 Picatinny rail without having to remove previously-mounted accessories. The combination of design and material used in the XTM Panels ensures they will remain securely in place under all operating conditions, but may be easily removed using the tips of two rounds when necessary.

B.A.D. Lever.  
Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.  Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

Battery Storage Core.  
Internal core unit for the MIAD, MOE Grip, and MOE+ Grip designed to hold two (2) AA type batteries in a self contained waterproof unit.  Included internal spacer provides rattle free storage of either (2) AAA or (2) N size batteries (commonly used for EOTech sights).  Rubber cap has two sides with marking to identify ""spent"" batteries and can be opened with a push of the thumb.

The Magpul CTR buttstock 
(Compact/Type Restricted) – Commercial-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Commercial-Spec Model includes an extended 0.55"" rubber butt-pad to provide positive shoulder purchase and accommodates the longer, slanted back common to most commercial-spec tubes.

The MOE Grip 
Provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability in an economical, drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments. The MOE Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. All mounting hardware included.

EO Tech 512.  
The Model 512 is the most popular model HWS.  This tactical optic is perfect for agencies that want the best in CQB speed and versatility, without the need for night vision compatibility.
AA Battery Model (supports Lithium and Alkaline)
Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot
Includes rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-less mounting bolt
Interfaces to 1” Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) or Weaver rail

The GG&G EOTech 
Lens Covers fit between the EOTech hood and the body of the EOTech housing. They are spring operated so that once pressure is applied to release them from the closed position, they spring open. The rear cover lays across the top, so as not to interfere with the field of view. The front cover opens and serves as a sun shield. However, if heavy brush etc. is encountered, the front lens will fold back so that it is not damaged. Because of the contours of the EOTech housing, these rifle scope lens covers are not 100% waterproof, but they do prevent most dust, debris, rain and snow from accumulating on the lenses. These unique lens covers for scopes can be easily operated with either hand to provide flexibility of operation. The design and methodology is so unique that we were awarded a patent

FSL-3 Laser System Smaller and Smarter  
Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date.  Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.  Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.  The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

I love this gun, it is crazy accurate, but when I carry I prefer to have an external safety because I typically have one chambered, and this gun doesn't have that.  I already have another .40 caliber, so I am looking for a full sized 9mm because I already have ammo for it as well (my wife has a subcompact 9mm).  I may be able to throw in a little bit of boot money for the right deal, but I'm not looking to go broke on a deal, just seeing what I can get.  My Glock does have one small spot where a button rubbed it from where I carried it for a week (my holster has a button on it), this mark is shown in one of the pictures I am posting.  I'm not interested in selling, and I will not trade for a Hi Point, or any other cheap guns, so please don't bother asking me.  I'm not sure what generation this Glock is, it's not written on it anywhere.  If you are interested in trading, feel free to text me at REDACTED, or e-mail me at REDACTED.  Please have pictures of your trade.  Thank you in advance for your interest."

Pistol is in excellent condition. No idea of the round count. It was used when I bought it but in perfect shape. I have put around 150-200 rounds through it. Never had any issues. Its still very tight. Great pistol for carry. It fits in my pocket very easily.  The pistol comes with the hard plastic case, two mags, and a pocket holster.  Ammo not included. 

The pistol is double action striker fired. Trigger is long but very smooth and light. These are very good pistols. I just don't really use it anymore.

It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability.

Known for its compact size (the short barrel is just 3.4 inches long), customizable features and contoured frames, the P22 is a tactical pistol that target shooters, law enforcement and civilians can enjoy. Many P22 styles are available, and thanks to features like removable grip back straps and extended magazines, the firearm can be customized to fit the needs of the owner.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from their centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ... and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

This Walther P22 comes with the original box. It also has a laser, lock, and two magazines. I can also throw in some bullets if you'd like."

 This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 rifle for target sports, hunting or personal defense. Smith & Wesson was able to offer this rifle at such an incredible value by changing some features. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:9R twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time with exceptional accuracy performance. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dust cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, MagPul MBus rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. The perfect platform for a first-time AR-15 Build. The M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for!

I personally went through this gun and completely modified it. You may have heard that PA-63's are horrible shooters.. this one is most definitely not. I installed a full Wolff spring kit, which fixes the recoil issues as well as the heavy double action pull. Since the frame is made of aluminum I decided to polish it up to a mirror finish which makes it look amazing. It has a fixed barrel (like the walther pp) which makes it dead nuts accurate. The aluminum frame lightens the gun up enough to make this little Walther PP clone easier to carry than the PP.  Since it is a Walther PP clone it will accept any holster made for either the Walther PPK or PP.  It is only a Makarov in name due to the fact that it shoots the 9x18 Makarov round.."

The Judge includes the box, manuals, and a beautiful Rob Leahy leather holster.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

Features:
---Extended Ejector Rod For positive extraction of fired cases.

---Ribber Grip-Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
---Taurus Security System (TSS)rs-Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

---Transfer Bar-The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

---Fiber Optic Sight-Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic.
