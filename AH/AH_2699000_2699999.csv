He decided it was much cheaper to fire the Calico he has in .22 Long Rifle so he sold this one.  This firearm comes with the original manual, 1 50 rnd mag, and 2 never used 100 rnd mags.  This uses a Helical mag system that can be fully loaded when stored, the spring tension can be released using a button on the back of the mag, when you're ready to fired it, you simply ""wind"" it up to the recommended spring tension and you're ready to rock and roll.  This makes it easy to store up to 250 rnds of ammo, in magazines and ready for use at a moments notice.
Spent casings are ejected down so no hot brass in your shirt and can be easily retrieved, in addition the safety is ambidextrous so the weapon can be fired right or left handed with equal comfort and safety.    
May consider partial trades or make me an offer.   Text REDACTED or reply online.
*UPDATE*
Many have asked to purchase 1 of the 100 round mags so I've decided that I'm willing to sell them separately for $200 each, I won't sell the 50 rounder separately and if the mags are sold the pistol price will be $650."

Google Jerry Miculek using this combination and I think, like me, you may understand why this rifle is insanely wonderful for urban environments and home defense.

Location: Golden Valley, MN

Trade Options: I'll take up to a 700 trade on a handgun and the rest in cash.

Buy this rifle and piss off a liberal.

That's right, this actually IS an assault rifle as stated by the manufacturer. You buy this, and rainbow farting unicorns will drop out of the sky landing on the liberal dreamers that created them.

That's not all! You also get a very kick ass weapon. I've put 100 rounds down the pipe and I absolutely love this bullpup. I've wanted one for awhile, but unfortunately, the tax man cometh and is demanding I pay in this year to the tune of 4,600 dollars so I'm liquidating some assets. That doesn't mean I'm going to take it in the kiester on this sale. These are highly sought after rifles.

What you get:

TAVOR Flattop (Assault Rifle) 5.56mm
Model: IWI TAVOR TAR 21 Flattop (Standard)
The rest of the stats? http://tar21.com/iwi-tavor-tar21-rifle-iwi-us-civilian-carbines/ This is the black 16.5 inch version. Chrome lined and full of awesomeness.

The Tavor Assault rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier.

The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bullpup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left
handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material.

In fact I shot one of these pictures with my phone in one hand and the rifle in the other and its very easy to make 100 yard shots with one hand. The best part is my girly arm didn't even get tired, so I'm sure your tactical bicep will laugh and holding one handed shots.

Need a red dot? No problem - I'll throw in a Vortex StrikeFire which co-witnesses with the built in irons for an extra 75 bucks. It's never been used.

This rifle comes with everything that is included in the original box.

Liberals may not bid on this gun, unless you like the taste of unicorn meat.
Make sure before you buy this, you grow a beard."

The pistol has had 400 rounds of fiocchi 180 grain FMJ put through it in order to break it in. The magazines have been stored empty and I also have the 14 round spring kits on the off chance 17 rounds sounds like a bad thing to you. The safariland holster is specific to the PX4 and has never been used other than to make sure the pistol fits. The uncle mikes holster is a standard black pancake holster with an adjustable retention strap. The HSGI taco mag pouch has never been used, it spent its time attached to the pistol belt but was not stored with a magazine in it, I can say however that when you place a magazine in the pouch that thing isn't going anywhere unless you want it to, really good retention. The otis cleaning kit has been used but is complete with the exception of one small piece that was never used to begin with so I never felt it was any real loss, however the kit is in great condition. The pistol belt is a padded belt meant to wear over the top of your clothes, it has never been used other than to make sure that it was sized correctly. 115 rounds of the ammunition is Federal HST 180 grain JHP, 30 rounds are remington golden sabre 135 grain JHP, and the rest is Fiocchi 180 grain FMJ which was the left over ammunition from breaking the pistol in. All ammunition has been stored in ammo cans with Oxygen absorbers and is in great condition. Asking $550.00 for everything, local pickup only."

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included)."

The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Started life as a factory 450 Bushmaster 16 inch upper. That was boring soooo.....

*Ditched super heavy free float tube and Heavy railed Gas Block
*Chopped 1.5 inches off the barrel end. Now is a solid 14.6 inches
*Undercut the barrel behind the gas block, i believe to .90 now (took about 12 ounces of weight off, a pound total when added to the barrel shortening)
*Replaced gas tube and changed to YHM low profile gas block.
*Added Daniel Defense 12 inch MDF rail. 
*Cerrently has the stock ""Izzy"" Comp on barrel for total of 16.1 inches.

Bottom line is the upper is now much lighter, balanced, and handles like it should with minimal loss in performance. According to the chrono i dropped about 150 fps on the barrel but still right around 2000 fps. 
Solid performing pig/deer/grizzly bear/ DHS Zombie machine.

Total round count down the barrel is 20. Thats 10 rounds in stock configuration and another 10 after I made it right. The Izzy on the barrel end is yet unpinned as I wasnt sure what kind of brake i would go with. As it sits now, you still do not need one, the recoil is not bad at all for a 2000 fps rifle slinging 250 grain projectiles. smile

You Get:
*The complete upper as stated.
*200 + or - rounds Hornaday factory ammo 250 grain in boxes.
* 3 Ar Magazines with single stack followers for the 450.

$1,500

I will not break up this package and as far as trades go.... They would have to be pretty cool.

No Cracks in Wood; Engraving Excellent.

First offered in 1937, the all-steel Featherlight is an improvement on the basic Remington Model 17 shotgun design. It won acclaim by virtue of being about a pound lighter than its nearest competitor. Rather than reducing weight through the use of alloys, the steel-receivered Model 37 employs a clever design that uses as few operating parts as possible. Also, these parts are lightened wherever possible.

Unlike most of its pump-action contemporaries, the Ithaca Model 37’s bolt locks into its stressed steel receiver. Rather than locking into a barrel extension as with other designs, the Model 37’s bolt locks by tipping up into a recess in the rear and locking directly into the receiver.

A notable design feature of the Model 37 is its bottom ejection port. This is helpful in keeping dirt and debris out of the action and has made the shotgun a favorite for many left-handed shooters. It also protects the shooter’s face in the event of a catastrophic case head failure by venting gases downward."

This is the earlier one that was still built on the thicker receivers.  The newer ones are now using standard 1mm thick stamped receivers. This is probably my favorite AK it just doesn't get shot as much as my SBR M92 so it was time to clear it out of the safe.  The only thing not 100% on it is that the previous owner had screwed a rail section onto the polymer hand guards, and I have never replaced them.  So there are four small holes in the hand guards, top and bottom, where the rail was located.  I probably has around 500 rounds that I ran through it. I cannot speak for sure on the round count before I bought it in 2007, but if did not look like it had been shot much at all."
