The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

120,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2857120,For Sale:  Taurus PT99 AFS,"Southeast, Terre Haute, Indiana",$ 450,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 9, 2014",Handguns,Taurus                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Taurus PT99 AFS pistol with two original 17 round magazines (These magazines have never been used.). Included are the rubber Pachmayr grips that are installed, as well as the original polymer grip panels. Also included is an EFK Fire Dragon dual-action recoil spring with two-piece SS guide that is installed, as well as the original spring and guide, along with the owner's manual.

The price for these items is $450.00 (Plus a $20.00 FFL fee to cover my end of the sale if shipped within IN , or out-of-state to an FFL holder.) If another Indiana resident wants to meet with me to purchase this pistol, I am willing to travel to Plainfield, for example, to conduct the transaction. However, I do require an IN photo ID and an IN LTCH be provided by those I meet, or it will prove to be a wasted trip for both of us unless we use an FFL holder to transfer the firearm at the buyer's expense.

Extra items that can be included in a larger package deal are three 17 round nickel plated Mec-Gar magazines, and three blued 17 round Mec-Gar magazines at $10.00 each. Also, four Mec-Gar 18 round magazines can be included for $20.00 each. [If sold separately, the individual price for the six 17 round magazines is $20.00. And the individual price for the four 18 round magazines is $30.00.] If all of the listed magazines are included in the package, this will raise the total price to $590.00 plus the $20.00 FFL fee (Total: $610.00).

The only problem I experienced with this particular PT-99 is with the rear sight blade, which came loose from the sight assembly... No, I can assure prospective buyers that this pistol was never dropped or otherwise abused. In fact, I solved this problem by inserting a small piece of barely discernable polymer tubing under the rear sight blade. This action not only fully secured the sight blade but does not prevent it from being adjusted. A new rear sight assembly can always be purchased from Taurus if the new owner so desires.

Only those who want to purchase this pistol and accessories will receive a response from me, since I'm tired of being annoyed by those who have no intention of actually buying the items I'm selling. 

Prospective buyers who wish to use an FFL holder must supply me with their full name and FFL mailing address and phone number (NO TEXTING) within twenty-four hours, or I will consider the transaction null and void. [Indiana residents who want to meet with me must supply me with their full name, phone number (NO TEXTING), and the public place and time during daylight hours they want to meet to conduct the transaction.] Once I receive the required information, I will supply the buyer who wants the items shipped with my full name and mailing address where they can send payment in full via money order. Once I receive payment in full, I will then notify buyer when their order has shipped.

My prices and terms are not negotiable."

Two 13 round and two 16 round extended magazines. It has Trijicon night sights. I am not the original owner so exact round count is not known. I have put around 250 rounds through it myself. I will eat everything you try to put through it. It comes with 25 rounds of Remington Golden Sabre, 15 rounds of Regular Hornaday hollow point, and 12 rounds of PMC range ammo. There are a couple of flaws that happened before I got and they are that the someone has dremeled the grip down around the palm safety, but it doesn't affect the way it holds or shoots. The second thing is that the rear sight is nicked on top probably from being bumped as it was being carried. It is also my daily carry so it does have a little bit of holster wear.  What you will get is the gun, 4 Magazines, a generic case, 52 rounds of ammo. I DO NOT have the XD case with accessories. I do however have two holsters one IWB and one pancake. I also have a leather single mag carrying case and a Hopps cleaning kit. I am asking $450 for the whole package, but would take $400 for just the gun, mags,case, and ammo. If interested please reply to this ad or you can text me at REDACTED. Two forms of VA id and bill of sale required. Thank You.

It already has the screw upgrade kit, HK push pins, HK rear sight, and GSG5 conversion kit done. Plus the cocking handle has a buffer installed so you can get slap happy and slap the cocking handle down all day like a real HK. It has 50 rounds through it total. Comes with three 20 round mags, 100 rounds of CCI mini-mag 22lr, the conversion kit if you want to go back to the GSG522 style components, and everything else in the picture. This is NOT the lightweight model with plastic upper. It is the metal standard model.

You can mount the collapsible stock with the push of a pin, BUT do so at your own risk as you are making a SBR subject to NFA rules at that point, so you can get the stamp if you like. I include the stock because I dont want extra parts I wont use for anything else. I have a picture in this config for informative purposes only.

The flash hider screws off and a suppressor adapter is available at hkparts.net. Again, caveat emptor for installing that part as rules apply.Thers are lots of parts and accessories for the GSG. Noise wise this guy is pretty quiet even with nine inches of barrel. It is a little louder than my Ruger 10/22 carbine but not much. If you spent a lot of time around helicopters and artillery you wont even need air plugs.

This is a great little gun and is fun to shoot. It is heavy and feels like a real MP5. The trigger has a long pull and is two stage. Kinda like a real MP5 too. I have other things to buy, so time to liquidate some firearms.

I have owned it for almost two years and have barely ridden it.  My back hurts too much to get worthwhile rides out of it so I'm selling it and looking for a cruiser or something a bit more comfy for long 300 mile rides.  

The good:
only 1600 maintained miles.  No wheelies, but I have taken it up to 140mph on one occasion.  Followed the proper break in procedure however.  
Michelin pilot power tires with less than 300 or so miles.. new enough they still have the new tire knobs on them.  Also comes with a new dunlop qualifier front tire (rear tire got a bad nail so I replaced both tires with the michelins)
Akripovix Ti exhaust ( still have the factory exhaust included)
Flush mount tail light (still have stock tail light too)
LiIon battery installed over winter.  Doesn't require charging and I know this is true.  The last one I had on my daytona laster 5 years before it started dying and i never charged it once.
Oil change performed with mobil1 @ 1200 miles.


The bad:
I was putting it in storage and it fell over.  The right side fairing has a scuff and a crack.  It would need to be replaced since 2 mounting tabs broke off.  I priced it online brand new OEM is 279.00$ shipped.  Also the right mirror has a chip missing out of the plastic surrounding the glass about the size of  a pencil eraser.  Cosmetically I just feel like mentioning it.

Other than that there isnt a scratch on it and it runs great.  I am in Portales, Nm right next to Clovis, Nm.  If you want to go for a ride, I'm fine with that as long as you have a motorcycle endorsement on your license and have cash in hand.  I have a helmet, jacket, and gloves im throwing in with the bike.

I am interested mostly in selling it outright, but I would be willing to take partial trade for guns.  Particularity a nice Garand or a nice AR.  Not really looking for all sorts of attachments... Just a well built AR.  Not really interested in any handguns at the moment.

Thanks for looking!

Pictures on request.  Bike is black on black.  I can always go to the storage unit and text you pictures from it however you want."

The FN AR is a magnificent rifle, well suited to many different tasks, and chambered in a very versatile caliber.  Looking for a new hog hunting rifle?  You found it, the 16"" fluted barrel and pistol grip make this little power house point instinctively, while its relatively light weight makes it a joy to carry. Or maybe you are looking for a Designated Marksman Rifle?  Again, look no further.  The raised comb of the stock, picatinny base, and forward picatinny tri-rail can fulfill all your DMR needs.  Basically, what you are getting is a compact rifle, that is easy to carry, soft to shoot, with awesome accuracy potential when coupled with match grade ammo.  

Which brings me to the next portion of our deal, not only have we knocked the retail price down, but also we are going to throw in 200 rounds of match grade .308 ammo.  This ammo is Remington Premier Match 175gr Sierra match-king BTHP, and man does it shoot.

I've put 200 rounds through the rifle. There is no cant in the sight, gas block etc. Very accurate. AK-74 style muzzle brake (aftermarket chrome lined) mitigates recoil very well, does exactly what it was designed to do. Lock up is tight on the folder and is the most durable, rugged stock for an AK IMHO. Workhorse. Extremely well made. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask questions.

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.
The Sig M400 Series Tactical Rifle was designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16” chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

tem 4A (305gr. Hard Cast gas Checked LFN) is designed for super deep penetration on large game. The big flat nose keeps the bullet penetrating straight and thus deep. You can expect a good three + feet of penetration in normal flesh and bone. The flat nose also does considerably more damage than a round nosed type of bullet as the flat nose cuts and smashes it way through living matter, while round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing much less damage along the bullet’s path and achieving more shallow penetration due to getting sideways while “slipping and sliding” through matter.
You’ll note my below velocities from over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.

1.       Ruger Bisley cut down to 6 inches------1328 fps
2.       Ruger Red Hawk 5.5 inch-----------------1331 fps

Sentences are of poor grammar.
I used the smart method of asking for a picture next to american USA curreny,simply thirty six cents,in three dimes a nickel and a penny next to the 1911.

SCAMMERS emails ive notcied have been from ""OUTLOOK"" email accounts,email them twice,i found that the COLT S.A.A. Was replied back by two different email OUTLOOK accounts both with different names and poor english.

LINDA MCNAMARA did and will not comply,nor will she/he,bring it to an FFL unless thr CHECK is cashed..i asked just for FFL to take a look at it and she denied my requests.

These NIGHTHAWK CUSTOM 1911s and some WILSON COMBAT 1911s,mostly high-end pistols,most recently a COLT SAA engraved are all SCAMS.
Be careful and just ask for a certain amount of change next to the firearm you wish to purchase id they cant prove it with that simple picture...RUN AWAY its a professional SCAMMER..if you want to catch one ask where they want the check addressed to and they willchange their mind and say they want a WIRE TRANSFER or WESTERN UNION type money transfer..these are clear cut signs of a SCAMMER."

I must note the few early Pre-Production revolvers are marked blem on the box. My sales rep. told me they are all marked that way because they are pre-production and that is the way the factory wanted them listed. The official claim is inconsistency in the evenness of the finish but I do not see any blems on the gun, so I have to believe the rep on this one.

I LOVE MINE!

these are great rifles. they are made by a machining company and the parts are tight. i got one for myself and sold my rock river elite operator and put my own stuff on this one.




i have this new in the case and i have one myself and it is dead on accurate and never jams. this rifle is a high-end rifle at a discount price. it beats the dpms,bushmaster,del-ton,and others in this price range. it has a LIFETIME WARRANTY! the barrel is good for 150000 rounds. it comes with one 30 round tapco mag,instructions,and a case.

AR-15 Rifle .223 / 5.56 NATO Caliber Semi Auto Flat Top Rifle W / M4  Barrel, 30 Round Mag and Hard Case by Bear Creek Arsenal
Chambered for .223 Wylde which accommodates Std .223 Remington as well as 5.56 NATO rounds.
Beautiful Smooth Parkerized Finish. 1 in 9 twist rate on barrel is highly accurate with a variety of bullet weights.

This is bar none the best AR-15 Rifle Value in the U.S. today.

We have torture tested these rifles and I would put them up against anything being sold for reliability...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark,
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 NATO is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

Only 3000 were made. It has a 4 inch pinned barrel, a six shot recessed cylinder, a case hardened trigger and hammer, and fixed sights.
