Includes original case, owners manual, lock, two magazines, optics rail, and magazine loader.  I changed out the front sight to a HiViz Fiber Optic sight for much better visibility.  The 22/45 is a great training pistol for new or young shooters.  The 22/45 has a the same grip angle and control locations as a 1911A1.  Initially purchased this at Larry's for a wife who has since lost interest in shooting.  I don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it.  Would make a great Christmas present for a young shooter this year.

I know it works too, because I've personally killed a shit load of things with it. Best thing about the Mossberg? They're unbeatable in a blind. You don't need gun oil, Shit you can just spit your Copenhagen in it.(not that I've ever done that, because that would be ridiculous.) Anyways back to myrtle, yeah that's right I named her. Myrtle, alright so she's got a 24"" barrel with a believe a modified choke. I've never checked or taken it out. Because the first day I took it out I dropped 6 birds, and a goose. The stock and pump are wood, although the only way you'd be able to tell is if you personally spent the time to remove the paint job. YEA, that's right sports fans. Myrtle just came outta my beauty parlor. She's got a 5 step paint job. I call it cat tails. I used high temp paints, and 3 layers of clear coat. So it should last longer than you. It is designed for use in a blind. Although, I'd say the paint is unique."

A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.

The SureFire M900 Vertical Foregrip WeaponLight delivers the tactical advantages of increased weapon control plus 500 lumens of ultra-reliable LED illumination. The light output is focused by a TIR lens into an intense, comparatively tight beam capable of illuminating mid-range targets and beyond, along with providing significant surround light for peripheral vision. The M900 also features two low-output LED navigation lights. Three switches control the primary beam: two momentary-on pressure pads on the vertical grip itself (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch at the rear of the light housing. The navigation lights are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch at the bottom of the grip turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage.

Semi-automatic with fixed 10 round magazine (included) or removable 20-40rd magazines (not included, but legal). Beautiful stainless steel fold out blade bayonet. Almost all of these rifles you see will have an ugly black spike for a bayonet, but these early Sino-Soviet models have the more costly to produce blade bayonets. Has a 'trap door' style mechanism (also stainless steel) inside the stock that houses a complete cleaning kit (included).

It was assembled at Jianshe Arsenal in China during the era of Sino-Soviet cooperation (1956 roughly, exact manufacture date unknown), but using Russian parts and with Russian supervision. The rifle has Jianshe Arsenal stampings, but otherwise only Russian characters (no Chinese characters except the Jianshe Arsenal triangles). It is an all milled receiver (not stamped!). The stock is very interesting - it appears to be a harder wood than the ""Chu wood"" the Chinese typically used, perhaps of Russian origin. The stock also has some extensive trench art in it, including the initials ""SD"" and the word ""POGRADEC,"" (a city in Albania) leading me to believe this rifle saw service in Albania. 

The rifle is unbelievably reliable, one of the nicest actions I have ever seen on an SKS. Everything operates smooth as silk. The bore is overall in good shape and was originally chrome lined. The rifling is in great shape and it's a great shooter. I have put 300 rounds through it, and have never once had a failure or malfunction of any kind, even with cheap steel case ammo. No failures to feed, to failures to eject, it just eats up and spits out anything you put in it. If you need a rifle that you KNOW will work, even if it's raining out and it's covered in mud, this is the rifle for you. Perfect hunting gun for the islands.

I will throw in about a dozen 7.62x39 stripper clips that I have verified to be the perfect size for feeding into this rifle. Will throw in a box of FMJ ammo as well.

The rifle is 100% legal and registered in my name, so the purchaser will have to meet me at the Wailuku Police Department to sign the rifle over (no cost I don't think, provided you have a permit to acquire rifles)."

VERY, very similar to the German k98 Mauser.  I purchased it for a sniper build from the grandson of the last owner where it spent 30+ years in a gun safe.  I'm working on another sniper build that is consuming more resources than expected. $300 no trades.  I have some ammo for it too, I spent a lot of time cleaning and studying its history. It is an import that was most likely acquired in the late 60's.  It was manufactured by the Ottoman Turkish empire. They used the German k98 as basis for the M38 production.

This is not a cheap version from a catalog. This is one of those big systems that they have at your local archery range where you shoot at a screen with your bow and arrows and have to put on the special tips on your arrows and the computer scores your shot. There are leagues that use these throughout the year or random customers that pay by the session at the local archery shop to use this system. I will try to explain everything as much as I can. I acquired this system from a guy that had an archery shop that went out of business and he packed it away in boxes and it sat there for a while. I thought I would buy about the same time a friend of mine was buying a house that we could set it up in. Unfortunately, his house will not accommodate this system so I am selling it. I contacted technosight and talked to a very friendly sales person that explained the system to me. This is an approximately early 2000's timeframe model. It was what she called a ""wintress"" model. It has a laserdisc player with remote, 15 different laser discs with different shooting/hunting scenarios, a projector to project the video on the large white folded screen, instruction books, software, two boston acoustic speakers, a bunch of cables, brackets for the projector, extra bulbs for the projector, the sensors that you mount to the wall to track your shot. This system does not have the computer or the frame for the screen. The frame for the screen can be built out of wood by anyone that is fairly knowledgeable with tools. The computer I have seen on ebay for about 100 dollars. My research shows it used a dell optiplex 300 computer. Since I have not had the opportunity to install/test this system out due to lack of an area to do so, I have not had the chance to play with it and install it, etc. However, the system originally sold for about 18,000 dollars and was on sale at the AMO archery show for about 15,000 dollars back when it was new. Someone could install at there archery shop and charge for the hour or half hour, or perhaps install in a large trailer and charge by the shot at a sports show. I talked with the sales rep and just the screen is about 500 dollars new and the tips for the arrows are about 50 dollars for a small package. I can give you contact info for technosight and the person that fixes and repairs these systems in Michigan. I hope I am describing everything the best I can. I can try to answer questions the best I can during the time of the auction. Any questions, just let me know."

LaRue Tactical PredatOBR™ 7.62 
The PredatOBR 7.62 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. 

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the supplied Roll-Bag and Tool Box. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/11.25 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire.

About the “Black Gold” Trigger:
We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world. 

We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

If you are looking for a great dependable Daily Driver or Work Truck, This is for you.

I got the truck and it needed a new axel and entire brake drum assemblies. I put an entire new used differential assembly in it. I also put brand new brake drum assemblies on it including drums, lines, brake shoes, wheel cylinders, self adjusting kit, and a hardware kit. So everything on the rear is brand new. The old axel did have a ABS sensor in the top of the housing and the new axel was not drilled for it so the ABS light is on due to being unplugged. I can show you where it is on the truck so you can be reassured nothing is wrong.

The truck's previous owner had a new fuel pump and fuel filter put in in December. I have records for it.

I just did all the following services this week.
I have machined the front rotors
Coolant flush service
Brake Flush service
Battery Service as well as Corrosion Preventative
Balanced all wheels.
Entire Chassis Lube

The truck was a work truck for the previous owner. It has dents and scratches. It has one spot of rust above the Drivers Bed Wheel well. The outside Drivers door handle is also broken off. The inside isn't the cleanest but will clean up with some work. The only other thing is that the check engine light is on for an ECT code. (Electronic Coolant Temperature Sensor) The sensor isn't sending a temperature reading back to the instrument Cluster. The truck does not overheat at all and this does not affect the drivability at all.

I will be taking this to work tomorrow with me and doing an Alignment. It doesn't pull right now and drives straight, I just want to make sure everything is within Factory Specifications.

KBB (Kelly Blue Book) values this truck right at $3100.

I am asking $2,000 Firm. Cash only.

I have a clean, clear, and open title ready to go.

I am open to trades on top of cash though. Looking for $1000 to 1500 plus trades. Price is negotiable depending on the trade

Interests are Firearms, things with motors, quads, high quality tools (Snap On, Matco, Mac, Cornwell), quality car audio, car trailer, quality tool box(same brands as above).Possibly iPad 4 trade but must be in excellent condition. Like I said, Price is negotiable depending on the trade.

Hey everyone, 
I have available for trade or sale a white iPhone 5 16gb for Sprint. It is in awesome condition and was only carried by me for about 9 months. It will come with box, paperwork, earpods (unused), wall wort (charger), USB cable, and possibly an otterbox as well (if I can find the darn thing haha). It also is covered by applecare until next october. I am only selling because i just upgraded so i no longer have a used for this one. This is a great way to get a new phone for alot cheaper tan buying without contract in store. If you have any questions, or for pictures please message me here or text me. I would also be interested in some partial trades for firearms, or even full trades. But please value your trades fairly, I dont want anyone trying to do a straight trade for a 150 dollar gun is all. Dont waste my time and I wont waste yours. thank you. Also, I would prefer to meet in or around norman. I am willing to travel some but it has to be worth it for me to do so. I can include cash or other extras on my end, but only if it is something i really want.
Thanks again!
JB

It is in great condition both inside and out and I can guarantee you it shoots as well as it looks.  

Also included is a Burris Speedbead which is a cool optical sight with a red dot that orients itself with the barrel of the gun even if you aren’t shouldering it perfectly.  It is great for pointing the gun while hunting or shooting clays, especially if you have to shoulder it quickly and don’t have that extra second to make sure your body is lined up perfectly.  

What is included with the sale:
-Beretta A391 Xtrema 2 – 12 Guage – 28” Barrel – Max 4 Camo
-Speedbead (which is removeable)
-7 choke tubes (5 stock Beretta and 2 extended chokes) and choke tube wrench
-Spacer for stock
-Gun Oil
-Beretta gun case

Let the PITBULL fill that need and so much more.

The PIT BULL makes you safer in TWO ways:  a bright 160 lumens LED flashlight & 11 million volt stun gun will change the bad guy's mind.  Both functions work off the same pair of switches.  A master switch on the butt protects you and your little ones from your new toy.

Each package contains a PIT BULL, an AC charging cord, a nylon carrier, and an operational manual.  This flashlight / stun gun is made of aluminum so it can take abuse, unlike the more common plastic models.  

Even if you carry a concealed firearm, you must always have a flashlight for low level light confrontation.  It might as well being shocking.

This unit is very discreet; there is no indication when viewing this flashlight that it is also a powerful stun gun.  The stun gun prongs feature is built in to the rim of the flashlight and are smooth to the touch.  Your attacker will not see it coming.  Very likely a warning crackle could prevent an assault from happening.

Seven inches, black aluminum, nylon holster with a belt loop included for those wanting to carry it on their belt. It also fits well in a pocket, purse and glove box.  Real estate agents and other professionals love this model; folks that need a bright light and security.  


One of my clients has put one in every car.   

Give your loved ones the chance to protect themselves.

When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a combat shotgun, they bought a Benelli. That's because a combat shotgun has to function the first time, every time. The Benelli M4 does it for the U.S. military, and now can be the centerpiece of your own home defense plan. Benelli engineers developed and patented a unique auto-regulating gas-operated (ARGO) system. Dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber operate directly against the bolt assembly. It's a simple and dependable system that eliminates the complex linkage, springs and heavy parts that other semi-automatic shotguns have to depend on. The result is marine-tough reliability under the harshest environmental conditions. The M4 comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a ghost-ring fully adjustable rear sight, and fixed-blade front sight. This variation features a rugged black synthetic stock and a pistol grip and holds five rounds of ammunition.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges, based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a combat shotgun, they bought a Benelli. That's because a combat shotgun has to function the first time, every time. The Benelli M4 does it for the U.S. military, and now can be the centerpiece of your own home defense plan. Benelli engineers developed and patented a unique auto-regulating gas-operated (ARGO) system. Dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber operate directly against the bolt assembly. It's a simple and dependable system that eliminates the complex linkage, springs and heavy parts that other semi-automatic shotguns have to depend on. The result is marine-tough reliability under the harshest environmental conditions. The M4 comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a ghost-ring fully adjustable rear sight, and fixed-blade front sight. This variation features a rugged black synthetic stock and a pistol grip and holds five rounds of ammunition.

 I have a brand spanking new Briggs & Stratton 7KW Standby Generator up for sale. Still in the box, on the pallet, and with all materials and instructions included. Comes with transfer switch, and remote control box. It does not come with the battery necessary to start in an emergency.
 This same model sells on Amazon, Ebay, and others from $1900-$2300.00. This is the EM7 model, not to be confused with some of the others.
 I would also be open to trades. Let me know what you have. Absolutely no ""projects"", no junk, no rust-buckets. If you don't want it, neither do I. This would be perfect as a backup to your heating system this winter. Ohio winters are notorious for power outages and this one certainly fits the bill. Thank you

 I am not willing to stick any money into a trade. Winter weather is coming soon to Ohio and if power is lost, so is your heat! Thank you

The TA31RCO Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of failure-prone batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. The TA31RCO's Bindon Aiming Concept allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

As the title says I have a revolver i just named Dr Jeckyll & Mr Hyde. Ive called it that because this rare beauty sadly was laid on it's left side in a gun collectors safe for 20 years after he passed away in the 90's. His wife left all 20 of his gorgeous and rare old smiths untouched and un-oiled for the following 20 years until current. It has no nicks and dings and it has a pretty nice finish on it's right or passenger side. But it's got a fair bit of light pitting on the left side. So what we have here is a gun that books at $1200-1400 easily in it's configuration if it weren't pitted. I don't know how to fix this other than polish and blast it back down and reblue it. And while that might fix the finish, it would obviously take it value down and that's why I've priced it as I have. It would make a VERY high end truck gun or house gun. These guns are hard to find and especially in the target version. This was an unfired gun as well, do despite it's freckling on the drivers side, it locks up tight as a bank vault, has a virginal bore and almost no ""line"" on the cylinder at all. This is the version with the ultra wide and deeply checkered hammer and trigger. It's action is light and breaks like glass like many of the fine old smith wheelguns. Adjustable sights. This is also the better built Pinned and recessed barrel and cylinder model. Has original serialized blue box, wax paper, manual and wood ""football"" grips that it came originally with and tools. Also comes with brand new Hogue tamer fingergroove grips as well. No Trades. Cash only. $525

Also a real steel frame with no mim parts. These are both in excellent shape. They are 1988 and 1991 issue respectively. The 88 is in great shape. I was going to say excellent until the gunsmith at Blob's Gun shop in norfolk gouged the dovetail putting sights on it yesterday a bit. This is still the coolest of the two. It's wearing od green oem sig grips and TFO dual fiber optic and tritium night sights. It's also Boldly stamped Herndon, VA as the late 80's ones were imported there. I like the early ones best. The second gun is also an early Westie P226, but in 1991 it got the early nitron finish and it is in pretty much perfect shape for a 22 year old gun! The barrel, slide, frame ans barrel hood have almost n wear at all. This 91 i bought from an army veteran who bought it to molle on his person on missions in serbia. Seldom ever fired.

This looks like some mismatch and it's not. This is a factory matching correct gun in excellent shape. The ""75 Pre B Transitional"" is before the cz 75B and has no firing pin blocks and naturally much better triggers and less to break. Also it sports the sexy original slide profile of the pre-b guns. The transitional models were made in the end of the Pre B runs just before the CZ 75B first came out. It has the new notched trigger guard and better mag release of the upcoming models, but the accuracy, slimness and no firing pin blocks of the pre b's. Best of everything and a factory offering for 2 years back in the 80's. The slide and barrel was Cerakoted in black ice and the frame has been done in double coated cerakote matte battle silver. The hammer, safety and slide release were done in matching black ice. The Czech and logo stampings and cz 75 model were all done in a final silver flake etching. Looks super sharp! A factory 16 round mag Cerakoted matching silver is included as well as a polished steel 15 rounder and a CZ Shadow 18 round competition mag with basepad. $690 with the first two mags or $775 for all three mags incl the 18 rounder and a brand new black right hand Galco Leather Holster. Considering the Holster cost $85 and the Shadow magazine cost $50 it's a pretty great deal! This is a LAZERBEAM smooth gun!

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."
