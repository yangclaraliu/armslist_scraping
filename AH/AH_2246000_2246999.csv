I am the second owner, to my knowledge. Bought this about 1.5 years ago with the intents of becoming a bow hunter... not really thinking about the fact that I have no where near by to practice with the bow. I don't fell confident in my ability to get a clean, humane kill.. so I've never hunted with it and haven't even had the opportunity to shot it in a year. It's got a couple of dings on it from the previous owner, but all in all is a very nice bow that comes very well equipped with everything you need to start bow hunting or upgrade your current set up.

In addition to the Z9, the package includes: QAD Ultrarest, HHA Adjustable sights, Yellow accents and sling, Axion stabilizer, about 15 easton aluminum arrows (most never shot), target arrow heads, 3 new in box muzzy broadheads, 4 new in box Bludgeon small game arrow heads, and a Plano hard case.

I'd just as soon sell it all to one person, but will listen to offers on parting it out."

I also have the Palmetto Box the gun came in.  

I have only put 5 rounds through it to confirm zero.  

Not interested in trades, unless you have an FN FNX 45 Tactical for trade.  Price is firm.

I am selling my lightly used Smith & Wesson 638 J frame revolver which was purchased just last month. This revolver has a 5 shot capacity. It has a shrouded hammer so it can be fired single action or double action. This makes it great for concealed carry as the hammer will not snag on clothing. Single action is a great option for getting those more accurate shots at the range.

I have put 100 rounds through this firearm with no issues at all.

Included in the bundle is the firearm itself (includes manual and gun lock). Installed is a Pachmayr Compaq grip for getting a full 3 finger grip on it. Along with the Pachmayr, 2 original boot grips will also be included, which are pink and black.

Also included are 400 rounds of full metal jacket 38 special for target practice and 50 rounds of Remington Golden Saber hollow point 38 special +P for self defense. That's 450 rounds total.

Finally included is a pack of A-Zoom snap caps for safe dry fire practice and reload drills/practice.

This bundle is great for a new shooter, or someone looking for a great conceal carry option. It has everything included for one to get familiar with this firearm. Snapcaps for dry fire/reload practice, target ammo for target practice, and self defense ammo for home defense/conceal carry.

I am ONLY selling this as a bundle together. I will NOT sell seperately. I am only looking for cash. NO trades.

All together I am asking $490. Must be face to face and buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale. I will only meet locally, also depending on distance. I would prefer to meet at a gun shop or shooting range, if possible.

I think this is a fair price considering the ammo alone will cost you about $200 total.

If interested and/or have any questions, you can email me at

Thanks!"

I put a new Vertex SPARC Red Dot (with included 2x magnifier) on it right out of the box, and zeroed it - maybe 2 magazines tops. Then went to the range and plinked off another few magazines before my wife decided that she wasn't a 'rifle girl' (whatever that means). This is a super fun plinker / tactical trainer with only 200 rounds fired through it!! 

When I bought this I was torn between this and a M&P 15/22. Once I held them both it was pretty easy to see that the Sig was the better choice - much more substantial and doesn't feel like a plastic squirt gun. My friends with 15-22's agree, so I'm not too biased. Comes with everything in the box, 25 round mag, manual, Vertex Red Dot, 2x magnifier, lock, manual, etc."

The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

Dual-function vertical grip locks to the bottom accessory rail of your tactical rifle’s forend to give you enhanced control during CQB and a stable bipod rest for precise long-range fire. The grip’s hand-filling contours and deep grooves provide a solid purchase even when your hands are wet. Hit the large, deeply grooved release button, and a powerful spring deploys the legs instantly. Conveniently placed for thumb activation, the button sits flush with the surrounding surface to prevent accidental deployment. Extended legs provide sufficient elevation for a standard 30-round magazine to clear the ground, and will not snag on brush, vehicle interior, or other gear when retracted. Legs and grip are made of tough, injection-molded polymer; steel cross-bolt with easy-grip thumbscrew locks directly to any MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail to ensure a rock-solid fit. GPS-02 has steel inserts in legs for maximum strength in high-stress tactical operations. May be used on many non-AR rifles and light machine guns with forend accessory rails.

Included with the sale is a leather formed paddle holster, green night sights (installed), a box of Federal hollow points, a box of Hornady Critical Duty ammo, an extra extended mag, and the box and paperwork The price is $600 cash as this gun new was over $700 without the extra mag and accessories and local sale only as I will not travel.

Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular round and a laser dot will show exactly where the gun is aiming. It’s easy to sight in any device without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in your shotgun. It’s easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills.

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.

THE SIGM400 SERIES TACTICAL RIFLE, designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

- Direct impingement gas operating system with rotating locking bolt
- 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Chrome-lined barrels with phosphate finish

24 inch barrel, 3"" chamber, fixed modified choke on the 20 gauge. Yes it fires slugs just fine, I have done so with zero problems. One of the differences on the ""D"" variant is the monte carlo style stock, which many prefer.

As many know, these are hard to find. I'm only selling to pay for another even harder to find combo gun I purchased recently.

$480 OBO, include some .22 and/or 20 gauge depending on the deal.

952,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2246952,For Sale:  MAGPUL Gen3 NATO 5.56/.223 CA rebuild kits,"OC, Los Angeles, California",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, December 7, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

It came with a Hogue tamer pistol grip, which is currently installed. I bought a new stock and forend which have the Mossy Oak Breakup Infinity pattern on it. I installed the new forend, which has the actual metal slide tube, not where the rails are just pinned directly to the plastic like this model normally has. I purchased a limbsaver recoil pad for the butt stock. This doesn't kick hard enough to need it, but the recoil pad that came with the stock is a wierd fit. This gun is quite controllable even with the pistol grip. It makes an excellent close quarters defense tool. Also has a 4-shot side-saddle shell carrier attached.
