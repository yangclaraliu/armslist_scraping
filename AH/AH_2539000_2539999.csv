It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight Caliber: 5.56 NATO Barrel Length: 16.1"" Spiral Fluted Weight (unloaded): 7.1lbs (16.1"" barrel) Length (overall): 32"" - 35.25"" (16.1"" barrel) , Rate of Fire: Semi Auto , Rifling: 1/7"" RH , Stock/Pistol Grip: LWRCI/Magpul MIAD , Sights: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and Rear , Magazine: Magpul 30 rd.

This is a full power+ 300 Win. Mag. load that is designed to shoot targets such as deer and sheep well past 500 yards with precision, yet the bullet will give ample penetration for large elk and moose. This load can also be used for such tasks as 2,000 lb bison, but only if you stick with broadside/double lung shots.

As always Buffalo Bore derives it published velocities from real world firearms and refuses to get involved in the industry wide duplicitous practice of advertising velocities that can only be achieved in extra long laboratory barrels, which the customer will never realize with stock rifles in the field. Notice our below velocities.

3100 fps -- Kimber Montana, 26 inch barrel
3064 fps -- Savage Mod. 116, 22 inch barrel
3021 fps -- Mauser Action with 22 inch Lilja barrel
You’ll notice that my 26 inch Kimber gives only nominal gains over the two other 22 inch barrel. This particular Kimber barrel is a “slow” barrel for a 26 inch barrel and should be generating velocities of roughly 100 fps faster than it is."

This package includes the following:

1.  New GEN 4 GLOCK Model 32 pistol (NIB - never been fired), case, everything that came with it - with a total of 3 magazines, each of which has the Pierce 2-rd pinky finger extender on the bottom (see photos).

2.  New (never been used) CROSSBREED HOLSTERS Inside-the-Waist Band Holster for the model 32, and...

3.  TACTICAL CARRYING BAG (black) that can hold 2 pistols and accessories, plus up to 6 magazines on the outside in pouches, and...

4.  1000 rounds (new) of LAWMAN 125 grain .357 Sig FMJ Ammo (please note, I couldn't put all the ammo in the photos, so I'm showing just one box of the Lawman ammo), and...

5.  Two boxes of WINCHESTER PDX Self Defense 125 grain .357 sig ammo.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I have two of these pistols.  I was so impressed with the first model 32 Gen 4, that I purchased another one.  Problem is that I'm not using the 2nd one.  This entire package is a steal because you know that the ammo alone can be expensive and not always available. Everything listed here cost me over $1200.

PACKAGE PRICE:  $825 Cash (no trades or checks will be accepted).  Please note, I'm selling all of this as a package.  If you ask me to break it up and sell this or that item, it winds up being too much of a hassle.  The end result is that you couldn't buy all of this for under $1200.  Out of State buyers will need to have this shipped to an FFL dealer, plus you pay shipping.

QUALIFYING PURCHASE INFORMATION:  Buyers must have either an up to date valid NC Pistol Permit (issued by your local Sheriff's Department), or a valid Concealed Carry Permit.  We would then fill out a formal bill of sale.

METHOD OF CONTACT:  Reply to this ad, or better yet, you can reach me on my mobile phone, which is REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM daily EST.  Ask for Ben.  I reside in Fuquay Varina, which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh, NC.

This is a light recoiling deer rifle or home defense gun that can have a red dot sight added to. I am only selling it because I am going back to bow hunting and don't need it. I am considering leaving the scope and mount on thr rifle and selling it at a good deal for $350. I paid well mm over $400 for the gun and all the additions. This also comes with 20 rounds of Federal Deer Thugs 170 gr and 12 roundsm of Hornady Leverevolution 160 gr. Call or text Adam REDACTED.

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.

Price is for pistol only, suppressor(s) available to make a ""tac pack"" at extra cost.

All local, state and federal laws strictly adhered to.

Sales tax and/or shipping to your dealer are extra.

This is not some used up hunk of scrap.
This bar has never been used or even mounted.
Lenses are perfect.

Youtube has a ton of videos on them if you need to see it flying.
Original packaging is ugly from being on our shelf for a few years, but the bar is untouched.

It is a 50"" mount.
NO CONTROLLER INCLUDED. 
It has all of the new mounting hardware and brackets, and FULL uncut harness.
It has all new wiring schematics so it can be switch wired, or you can get a controller from WHELEN. Honestly for the money I just switch wire them, it takes 4 switches.

If someone were to want a controller, I can order one for $125.
I will not order a controller until the bar is purchased and paid for though.
It would take me a day to have one in.

I will also include a used code 3 arrow bar. No controller, but works fine. 

Perfect for a plow or tow."

About the rifle:
It has an Olympic Arms Pre-Ban lower and a Bushmaster flat top upper
FAB Defense polymer flip up sights, made in Israel 
20in freefloat bull barrel
Aluminium quad rail with OD green rail covers
OD Green Magpul furniture.
Magpul MOE Trigger guard

It functions very well and has survived everything I put it through.

There ARE scratches/marks on this rifle, I actually use my guns and don't baby them, because this thing was made to last. They're not extremely big or worrying, though. Just something to bare in mind before you  meet up with me and then whine about some marks. 

So, with all this in mind, feel free to throw a trade or a cash offer my way and I'll consider it.

All models feature sleek lines and a scratch resistant, non-glare military
black finish with high impact grips. The polymer frame used on the 9mm
compact offers the shooter several advantages. First, it will decrease the
weight of the weapon. Secondly, the forgiving nature of the polymer will
decrease the felt recoil when firing the weapon. The polymer frame that is
used by Hi-Point is a very high tech, durable material that will serve the

It comes with everything it came with.  This package includes 2 reg. mags (5 round) and an extended mag (7 rounds)--I have to say the pistol is extremely concealable with the reg. mag, but more comfortable with the extended mag, but still relatively small.  Like the title states, this gun was purchased new, and post-recall, so no need to send it back to get the recall fix.  Text if interested at 918two14five466.  Cash only please, no trades."

Milled receiver and chromed bore. Threaded barrel. This gun is absolutely in amazing condition. Wood furniture is like new. The previous owner had the gun professionally refinished. It’s got the tough Moly Resin finish on it right now. Nothing was wrong with the factory finish. Previous owner just wanted a better finish than the factory. Which I totally agree. Moly resin is really hard, durable, long lasting, self-lubricating, and has that always like-new-look finish to it. The gun has enough U.S. made parts for the 922(r) compliance. The pictures does not do the gun justice. This gun looks way better and nicer in person than the pictures. My fault, not really a very good photographer. You must be at least 18 years old or older to buy/trade this gun. Kentucky resident with proper ID.  Thanks for looking.

 A little background on the Bulgarian SLR-95:
 The SLR-95(s) is/are 100% made in Bulgaria, has Steyr cold hammer forged barrels, and factory hot dipped hammer forge receivers. No longer being imported. The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world.

* Update: 1/9/14: I forgot to mention, factory plastic/polymer furniture (upper & lower handguards, pistol grip) included with the gun.  No thumbhole stock *

I purchased this upper and ammo for a build I was doing. Only reason I'm selling is because I've decided to change up my build. This upper is new and I have only had it for about 3 months. There has never been a round shot through this upper. All ammo was recently purchased. 

FYI.....I don't have to sell the upper or ammo. I am willing to negotiate a little. So don't try to low ball me on price. This AAC upper is high quality.
