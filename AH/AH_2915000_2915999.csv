Velocity Works is proud to offer the custom-built VW Sniper Mosin Nagant. 

The objective of this custom-built rifle was to produce a capable and attractive heavy caliber, long-range precision target rifle that fires inexpensive ammo and can be had for hundreds less than an off-the-shelf item in the same category. 

We started with a conventional 91-30 Hex-receiver (slightly stronger than round-receiver models) Mosin Nagant.  We then removed the action and barrel from the wood stock, and completely degreased, cleaned, inspected, and function checked the firearm.  All the steel was then professionally hot blued on site to bring out the luster of the steel and protect from corrosion.  

For mounting optics, we went with a top-of-the-line picatinny scope mount.  These heavy duty mounts are precision machined out of 6061 aluminum here in the USA.  The mount utilizes 3 mounting points and has a hard coating to resist chips, scratches and corrosion.  These mounts have been tested up to 800 yards with sub-MOA results, quite impressive considering the kick of a 7.62x54R round.  We had the mount professionally installed by our on-sight gunsmith, who measures, fits the parts, and drills and taps the necessary holes to secure the mount. Included with the mount is a custom down-turned bolt handle which allows the clearance to move freely under the scope.  The bolt handle and body were polished to a high-shine finish. 

For optics we mounted a Sniper Precision Optics 4-16x50mm scope.  Features include a red or green illuminated reticle, locking windage and elevation adjustments, and a removable sun shade. 

The action was then fit and installed into a Pro Mag Archangel Mosin Nagant stock.  This new-age, ergonomically friendly, composite stock features a fully adjustable length-of-pull and cheek rest, a small storage compartment, and accepts the included 5-round detachable magazine (10-round mags are available as well).  A Caldwell tilting bipod rounds out the whole package. 

Each of these rifles is fully tested and absolutely ready to fire and enjoy.  If you are looking for a time-tested, heavy caliber, attractive, long range precision target rifle that fires cheap and readily available ammunition while costing hundreds less than the alternatives, purchase one now, or contact us about building one of these custom rifles for you!

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

seriously, though. this is a smith and wesson mod 629-6, classic. I am looking to trade or sell this fine hand cannon. the cylinder locks up tight, no play, and the bore is bright and shiny.

Now I need to explain a little about the 9mm mags. I had intended to purchase from Midway USA a storm lake barrel to convert the 40cal to 9mm. So I was buying the 9mm mags as I would fined them. So another selling point of this gun is that for about $150 you can purchase a barrel and have two calibers in one gun. Also for about $70 you can buy a S&W factory .357 Sig barrel from midway. 357sig will use the .40 mags so no need to purchase mags for them. Three calibers/one gun. 
I have fired 75 rounds through it. The 9mm mags have never been used they sell for about $30 on up.

The additional items included are things I bought for the gun. I'm only selling it to raise some money to help with property taxes. I bought this new for $385.00 plus tax... so about $410.00 and have easily another $250-300 into the gun with extras. 
Its a very fun gun and is no longer made like this. The current models have cheaper finishes.. I prefer the look of the matte black heat shroud which is no longer an option and a few other things too.  It seems guns are getting a lot more plastic parts and crappy finishes these days; Just to compete with cheap spinoffs... It's just not worth it in my mind. If you bought new Mossberg 500 it would cost about the same as this one but without all of the extras. Not to mention you would get the cheap parts/finishes. A great package and Price of only $420.00

Includes:
1 x Scope/Sight known as a Red dot/Green dot Sight that has four modes in both colors... One dot, Three vertical dots, Half Reticle and Full Reticle. (Installed)
1 x Laser Sight - with Standard on/off button and the secondary squeeze attachment can be used/installed on the laser sight also (not installed but can be mounted)

These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are extremely accurate and reliable. The Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a monster round. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. This rifle comes complete with scope(very cool, built in range-finder reticle which was originally lit with radioactive Tritium), Comes with a hardcase. Quantities of these rifles are extremely limited. That is why these are very scarce and will only become more so."

This gun is awesome. Aside from being the first 100% American made AK, it features a fully milled receiver with an engraved US flag on the side. This has the ""shark fin"" front sight and a rear sight that is adjustable for both elevation AND windage. It also comes with a birdcage flash hider. It also has the AK Sig forearm brace, which is a blast to use. Very comfortable and 100% legal. I have replaced the stock grip with a MOE AK grip and added a AFG to make it more comfortable to shoot. I have put around 500 rounds through this, and it has performed flawlessly. And despite the common myth of AK's being inaccurate, I'm hitting spent shells at 20 feet and full sized targets at 100 yards with the iron sights.This package comes with up to 5 mags (4 tapco 30 round and 1 40 round import), up to +/- 1300 rounds of wolf FMJ's, and a triple AK mag/triple pistol mag MOLLE pouch, depending on trade. I could also possibly add an IO Sporter with aftermarket muzzle brake and solvent trapper or cash for the right trade offer.

This M-223 Riflescope has a BDC 600 Reticle developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Rem 5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet. The new BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards. Every model features an impressive 4-time zoom range and four inches of constant, non-critical eye relief. A massive ocular lens delivers a huge, exceptionally bright, high-resolution sight picture. For minimum weight and maximum strength and durability, it is made out of a one-piece main body tube.

Nikon has engineered the entire Ultra ClearCoat® optical system to provide the shooter with a bright, sharp, incredibly flat sight picture and light transmission up to its theoretical maximum--95%. Magnification reference numbers are viewable from the shooter's position to offer smooth zoom control. And of course, this scope is nitrogen purged and o-ring sealed to be waterproof, fogproof, shockproof.

Sporter safes are packed with tough-to-beat security and fire protection features. Proven gun safe security and added convenience are yours with a Sporter safe. Stepping up to the Sporter Series gives the piece of mind that the UL RSC (Residential Security Container) Rating against tool attack provides. A versatile DPX Storage System adds value and convenience.WHY CHOOSE A SPORTER SAFE?Sporter safes offer the quality, security and fire protection features expected from a Browning ProSteel gun safe at a price that is next to impossible to beat. A heavy 12-gauge steel body and rigid 1"" thick formed door with a Force Deflector Lock System. 2016 models include a 1400F/60 minute fire protection rating for additional peace of mind. The Cantilevered Modular interior and DPX door storage provide the most versatile interior found in a safe at this price - and above.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.QUICK ACCESS RACKFlexible polymer wings secure the barrel and allow firearms to easily be pushed into or pulled from the rack.BROWNING PROSTEEL SPORTER DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 58""x30""x23""Interior Dimensions [HxWXD]: 54""x27""x16""Cubic Feet: 23Weight: 520 LBSBolts [Total/Active]: 8/5Gun Capacity: 25 Total (9/18+7)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 12- Gauge SteelDoor Type/ Thickness: 1"" Formed Door w/ Partial Inner PlateLocking System: Force Deflector Locking SystemLocking Bolt Size: 1"" Diameter Chromed Locking BoltsLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 3 SidesLock: S&G Mechanical or SecuRam ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Steel Pin Lock ProtectionFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door/Body: 1""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 1.5""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1400F/60 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESExterior Finish: Gloss Black or Hammer GrayInterior Covering: Beige FabricHandle: Three-spoke Silver Chrome HandleCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degrees HingesStorage Solution: DPX Storage System (top half of door back)Interior Shelving: Cantilevered Modular ShelvingRaised Floor: Elevated floor protects gun socks"

This gun is VERY hard to find, especially the rifle version.  The short stroke piston operating system works flawlessly.  This is a fantastic gun and is in excellent condition.  I've put at most 200-300 rounds through it.  I've not had a single failure of any kind with it, and it is very accurate.  It will shoot sub 1.5"" groups at 100 yards with cheap bulk ammo.  And that's with the 4x optic shown on it.  With higher quality ammo I'm sure it will shoot sub MOA.  I really like this gun, but I just have too many guns and this one isn't getting used enough.

The price includes the gun as shown with ergo grip, a few magpul rail covers, a magpul sling attachment, one Rock River 30rd magazine, and original Rock River plastic case.  I'm happy to swap on the original hogue grip if you prefer that.
