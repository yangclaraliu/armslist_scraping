I may consider trades and I am looking for a small nine, like S&W Shield, Kahr CM9,  or an XDS 9. I may consider a new Glock 42 if you've been able to get your hands on one of those. Other trades will be considered and it never hurts to ask."

I got this in a trade awhile back not knowing too much about what it was/is, I just wanted the barrel and receiver that came with the stock (barrel and receiver were marked ""Inland"" which is where my granddad worked so I wanted that part).  I have no need for it.  Stock has markings on the back, left side of ""AAX.""  I understand that this is from the Augusta Arsenal which was responsible for rebuilding M1A1s after the war.  Has ""SA"" stamped on the underside of the grip.  Springfield Arsenal made replacement parts after the war and shipped them to other arsenals for installation.  Buttplate is marked ""B257614 *4.""  The ""*"" looks like a wagon wheel, no an asterisk...there is just no key for a wagon wheel oddly enough.  Handguard is marked either ""IH"" or ""HI.""  Not sure which is right.  I've looked around and it seems these stocks are pretty valuable.  I make no guarantee that this thing is 100% real, paratrooper, brought home from the war so don't send me hate mail.  It looks real to me but hey, I wasn't alive in the 1940s.  Asking $1000 OBO, just trying to get my money back.

It is in great shape and I would rate it a 9/10 just due to a few light handling/wear marks.  Four magazines are included and they are 20 rounders.  The grips on this model feature a built-in magwell and it has TFO night sights.

Shooters can also use the Mil-Dot reticle as a hold over for bullet drop compensation or windage correction.

Featuring a built-in 5mW red laser that can be mounted on a picatinny or weaver rail, this riflescope facilitates quick target acquisition in rapid changing, low-light environments that only a laser can do. The flexibility of the zoom from 2.5-10x maximizes the utility of the scope. Set the magnification at 2.5x for a wide field-of-view and easier close-in target acquisition. Twist the power up to 10x for all of your mid- to long-range target requirements.

The 2.5-10x40 Riflescope with Red Laser also includes a 100-500 yard .223 bullet drop compensation turret, which adjusts the elevation of the reticle and allows the shooter to achieve zero by moving the compensation turret to the correct yardage. Precision multi-coated optics are a distinguishing feature of the Firefield® Tactical Riflescope line, offering a clear view in both bright and low-light situations.

Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance."

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

This firearm is a conversation piece, and absolutely gorgeous! I truly enjoy it, I'm just focusing on my IDPA and USPSA competition shooting and I'm trying not to shoot anything but my comp guns... And I don't want this beauty to sit and collect dust.  That being said, I'm in no rush to sell, so Low balling won't work.  

TRADES: 
  I'm really only interested in a few firearms as trade,  an FN FiveseveN (possibly straight across if the package is right), a Glock plus cash (preferably G19/34/42).  I can't think of anything else of the top of my head, but it never hurts to ask if you have a firearm you'd like to trade. Not interested in trades of anything else (cell phones, pianos, golf clubs, nothing)

Anyway, sorry so long, text works best, I'm in NW Tucson btw, 4 one 0 9 one 9 7 0 six 9"

Exactly 18 rounds fired through it, perfect function. My wife has hands and wrists too small/weak to shoot this pistol, as we found out our first time at the range this week.  This firearm was purchased brand new 2 months ago, and still looks amazing – never carried. This is the latest 2013 revision LCP with the larger, more visible sights, and shorter, smoother trigger pull – a big improvement on the original LCP. This gun comes with a Crimson Trace LG431 Laserguard laser, installed and sighted in. I purchased 2 extra factory Ruger 6-rd mags, all 3 mags come with both flat and fingertip extension floorplates. Everything looks new, because it basically is. 

This package also comes with a Galco Stow-N-Go holster, a tuckable IWB, specifically designed to hold the LCP with the CTC laser, and a Desantis Superfly rubberized pocket holster, similarly cut to accommodate the LCP with the Laser. As you can tell, I really had a lot of plans for my wife to carry this pistol, but as it’s not a good fit for her, none of it is needed. 




Total package with everything new, cost me about $640 for gun, laser, holsters and 2 extra mags. I’m asking $409 shipped FedEx for the entire package with everything, to your FFL of choice, or $390 FTF sale in South NH. Will sell FTF to NH Residents ONLY, all relevant laws apply. This is a great deal, and hundreds of dollars off on a nearly new pistol. My loss is your gain. 

Please email with any questions, I get emails immediately and can respond quickly. I will accept discreet Paypal, no mention of firearms – or money order/check, held 24 hours to clear. Fast shipping, and I have good feedback, purchase with confidence."

Sig Tac Brace $120
Chrome RRA BCG with enhanced ejector $170  or make offer for a standard BCG $100

Add all that up and we are around the $1475 range as it sits. Like brand new. Will sell for $1050 that saves you the money for the build, taxes and shipping. Or make offer and I remove the Chrome BCG.

Everything is as you see included EXCEPT - Weapon Light, Sling, and Mag.

I have at the time a Chrome premium BCG installed. This was almost $200 at the time. If the rifle sells for what I am asking the BCG will go with the rifle. But I will entertain lower offers for a standard mil-spec black nitride BCG. If you know about BCG's the chrome is easier to clean after firing, and retains natural lubricity, reducing the need for lube.

I have other AR's so, the chrome BCG can go in those. Willing to hear offers though."

In stock and up for sale is a NIB Swiss made SG 553 Pistol. Comes with one 30 Round mag and ships in a hard plastic case. This is the finest 550 Series firearm available and there are only a few remaining. This variant has a newly designed rear flip-up BUIS for easier deployment and the barrel was factory threaded to 1/2x28 and then nitrided. This is the newest model made by Swiss Arms Neuhausen, also known as SAN. The new rear flip up sight is far easier to deploy than the earlier versions. The sight extends past the end of the rail slightly allowing one to lift it up from the rear with hands only. The earlier sights folded up from the front and were embedded in the rail, requiring a tool or thin object such as a punch be inserted under the front of the sight to lift it up. It is far easier to use and THIS VARIANT IS ONLY IMPORTED by M+M/Armati with this new sight.
