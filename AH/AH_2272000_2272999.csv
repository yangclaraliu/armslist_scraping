They don't make them like this anymore ! 
BRAND NEW ! - I have an earlier model 700 BDL CD, that is in the original factory box and has never even had the bolt put into the gun. I think this rifle was made in the early 80's, but not positive. It has been in the box, in my safe for more years than I can remember and only taken out of box occasionally to oil. This gun is NEW, with factory trigger tag attached.
This rifle has one of the prettiest stocks you will see, with beautiful checkering and rosewood forend cap. It has a hinged floorplate, with internal magazine, 5rd  total capacity (standard on these rifles). 22"" barrel and beautiful wood ! - I won't go into all the specs., since I'm sure you are familiar with them. I'm also sure you know how much better these older actions are, compared to newer guns. 
 These earlier generation guns sell on online auction sites for $850.00 - $1200.00 (check for yourself). But, to find a brand-new one is special ! - Please don't offer trades, but don't miss the chance to own this classic rifle, in new condition !

This one comes with the black rubber grip installed as well as the original military bakelite grips, one magazine, and I'll throw in 16 rounds or two mags worth of 9x18mm ammo.  It is a circle 10 military approved model but I'm unsure of the year of manufacture. This one is in great shape mechanically but with the typical holster wear of these guns.  They are fun and cheap to shoot, exceptionally reliable (100 rounds of steel cased ammo through it, 0 malfunctions), and very accurate, as well as being a good CC choice.

I'd like to trade it for something subcompact or pocket size.  Not really particular but I would prefer something in .40 but will consider 9mm's as well.  Would also consider .38 special/.357 snub nosed revolvers.  Absolutely not interested in .22's or .380's however.

The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.

Rifle scope has all the advantages of a red dot sight plus some, without the battery dependency
Glass-etched reticle in hunting gear is visible with batteries or without
Scope features a removable illumination module which illuminates the reticle in red
Illumination module can be removed and the etched-glass reticle is still visible, so you're never battery dependent
Eight brightness settings for changing light conditions, with an automated low-battery indicator
Features the illuminated Leupold circle plex reticle which is sharp and defined, illuminated or not, and can be used for range estimation
True 1x optical system allows you to shoot with both eyes open
Slotted, 1/2-MOA click windage and elevation adjustments are easy to change with the adjustment cover
Integrated base system includes different height mounting spacers to work on any type of weapons platform
Prismatic is also compatible with the A.R.M.S. #22-34mm Throw Lever Rings Base and Spacer System, and conventional 30mm rings
Can be mounted using a ratchet over the outside or inside the mounting screw's handle
Adjustment system de-centers the objective lens, rather than tilting the erector system, so it's more repeatable and more durable
Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2 for increased light transmission and abrasion resistance that far exceeds military standards
True focusing eyepiece means the Prismatic can be adjusted and used by anyone
Illuminated circle plex reticle provides a bold aiming point, and can be used to estimate range
With the thickest maintube of any Leupold ever built, it's our most rugged scope ever, practically indestructible
Absolute waterproof integrity"

Selling cause I could use the cash right now.

I know many love to hate hi points and tell stories of how so and so bought one and blah blah blah. 
To be honest - I've never heard a bad story from an actual owner. This particular weapon I got from a military friend of mine and he was very happy with its function. 

I'd say I haven't had any trouble with but I don't have the money to invest in shooting ammo lately ... so it hasn't had much of a chance to give me trouble either. 
I have another .40 hi point that I'm keeping I've shot more. I fired winchester white box target ammo and didn't have any problems - the friend I got this from said he didn't have any problem with his either.

This particular firearm has never been sent in for repair (has not needed it) but it is covered under a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. 

Read below for my personal experience with their service on a different firearm.

**Hi Point lifetime warranty**
This firearm has never been sent in for repair but I have a 9mm hi point that I got at a gun show that was beat to crap (I think it was kept in a tool box or something) but still functioned without a problem.
I sent it the manufacturer to be ""checked for problems that might have escaped my attention"" -- I would have been fine if they determined nothing was broken and sent it back as is but they completely refurbished it!

It came back with new grips, slide, sites and compensator and I suspect they replaced some internal parts such as the pin, springs, etc. They also sent me a box, gun-lock and owners manual. (that I didn't have with it).

I can't remember how long it took ... maybe three weeks? They're much faster than Taurus is with their warranty and easier to work with as well. 

Ever since that experience I've felt really good about having hi points. 

Sure I prefer my more pricey guns but I think most of the hate towards this brand is mostly snobbery. 
If anyone has a problem with them the factory will fix it."

I think mossberg wanted people to believe that they're better quality but I think it only boiled down to cosmetic looks and a bit of rareness. They're otherwise just the same as a normal mossberg 500 - which are good pumps. 

This is a pump action 20g. shotgun.

This auction is for an Les Baer Monolith Heavyweight 1911 in .45ACP. This pistol was modified with a Smith & Alexander arched Mainspring Housing & Magwell blended into the frame, an Ed Brown Match Bull Barrel hand-fitted to the Slide, Ed Brown Oversized Magazine Release, and an Ed Brown Oversized ambidextrous thumb safety... all hand-fitted and Hard Chromed by Bob Cogan at Accurate Plating and Weaponry. This auction includes the pistol and one Wilson Combat 47-D 8rd 1911 magazine. This is one hell of an accurate, reliable, and smooth shooter. The Monolith Heavyweight comes with an extended dust cover on the frame. With the hand-fit bull barrel, there is a significantly reduced recoil and rapid follow-up shot. There is a two-piece full length guide rod. These pistols retail for over $1,800.00 new. With the significant custom improvements, this auction starts at only $1,600.00. Don't miss out on a chance to own and shoot this outstanding pistol. Please contact me for additional photos or information. Buyer pays actual shipping to your FFL. Payment must be by money order or certified funds. This is from the Les Baer web site: Baer Custom's MONOLITH is a real monument in steel. It's one bad boy that's as tough and rugged as it looks. The MONOLITH's steel frame has an extra long dust-cover (the only 1911 in the business) that matches the length of the slide. That gives the five-inch slide and the frame a blocky, one-piece appearance...really an awesome look. It also gives the MONOLITH some extra heft on the front end which helps reduce muzzle flip. If you compete in USPSA Limited Class or in Centerfire Bullseye matches, you know the kind of edge that can give you. We guarantee 3"" groups at 50 yards. Features include: • Baer N.M. steel Monolith frame • Baer Monolith flat bottom double serrated slide • Baer NM barrel and stainless bushing • Low mount LBC adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop • Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambi safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability"

It has sat for a long time, but I believe it is functional and restorable.  It is apart, to field dress disassembly, as I was thinking about restoring it.  However, with a full time job, to little boys, 16 acres, horses, chickens and a second job as a moonlighting guitar player, I just don't have the time to mess with it.  Serial number was verified through Winchester documentation as 1913 production.  It begins 32XXXX.  The rifle is stamped for 22 short, long and long rifle.  The rifle had a broken hammer spring and was put away for many years after that.  I believe it is all there.  I can e-mail photos of anything you want to see and will try to post some up here tonight or tomorrow.  I would be interested in trading for a decent lever action 22, or other lever action rifles.  I would be also interested in trading for or towards a .45 Colt  SAAreplica with short barrel."

I'm just a little old school and have grown attached to the AK47 platform so I've decided its time to part with this rifle (and the extra money is a big plus to).

If you have been trying to find a camouflage hunting and outdoors boot that will keep your feet both dry and warm, this 9” Rocky BearClaw 3D (#9275) boot may be just what you are seeking.

With its strong full-grain brown leather and Mossy Oak Break-Up® camouflage print (over durable nylon); the look of this boot will surely take your overall hunting experience to a whole new level.

An invaluable feature of this hunting boot is its GORE-TEX® membrane. This fabric so exceptional because it is breathable, waterproof, and prevents moisture from entering these boots. Regardless of the weather conditions or your surroundings, you’ll be glad that you have this feature keeping your feet dry and comfortable.

The temperature dropping isn’t going to stop you from wanting to go hunting, which is why these BearClaw 3D boots have 1000 grams of Thinsulate® Ultra Insulation. Your feet will be kept warm, even in extremely cold conditions, but the insulation won’t add bulk to the inside of your boots.

For more comfort internally, you’ll be walking on the Air-Port cushion footbed. This is not your typical footbed; it is shock absorbing, supports and cushions, and promotes air to circulate each time you take a step. Your feet will be at ease throughout the entire hunting season.

On the bottom is the BearClaw 3D outsole with ROCKY 3D welt construction; it's durable and allows you to walk across rough terrain with absolute ease.  

Now, get outdoors in these Rocky BearClaw 3D hunting boots!

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. 

The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount “Picatinny Rail” which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights.
