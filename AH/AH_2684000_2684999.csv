Its 3 1/2"" 10-gauge payloads are significantly superior in patterning efficiency to 12-gauge 3 1/2"" guns, and even produce less felt recoil. It features a corrosion-resistant gas-operated action in which a small cylinder – not the entire piston – moves, helping dampen rearward force. Ultra-reliable and smooth, it’s the only shotgun worthy of the ultimate bird-leveling payload.

The Model SP-10 Magnum Satin come equipped with a 30"" vent-rib Rem Choke barrel with twin beads and interchangeable Full and Modified Rem chokes.

I am looking to trade my never-fired, Ruger Charger for a .22lr target pistol, preferably a Ruger Mark II or Mark III. I will also consider a Browning Buckmark.



The Ruger Charger has never been fired, and is the stainless & light grey finish. It comes with a brand new Truglow red/green dot sight (cost $100.00) with five reticles in each color, and adjustable brightness. There is also one factory 10-round magazine, a Pro-Mag 32-round magazine (steel-lipped), the original box, all original paperwork, locks, the bipod, and nice carry bag with the Ruger logo.

This pistol is very clean, with no issues. The only reason I am looking to trade for a target pistol is that I can better teach my youngster to shoot with something that can actually be handled and fired in hand. The Charger can only be fired from a bench rest position by my boy, and offers little in the way of teaching grip or stance. The reach from the grip to trigger on the Charger is also a bit long for him as well.



That said, I am looking primarily for a Ruger Mark II or Mark III with bull barrel. I will also consider a 22/45 if it has the replaceable grips. A Browning Buckmark will also be considered, as will other makes and models of target pistol in .22lr. Just contact me to let me know what you have and we'll think about it.



I may consider other arms as well, such as a decent 22lr rifle, a 12ga with a rear sight (ramp, ghost ring, etc.). Prefer tactical style shotgun over hunting style. I am not opposed to buying my son a target pistol if I work out another deal on something else here, so again, feel free to contact me with any fair offer. Also feel free to ask for any further details or for more pictures.
Will meet to trade face to face (will deal trade via FFL as well if necessary), and will require a signed and certified bill of sale, as well as ID info. as proof of state residence."

Please email me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

LaRue Tactical PredatOBR™ 5.56 
The PredatOBR 5.56 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 5.56x45 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. 

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the supplied Roll-Bag and Tool Box. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 5.56x45mm, and feature rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All muzzles are threaded in 1/2 x 28. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. The New A-PEG grip also comes standard. This grip was designed to be ambidextrous and places the hand in the corrected position for precision shooting.

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

This is probably going to raise the eyebrows of gun traders like myself. I picked these up here and there just because the price was right. The 7mm was my deer/elk rifle for several hunts and does have a ding here and there but nothing major. The Marlin I picked up on a partial trade but really have no use for it so it just sits in the closet. The Model 220 I took on a partial trade a few years back. And again, I have no use for it either. They all function nicely and just need to find another home, as I am running out of safe and closet space. I want to let all 3 go for a quality handgun. I'm putting a total trade value of around $700 obo and I think that is fairly reasonable. That's 100$ on the 220.  $200 on the model 81 and $400 on the 7mm. I like Glocks, Walthers, Sigs, XDS in 9mm and maybe a quality revolver. Just let me know what you have to offer. I am pretty firm on the price but may be willing to work with someone who is interested. Thanks for looking!"

Rear quarters are rotted (common for this car), left worse than the right, and the floors are rotted. Other than that all the original chrome and trim pieces are there. With some work this would be a great restoration project for the winter, of if you don't want to restore it you could make it a sweet rat rod, or upgrade it and have a nice hot rod. Possibilities are endless...

Like it says, I have an almost brand new SIG P250 TWOSUM. Basically two pistols in one...one large frame and one sub-compact frame. They use the same trigger group and are interchangeable at will...the pistol shoots well, I am just looking to fund another project.

The Pistol kit sells for around $600-650. I'd like to get $550 for it. Not really interested in any trades at the moment. But if you feel you have something that would catch my eye...hit me up.

Thanks,

For sale by private owner, Taurus PT-92AF 9mm pistol. This is a 1988 production DA/SA model with manual safety only, no decocker. Included with the pistol is one OEM 15 rd magazine, one 18 round Mec-Gar magazine, which is very high quality. Pistol comes with one set pachmayr grips, soft rubber with checkering, and one set hogue smooth exotic hardwood grips. I also have a blackhawk SERPA retention hostler for a Beretta M9, which required slight modification to the retention tab to fit the slightly different trigger guard of the Taurus variant. 

I have owned this pistol for 5 years and have no issues with it. Makes a great firearm for personal defense or recreation. Pistol is very comfortable and naturally easy to point and shoot. 9mm recoil is very mild and easy to manage, especially with the soft rubber Pachmayr grips.  I am only selling to free up money and safe space for a new firearm. 

A little history of the Taurus 92 pistol. Taurus 92 bought the Brazilian Beretta factory lock stock and barrel and began producing their clones using the same exact machinery and specifications. The taurus will often fit hostlers made for the beretta m9, but the trigger guards are slightly different in shape and certain holsters may or may not be compatible. Beretta and taurus magazines are not interchangeable, but good quality mags are available for comparable prices, such as from Mec Gar. Another difference is the location of the manual safety. Unlike the Beretta awkward slide mounted safety, Taurus manual safeties are located on the frame, and are consistent with most other DA/SA pistols available."

Precision Shooting Arms red dot scope. 1x magnification with 4 MOA red and green illumination, each with five different brightness settings. Includes mount and scope caps as originally purchased; everything functions as it should and is in excellent condition. Model is listed as an M2 Fusion Fire from the company (Precision Shooting Arms, LLC) and was designed to compete with the AIM Point optics at a lower price point. This one is in like-new condition. 

Package deal for everything, not interested in splitting things up but will consider trades (partial or full and can add cash on my end to the right deal). Thanks."

Leupold MSRP is 500, cabelas has the scope for 450. You would be out the door over 500 with scope caps and tax from cabelas. Even if you get it online from swfa, brownells, or optics planet you are 450 plus shipping and another 25 for the scope caps. I’ll sell it for 375 Firm which is saving you at least 100 dollars to get a BRAND NEW scope in perfect shape with warranty. I ordered a rifle that came with this scope. I never fired the rifle with the scope on it because I need a long range setup. It doesn’t have a scratch on it, and has all accesssories and manuals. Only difference is they didn’t ship me the box. I thought I might keep the scope before I ordered another long range one so I bought butler creek flip up caps that fit perfectly. The green firedot and bullet drop compensator specificallly for .223 is awesome, green dot is adjustable in size and brightness, it is daytime visible. It’s got the best warranty out there LEUPOLD, no warranty card, etc.

Great scope for tactical, 3 gun setup, hunting, etc, just read the reviews. People say they can make 500 yard shots with the turrets and the 4x magnification.

This was a model designed for the US Military in 2006 when the SOCOM division put out request for a new side arm for their operators. The funding was scrapped by the government but the gun was still made. This is the result. One of the smoothest guns I've fired. comparable to my Glock 22 .40 

The gun shows some holster & light mounting wear. Functions great. Personally put 25 rounds through it. Unknown what previous owner put through.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. In stock and ready for delivery, call Rick at REDACTED."

The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios. Built around a rugged, ultra-bright daylight visible illumination system, the Mark 6 1-6x20mm offers a true ""both eyes open"" situational awareness at 1x, while also offering the ability to identify and engage targets out to several hundred meters at high magnification. The Mark 6 1-8 elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic.

0 rounds of W.C.C. 5.56x45mm NATO. This is one of my favorite rounds in the 55 grain 5.56 platform.  Sealed primers equals extremely long shelf life. I have shot plenty of M193, XM193 and XP193 and I still like W.C.C's Q3131 and Q3131A better. Its hotter, faster, and more accurate.  We chronied a 5 shot average from this same lot at 3,356 fps. Thats fast for a 55 grain projectile!
