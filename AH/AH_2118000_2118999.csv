When I was at the range some years ago it would stovepipe.  I took it to my local FFL dealer and he had his old time gunsmith rework the lips of the magazine and tested it to work fine.  I have shot it some since then with good luck.   Take this to the range and you will have lots of people come over to check it out.

I have had this rifle for almost a year and put probably right at 1000 rds through it. I have run both steel and brass case through this beast and it has NEVER so much as stuttered, this is one of the few piston guns that will just chew through steel cased ammo with no problem (one of the deciding factors in purchasing it) all the internals including trigger group, are NP3 coated for maximum corrosion and wear resistance and the BCG has the same coating makes it a dream to clean. the barrel Uses LWRC's proprietary NIcorr surface conversion technology upping the barrels accurate life to well beyond 40,000 rds. I have the LWRC Skirmish sights on the rifle right now but i might be keeping them depending on the trade. I will be including 3 Lancer L5 mags with the rifle as well as a Daniel Defense hardcase to transport it in. I might include the sig red dot as well depending on the trade/cash offer. 

Now for what im looking for, im not looking for a straight trade only partial or a full cash offer. I am looking for at least around 1000$ cash plus trade. Im looking for a quality AR pistol with the barrel being no shorter than 8 inches (that can include the FH) prefer it not have an A2 sight but not a complete dealbreaker but i am not a fan of railed gasblocks so id prefer the gasblock under the quadrail and not visiable.
Also looking for a quality Arsenal AK74 in 5.45x39, no tantals or cai garbage 
last but not least im looking for a Tactical .308 bolt gun. plz dont offer up your stock rem 700 sps and expect 1000 in trade for it its not going to happen on a 750$ new gun. looking for a ready to rock system. Bell and carlson/acis stock systems and optics are a plus. feel free to offer other items you feel i might be interested in but those are what im mainly looking for ATM. i will respond to all offers but please dont try and peddle junk to me. This is a Top Tier rifle not bubba joes dpms or frankengun.

This gun was made before Colt stopped making the Mustang in the 90's, before the production of the current Pocketlite, aluminum framed Mustangs.  This is a steel framed pistol with the Colt-Guard electroless-nickle finish, which is a very durable, corrosion resistant finish.  I replaced the original, plastic factory trigger with a steel trigger.  This gun also has a full length guide rod from Wolfe.  

This little gun is a great shooter, and would make an excellent carry gun.  I am extremely accurate with this little pistol, thanks in part to the extremely clean, crisp trigger.  In fact, Sig patterned the P238 & P938 on this pistol.

I am selling this gun with some extras as a package deal.  You will get:

2 original Colt magazines (7 round, flush fit)
1 additional flush fit magazines (Metalform)
1 leather back pocket holster
1 Desantis Superfly holster (for pocket or IWB carry)
44 rounds of Hornady self defense JHP ammo

I am asking $700 for this package."

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

This is slightly used Ruger Mini-14 Tactical rifle chambered for .223. For decades, Ruger Mini-14 rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities.

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. A Garand-Style Action with breechbolt locking system, a fixed-piston gas system and self-cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions.

The accurate sighting system has a ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. This rifle features an adjustable, side folding stock and rubberized pistol grip.

Savage Anschutz mark 10a with anschutz sights. Shows a little light surface rust in places but overall not bad. When I bought this the bolt was disassembled and the seller said he wasn't sure if something was missing. There are some diagrams online that show a spring around the firing pin and others that do not. I assembled it and it does fire as expected as it is right now. The buyer should review the assembly of the bolt for safety reasons.  - $400

Winchester Model 59 WIN-LITE 12 Gauge Chambered 2 3/4"" Modified Winchester Choke
It has a few scratches and wear marks. This is a very light shotgun and is fun to shoot. Great for young kids trying to shoot 12 Gauge without it being too heavy. 
This is a $650 shotgun if it were perfect condition. But I'd let it go for $350 because it doesn't look new or restored. The wood is excellent with no cracks or chips. This is a great shooter and is a semi auto.

AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market .
 The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and either a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver or fixing bases for a top scope mount, and push button safety.Ambi-dexterous mag release,100 and 300 meter flip up rear sight.
 VEPR SUPER comes with a fluted  heavy barrel  with integrated muzzle brake for reducing the rifle weight and improving cooling ability.
 All VEPR SUPER rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual.
 Included are two 10 round polymer mags and two 20 round steel mags(hard to find and expensive) original box and manuals, brand new Kalinka  quick disconnect top scope mount and Burris Fullfield II 3-9x40 scope, Harris style 8-12 inch bipod."

I have had this for about 7 months and bought it new. It is installed on the Larue QD LT100 quick release, which allows you to sight it in and take it off w/it staying zeroed in. I went with this ACOG setup over the standard 4X32 because the TA-11 allows the shooter to have a longer eye relief vs. having your eye right on the scope and because the green donut is easier to see than red. I only shot one time w/this scope to sight it in which was less than two 20 rd boxes and it's been in it's pelican case for the last 6mts. It is in perfect condition.

BRAND NEW 8 boxes/20 per box/.44 caliber Special/200 grain. 

I am selling these .44 boxes because I actually have too much ammunition and desire to keep less at home.  I bought these only a few months ago so they are fresh.  Great accuracy, overall no problems at all.

You may research for yourself the price.  You will not find them anywhere locally.  I desire a quick sale so I will offer you an extremely generous offer: all eight boxes for the price of four!  And no shipping costs when you pick up at my home which will save even more money.  Most all internet dealers sell this for $29.99 per box, price: $240.00 plus taxes/shipping.  I will sell all eight to you for $120.00 - HALF OFF!

In the attached photos: the rifle for sale has the darker blue/black finish, the other rifle is just for comparison with a typical Garand finish.

I’ve gone to gun shows since I grew up in the 60’s but I am not an expert on Garands. Like most all Garands this one has been rebuilt, but apparently in Great Britain, due to the British proof marks, black British-style finish, and several British-style repairs to the handguard.

This rifle is a CAI import, they do not seem to have a good reputation on the internet. CAI seems to be accused of using bad, even rewelded receivers. However, my rifle has an excellent condition, original Springfield Armory receiver which dates to early February, 1944. The barrel is marked SA 2-44 and must be the original barrel, unfortunately it is pitted and has muzzle wear. If you are fanatical about barrel condition or want the rifle for target shooting this is probably not your best choice in a Garand. (At least it is the original barrel.)

The stock is very nice, with a clear circle-P marking and the remains of the outline of a cartouche box. The inside of the stock is marked “OR” apparently, and possibly the numbers 3312.

These parts are SA: hammer, trigger housing, bolt, receiver, barrel.

Trigger guard: WRA 46025.

Op rod HRA 6535382.

It seems there are several possible uses for this rifle:
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is, representing a “British arsenal commercial rework” variation of the Garand rifle.
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is for casual shooting, as a historical relic, an investment (future imports may be banned) and even now as a reliable, hard-hitting weapon.
•	Take the rifle apart and apportion the parts as they best help your collection.
•	Keep the ammo, see below, sell or trade the rifle in the future.

Now about the ammo:

This package includes 1000 rounds of clean, shiny military surplus ammo with sealed primers. Of the 1000 rounds, 720 are Greek 30-06 ball; the remaining 280 rounds are black tip FN A/P.

Of these 1000 rounds, 840 rounds are already loaded into 8-round Garand clips, 280 rounds into each of 3 vintage ammo cans. (105 loaded 8-round clips=840 rounds.)

One can is fully loaded with Fabrique Nationale black tip A/P ammo on clips, here is a possible retail value for this one can of ammo: 280 rounds @ $1.50 each, 35 clips @ $3 each, $20 for vintage ammo can, total $545.

To approximate the retail price the Greek ball, 720 rounds @ $1 each, 2 more ammo cans @ $20 each, 70 more clips @ $3 each, total $970."
