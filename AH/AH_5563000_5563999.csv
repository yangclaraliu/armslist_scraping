This revolver is in unfired condition in the original box numbered to the gun with all of the paperwork shown including the factory test target. Please note that there is a very light rust spot on the back strap about 4mm wide. It looks like it was caused by the way the gun was stored. There are a few very small marks on left side of gun but nothing that really sticks out. Other than that, this gun as NIB and in mint condition as it can be seen for the pictures. The cylinder face, recoil shield, and forcing cone are completely clean and it is factory fired only. The grips are exceptional on this Python and are very crisp. This Python has not been handled very much and is a close as you can get to NIB Colt Python as you can get other than the slight mark on back strap. If this Python did not have these marks from storage, this one would be worth close to $5000. Own a 46 year old Colt Python today and make this special Python a place in your collection.

The integral accessory mounting rail provides space for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. The dovetailed, high-visibility 3-dot sight system features a raked-forward front sight for easy removal from the holster and an adjustable rear sight. Manual safety and D-shaped magazine release are easy to reach and actuate and appeal to both left- and right-handed shooters.

The I-12 comes in four finishes, Realtree APG HD, Advantage Max-4 HD, walnut and black Synthetic to meet a variety of hunting needs.
It uses an inertia driven bolt, so bolt is basically fixed when the firing pin punches forward and strikes the primer. The primer sends a charge into the gunpowder and it explodes and releases gases that propel the shot through the barrel. Once the shot and gas exit, a backwards force then drives through the gun (recoil/vibrations). When the force reaches the bolt housing, the bolt is then driven back until the inertia spring catches and sends it forward. This system replaces systems that other semi-autos use where gas or the initial explosion drive the bolt back. And, since the gases can’t seep through into the chamber there won’t be any carbon-build up.
Features include a Twin Shock Absorber (TSA) recoil pad that deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter’s shoulder"

This trigger, touted by the manufacturer as the first of its kind for pump-action shotguns, is user-adjustable to under 3 pounds.
The 535 ATS Pump-Action Combo is available with either a 22″, 24″ and 28″ steel barrel. Each gun features interchangeable barrels available in deer/turkey, turkey/slug, and field/deer combinations (each gun includes one rifled barrel). The Combo model is equipped with adjustable fiber-optic sights that are brightly colored and easy to see, and rifle sights. It also has a synthetic stock that comes in black, Mossy Oak New Break-Up, or Mossy Oak Break-Up Infinity.
Common features to the 535 series include Mossberg’s patented Trophy Slugster cantilevering scope mount system, allowing barrels to be changed without having to remove the already-mounted scope. It also has an ambidextrous thumb safety, laser-engraved bolts, and free gun lock."

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

This is an all factory original machine gun that was built by Colt in Hartford, CT in the late 1970's. This was sold to the Federal Government, and the widely accepted story is that these were issued to the Department of Energy (DOE) to protect nuke sites across the country. A small number of these were sold to civilians in the late 1980's.As you can see, this was a carried weapon and has some great patina and lots of character. It is so hard to find a M16 with honest wear - it is actually much harder than finding a new one. This rifle mechanically is in excellent condition including the bore. It appears to have been fired very little.One of the things that attracts me to this rifle is with the US Property markings, it is 'the very thing' for so many different military builds that you could do, like a MK18 Mod 0 build, or a MK12 SPR build, this is the exact lower - it wouldn't even be a clone."

The action is single/double and the caliber is .45 ACP. The barrel is a bull barrel at 3.5 inches. The sights are open, with a white 3-dot dovetailed. The frame and slide are both steel, and the finish is an armory kote (dark matte finish). The magazine capacity is 6 + 1, and the grip is a Hogue soft grip (Fits the hand well.)This is an older model which is no longer made, but still covered under Springfield's 'Lifetime' guarantee. This is an all steel frame handgun, no polymers here. I believe unloaded it comes in at around 32 ounces. Included with the handgun is 2 holsters, 5 extra 6-round magazines, 3 magazine holders (Holds 2 magazine a piece) by 'Allen', and around 500 rounds of ammo, including a box of Sig Sauer 'Elite Performance Ammo' and a box of Ruger 'ARX' Polymer Ammo. That's over $250 worth of extra gear, accessories and ammo, on top of the sidearm. The pictures here don't do it justice. The hefty weight also helps with recoil, and it's easier to keep on target. I don't ship, period. Here is a interesting video about the firearm: https://youtu.be/1Va9_N2U5G0 I will give you a discount if you have to travel any distance, as that is the only fair thing to do.

This is a very handsome 5-screw revolver that has matching numbers on the frame, cylinder, barrel, extractor, and yoke with the metal retaining 98-99% of the original blue finish that has some trace silvering on the muzzle and a mild turn-ring on the cylinder. The target hammer and trigger have nearly all of their original color case-hardening remaining with a few traces of gray along the edges, and there is some further minor fading along the edges of the ramp front sight with red insert. The checkered, diamond-center grips are correct but numbered to a different gun and are in excellent condition with only a few extremely minor handling marks and some mild flattening of the points. The revolver is housed in its original, “1926 Model” marked, pre-war two-piece gold box which is numbered to the gun on the bottom and surcharged “4” over the “6 1/2” on the label end. The revolver is accompanied by a 2016 dated S&W factory letter listing a ship date of January 26, 1954 to Evaluators Ltd., Triangle, VA (Evaluators Ltd. was a law enforcement dealer with close ties to the FBI at nearby Quantico, VA). Additionally, the letter makes notice of the fact that S&W was actively using up their back stock of older boxes at the time this revolver was shipped. This is an extremely nice example of a very desirable .44 Target that rates excellent condition overall. FFL or C&R"
