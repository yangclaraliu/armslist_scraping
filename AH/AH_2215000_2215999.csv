This is a great gun in like new condition. I am the only owner and I am meticulous when it comes to my firearms. This gun has an Apex Tactical fully machined sear and Apex Tactical Ultimate Striker Block installed so the trigger is very smooth. I do have the original sear and striker block. This gun also comes with 9mm barrel and two 9mm magazines. That means you can reliably shoot 9mm rounds by simply swapping out the barrel and using the 9mm magazines. Nothing else is required. Do some searches for M&P compact 40 to 9mm conversion for more info.
I am primarily looking to work out a trade for a M&P pro in 40 or 9mm or a Glock 34 or 35.
I would consider selling everything outright for $650. That is only if I am unable to work out a trade so the price is firm.

This is the bi-tone stainless steel and black model (gorgeous I might add). I bought this pistol several months ago and although it is a pleasure to shoot, I am looking for more of a medium/full size pistol. There have been exactly 100 rounds put through this handgun. The trigger on this Ruger is awesome, smooth and crisp. It is a striker fire weapon, just like the Glock, only it has a manual safety option along with the trigger safety. This pistol is great for CCW, with the 10 round mag in, it is virtually the same size as the Glock 26 (+/- mm's). Comes with 2 magazines, a 10 round and a 17 round. The 10 round is a flush fit and is perfect for concealed carry. The 17 round comes with a magazine adapter which matches the grip of the pistol so it looks really good. The original Ruger box, along with manual, speed loader, and optional magazine butt plates is included as well. 

I am also throwing in a AIM 150 lumens tac-light that mounts nicely on the weaver mount of this pistol, and 100 rounds of 9mm ammo. The tac-light is very bright, lightweight, and easy to turn on/off.

Shot a few 454 Casull and 410 (3 inch magnum) oo buckshot  through it.  Pattern spread was a little more expanded by distance than a long barrel shotgun. Regular 410 shotshells seems to spread more by distance than heavier oo buck pellets. 454 is surprisingly accurate and very little recoil compared to a Ruger SuperRedhawk 454 Casull, Taurus Raging Bull 454 Casull with 8+ magnaported barrel, or a Freedom Arms 454 Casull. This is no doubt due to the weight. This is not magnaported which makes this a interesting big game gun as not only are you getting the limited recoil by comparison with 454 Casull, but you are not losing any FPS due to magnaporting. Problem for me is its heavy, but this will take down Grizzly or Elk with the 454 hunting loads.  If interested,  text, call or email. Asking 970 cash seeing as how these are hard to find and sought after. Msrp is 1061.00. Condition LNIB.

It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets and one mag.

This gun has the best balance and feel of any shotgun we have tested in years. The length of pull combined with the 28 inch barrel and the very nice trigger pull makes it one super fast clay breaking tool or bird stopper. 

Now the history: this model was a firearm reintroduction by Remington in 2001 of the famous Remington Model 32. This shotgun has a mechanical set trigger, automatic ejectors, a 26 inch ventilated rib barrel, with screw-in chokes and 2 3/4 or 3 inch chamber. The checkered walnut stock is excellent with a nice, high gloss finish. The forearm is in good condition: there is a small wooden piece missing from a corner edge, but it does not effect the weapon at all and is cosmetic- HENCE, why the reduced Price. The bluing is excellent, inside and out. Another item that makes this firearm a very complete package is the Remington brand carrying case. It is of superb quality; from the two locks in the front and full length hinges on the back. The interior is premoulded to the shotgun shape with areas for chokes, wrench, snap caps and other goodies. The outside is tough with a rub rail at the top and bottom to help protech the case from damage. 
This firearm shows was in production from 2001 - 2006 at the Remington Ilion, New York factory. To date; this is the last American made Over and Under ( O/U ) shotgun to be made by Remington. Its list price was $1759. The high quality shotgun case -- Remington would have changed an arm and a leg for it. A little history on this particular firearm; I purchased this Shotgun upon my last deployment from Iraq as a gift to myself.  I have hunted wityh it and it is a Slaughter Machine- Amazing Gun...especially for Quail or Pheasant.  
Asking Price is $750.00 Firm.  I will NOT negotiate or trade for it.  It comes with the Gun, the choke tool, the Metal case and keys.  Ill even throw in a Cleaning snake for the barrel.  Serious Buyers only please.  Im a few minutes SW of Tinker AFB off I-240"

Designed to meet the requirements of Police and Security Forces, the Sphinx AT .380 is considered one of the safest semi autos made. The Sphinx Safe System allows instant use of the pistol in any situation. A sophisticated mechanism decocks and secures the trigger system after each shot, leaving this DA pistol absolutely safe to carry, but ready to go, with a chambered round. With a 10 round magazine and one in the chamber, it makes a reliable and absolutely safe back up gun. This gun is the upgraded M type, which is equipped with an additional manual ambidextrous firing pin block. 

The Sphinx AT .380 is made in Switzerland, and the fit and finish on this gun is perfect. The frame is Stainless Steel, and the slide is Parkerized Steel, creating a beautiful 2 toned gun.

I already have another .40 caliber, so I am looking for a full sized 9mm because I already have ammo for it as well (my wife has a subcompact 9mm). I may be able to throw in a little bit of boot money for the right deal, but I'm not looking to go broke on a deal, just seeing what I can get. My Glock does have one small spot where a button rubbed it from where I carried it for a week (my holster has a button on it), this mark is shown in one of the pictures I am posting. I'm not interested in selling, and I will not trade for a Hi Point, or any other cheap guns, so please don't bother asking me. I'm not sure what generation this Glock is, it's not written on it anywhere. If you are interested in trading, feel free to text me at REDACTED, or e-mail me at REDACTED.

Potential Trades:  Looking for equal value or cash + trade.  I like Glocks (almost any in any caliber, but definitely not straight across), M&P Long Slide, XDM Long Slide, Semi Auto Shotguns (I would pay cash to go up to a Beretta 1301), and Dillon reloading equipment.  Might consider trading + cash from my end for the right item.  Please do not ask for straight across trade for polymer guns unless HK."

The gun has the upgraded trigger group and polished firing pin from Glockworx.  The difference between the stock trigger group and the Glockworx is significant.  The trigger group is 100% drop-in and NO permanent modifications have been made to the gun.  The stock trigger group and firing pin are also included.  I also had my gunsmith install a set of TruGlo tritium and fiberoptic night sights.  These are the best sights I have ever used, a huge improvement over the stock sights.  Finally, I installed a steel guide rod and replacement springs as the plastic stock rod tends to crack.  The gun has had fewer than 1000 rounds though it.  There is no wear on the frame or slide.  There is a tiny spot of wear on the slide release and the top of the barrel.  This is normal wear on Glocks and does not affect function.  It would be difficult to tell this apart from a brand new gun.

I accept payment in postal money orders only.  Along with your payment I will need a copy of your FFL's license and address so the gun can be shipped there.  Returns accepted only if the condition of the gun does not match the description."

The gun has the upgraded trigger group and polished firing pin from Glockworx.  The difference between the stock trigger group and the Glockworx is significant.  The trigger group is 100% drop-in and NO permanent modifications have been made to the gun.  The stock trigger group and firing pin are also included.  I also had my gunsmith install a set of TruGlo tritium and fiberoptic night sights.  These are the best sights I have ever used, a huge improvement over the stock sights.  Finally, I installed a steel guide rod and replacement springs as the plastic stock rod tends to crack.  The gun has had fewer than 500 rounds though it.  There is no wear on the frame or slide.  There is a tiny spot of wear on the slide release and the top of the barrel.  This is normal wear on Glocks and does not affect function.  It would be difficult to tell this apart from a brand new gun.

With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments.

A 1950 Belgian FN Browning A-5 12ga. I dated the serial number from Browning and the serial number puts it's date of manufacture around early 1950. This is an excellent collector piece. All parts are original. This sale comes with two barrels. A 28"" Belgian marked full-choke barrel and a second open-choke 24"" barrel. I've cleaned and oiled it recently. After I bought it I took it to the range to make sure it was working condition, it shot beautifully, no malfunctions or hang-ups. This shotgun, both interior and exterior, are very clean and the bluing does not show any signs of rust or scratches. There is some kind of stain on the ejector side of the receiver but I can verify that it is not rust. I would estimate this shotgun to be in about 95% condition. If you have further questions email me and I'll be happy to answer. Happy hunting!"

The trigger group is 100% drop-in and NO permanent modifications have been made to the gun. The stock trigger group and firing pin are also included. I also had my gunsmith install a set of TruGlo tritium and fiberoptic night sights. These are the best sights I have ever used, a huge improvement over the stock sights. Finally, I installed a steel guide rod and replacement springs as the plastic stock rod tends to crack. The gun has had fewer than 1000 rounds though it. There is no wear on the frame or slide. There is a tiny spot of wear on the slide release and the top of the barrel. This is normal wear on Glocks and does not affect function. It would be difficult to tell this apart from a brand new gun.

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

I see this CHL like its the holy grail.  Texas drivers license. Promise the buyer is legal to purchase a firearm. Impersonally would never own s CHL to be used to pick up Not only my.legal firearm but my person. To me there is only ONE DOCUMENT that means anything at all about buying or selling a firearm. A very simple document that's totally free of any charge. A Texas voters registration receipt. Duh. The very reason we are able to own firearms. A person so lazy they refuse to do the right thing surely doesn't need to buy a firearm. Only exception to this I believe would be a soldiers I.D...........
Felons can not vote......illegal aliens can not vote. Underage kids can not vote. So we do face occasional inconvenient jury duty. That's a very small price to pay. I see no place on the card for color...no place for religion....just a small document that shows.  YOURE DAMN RIGHT. IM A CITIZEN OF THE FINEST COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. NUFF SAID Gene"
