Listed as a Saiga because arsenal is not available in menu.  Super cool but i think i prefer a stock.  It has a 10.5"" barrel with a short gas system.  Hinged top cover (which is awesome). It is a 100% Bulgarian built gun.  There are no US parts  on this since it was imported as a pistol.  Reciever does have the folding stock rear trunnion already installed but is not cut for pin or front catch but is not difficult for a smith or DIY guy with some machining skills.  Easy SBR project which was my plan but didn't feel like fooling with wait time and hassle if I ever wanted to sell.  Looking to trade for another AK ONLY.  Prefer trade for another 106 series rifle, but open to other high quality AK in 5.56.  Also consider a slr105 or SGL-31 or similar rifle in 5.45.  Any Saigas must be converted unless you want to add cash. This weapon is in great shape, recoil is not bad, fires anything you load in it, and makes a big manly flash and bang.  Includes 2 Circle TEN smoked mags and a 5 rounder if you want it.  Works well with a sling for steadying which I can include if you need one. Call or text Brett 615-517-428six"

Springfield M1A - National Match - NM SS barrel and factory standard NM features.  Walnut stock.  No modifications from factory model.  Some striations on barrel under operating rod.  Small scratches.

Springfield M1A - Loaded - NM SS barrel and factory standard NM features.  Synthetic stock.  No modifications from factory model.  No jams, cycles well, operating rod by itself may need to be replaced far in the future if rifle is abused, my uneducated estimate is >1000 rounds.  Small scratches.

Norinco M14 - Wood stock with hinged metal butt plate.  I don't know about past modifications, but the rifle cycles correctly and shoots straight.  Will work as well as any Springfield standard with tuning.  Small scratches.

All three rifles are in excellent condition with no rust on any of them.  All have been fired and meticulously cleaned recently.  There are minor scratches on each rifle, as all have been used.  All three have shiny bores and shoot flawlessly.

BUFFALO BARNES PREMIUMLEAD FREE 338 Win. Mag. 210gr. TTSX SUPERCHARGED (ITEM 52D)

This 338 Win. Mag. load offers the rapid initial expansion of the tipped (TTSX) TSX bullet, yet it still penetrates deeply as do all TSX style bullets. This bullet is best suited for use on animals under 800 lbs where the greater impact damage is beneficial and where enormous amounts of penetration are wasted. Even though I have killed 1500lb moose (with one shot) with this exact load, I prefer the deeper penetration of our item 52B (225gr. TSX) for animals that large.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

Besides putting 55 rds through it at the range I haven't done anything to it and to be honest don't know much about it other than it shoots better than I can. Well, that and it's heavy as hell... approx 15.5lbs! Great for reducing felt recoil and keeping the muzzle down but not so much for taking into the backwoods. $900 obo

Unless it is a fantastic deal for me we would need to meet close to or in Norman.

A classic original combat proven Springfield Milspec 5 inch Government model GI 1911. But it has the complete Wilson Combat reliability package so it runs better than the rest. The feed ramp is mirror polished, extended ejector, lowered and flared ejection port, and re parkerized. All work was performed by legendary Wilson Combat. 

265.00 plus shipping both ways for the reliability package. I have a copy of the Wilson Combat invoice and can send it upon request. 

I added true original vintage 1911 combat grips. This gun looks and feels like the original. But it runs better than most on the market. This is one of the few 1911's that I would trust my life to. If you want to carry the real deal here it is!


The only part re-parkerized was where the ejection port was lowered and flared. Wilson did not re-parkerize the entire weapon. The wear marks seen are typical wear marks from a few holster drawls. If you want a gun that has a scratch free finish go with a stainless or hard chrome. I prefer parkerized because it doesn't reflect light in low light conditions. Having a non reflective weapon to me is much more important.

The 30BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core, and it offers exceptional sound suppression levels in a very lightweight format. For shooters using the 30BA, accuracy is the first priority and this suppressor meets those demands. The 30BA mounts over a muzzle brake, and this brake-attached version provides the same repeatability as the Thunderbeast direct thread attach suppressors. This .30 cal suppressor is rated up to .300 Winchster Magnum, but it’s the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting, such as .243 Winchester, .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum and WSM. The material and construction of this suppressor provides a great strength to weight ratio. Thunderbeast has created a .30 cal suppressor with a conical shoulder surface, 100% titanium construction, 360 degree fully-welded baffle core, Helical baffle technology, magnum rating, and solid Point of Impact repeatability."

As an NRA-Certified Instructor in Pistol, Personal Protection In The Home, and Personal Protection Outside The Home, I can tell you one of the most important factors is choosing a pistol is the way that it fits your hand and, therefor, its ""Natural Point of Aim."" There are few other pistols, if any, that fit hands so well and provide the correct, essential Natural Point of Aim. Furthermore, the adjustable back-straps on the XD(M) allow even further customization in Natural Point of Aim and comfort. 

Design
Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 
New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations 

(M)odel Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 

(M)ega Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Technology
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

(M)atch-Grade Barrel
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimum Reset Trigger
The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 

(M)elonite
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

Innovations
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

(M)ega Capacity Magazine

(M)inimum Error Dis-assembly
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

PersonalizationUsually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.

(M)agazine X-Tensions
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)

The Standards
In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. 
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status Indicator
The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

USA Trigger System
The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Grip Safety
Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

626,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2245626,For Sale:  CRKT F.T.W.S. Fixed blade tactical NEW,"Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 160,"Listed On: Monday, October 21, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you look at the web site of custom knifemaker Allen Elishewitz, you'll see that he is a wide-ranging designer, offering not only exquisite custom folders, but also timepieces and writing instruments. But Allen is also a serious martial artist, hence his interest in designing a superior fixed blade. 

This new knife/sheath system is the culmination of two years of work, and the finest tactical fixed blade we have ever manufactured. Because it is designed For Those Who Serve, we are calling it the Elishewitz F.T.W.S.™ 

Allen has carefully considered every facet of the full-tang 6.30"" blade. SK 5 carbon steel was chosen for its strength and hardness. The tip is a modified spear point with full width near the tip for penetrating strength. The top of the blade features a four-inch-long flat grind with a chisel ground edge for heavy hacking and chopping tasks. The blade is black powder coated to resist corrosion and minimize reflectivity. 

Likewise, the handle is carefully thought out to provide best grip under all conditions. There is a semi-hilt, plus four finger choils and a parrot beak at the end for maximum security. The injection-molded glass filled nylon scales feature an aggressive pyramid texture. The blade tang is taper ground to allow the handle to swell at the palm and become narrower at the end. A lanyard hole is provided. 

Tactical Sheath. Our battle-proven custom black high-strength nylon fabric/glass filled nylon sheath has an injection-molded liner. Dual belt loops are Velcro® adjustable. For maximum versatility, there are ample grommets with a length of 550 paracord included, an adjustable leg strap, plus a slotted sheath back that can mount on MOLLE gear. Two removable security handle straps with snaps give access and security, and qualify the system as jump and water operation accepted. A utility pocket with a Fastex™ buckle will carry a variety of folding knives, multipurpose tools or sharpeners. 

The operator today has many fixed blades to choose from. Allen has combined their most successful elements in a fixed blade that is strong, well-balanced, secure to grip, and competitively priced. Best of all, it's a true Elishewitz."

The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size, including the popular new beavertail backstrap. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

These pistols include a speed loader and ship in Glock branded padded hard cases.

This Colt Frontier Scout single action was built in 1958 and is chambered for .22LR, .22Short, and .22Long. 

It is the Duo-Tone model with the alloy frame. They stopped making this version in 1961. The original black plastic grips are in excellent condition. The barrel has some holster wear on it, but nothing terrible. The bore and cylinders are in excellent condition. The action and cylinder are tight, and it has a crisp trigger pull.

This single action is a GREAT shooter that comes with a lot of history!! It’s a fun and reliable gun to shoot, and it will do pretty much whatever you throw at it!

I am looking to get $350.00 cash for this revolver. This revolver is regularly listed for $450-550 on many sites.

The BOSS system not only reduces recoil but also does much more:

 What is the BOSS?
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible.

How the BOSS works.
The BOSS simply tunes the vibrations of your barrel. This allows the bullet to leave the barrel the split second it is stationary. Your BOSS manual has a list of settings for each caliber and bullet weight. Adjusting your BOSS to these ""Sweet Spot"" settings allows you to find the instant your barrel is stationary. The result is accuracy never achieved before by an out-of-the-box rifle.

 The parts list includes: ed brown match trigger, cylinder and slide stainless sear, stainless sear disconnect, stainless sear spring, stainless hammer, 4 lb main spring, wilson combat 2 piece full length guid rod, wilson combat 18.5 lb recoil spring, wilson grip screws, and vz operator grips. 

This gun was a good shooter from the factory, but with all of the parts that have been hand fitted and tuned, it shoots like a dream. I can actually say that with the way this gun has turned out i would take it over a kimber. The only reason that i am looking to trade it is because i would like something in 9mm. The only trades i would be interested in would be a smith and wesson m&p 9 full size in good condition, a gen 3- gen 4 glock 19 in good condition, an ar .308 lower plus cash or with a matched upper, a remington 700 sps tactical aacsd. But feel free to make another trade offer. The worst i can say is no thanks. If you are interested just let me know and you can come by and look at it."

Putting this barrel in allows you to shoot cheaper rounds for cost effectiveness. It has falcon grip tape manufactured to fit the G22.

Product Information

    The UTS-15 Tactical Shotgun is a 12GA pump-action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 20,5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included)."
