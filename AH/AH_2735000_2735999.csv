Features include padded leather palms and rubber finger and knuckle guards on the top. They will keep your hands scratch and cut free! They make awesome shooting gloves. No more cold, numb fingers getting scraped and cut! These also make excellent work gloves too! I have all sizes. Payment through PayPal is fast and secure. Shipping is FREE!!! Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

Born of the gun making expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. 

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories.

I bought it here in the Chicagoland area for $575 plus tax. plus another $30 for the extra magazine and another $30 for the quick draw clip. That's  $625 I have into this thing not including taxes.  You can have it all for $545, not a penny less. $545 is more then a fair deal. Lowballers, go aggravate someone else. ALL Illinois laws will be followed including foid card validity check."

The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

It features the JP 18' medium contour barrel and muzzle break.  The gun has about 400 rounds through it and is very reliable.  While scoped, the rifle was capable of sub-moa with good ammo.  The upper receiver alone retails for $1299 if purchased new.   I am asking $1000 or best offer for the upper and firebird precision lower...

The lower with the A2 stock is a Firebird precision lower with a mil-spec buffer.  I dont recall the trigger group manufacturer but it breaks like a mil-spec trigger, nothing special.  $250

The second lower is a Rock River, with a commericial buffer tube, Magpul STS stock.  It also has a Rock River Trigger.  It is much better than mil-spec, but not a Timmney or Geissele.  $350

If you buy the rifle with a lower I will subtract $100.  

I am not in a rush to sell, thus I will not entertain any ridiculously low offers.  I am open to trades for other ARs, semi auto shotguns, Arsenal AK's, a S&W M&P Pro 5"", Aimpont and 1-4x or 1-6x optics, professional Nikon camera lenses."

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
I have one Woodland Camouflage Point Blank vest included with the 2 Armor plates for our ""Mil-Spec 46100"" for $240 the size is Medium and it is like new.

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five
I have one Woodland Camouflage Point Blank vest included with the 2 Armor plates for our ""Mil-Spec 46100"" for $200 the size is Medium and it is like new.

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I hate the use of the word rare on here so I want to be clear, A bulldog 44 is not a rare gun. It's the bobtail hammer design that is hard to find but as you see in my asking price I did not magically use the word rare to inflate what I'd like to get out of it but ye the older ones are worth more than the newer lighter models. Truly power in a compact size. This is an older model Charter Arms 44 Bulldog that is in near perfect condition. Built MUCH better than the ones in recent years. It has the bobtail hammer so you can fire it in single action mode at the range without having to pull that long double action and of course it will fire double also. It is in near perfect shape with one small little scratch near the end of the barrel. Also has an in waistband clip on it. Great shooting gun. Recoil is no more than my 38.  44 power in 38 size. Also has original wood grips that comes with it. Just email if interested or text at 615-476-two thousand. Thanks"

When our engineers were designing the Companion, a major emphasis was on providing the smoothest ride available. If you've ever pulled a 5th Wheel trailer with another hitch, you know how stopping and starting can nearly give you whiplash! That's because traditional latching systems don't match the kingpin tightly. Our hitch was engineered with locking jaws that perfectly fit the king-pin meaning that there are no sloppy starts and stops. In addition, the coupler of the Companion sits on arms that are coated with polyurethane bushings, this means that where other hitches give you metal on metal contact, the Companion gives you a cushioned, quiet ride. Finally, instead of just front-to-back cushion, the Companion features a built-in shock absorber that allows gentle side-to-side movement without the slamming. This is a ride you deserve to experience!

The furniture is all original Romanian military, solid front, laminate rear, this is completely un-messed with.

The SAR series was banned from importation in 2003, so they are rare, and hard to find now, further I had a smith re-add the bayonet lug, thread the barrel, and install correct pattern slant break, plunger, and spring, all Romanian military parts were used.

The SAR is unique as being the only correct patterned stamped Receiver AK to feature BOTH Y dimples, which makes it the most correct AK clone on the market, and also makes it ideal as a host for an NFA (full auto) conversion if you have your SOT License. It also features a factory optics rail.

This is NOT to be confused with the garbage WASR's, this is a completely different model, and unlike the WASR's is actually good.

I have pictures, but I'm having some technical issues so I will have to text them to you if you want to see them.

Note: The manufacturer is Cugir, but that was not in the drop down menu, so I selected the importer instead.

The Kobra site is NOT included, but is available for an extra $450.

The Kobra sight also has not been imported in a number of years, and is even harder to find than the rifle, it also is the type which uses common AA batteries."

Please note that the gun looks much better in person than what my cell phone is taking today.

The Package Includes:
the Ruger LC9 itself (obviously)
Crimson Trace Laser Guard
1 – Metal Belt Carry Clip
2 - 7 Round Magazines with Pinky Extensions
1 – 7 Round Flush Magazine (for really deep concealment)
3 – New Batteries (1 new in the guard and 2 extra ones I'll give you)
1 – Soft Pocket Holster
1 – Custom Built Kydex Pocket Holster
1 – “Discrete” Multiple Position Magazine Holster
Enhanced Raised Texture Grip on the Gun and on Pinky Extensions
Original Box, Carry Pouch, Lock and Paperwork
500 – 115 grain FMJ's (your choice of Winchester or Federal)
  50 – 115 grain JHP's (I use Federal JHP's for self defense with all of my guns)

Some of it's features:
100% Reliable Handgun – it's a Ruger (I've put 600 rounds though it – every single one was flawless; you can easily expect it to last 100,000 more rounds in it's lifetime. This is an extremely accurate gun – if you're not hitting the bullseye with this, don't blame the gun - LOL)
100% Reliable Laser – it's a Crimson Trace (you can sight it in for whatever distance you want, I have it at 15 feet because I figure that's where I'd need it very fast if I ever needed it)
It's a very good looking gun (I know that matters to some people).
It was designed for smaller hands yet works great with huge hands as well (check out Hickock45 on Youtube).
An extremely smooth and crisp trigger (I had a gunsmith detail clean the gun and then polish all the friction parts, which only cost $40; I was so happy with the results that I brought in 4 more handguns after that to get them done, too!)
Wonderful 3 dot iron sights (I'm not usually a big fan of 3 dot sights, but these are actually really good)
Small and thin enough to carry & FULLY conceal in many different ways (ankle, appendix, small of back, shoulder, every pocket I've tried (even back pants pockets), it'll even hold inside a cowboy boot!) 
Softened and rounded edges/corners for comfortable carry all day every day and to make sure you don't snag anything if quickly pulling it out of a pocket or your waist.
Several safeties built in that keep you safe, yet they don't get in the way if you ever need the gun fast or under pressure. You can keep the safeties off all the time if you like, which is what I did.
Rear site is adjustable for windage but it's been dead on since day one so I haven't touched it.
Although it's perhaps the lightest 9mm that many would say is reliable enough to trust your life to, it has very little recoil because of it's lower design making the second and third shots VERY fast (especially when using the laser!).
Like I said, it's incredibly light. You can easily wear it with sweatpants or shorts by using one of the holsters and the side clip, knowing it's safe and secure while being completely hidden and ready to use in a moments notice if ever needed. 
No special buttons to press to put the laser on or off; when you grip the gun ready to fire the laser comes on, when you let go some of the pressure it turns off – no wasted batteries by it turning on accidentally and then not working when you need it in a life saving situation.
Extremely intuitive and user friendly handgun. I hate to say that you won't need to practice shooting because I feel everyone should consistently practice shooting whatever they carry, but if you miss a trip or two to the range you won't have to feel guilty. It point shoots like a dream (or nightmare I suppose if you're on the other end of the barrel), the sights are great and quick to align and then you of course have the Crimson Trace Handguard which makes a beginner shooter decent and an experienced shooter a marksman.
The only reason I'm selling this is because lately I've been carrying a revolver and I think I'm going to stick with the revolver for a while.

Total for everything would cost just under $985 new; but even though it looks new, it isn't (the ammo IS factory fresh new) - but I figure it's got to be worth at least $800 … but I'm only asking $750 with the 500 rounds of FMJ and 50 rounds of JHP ammo or $650 without the ammo because I've always gotten good deals myself and been luck enough to have dealt with good, honest people when buying on Armslist, so I like to pass the good deals on the few times I'm selling something here, too.
Cash is always king, but I am open to all sorts of trades (not carry handguns though, I'm sticking with my .357 for now). Money can be added on either end as far as I'm concerned."
