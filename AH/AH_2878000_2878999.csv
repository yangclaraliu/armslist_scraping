Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.email (samson.2285@yahoo.com )"

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. email(samson.2285@yahoo.com )"

Not ""hand-fitted"" like some other brands, Baers are built by human hands.  They are known for their tightness as well as their extreme accuracy; this model is guaranteed to shoot a 3 inch group at 50 yards.  They are all business, no frills.  This particular Baer is blued with checkered  cocobolo wood grips.  It also features a fully adjustable rear sight, a National Match frame, slide, barrel and bushing.  Comes in the Baer box with the two premium magazines and everything else that came from the factory.  This one just came back from the Baer factory with a fresh trigger job, as the trigger had a bit of creep when purchased.  It is perfect now.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. email (samson.2285@yahoo.com )"

With its extended barrel and line of sight, the GLOCK 35, in .40 caliber, allows for accurate hit patterns, especially when rapidly firing at multiple targets. This has resulted in widespread adoption of the G35 among members of the practical shooting community. The G35 dominates the Limited Class of competitive shooting sports worldwide. The Glock 35 features adjustable sights and a trigger pull of just 4.5 pounds.



The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.



GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.



This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

A perfect candidate for SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) *, the SLR-104UR rifle is a brand new Bulgarian stamped receiver rifle that is built from all original brand new factory parts and premium quality US made components, from its hammer forged chrome lined barrel to the original Bulgarian Arsenal mil-spec. stamped receiver.

The folding buttstock makes the SLR-104UR compact rifle for carrying easily and locks in its extended position rock-solid and provides all the comfort you need during shooting. The lower handguard comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s stainless steel heat shield, which helps keep your hand cooler when shooting. 

Throw an optical scope on this baby and the SLR-104UR, equipped with a double-stage trigger group, becomes an accurate sharpshooting rifle. Or, cut down the barrel and get a mean looking Krink for yourself *."

It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($299 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical situations. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2400 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping.

I also have approx. 2,000 rounds of Hollow Point and Soft Point 7.62x39 ammo - made by Wolf, most are the polymer coated kind for better performance. Non-corrosive and recent production. The buyer of the 556r package will get 1st option to buy this ammo and I will not sell it prior to the 556r being sold."

436,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2878436,For Sale/Trade:  Sig Sauer 556r (7.62x39) w/ many extras,"Akron area, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, March 30, 2014",Rifles,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for grabs is a gently used Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($299 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical situations. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2400 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping.

I also have approx. 2,000 rounds of Hollow Point and Soft Point 7.62x39 ammo - made by Wolf, most are the polymer coated kind for better performance. Non-corrosive and recent production. The buyer of the 556r package will get 1st option to buy this ammo and I will not sell it prior to the 556r being sold."

It has a 5 shot magazine, loaded individually or by stripper clips. This particular rifle is one of those given to the Turkish forces during WWI, hence the Turkish markings on the top of the receiver. 

This rifle is clean and there does not appear to be any external importer markings visible. I have owned this rifle for over 30 years and it has sat in the safe. At some point before I purchased it, the stock was refinished. The barrel is pitted and dark, but the rifling is still sharp. 

Serial numbers are mostly matching, except for the trigger guard / magazine. It does have a cleaning rod, but no bayonet.

I am asking $250 or best offer. This is classified as an antique weapon. I also have some mil-surp 8mm ammo that I will throw in, some on stripper clips. I will not ship. Face to Face only and you will need to have ID please. I can arrange to meet you somewhere in the Reno area."

I believe it was made in 2012.  I have only taken it to the range 2 times for a total of 130 rounds.  I have cleaned it after each range trip and just re-cleaned it again today prior to posting it for sale.  I have not had any failures at all.  It is a beautiful gun and wasn't planning on selling it, but I already have another 1911 and too many handguns that I never get to shoot as it is.  Could make a great conceal carry with being lightweight and the 4.25"" barrel.  I bought this used (barely 50 or so rounds through it then) at Diamondback, but it was originally purchased from a guy who bought it, took it to the range one time, and then traded it in.  You will notice in pics that the grips are slightly off color from each other.  This is how it came.  I honestly wasn't bothered by it so never called Colt to ask.  I did check Colt's website and they sell the same grips for $35.  Even Colt's we site says ""
Please note: Because these stocks are made of a natural material, color, pattern and texture will vary.  There are no guarantees on uniformity.  Minor inclusions such as checks, shading and other irregularities may occur.""

Imported by cia, very accurate rifle. I have maintained, and even tuned this rifle alittle bit to help smoothe it up, and definitely did not ""bubba"" it up, with rails, flashlights, and goofy shit like that. However, it has some improvements over the originally design, more for practical sense. It has a ati glass bedded stock, ati scope mount and ati bolt conversion.also has had trigger work done, dropping it to about 3.5-4 pds without any creep. The only thing I really have done to it personally is polish the bolt  and tune the ejector alittle bit. It also comes with a bipod, sling, original stock, hornady steel match ammo ppu soft point ammo and cleaning rod. If I can remember anything else I will add it, scope not included. For a mosin, this thing is kind of a prized shooter, and while it might not be in 100% condition, it is in very good condition and really hasn't been shot all that much. Only real reason im listing it is to see if I can get back what im into it, as well as focus more on my 25 06. If I can't get what I believe its worth, then im just going to keep it, also if you have anything cool to trade for it let me know.  Update++ just added 440 rds of ammo.

681,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2878681,For Sale:  REAL Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, April 7, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"As I've received a number of email responses to my previous posting for my authentic Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x optic claiming that it is a Chinese knock off, or that Elcan doesn't make a green Specter DR, I purchased one of the Chinese fakes and pictures of the two side-by-side.  In each of the pics, the real Elcan is shown above the fake one.

Raytheon Elcan did in fact produce a limited quantity of the SpecterDR in dark green and these were not sold to retail consumers but rather they were issued to certain elite units of the Canadian military.  To my knowledge these were the only recipients.  One very easy way to tell an authentic SpecterDR from a fake, aside from looking through the optic, is to look at the serial number.  Authentic Elcan SpecterDR optics will have this engraved on the unit and they do not have significant text on them whereas the fake units have a serial number painted on both sides and on the top and say Elcan SpecterDR on both sides.  Authentic Elcans also illuminate in two different ways while the knock off units only illuminate with a red dot.  The eye relief on authentic Elcan optics is another give-away as real ones will have an optimized optical path and will exhibit identical eye relief whether in 1x or 4x magnification.  As I know have both a real and knock-off Chinese made Elcan, I'm willing to sell either.

I hope this is helpful and thanks for looking.  The link below will direct you to one of many sites with posts discussing how to tell the difference between authentic and knock-off Elcan optics.  

http://thecounterfeitreport.com/product/292/Elcan-SpecterDR-Combat-Sight.html
From this post:
""The ELCAN SpecterDR Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. 
Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.
Elcan has reported counterfeit Elcan SpecterDR combat sights being sold on the internet. The counterfeit combat sights, while displaying counterfeit SpecterDR trademarked branding, are easy to identify when compared to the authentic combat sights.
All genuine Specter Sights by ELCAN are sold with; Unique serial numbers engraved on the body of the sight; Raytheon ELCAN branded (or authorized reseller) packaging; Raytheon ELCAN branded (or authorized reseller) User's Manual.
If the patented magnification switch lever is missing from a dual role sight -- it is counterfeit."""

With its extended barrel and line of sight, the GLOCK 35, in .40 caliber, allows for accurate hit patterns, especially when rapidly firing at multiple targets. This has resulted in widespread adoption of the G35 among members of the practical shooting community. The G35 dominates the Limited Class of competitive shooting sports worldwide. The Glock 35 features adjustable sights and a trigger pull of just 4.5 pounds.

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

Apex Handguard System - Rifle length Includes full top rail
The Apex Handguard System, designed for shooters by shooters, significantly improves the AR-15 design by addressing not only the original short comings, but also offering refinements beyond other aftermarket products. A superior design results in optimal comfort, versatility, and durability for target, hunting, law enforcement, and military use. It's modular and 100% made in the USA.

*Offset clamp allows for a trimmer, more comfortable hand guard, free-floating the barrel to maximize accuracy and heat dissipation while providing excellent air movement over the barrel and gas tube

*Unique modular design allows rails to be mounted where needed, as needed, and a comfortable gripping area maintained elsewhere eliminating unnecessary weight

*Four built-in quick detach sling swivel mounting holes eliminate the need for a rail-mounted sling swivel

Features:

MIL-SPEC hard anodized aluminum, matte finish
Innovative mounting system is secured to the factory style barrel nut already in place on most rifles
Asymmetrical mounting system allows for a 1/8"" smaller diameter hand guard than other tubular designs
The structural integrity of the tube is maintained by regularly bridging the accessory and ventilation slots
Slots at 45 degrees and 315 degrees encourage air movement over barrel and gas tube while serving as accessory rail mounting positions
Mounting slots give you control on exact placement of optional rail pieces for mounting accessories
Available rail positions exceed ""Quad Rail"" hand guards in versatility by offering eight positions around the tube at 45 degree intervals
Top mounting holes accommodate top rails: 1.5"" and full length 12.5""
GatorGrip pattern milled into the hand guard grasped by the forward hand provides a positive, yet comfortable control surface and enhances cooling by increasing surface area, as well as complimenting receivers where the front of the magazine well has been cut in a similar pattern
Hardware coated to resist corrosion in 1000-hour salt spray tests
The Apex Handguard System including hardware is made in the USA

This gun totally lives up to Kahr's reputation for incredible reliability and accuracy. The gun is super-clean with a bright, shiny and totally unmarked barrel. 

If its such a great gun, you ask, why am I selling it? Well, ladies and gentleman, my life has become a country song; I met a girl who lives in Tampa and I'm selling a pistol to fund the trip to visit her. That's right, not only can you purchase a great American-made pistol at a fraction of its retail price, you can also help love spread its light a little farther into this dark world. Rarely will your firearm's dollars go to so worthy a cause.

And if that didn't make the deal sweet enough, I'll throw in all the remaining .40SW I've got lying around the house, which is probably about 25 rounds of assorted FMJ and HP. 

We can also negotiate the inclusion of a nice North Carolina-made leather holster (Murph's brand), a clean set of .40SW-10mm Lee reloading dies, a ton of spent brass (well, not actually a ton, but you get the idea), and about 400 small pistol primers.

I'll need to see a NC pistol purchase permit or NC Concealed Carry document, in addition to a NC I.D. As much as running from the law would really complete the whole country song theme, I'd rather have time to spend with the lady."

 The CZ 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action.
