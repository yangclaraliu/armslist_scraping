This AR is extremely accurate, and eats anything you put in it, and loves the 69 gain and 55 grain equally.
I have only put less than 500 rounds through this rifle and it looks like new.
The reason I'm wanting to trade/sell this AR is because I'm lusting after the Sig 516.
The original BCG only has 30 rounds on it, I got the FailZero shortly after I purchased the rifle.
The only trade I will consider is a gen2 Sig Sauer 516."

SOMETIMES THE BUZZ IS GOOD. The buzz about the SIG SAUER® Mosquito, is that–this scaled down, rimfire version of the company’s popular P226® reduces the noise, recoil and expense of centerfire shooting but keeps the accuracy, precision and exhilaration the same. The polymer frame, blowback-operated pistol is offered in a wide range of configurations.

Trijicon AccuPoint 1-4x24 Riflescope is ideal for big game hunts or anytime you expect to shoot at shorter distances. The Trijicon AccuPoint Scope, with its patented imageilluminated aiming point, will help you get the job done.

The true 1x magnification allows close-in shots for tactical shooters, law-enforcement professionals and safari dangerous game hunters. The 30mm tube of the Trijicon AccuPoint 1-4x24mm Scope offers greater adjustment range and more variety of mounting options.

Like all AccuPoint riflescopes, the TR24 series is built with fiber optics and tritium allowing for a battery-free reticle that provides lightning-fast target acquisition and pinpoint accuracy in any light.

Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I have only one Multicam Front/Back/Side Carrier manufactured by
""Tactical Tailor"" for sale the complete set plate carrier including the plates would be $340

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

It's a subcompact in 40 S&W. Comes with two extended mags and the compact mag plus box with all the XD gear. I'm not claiming it is in perIt shape cosmetically, but it is a flawless performer. It has been my carry gun up until this point, so expect normal carry wear. If you are looking for BNIB, this is not it. If you are looking for a great and totally reliable weapon that you plan on scuffing up anway, this is for you.

$450. FTF only. Located in NWI. Can test fire at my personal range. I would really prefer to trade so the cash price is high accordingly. I will sell it outright if someone wants it bad enough, but I'd rather try to get some trade offers first.

Trade: Looking for a Savage 110 or variant in 300 WinMag. NOT an axis. Would consider any 110 long action though. Cash +/- as needed.

Iv only shot it twice put it up and haven't messed with it since, work keeps me from the range.......so I figured I'd let this gem go to some one that could use it. This would make a great entry gun in cowboy action events, and it's crazy accurate.

According to the date code on the barrel, this was made in 1978 (CQ). Not many were manufactured in .243, and the vintage quality Remington is known for shows in this rifle. It has a great trigger and feels great in the hands. This gun has been hunted, and shows some honest wear. Also a previous owner lightly etched his initials in the rear of the stock, but that could easily be sanded out. If you are looking for a flat shooting, fast pointing rifle for hunting or targets this is it. I got it for a varmint rifle, but ended up with a deal on 22-250 and I don't need both. It isn't shown, but the rifle also comes with a hard case. Any questions please ask. Thanks for looking."

BUFFALO BARNES PREMIUMLEAD FREE 338 Win. Mag. 210gr. TTSX SUPERCHARGED (ITEM 52D)

This 338 Win. Mag. load offers the rapid initial expansion of the tipped (TTSX) TSX bullet, yet it still penetrates deeply as do all TSX style bullets. This bullet is best suited for use on animals under 800 lbs where the greater impact damage is beneficial and where enormous amounts of penetration are wasted. Even though I have killed 1500lb moose (with one shot) with this exact load, I prefer the deeper penetration of our item 52B (225gr. TSX) for animals that large.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

I purchased this for carry, but reverted back to my 1911 shortly after purchase. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this weapon. It has less than 400 rounds through it and has spent most of its time in a bedside holster. This is NOT the DAK model!
The Milt Sparks holster was only use twice and is like new and not even broke in. If you know anything about Milt Sparks holster you'll know they will last you a lifetime as well as due to the demand there is a minimum wait time of 6 months for order for a new one of these holsters. I don't have any mag holders for this weapon. 
So here's what you'll get with this package:

Sig 229 w/rail
Laser Max guide rod, already installed
Milt Sparks IWB holster made of shark skin and horse hide, in black
52 rounds of StarFire defensive ammo
60 rounds of Spear Gold Dot defensive ammo
150 rounds of Winchester hollow point ammo
50 rounds of Winchester ball ammo
24 rounds of unknown ball, bagged ammo from gun show

The price is firm on this weapon, but I am also looking for possible weapons for trade. Currently, I'm in the market for M&P Shield 9mm and a .17 HMR. I don't need to sell this weapon, but would like to find a good home for it to someone who appreciates the quality and reliability of Sigs as well as the other high quality items included in this sale. With that said, I'm also not trying to drive half way across Tennessee to meet you so you can look at the weapon. If you want it you can come to Knoxville. 
This is the perfect package for someone who's ready to carry right away."

 The barrel is still in as issued condition and has not been cut down so this barrel can be used to rebuild a military spec 1917. the bore has sharp rifling but could benefit from a good cleaning.

The receiver has been modified as most 1917 sporters(sight guards / ears) have been cut off and drilled for scope bases. Action related parts are also in ass issued condition and can be used to restore / rebuild a military spec rifle.

the scope bases and rings are cheap aluminum which I was going to scrap them in favor of a one piece steel.

The scope is a vintage Weaver K8 with a 50, 75, 100, 200 & 1000 yard preset focus on the forward bell. constructed of steel with 1 inch tube. vintage Weavers are highly sought after. over all condition is good plus, there is some surface rust just ahead of the rear bell but these clean up great(excellent grade steel) was used in their production. made in El Paso Texas!

The stock appears to be a Bishop manufactured stock great over all condition with a small but easily repairable chip just behind the receiver tang. the piece is still on the stock and will not fall off just simply needs glued.

I am asking $400 firm and is being sold ""AS IS"" I have $350 in the stock and scope alone so please don't complain about paying another $50 for the rifle they are on HAHA!!

I will ship directly to a PA resident or to an FFL holder country wide but this is a heavy and long rifle so it will be rather expensive(I ran it through USPS using an Adams county zip and it quoted $38.23 just for a rough ball park figure. could be much less but won't be any more than $40.00. I am located in Port Allegany, PA 16743(McKean County)

Had this shotgun for about a year and a half, shot several hundred rounds through it without any issues at all. It has an 18.5"" barrel and a 3"" chamber (meaning you can shoot 2.75"" or 3"" rounds. Holds 7 rounds of 2.75"". Shoots bird shot, buckshot, and slugs accurately and effectively. Extremely smooth and efficient action. I have taken it apart and cleaned/oiled it about every 100 rounds or so. It's in pretty good shape, it is used and does show some signs of minor wear as expected. 

Comes with an ATI 6 position adjustable stock, pistol grip, fiber optic front sight, and removable heat shield; making it an excellent choice for home defense as you can adjust it as needed for any situation. Also comes with a soft carrying case and some home/self defense ammo: 1 box of Hornady Critical Defense 00 Buckshot (10 rounds) and 2 boxes of Federal Premium Tactical slug ammo (10 rounds total). Also throwing in a box of Winchester Super X 2.75"" 7 shot game & target ammo (25 rounds).

I recently inherited a few shotguns from a relative, so it is time for this one to find a new home. I don't NEED to sell, so please keep your lowball offers to yourself, I will not respond to them.  

Price is $350. FTF only, no shipping. Must be at least 18 yrs of age with a valid OHIO ID, no exceptions. CCW owners, like myself, preferred. Willing to meet in or around the Akron area. Not really looking for any trades, but not opposed to listening. Please be specific with any trade offers. Thanks."
