Spike's Tactical Fake Can/Suppressor

The Spike’s Tactical CAR-1 Fake Can gives you the looks of having a 10.5” suppressed rifle but doesn’t come with all of the expense and paperwork that’s required for the real thing. This is how it works; The CAR-1 shrouds back over the barrel of your rifle concealing part of it inside of the CAR-1. This is what gives the illusion of a suppressed SBR and of course, no stamp is required. Keep in mind, this fake can is just for cosmetic looks and does not provide any sound suppression whatsoever. The CAR-1 should only be used with barrels with Carbine length gas systems. 

Spike's Tactical fake cans are made out of solid 6061 Aluminum bar stock for strength and topped off with a durable Anodized finish. The length of the can is 5.5” and has a diameter of 1.25”"

This rifle is in amazing shape for being 137 years old. It retains nearly all its original finish including traces of the case color on the Breech Block and Lock Plate . The bore is near mint with a fantastic shine and crisp sharp rifling and would rate a 9 out of 10. This is the nicest Trapdoor Carbine I've ever seen and these don't come up for sale often in this condition. I have shot this Carbine at least a dozen times with New production Remington .45-70 loads and its very accurate and a pleasure to fire. If condition wasn't enough this Carbine is also Regiment or Unit Marked to two different Regiments. It is marked on the trigger bow or tang M 2 27 which stands for M Company 2nd Infantry 27th weapon. It is also marked on the buttstock near the Buttplate C 3 14 Which would be C Company 3rd Infantry 14th Weapon. I am listing this locally for one week and if it doesn't sell it will be listed on gunbroker next Sunday night and if you look at recent comparable Trapdoor Carbines you will see they sell for $2000 and over. Everything seems correct about this Carbine right down to the Carbine marked rear sight. I can ship this item directly to your home as it was manufactured in 1877 and is considered and antique so no FFL is required for purchase. Will consider partial trades for other firearms as long as at least $850 cash is included in deal. Email, call, or text REDACTED"

We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon

I'm not desperate to sell, so please stop with the offers for $450 or a Lorcin 25ACP. 

I'm selling my very slightly used Remington R1 1911 package.  I bought this gun in November 2012 and have fired exactly 100 rounds of .45ACP through it.  I do not have the original cheap grips anymore because I put some nice VZ Predator grips on.  Also included in this package deal are 4 x 8 round Chip McCormick Shooting Star mags and 2 x 10 round Chip McCormick Power Mags, 2 custom made kydex mag pouches, 1 Fobus mag pouch, 1 RH kydex holster (I don't remember the maker...it could be Blade-Tech or it could be Uncle Mike...I just don't remember) and factory box with warrantee paperwork.  BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!


Also included in this package is my GSG .22 Conversion Kit with 1 magazine.  This complete upper conversion kit will allow you to shoot .22 on the 1911 frame.  


Here's what I have wrapped up in this package:

Remington 1911 R1: $800 (yea, I know I got taken to the cleaners, but it was an impulse buy)

4 x 8 round CM mags: $25 / ea -- $100 (Only 3 pictured, found #4 in my closet)

2 x 10 round CM mags: $30 / ea -- $60

VZ Predator gips: $60

2 x double kydex mag pouches: $25 / ea -- $50

1 x Fobus mag pouch: $10?

1 x RH kydex holster: Unknown

1 x GSG .22 Conversion kit: $200

So I have over $1275 wrapped up here, and I understand that I'm not going to get that back.  Everything here is in 99% + condition.   Price for the whole package is $900.  I believe that is a fair price for the whole kit.   Only item not shown in photos is the GSG Conversion kit.  I will not entertain LOW ball offers.

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! 

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Remington 700 BDL in 7mm Remington Magnum. It is built for a high caliber, lightweight hunting rifle for traveling when hunting for big game, but could easily be set up for a Bench/Target rifle. It features a Boyds Featherweight Thumb-Hole Pepper-Wood stock (Original nice BDL stock is included). Stock is lightweight but has nice recoil pad made for the stock so the recoil is not bad at all. When using the high grain 7mm mag ammo, it is comparable to a 30-06. It also has Leupold base and rings and a Leopold Vari-X III 4.5x14x40 (with objective yardage dial-in focus and Duplex Reticle) sighted in at 100 yards. I also have two boxes of HORNADY Red ballistic tip (high and Medium grain), Winchester Silver-tip ballistic tip high grain, and one box of Winchester brass rounds (High grain) for range. Also has Claw sling installed. Stock also has additional forward lug for a Bi-pod. Total amount invested in rifle is below. The bolt is very smooth (like new), the gun is very clean (inside barrel is like new), very flat-shooting, very powerful. Blueing is 90% from use, but overall round count is less than 40. I am someone who takes very good care of their things, this gun was no exception (regular cleanings/lubricating even when not used just to remove dirt particles from air inside cabinet). Carried more than shot. Spends most of its time in gun cabinet. Can send more pics from if needed.

The workhorse Model 700™ SPS™ line is as solid and dependable as ever, and we’re proud to keep the Buckmasters Edition, including the “Young Bucks” version, filling freezers across America.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

There is a cost that comes with high performance, in this case, it’s a lot less than you think. The Model 700™ SPS™ (Special Purpose Synthetic) offers everything you love about the legendary Model 700, all at an extremely affordable price.

Built to carry on the tradition of the Model 700™ ADL™ Synthetic, the Model 700™ SPS™ is leading the way for the next generation of hard-hitting, fully featured, affordable priced rifles. From the rock-solid receiver design to the famous “three rings of steel,” the Model 700 SPS offers the unrivaled out-of-the-box accuracy and high-end performance you've come to expect from America’s most popular bolt-action centerfire rifle.

The Model 700™ SPS™ features an improved, ergonomically designed synthetic stock for better handling and enhanced overall functionality. The carbon steel barrels are clean without sights and receivers are drilled and tapped for scope mounts. All exterior metalwork features a matte blued finish. Standard amenities also include a hinged floor plate magazine, and swivel studs.

Now  the Model 700™ SPS™ Youth is offered in a left-handed version chambered for 243 Win and 7mm-08 Rem and is  the first-ever southpaw youth rifle offering. Our new Managed Recoil 7mm-08 Rem ammunition is the perfect complement to this addition.

DIAMONDBACK RIFLESCOPES

Diamondback riflescopes completely change the rules when it comes to “you get what you pay for.” First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes them virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the checklist and the advanced, fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. All this and then some in a riflescope that seems like it should cost so much more—but doesn’t.

Model: 1911 Range Officer 

Caliber: .45 ACP/AUTO 

Capacity: (2) 7 Round Magazines 

Sights: Fully Adjustable Target Sights 


Up for auction is the Springfield Armory Range Officer 1911. Made for those who want a 1911 competition pistol for a relatively low price. It has features that allow the user to participate in various types of competitions, but without the additional features found on other Springfield models that aren't absolutely necessary in those competitions. 

Its 5"" stainless match grade barrel is something you'd want in a competition pistol. So is the long, lightweight speed trigger. Its five to six pound pull is suitable for a variety of competitive shooting disciplines. 

The forged steel frame and slide are anodized for durability, as well as good looks. Despite the relatively low price, the pistol comes with hardwood Cocobolo grips that make the Range Officer an attractive pistol, too. 

The pistol comes with adjustable target sights. The adjustable sights are made by Novak, and are considered to be some of the best on the market. The rear notch and front sight blade align with just enough ""air"" around the sight picture to let you know that your sight blade is centered. Once adjusted, they stay adjusted, even after thousands of rounds. 

If you're not sure which type of competitive shooting you'd like to get into, the Range Officer is a reasonably-priced way to try all of the shooting competitions before you decide.

Product Description
Originally designed by Bruce Browning, this is the Browning Autoloading Rifle that started it all. Featuring fine Walnut, a precision machined ordinance steel receiver and a hammer forged barrel, this magnificent BAR will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance, the BAR MK II Safari is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet.

Hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy.
The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
Patented BOSS® device available on certain models of the BAR MK II Safari model allows your to dial-in barrel harmonics to maximize accuracy with your favorite load.
Scroll-engraved ordinance steel receiver on the BAR MK II Safari is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
Gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel.
Seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.
Strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.
Buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.
Bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.
BAR MK II Safari is equipped with a traditional detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading, in the field or on the range.
Magazine capacity on the BAR MK II Safari is 3 rounds in WSM calibers, 4 rounds in traditional magnum calibers and 5 rounds in standard calibers.
Trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod.
Generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
Richly blued steel finish is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
Charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard.
Crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Walnut stock on the BAR MK II Safari has cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, and a beautiful deep gloss finish that brings out every nuance of the warm grain of the wood.
Traditional recoil pad on the BAR MK II Safari greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.
Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling.

852,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2793852,For Sale:  .40 S&W High Quality Defensive HP Reloads (290 rounds total),"White Bear / St. Paul, Minnesota, United States",$ 120,"Listed On: Thursday, March 27, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have three boxes of high quality reloaded .40 S&W handgun ammunition. There are a total of 290 rounds in three 100-round Dillon Boxes. These consist of:

2 boxes (190 rounds) 200 grain Hornady XTP - hollow point cartridges, loaded with once-fired Federal cases, AA#2 powder and Federal primers.
These big 200 grainers have a velocity of 968 fps and would work well as a defensive or a hunting load.
One box is full and the other is missing 10 rounds - 190 rounds total.

1 box (100 rounds) 155 grain Hornady XTP - hollow point cartridges, loaded with once-fired R-P cases, AA#2 powder and Federal primers.
These lighter 155 grainers have a velocity of 1150 fps and would work well as a defensive or a hunting load, with less recoil than the larger slugs.
One complete box - 100 rounds total.

These were loaded by an experienced reloader a few years ago on a Dillon 550 press and are very high quality....as good as you can buy new. I bought them at a gun show in another state...(Oklahoma?). That said, they are still reloads and some guns recommend against using reloaded ammunition (Glock in particular). BUT a friend of mine shot some of this in his Glock with no problems, however, since I did not reload them I take no responsibility or liability for their use or misuse.

And if you did buy defensive ammo like these new it would cost you twice what I am asking. In fact, my price for these hollow points is less that you would pay for basic ball ammo in this caliber...these are a great deal. (Fleet Farm gets almost 120 and tax for a blasting pack (250 rounds) of MagTech FMJ....this is cheaper than that and it's Hornady HP!)

I shot quite a bit of this in my S&W Sigma and the stuff is consistent and accurate, but traded that gun last year along with some of this ammo....I uncovered this in a corner of my shop recently and with nothing to shoot it in, it's up for grabs.

My Price is $45.00 per box for the two full boxes, and $40.00 for the box with 90 rounds in it. Hey! These Dillon boxes are five bucks each empty! I have a few more pics that I can't post here so if you want to see closeups or have questions, let me know. Sorry - I won't mail it - FTF only.

$45/$40 box cash or If you want it all, I'd take $120 cash.



Note: It is reloaded ammo and I didn't reload it so I will take no responsibility for its use or misuse. Some handguns recommend against the use of reloaded ammunition so read your owners manual. I haven't had a problem with it but it's still reloaded ammo. Just sayin'....."
