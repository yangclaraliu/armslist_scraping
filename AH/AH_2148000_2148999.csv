Up for sale is my nearly new Bravo Company Mod 0 mid length AR15.  I added a Magpul handguard, Magpul folding rear sight, Magpul AFG handguard grip, and a Yankee Hill gas block with folding front sight.  The rifle is less than 6 months old and has less than 150 rounds through it.  BCM rifles are very high quality which are built and tested to the highest standards. Bolt carrier groups and barrels are mil spec, magnetic particle inspected, and high pressure tested.  Check out  http://www.bravocompanyusa.com/ for info.  Definitely a step above most box store AR15's. 

Mounted up top is an Aimpoint Pro optic with the Aimpoint protective cover.  This is a very high quality optic which you can leave on 24 hrs a day for 3 years on the same battery.  Also included is 13 30rd mags, 9 of which are PMags, and 2020 rnds of 5.56/.223 ammo, all new and factory loaded.

I would really prefer to sell as a package.  However, I will sell the rifle or the Aimpoint separately.  I won't sell the ammo or mags until the rifle sells, in case it doesn't I will need those.  I don't need to sell any of this, I just don't shoot it and am moving into other things, so listed price is firm and is $1000 less than you would pay at today's prices.  No trades considered except for a partial trade for a .308/30-06/.270 bolt gun.  price is $2200 for everything, $1200 for rifle, $350 for Aimpoint, or $1500 for rifle with Aimpoint.

I am the original owner of this gun, it was bought new at Hoover Tactical several years ago. It has had around 300 rounds put through it, and the only problems I have had with it is when I ran steel cased Tula ammo through it. The gun comes with the original box, papers, gun lock, and ext. Also comes with a WC Creations hybrid kydex/leather tuckable holster. Gun was my daily carry for a few years, so it is showing some holster wear on the right hand side of the slide.

I'm interested in specifically the carbines (i.e. M38, M44, M91/38, etc.), but I'm open to any model.

 I'm wanting to get this rifle so that I can do some target shooting (maybe hunting) with some friends so functionality is the key issue. I don't really care about the look/finish for the most part.

In a perfect world I'd like to find something that shoots well, though since it'll be a Mosin I'm planning on having to put some TLC into it.

If you have accessories let me know about them and we can alter prices based on them. Things I'm specifically looking for are a Bandolier/Ammo pouch, stripper clips and a sling.

As far as ammo goes I'll take anything up to a 440 spam can of ammo (maybe more)

 Bent bolt is a plus but by no means a necessity.

You only need to look at the “standard features” to understand that standard means extraordinary to everyone else. From the match-grade, air-gaged, polished 416 stainless steel 18” custom-fluted mid-weight barrel to a forged and precision-fitted upper and lower receiver to a matched bolt and bolt carrier with H-buffer. This rifle means business. And consider that Colt competition “triple port” muzzle brake along with a Magpul MOE grip and enlarged trigger guard and Geissele two-stage match trigger breaking at 3.5 lbs and you know you also have a performer in your hands. Go ahead. Check the specs. It’s all in there.

PICTURES TOO LARGE- PLEASE EMAIL FOR MORE PHOTOS (I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE RIFLE FROM ALL ANGLES, WITH SCOPE ON AND OFF)

Russian Capture- Czech manufactured (DOU) 1944 on receiver. Imported by Century, with import marks underneath the barrel (so older import, as I am told they got in trouble with ATF and now have to put import marks on receiver and in easily spotted areas) This rifle being a capture rifles was rebuilt by the russians and has no original matching parts except electropencil after rebuild (much like a mosin nagant). The rifle has the original marksman style safety (to clear a scope) and has been drilled for scope rings. The scope rings are high turret reproductions (valued at $100-200 depending on what size, height, on various mauser outfits). I will throw in a redfield scope (NOT ORIGINAL, NOT REPRODUCTION, MODERN Style Scope). 

I bought the rifle with the scope and rings, but have been firing it using iron sights, bore is good and shoots straight. I have a few 8mm surplus rounds (14) remaining that I will throw in as well.

This is the heavy 9 shot model, with a slightly modified bayonet lug to reduce metal on metal contact with the bezel of the flashlight. Dual locking bars, massively thick barrel and magazine tube, and Picatinny standard rail makes this shotgun one of the best scatterguns in the world. Used by the U.S. Marines, it can accept mossberg 500 parts like stocks, magazine tubes, barrels, and forends. Not sure why you would, but you could if you wanted. It is chambered for 2 3/4 loads, and considering it is a pump gun, it will reliably feed every sort of 12 gauge shells you could possibly want. 
One Surefire Dedicated Forend light, with pressure switch and a bezel typical of surefire weaponlights. The grip area is tactile rubber, and the body is metal. This model is the high end one, including a two battery body, constant on/off switch, and a weaponlight lockout switch to keep it from turning on when you don't want it. 
One Mesa Tactical side saddle shell carrier. It bolts securely to the frame of the gun, through the rear takedown pin and the ejector bolt. there is a thin strip of rubber beneath it, so your frame is still unmarred after hundreds of rounds of buckshot. There is an internal tube of replaceable rubber (just replaced) that holds the rounds in. Don't worry about primers pointed down, this holds shells solidly. 
One Blackhawk recoil control stock. while expensive, it includes an internal recoil reduction spring, pistol grip, and M4 style rear stock. Sling attachment points in three places, a rubber buttpad, and an internal locking grommet keeps everything very solid. 
One optics rail, designed for this weapon specifically. while Picatinny standard, the inside has a groove to allow you to use the iron sights. Not sure why you would, though. The stock is directly inline with the barrel, making it very controllable, but not so great for using the front bead. 
One Sig Sauer red dot optic. uses 2032 batteries, with ten levels of brightness. Its locktited onto the rail, so it would be tough to remove, but again, why would you want to? 

All together, this is a combat scattergun that would be right at home in a patrol car, home defense safe, or war zone. you would be hard pressed to find accessories better than what you are buying, and you would pay far more to build it. 

The gun is solid, with minor wear and tear, but upkeep, cleaning, and parts replacement has been monitored by an active duty Army armorer. The ejector, magazine spring, and rubber sidesaddle tube have been replaced within the last six months, and it comes with a free, brand new magazine tube spring. 

Sadly, the primary user of this fine firearm has swapped to a different model due to work requirements, so now it is up for grabs."

HeadDown’s Deceptus Break Down Rifle is easily (tool-lessly) disassembled into two roughly equal-length parts—the receiver and stock on the one hand, the 16-inch; 1:7-inch twist, hammer-forged barrel on the other. Combined they make for a fairly petite 36.6-inch carbine, chambered in either 5.56x45mm NATO or 300 AAC Blackout. Forged from 7075 steel and hard-coat anodized for durability, the Deceptus features a mid-length gas system, an MFT stock, an A2 pistol grip and a thread protector. Included with the rifle is a custom hard case (into which the bisected rifle neatly fits) and one 30-round magazine

A Hungarian FEG SA85 converted to an AK-104-gery. I got it from Darren Mellors of Grenadier Precision in Tx before he went to LWRC in VA. It obviously has the AK-104 gas block/front sight/muzzle thread as well as a Chris Butler brake/flash hider to bring the barrel up to 16"". Additionally, the rear sight has been replaced with a short picatinny rail and a AR type folding peep sight has been riveted on to the rear of the dust cover. I believe the trigger is a G2. 

The gun is incredibly light and handy for such a hard hitting round. I was going to convert it to a folding stock, but I liked the balance so much that I decided not to mess with it. 

I'm only selling because I'm getting away from 7.62x39 and moving toward 7.62x35, otherwise I'd keep it. 

The gun has had maybe 200 rounds put through it by me, I used my Saiga's for blasting. The condition is great as can been seen from the pics. It comes with a 2 point sling and a poly mag. 

I'd like to get $1,000 for it, plus shipping. The rifle is in South Charlotte."

-UTL
-5 X 10rd factory magazines
-Safariland drop leg holster (only holds USP)
-Factory 3 dot sights (installed MTM night sights are faded)
-Factory cases for both the USP and the UTL

I am the first owner of this pistol and the USP has only been shot at indoor ranges. Considering her pedigree, she can take a lot more punishment than I could ever dish out from a range session. It has never been carried - I purchased the holster on a whim. The UTL has always been stored with the batteries removed and from the pictures you can see it is in working order. The reason that I am looking to sell/trade it is that I want something that will be easier to carry (just completed my CCW course).

As for partial trades, I am ""interested in"":

SIG 220 (especially beavertail models)
Glock 21 or 30 (Gen 4 only please)
S&W Ladysmith model revolver in .357 (for my fiancé)
Lever action rifle in .44 Mag or .45LC
Ruger 10/22 (take down model only)
Surefire X400 Ultra

I'm also open to hearing what else is out there for trade. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in trading for 1911 pattern pistols, shotguns, or any other types of rifles than those listed (sorry). I'm also not looking to part with any cash in the trade.

Of course, cash always works as well. I'd put the trade value of the package at $1200. I can also include some ammo (with an upwards price adjustment) depending on the deal.

FTF in NoVA requires 2 forms of ID and BoS. I will provide the same for a trade. I am also willing to ship to your FFL for shipping costs."
