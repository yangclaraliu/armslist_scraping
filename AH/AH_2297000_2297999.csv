It's not an SPCII chamber, specificially, as the header states.  The 700s (Remington only built them in 2005-2006, during the original release of the SPC chambering) are, allegedly, closer to SPCII than SPC, if you talk to some of the folks over at 6.8Forums.  It can be reamed to SPCII with minimal effort.

It had some holster wear and is not perfect comsometicly but the bore is very clean with around 150 rounds out of it and it's a very solid well made gun and the cyclinder locks up nice and tight on it. Shoots great and can also shoot the plus P rounds as well due to the 4 inch barrel that is a heavy duty S&W CTG barrel and nice bright sights. This gun is a very friable great shooting gun with some history behind it. It was carried by a St.Louis police offers gun. It's a double/single action gun which is great for home defense.

The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols."

Has been kept in a gun case in his closet for as long as I can remember.  Shotgun is older than I am, has no serial number (pre-'68), and is a FOX Model BSE-c.  From what I've been able to find out online, date of manufacture was approximately 1958, which classifies this as a ""Curio and Relic"" exempt from Bloomberg and Hickenlooper's stupid law, so no need to go through an FFL.

Shotgun has been heavily customized.  Barrels were professionally cut back to 18.5"" with new sight beads installed.  Wood was refinished.  Sling swivels installed.  Handmade leather sling and shell caddy installed.  This shotgun will accept 2 3/4"" or 3"" 20 gauge shells and has a full choke so slugs are no problem in either barrel.  SINGLE TRIGGER with non-rebounding hammers is a very solid and foolproof design.  The FOX is a fancier version of the Savage/Stevens 311, which is built like a tank.

The negatives about this gun are few.  There are a few light scratches on the underside of the receiver, probably from bracing it against a tree branch on a hunting trip.  Also, someone tried to cover up some scuff marks on the finish with a bit of cold blue here and there, and if examined closely under a light you can see the difference in color where the touchups were made.  On top of the stock there is a slight scrape from the break action lever rubbing against it.  These are all very minor and normal blemishes from honest use.  Not a safe queen, but not a beater either.  Round count is very low.  Just cleaned up the action and oiled it and it is working very smoothly.  Should provide a lifetime of trouble free use.

Shotgun is lightweight and compact with light recoil.  Great for camping trips or home defense.  Lockup is solid, extractors work perfectly, both firing pins are intact, safety works like it should.

Shotgun comes with: leather sling, leather shell caddy, a gun case, and over a hundred rounds of assorted ammo.  I have not counted the field loads, but there is a gallon sized ziplock bag filled with them, I'm guessing about 75 plastic hulled Federal 7 1/2 birdshot.  4 lead rifled slugs.  25 rounds of RIO C20 00 Buck (imported from Spain and hard to find), 5 rounds of DUPO20 lead free expanding slugs (imported from Latvia and hard to find).  All ammo is new and recently purchased. 

Selling to pay bills and because I decided I'm really not into shotguns.  Finally figured out how to upload pic from my phone to the computer, and sorry it isn't the greatest.  Asking 450 CASH for everything, and I'm pretty firm on price.  This is a good solid shotgun in nice shape with plenty of extras, and I had a lot of interest in it and not in a rush to sell.  Not particularly interested in trades unless you have a lever action 357 (not interested in any other caliber), a 6"" GP-100, or a SIG P230.  Will not ship.  Must be a Colorado resident willing to meet near Denver.  No prohibited persons.  I reserve the right to withdraw this item at any time.  Thanks."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured.

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. The P226 Black Stainless has both a stainless frame and slide that has been Nitron coated.

538,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2297538,"For Sale:  Model 1817 ""common rifle"" made in 1824 by Simeon North","Suffolk, Hampton Roads, Virginia","$ 3,000","Listed On: Monday, November 4, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY!

Pictures Available Upon Request

The Model 1817 is normally referred to as the “Common Rifle” by both collectors and historians. It derived its name due to that it was being manufactured simultaneously with the Hall’s Rifle and the 1817 was the more common of the two (the Hall being a breechloading weapon), but there was definitely nothing common about this unique offering to U.S. martial weapons.

The first thing that makes the M1817 different is the fact that it is the only primary issue weapon in U.S. military history to be entirely produced by way of contracts with none of the rifles being made at a National Armory. Though the design was created at the Harper’s Ferry Armory, the entire production of 38,200 were made by five outside contractors: H. Deringer, R. Johnson, Simeon North, N. Starr, and R. & J.D. Johnson. Deringer produced the highest number, with some 13,000 rifles completed, while R. & J.D. Johnson manufactured the least, with a total of 3,000.

The first two features that meet the eye when looking at a M1817 is the attractive oval patchbox in the stock and the configuration of the stock  itself. When one looks at the M1817, they are in some ways reminded of a Kentucky Long Rifle. The popularity and reputation of the Kentucky and Pennsylvania Long Rifle was evidenced in the design of the M1817 stock which was crafted to reflect the appearance of those weapons with its gracefully sloping butt stock.

The mere fact that it was a rifle made it uncommon in 1817, when it first went into production. In an era of smooth bore production, the seven groove rifling in the barrel of the M1817 was indeed an oddity. Up to this time, rifles were designated to be carried only by specific units of “Riflemen.” The smooth bore, fired at close order from solid lines of men, standing shoulder to shoulder, was still the favored weapon with the commanding officers of the world’s armies.

The government was issuing a rifled weapon on a large scale for the first time in military history. Given the small size of the standing American army during this period, it can be safely stated that a higher percentage of American soldiers had access to the improved rifled muskets than soldiers in any other army in the world.

The specifications for the rifle were a 54 caliber and a 36"" barrel attached to the stock by means of three barrel bands. In its original flintlock configuration, it has a brass flashpan, with no fence, attached to a case-hardened lockplate. Mountings were of iron with all metal parts being finished brown. Locks were marked by the individual markers, but there were US markings present on the weapons as well—a “US/P/” at the breech of the barrel, and a “US” on the tang of the butt plate. The stocks were made of walnut, and the ramrods were of the trumpet type, with brass heads. There was no provision made for a bayonet, as the rifle was not intended to be used with one.

The duration of manufacture lasted from 1817 until 1840, (with the greatest production taking place in the 1820s) making it also one of the most tenured longarms in American military history. Toward the end of the production run, the new percussion system was beginning to be adopted by many nations as their standard infantry weapons. The U.S. Model 1842, while still a smooth bore, was the first American military percussion musket to be adopted for service. It was the M1842 that was  the standard American musket during the Mexican-American War, but a large number of M1817s also made the trip south of the border. The advent of the percussion era relegated all flintlocks obsolete, and the M1817 was no exception. When the ordnance department began the process of converting many of their old flintlocks to percussion in the 1840s and 1850s, the Model 1817 was a prime candidate. Because it was a rifled piece, the “Common Rifle” was a natural choice for the conversions that were taking place both at the national armories  as well as through government contract. Many examples of percussion M1817s exist today with both the French and Belgian type of conversions.

By the time of the U.S. Civil War, most of the M1817s were stored in various state arsenals with a large number of these being in the South. The rarest and most soughtafter version of the M1817 was a result of this southern connection. M.A. Baker, gunsmith in Fayetteville, N.C., received a Confederate contract to convert a number of M1816 and M1817 muskets that were still in the original flintlock. It is not known how many total rifles Baker converted, but the number was definitely under 1,000 for both models combined. Lockplates are marked “M.A. Baker/ Fayetteville, N.C.” and many will also have “N. Carolina” stamped on to the barrel. Production began in 1862 and was completed in 1863.

Confederates were not the only ones to use the M1817 when the Civil War broke out. Many Union troops also carried them into battle, from all accounts, they were well received by the troops, and were far preferable to a Model 1816 or even a Model 1842, by reason of their rifling. Their major drawback in the field was the fact that they were 54 caliber, necessitating ordinance officers to stock yet another bullet to go along with the more common .58 and .69 calibers. When the M1817 Rifles were eventually pulled out of service in favor of the Model 1861, it was as much to solve the problem of ammunition supply and uniformity as anything.

They remain one of the more graceful in appearance and better-made of all of the U.S. military longarms to be produced, from the time of their introduction through the Civil War."

Installed on my AK currently but I have decided to go back to the original stock to sell the gun. 
This is for the butt stock only not the folding mechanism or adapter to the gun. 
The Stock was installed on the gun but never fired, I wrapped the top with paracord for looks and to have a softer cheek weld, can simply be unraveled and used as well. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions. I firmly recommend this stock it is built strong in the USA.

Benelli Super Nova Pump. 12 gauge, 28"" barrel. Comfortech Stock. Max-4 HD Camo.
The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip.At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core."

9mm and .40 S&W available. 2 10rd mags eac. 4 inch barrel. Will ship this item.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

BRAND NEW. Will ship this item.

General Features
The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.
Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.
