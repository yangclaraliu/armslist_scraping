The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.
Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

. The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other p­istols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

""Noveske's Stainless Steel AR-15 Match Barrels in 300 AAC Blackout are perfect for wringing the most accuracy and performance out of this unique new cartridge. Composed of 416R stainless steel that's hardened to 30 RC, the barrel has a medium contour, bead-blasted satin finish, M4 extended feed ramps, and is threaded at the muzzle for the addition of flash hiders, muzzle brakes and/or sound suppressors. Each barrel is shipped with a pinned, low profile gas block, gas tube and barrel extension. 

The barrel's pistol length gas system provides optimal reliability with subsonic ammunition while suppressed, and supersonic ammunition while unsuppressed. While supersonic ammunition may also function with a sound suppressor installed, subsonic ammunition fired without a sound suppressor may cause cycling problems.

I added:
A Magpul trigger guard
Ergo grip with a palm swell (though I am including the original grip as well)
Magpul MBUS pop up iron sights
BCM/VLTOR charging handle
Daniel Defense low profile buffer tube quick detach point (the stock can collapse all the way using this QD point)

Otherwise included are 1 magpul PMAG and 2 stanag style magazines with plastic followers, a VLTOR buttstock, a sling with QD attachments and 2 detachable rail sections.

The gun is in used condition with less than 500 rounds run through it. The trigger feels amazing, and the gun is incredibly light. There are no marks on the gun, and it is in a nearly new state. I'm selling it because I'm not a huge fan of the AR15 platform, and prefer older guns.

If you have any questions or wish to see any further photos of the firearm, please do not hesitate to contact me. Feel free to make an offer, but please don't low-ball me.

I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet up. I have a good guy badge (CPL) I can show at time of sale. You must be able show show a Washington State ID; if this sale crosses state lines it will need to go through an FFL.

It's a great weapon but I just have too many AR-15s at the moment and would love to see what trade offers come in. I'm pretty open to anything except .40 cal pistols. 

This weapon is nice and lightweight yet full featured (has forward assist and ejection port cover) and is NOT made of plastic. It would make a great truck gun, child's gun, or lightweight backpacking or a nice light gun to trudge through the woods on a hog hunt with. 

It comes with a lightweight barrel that is .750 under the gas block. The gas block is ""receiver-height"" so there is not a step-down in height from the receiver to the gas block, nor would their be a step down in height if you added an nice drop-in quad rail. It comes with a OD green CAR stock, milspec buffer tube, complete BCG, Magoul ASAP rear sling adapter, full heat shield carbine length handguards.  

Note: I plan on removing and keeping the HK-style sights that are on it because I want them for a 7.5"" AR pistol build. (Unless we work them into the deal somehow)

I'd also be willing to trade just the upper for a 7.5"" barreled upper."

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

This Underwood ammo is built to the tightest tolerances for peak performance rivaling and sometimes surpassing handloads in many guns. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.  Speer Total Metal Jacket Handgun Bullets represent the highest level of evolution of the full metal jacket bullet. Uni-Cor construction bonds the jacket to the core for near perfect uniformity and eliminates the opening found on the base of other bullets. Conventional FMJ bases can also deform under pressure, which decreases accurracy. Perfect for indoor target shooting.

This is a full power plus 41 Mag. load. It is safe to fire in all 41 Mag. chambered firearms and has short enough over-all-length to fit even very short cylindered revolvers such as the Taurus. We are not able to use a flash suppressed propellant for this load, so you’ll notice a large muzzle flash when fired from barrels under 7 or 8 inches in length.

This load is designed primarily for hunting animals the size of deer and medium sized black bear. Additionally, it would make a wicked defense load against humans.

As always, Buffalo Bore refuses to follow the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities. Our advertised velocities are generated from real world firearms so our customers can see what type of results they will get in the real world, where it matters.

Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target.

Here is a list of the components that have been added.

- Gg&g Rem 870 Enhanced Follower
- Sightmark Multi - reticle Reflex Sight Matte Black
- UTG Standard Push Button QD Sling Swivel, 1-Inch Loop

- Mako Recoil-Reducing Folding Collapsible Buttstock for Remington 870
- Black Aces Tactical Quad Rail System Remington 870/1100 Combo With Extended Pin Set

This shotgun is a great home defense weapon, and is in great condition.  The butt stock is a great addition to the shotgun.  The piston takes nearly all of the recoil allowing you to shoot to your hearts content without the sore shoulder afterwards.

I would consider trading for a .17 HMR bolt action rifle + some cash or something that will equal it out.

The picture also shows an Eotech XPS on the rifle, that will NOT be included in the sale; however, for another $50, I can include an Aimpoint clone with it.  They usually sell for $100.  You can see it attached to the HK MP5 in the second picture (rifle not included :p)

These rifles are selling for $750-800 new.  This has around $200 in magpul parts alone included with it, as well as a couple mags I could throw in.  All said and done it's $850 for a fully dressed rifle with optic that needs absolutely nothing, I think that's a heck of a deal and I don't see anything else lower on Armslist locally right now.  I just need to get it sold THIS WEEK so I can move on another rifle.

This is the Gen 2 C15 with dust cover and forward assist.  Excellent shooting rifle and I would not consider selling it under normal circumstances.  I'm the original owner, purchased it new in 2012.

I have original case and owners manual as well. I am looking to trade/sell for a new toy,  What do you have? I would say there is $1500-1600 value here so try be realistic....I am putting value on ammo, brass, etc.....Price it out I know that bare guns don't typically go for this. If you just want the gun....make me an offer. Shoot me your offer...I might take it. I will respond to all reasonable offers.  I also have a  Stevens 311r SxS 12 gauge shotgun and a Star M43 9mm that might be used to up the value.  I can take and send more pics if needed...."

I obviously have all the paperwork that comes in the box. It comes with the gun, 2 magazines, gun oil, trigger lock and a trigger guard, manual, and several papers. Just look up the SCCY CPX-2 and you will see how highly rated it is. It looks really nice. There is no external safety but instead around an 8-pound trigger(which is the safety). Do your research on this gun and you will see, for the price, this is the gun to get. Gun comes with a LIFETIME NO QUESTIONS ASKED WARRANTY THROUGH THE MANUFACTORY. Does NOT require any registration through the company. If you have the firearm, it's covered under the lifetime warranty. Just check out their website to see how great the warranty is. This gun cost $340 plus tax. So I would like to get $300 out of it since it's practically brand new. Text 405-four six four- 1756 if your interested in buying.

This is an exceptional firearm that's an excellent choice for conceal carry; HK's proprietary metal treatment will hold up well to the humid, sweaty florida weather.  No Rust no Fuss!  This HK comes with standard 3 dot combat sights.

This is a Variant 1 pistol, right handed configuration, with DA/SA action and decocker.  Unlike many DA/SA weapons, the safety can be engaged with the hammer lowered.  This pistol can also be carried cocked and locked like the 1911 for strictly SA operation.

Designed for lever-action rifles
Elastomer Flex Tip bullet is safe in tubular magazine
High ballistic coefficient increases range
Expands reliably from 800 to 2,000+ fps
Delivers up to 40% more energy than traditional flat-point rounds
Hornady, a leader in ballistic innovation, now introduces a new line of ammunition for lever-action rifles that dramatically increases velocity, energy, trajectory and downrange terminal performance. Lever guns with tubular magazines have been hindered in the past by their inability to fire pointed bullets safely. Now Hornady has perfected the Elastomer Flex Tip™ bullet that can be safely fired from such rifles without fear of a chain reaction discharge in the magazine. The Flex Tip puts enough give in the bullet tip to prevent detonation of the primer ahead of it in the magazine. It also increases the ballistic coefficient of the round by using a pointed bullet design and permits the use of propellants that can turn popular 100-yard ""brush gun"" rounds into deadly performers at 200 yards and beyond. For example, LEVERevolution .30-30 ammunition shoots a 160-grain bullet that is 400 fps faster and has 400 ft.-lbs. more energy at 250 yards than conventional .30-30 ammo, and bullet drop at 300 yards is about 12"" with a 200-yard zero. LEVERevolution similarly enhances the performance of other popular lever gun calibers and delivers up to 40% more energy compared to conventional flat-point ammunition. Join the LEVERevolution today. Per 20. I currently have 2 Boxes on hand.
