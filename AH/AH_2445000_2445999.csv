6.	Ring Size is 6
I took this to two different jewelry stores on 12-20-2013 to see what they say it is worth. 
They also verified the above information. 
* The first one said $9200 and the second one I took it to said $9600, so that’s what THEY say it’s worth. They’re the professionals. Not me. I know I paid more for it, but once again, that was years ago.
I am not paying to have another appraisal done on it, just to sell it for a fraction of what I gave for it. I'll meet you at any Jewelry Store for verification of value.
It’s in a beautiful ‘Real’ Cherry wood box with white leather liner.
I’ll take $3800 for it (cash or Certified Funds), or $4500 trade value.
I'm willing to pay upwards for more valuable item(s). ie; late 70's to early 80's SWB Pickup."

166,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2445166,For Sale:  Antique Japanese Samurai Sword,"Eastside, Cleveland, Ohio","$ 3,800","Listed On: Monday, January 6, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Bought this sword from a live estate auction in Youngstown a few months ago. I have been checking and had a local antiques dealer look at it. He had a student that is Japanese look at it and try to read the papers with the sword.

The antiques dealer took the handle off to see who made the sword. The handle was very rusty, it does have the makers writing on the handle but he could not be read it due to the rust.

It is a long sword called katana from the hand guard to the top of the sword is 28 ½” long.
There are grooves in the sword on both sides and is very sharp.

The temper line is rolling and you can see swirls in the metal. The student said that is from pounding the steel to make the sword.

The handle is a military handle with a Captain officer identification cord and the ends of the handle where the cord is tied is silver.

The hand guard is old steel with waves and gold dots.

The sheath looks newer but very nice with stripes but had a leather cover on it but the cover was very dry and fell apart after the dealer took it off the sheath and carrying it around.

There was an envelope on the sheath that has Japanese documents in them and I was told they are the license and a note that says something about 1680.

I have checked Ebay and seen similar swords selling for $3500 to $10000 dollars. The antique dealer said I should get at least $3500 and maybe more. He is willing to put it in his auction in a couple months but I want to try and sell it now for extra Christmas money.  THE ONLY WAY I WILL SELL IS FOR CASH FACE TO FACE OR USING PAYPAL IF THE BUYER PAYS THE PAYPAL FEES AND SHIPPING.

The SKS without the bayonet is $400.00 and was manufactured in Factory 625 and uses stamped metal parts.  This does not affect the reliability, strength or operation of the rifle.  All parts are interchangeable with any SKS part/accessory available.  The only reason the Chinese went to stamped parts is so that they could produce more rifles, faster and cheaper while maintaining military-grade reliability.  Essentially the factories saved money by not employing skilled milling craftsmen that were required to produce milled parts.

Regardless of which rifle you choose, you will have a very good rifle that will last you forever!

This Saiga is a Russian built ak which is the most accurate and highest quality type of ak you can buy on the market.  It has all arsenal black furniture with the trapdoor in the buttstock for the cleaning kit it comes with.  Also comes with a VERY comfortable US. Palm pistol grip, and arsenal's ak 74 style brake built for 7.62x39.  This is not one of the knockoff tapco versions, this brake cost me 45 dollars and is almost brand new.  Yes, it came to me from the factory uncolored, without any type of finish or paint, so it's not worn in the slightest.  The gun has had less than a thousand rounds through it and I was managing to shoot 4 moa with it while just shooting for fun and it has never jammed once.  Obviously everything is threaded to standard the standard 14x1 LH soviet standard, and it comes with a thread adaptor which is what holds the authentic AK 74 style brake on.  The same gun, new retails at about 1,200 dollars.  If you're in the market for a quality AK, for an absolute killer price, then please jump on this before somebody else gets the deal.

The only thing that does not come with this rifle is the sling, which costs about $5 USD online if you really like it.

Pistol available separately or as a package deal.  Trades listed.

Ok, after several requests, I have decided to go ahead and split this package up for interested parties.  The prices are broken down below.  Willing to make a better deal for multiple items.

HISTORY:

It has seen exactly 1,144 rounds.  I have professionally maintained this pistol according to Glock specs, and it has performed flawlessly with all types of ammunition.  The only wear on the pistol is on the barrel where it contacts the end of the slide, as seen in the pictures.  The bore and feed ramp are excellent.  Function is 100%

(Funny how I see so many ""low round count"" guns on here.  What that means to me is either: A - Unknown round count, B - The person owns guns just to own them, or   C - Bullshit.)

Ghost 3.5# Trigger Connector
Extended Slide Release
Extended Magazine Release
Grip Plug

1 Glock Factory 13 Round magazine

1 Set of .45 ACP Lee Carbide Reloading Dies

Product Description
savage_arms The Predator Hunter is designed with the accuracy shooters expect in fixed shooter in a rifle that's light enough to make an excellent walking varminter. The reliable Model 10 action, used as the basis for the entire Savage line, uses a bolt with a plunger-type ejector passing through the bolt face. Savage turns all its barrels from a proprietary carbon-steel alloy stock with button-rifling and a recessed, target-style crown that protects the barrel from dirt and grit. Each Predator Hunter comes with a fully camo-treated synthetic composite stock and a 24-inch tapered and fluted barrel along with the best-in-the-business, quick-adjustable Savage AccuTrigger. Rounded forend. Oversized bolt handle.

I've got a delaware machinery AR-15 I'm looking to sell. I purchased this rifle in December 2012 at the gun show. I've had I believe around 60 rounds through this gun since I purchased it. Now it just sits and doesn't get shot any so I'm looking to sell. I've got with this gun 5 mags and around 300 plus rounds. Gun shoots fine with all the mags also. I've got two steal mags, one Tapco, and two Magpul mags (one with window one without). The lower is stamped .223 and the barrel is marked .556 with a 1/9 twist also. Also this rifle has a sightmark red dot sight on it. I haven't shot it enough to sight it in. I got it from Acadamy for $100. Has four different sights you can choose from.

I'm looking to sell everything as a group really not wanting to part the mags and ammo and so forth. Also in the pictures below the bag of ammo is only part of what I have. All the mags are loaded 30 a piece plus whats in the bag.

THE ONLY TRADE I WOULD CONSIDER WOULD BE A: S&W M&P Shield 9mm or .40SW with cash on top. Not sure how much but I'm open to offers if you have that particular firearm.

The gun includes the following features:
22"" barrel threaded for Remington choke tubes and chambered for 2 3/4""shells
Fiber optic front bead
8 round extended magazine tube with tube clamp (total capacity 9 shells)
Front and rear sling studs

High visibility red magazine follower* ($15)

Gun cycles low brass bulk birdshot fine, and has an estimated 3 or 4 hundred shells put through it. The gun shows some handling marks but because of the black finish under the green cerakote they are hardly noticeable. Finish is ~ 98%. Nothing that a shooter is going to mind. Only selling to build a new computer.

Not interested in trades. First one to meet me in Stillwater gets the gun, no exceptions. This gun with all the extras would be about $1,000 new so I am not going to respond to lowball offers.

Very comfortable to carry. I shot somewhere between 300 and 600 rounds through it. I kept this gun well cleaned the lubricated. The last time I took it to the range I accidently dry fired the gun a few times and broke the mechanism that retains the firing pin. I sent it to Kel-Tec as this problem was covered under warranty. I was amazed by Kel-Tec's great customer service. They shipped the gun to and from the factory for free. They gave me a new slide, barrel, internal parts, and polished the feed ramp. In short the upper receiver is new and the lower receiver is gently used. The gun comes with four magazines, an upgraded steel guide rod, magazine grip extension, and small case as pictured. New this gun only comes with one magazine. Extra magazines cost approximately $30.00 each. So getting four magazines is a nice bonus.

The stock was slightly filed to accept the Tapco removable 20 round magazine. This filing is unnoticeable from the outside, and had no effect on the original 10 round magazine function or stability. Ive switched between both magazines with bullets loaded to make sure they load and un-load- both work perfectly. As stated above, this gun has never been dis-charged, its a brand new gun, and from what I understand of these models, it was probably bought in the 1990's at some point that is unknown to me. All numbers match on all pieces, including the box the rifle was sold to me in. Its a nice rifle, and becoming more rare as the years pass. Because I have more than one, I am selling this one. I will consider meeting within the state of New Mexico, within reason."

For example, I recently built a very larg bug out kit for a family of 7 that was worth (retail) around $1500 but traded it for a rifle valued at $1000 so I price/value my kits very fairly. If you have any guns you willing to trade let me know and we can work out a deal. If interested let me know and I will send a list of what I can build and what I have available. If you dont have medical training but want a good first aid kit and/or general training I can do that as well. Thanks
