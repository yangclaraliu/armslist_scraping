25,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2005025,For Sale/Trade:  Dbal-D2 trade for nice AR or handgun,"Murfreesboro, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 1,700","Listed On: Friday, August 16, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The DBAL-D2 (Dual Beam Aiming Laser) is a multi-function Class 1 Infrared Laser from Laser Devices, Inc.  Being Class 1, it is completely Eye-Safe and available to the general public.  Class 1 IR lasers feature a 0.7mW rating which is not restricted by the FDA. While this is a lower output than the standard 5mW+ IR lasers used by Warfighters and LE Professionals, it is perfectly adequate for targeting at ranges out to 250 yards. This encompasses most ranges at which users will engage targets during night shooting and training.  The DBAL-D2 is designed to be weapon-mounted and act as an aiming system when the shooter is using head-mounted night vision goggles.  With the maximum identification range of the latest Gen3 tubes being between 100-115 yards, the 250-yard range of the Class1 laser is perfect.
At its core, the DBAL-D2 is a civilian-legal DBAL-A2 (AN/PEQ-15A).  It features a Class IIIa visible laser pointer (available in red or green), Class 1 Infrared laser pointer, and Class 1 LED IR illuminator.  The Illuminator is what sets the D2 apart from the legacy LDI Class 1 lasers.  The DBAL-D2 features an integral LED Infrared illuminator, complete with High/Low settings.  At high power, it runs at 600mW, generating IR illumination out to 800 yards (750 yards useable).  This incredibly high power illuminator is an LED, making it completely eye-safe.  What’s more, the 0.7mW infrared laser will not wash out in the illuminator’s beam, giving the shooter clear and precise aiming out to the laser’s maximum range under less-than-optimal lighting conditions.  Please note that the illuminator will “reflect” off walls at high power and close range, effectively washing out the lower power laser.  For these applications, it is recommended to use the illuminator on its low setting.  The illuminator features a variable bezel that can be focused from a wide/short-throw (30°) to a narrow/long-throw beam (2°).
Functionally, the rest of the DBAL-D2 provides the same benefits as the legacy systems.  The Class 1 IR laser works great out to 250 yards and the visible red or green laser is the same as the others.  One difference is both lasers are slaved, meaning that they zero each other when adjustments are made.  This makes zeroing the laser a lot easier.
Physically, the DBAL-D2 features the same robust aircraft-grade machined aluminum housing as LDI’s military lasers.  Obviously, the illuminator housing is larger to accommodate the LED, but other than that, it is about the same size as an AN/PEQ-16B.  It is extremely rugged and can take a lot of abuse.  In fact, when you get the DBAL-D2 in your hands, it is very apparent that it’s built like a tank.  The D2 uses the same excellent HT Self-Adjusting Throw-Lever as every other LDI laser.  This is one of the best quick-detach mounts on the market.  We have yet to find a rail it won’t work on.
The DBAL-D2 is the embodiment of innovation in the civilian night vision market.  LDI listens to its customers and makes products based on more than just what the government wants.  There is no finer multi-function laser on the market.  The inclusion of the infrared illuminator in the unit allows the shooter to free up real estate on the weapon platform for other accessories, or simply condense the amount of things hanging off the gun.  Add in the fact that the illuminator is one of the finest we have seen, and you have a winning product.  Please note: the illuminator is an LED, so there is visible downrange signature.  A visible red light (inherent to all LED’s) can be seen from over 100 yards away when viewed within 2° of the emitter.  This is a very small window, but something professionals need to be aware of. Im asking $1700 or trade for nice AR, bolt gun, or handgun. Text me REDACTED anytime."

Now that that's out of the way here's what I have for you....lol

Up for your consideration is a T-POD Foregrip by Fab Defense. This is not your everyday plastic Foregrip / Bi-Pod that you can purchase for $20. This Foregrip is made of Polymer with the legs being made of Aluminum 6061-T6 Hard Coated Anodize for Superior Durability and are independently adjustable so if you're not on an even surface, you can adjust the legs and be 100% level. The light is a Nebo Protec that is already attached to Foregrip with a pressure switch. All you have to do is squeeze Foregrip handle lightly and it turns on the light or laser. There is a blue button on top of the light that you change the function of the light to a different mode. After changing the mode, the pressure switch will still activate the same way, you now just have a different mode. If you don't want to use the pressure switch, I have the end cap for the light ( to use as a regular flashlight ) and I also have the piece that fits back into the slot on the Foregrip where the pressure mount is. More information and specifications are further down in this listing. I bought these last week to put on my Mossberg 715T, tactical 22 but the gun was stolen while we were gone for the weekend. I have about $280 in both of these items. These T-POD Foregrips / Bi-Pods are made for many guns for the Israelian Army. These two items can be mounted to any rifle that has Picatiny or Weaver Rails. Ideal for Assault Rifles or Target Rifles.

This rifle has barely broken in at approximately 250 rounds of quality brass Federal 55 grain 5.56mm BTFMJ ammo. It has never malfunctioned. Not even once. It is well cared for by operator who knows how to care for AR15 rifles. This rifle bolt and all action parts were treated with Frog Lube upon purchasing and cleaned and treated with Frog Lube since. It is slick. Upper and lower are tighly fit in fact this is one of the biggest advantages besides the lower weight at 5 lbs stock, that the Carbon Fiber offers an EXTREMELY TIGHT fitting upper and lower. This contributes to accuracy and reliability.

The Nikko Stirling Target master is available in four variable zoom models that allow the user to adjust the magnification required to suit their needs. The main body of the scope is a 30 mm hard alloy tube that provides added strength and light transmission over one inch rifle scopes. The lenses are coated in our ETE Microlux coatings, which allow maximum light transmission to your eyes so you see the target faster, clearer and with more contrast. The Adjustments are Target style, to adjust simply pull out gently and turn to the desired setting. Push down again to lock. You can also return the dial setting to Zero with out special tools so you can be ready in the field to accurately compensate as required for both windage and elevation. Key Features: All Target master rifle scopes feature Side Parallax and focus adjustment. This is easily achieved in with the side adjustments compared to objective adjusting rifle scopes. Also located on the side is the switch for the illumination of the reticle. This looks much neater and allows quick adjustments in the field. Fast focus eyepieces allow you to adjust the scope to suit your eye strength.

Smith & Wesson’s M&P pistols are the handguns of choice for many law-enforcement units, and for good reason. Rugged reliability and accuracy combine with solid construction to make the M&P line stand out in a highly competitive field.  Now Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield™. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Unlike some compact semiautomatics, the Shield is outfitted with a thumb safety for added peace of mind. Chambered in 9mm with a 3.1"" barrel, accuracy is outstanding for a compact semiautomatic. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. A steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an eight-round version with an extended finger rest."

But the Finnish M39 is not.  If you know the history of the M39 you can appreciate this one.
I have tracked the rifle down to being issued to the Suojeluskunta (Finnish Civil Guard).  It belonged to the Jager troops which is Finland's Pathfinders.  Took me a while to find the marks on the stock that proved this.  The stock is a war era stock and not a remanufactured one.  It has the dark finish and no damage to it.  The bolt and action have the Russian Tula stamps on them but that is all that is Russian on this rifle.  The barrel is a 1942 Suomen Armeija (SA), Valmet (VKT) and Tikkakoski, D barrel.  And how cool that the serial number is 5150*. (please note that there is no import serial number added to this weapon like all the others that have been imported, it is 100% original)

Now that the history lesson is over, this is an awsome shooter.  I have put about 100 rounds through it with shot groups of about 4 inches at 100 meters with iron sights.  The bore and barrel are super clean.  No problem shooting surplus or new steel ammo.  It will come with the tools, oil can and pouches.  There is no cosmoline on the wepon at all.  The blueing on exposed surfaces shows wear but the unexposed surfaces are still good.  No rust.  All serial numbers match except for the magazine plate.  But this is common because of the nature of how theses M39's were built.

This will be a F2F transaction at in Sacramento (will not ship) and because the weapon is 71 years old no FFL is required in CA.  Must show valid CA ID and be over 18 years of age.

Complete, just add your stripped lower and a magazine!!! I ordered this a Very Long Time ago and it just arrived... No Need for it now and I don't want to pay for shipping it back. So... Here is a DEAL available Right Now just for YOU!!!

This Del-Ton Mid Length Carbine Kit includes everything needed to turn your Stripped AR-15 Lower Receiver and Magazine into a complete, fully functional rifle. This kit features an assembled Del-Ton A3 Flat-Top Upper Receiver with a Chrome Lined 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel, Mid-Length gas system, F-Marked Front Sight Assembly, 2-Piece Handguards and an A2 Flash Hider. The barrel's 5.56x45mm NATO Chamber, M4 Feed Ramps and 1 in 7"" Twist rifling ensure reliable feeding and functioning with a wide variety of both commercial and surplus ammunition using light- or heavy-weight projectiles. The Bolt Carrier is machined from 8620 Steel for strength, incorporates a properly staked, chrome lined gas key, and houses a *Carpenter 158 Steel Bolt that has been High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected to guarantee a consistent, defect-free part.

*Carpenter No. 158® alloy is an exceedingly high strength, case hardening alloy mold steel. It is a cold-melt electric furnace process manufactured to a narrow range of analysis limits. Electric furnace melting, under closely controlled conditions, assures unvarying uniformity, or service. Each lot is hot acid etch inspected.

Carpenter No. 158 alloy should be considered for jobs which require an extra measure of core strength. It possesses high strength core with uniform mechanical properties even up to 5"" (125 mm) thick sections. It possesses highest mechanical properties of any case hardening mold steel.

The special alloy content of Carpenter No. 158 alloy imparts excellent wear resistance. Dies withstand long runs or severe abrasion over much longer service without roughening of the mold surface.

Excerpt from Carpenter Technical Data Sheet: http://cartech.ides.com/datasheet.aspx?i=101&E=100 Carpenter No. 158 alloy is Mil Spec for All Variants of the M16 Bolt.

The kit includes a complete Lower Receiver Parts kit that is ready for installation into the host stripped lower. A M4-Style Collapsible Buttstock Assembly rounds out the package with a 6-Position Mil-Spec diameter buffer tube, carbine buffer and buffer spring.

Stripped lower receiver and magazines are NOT included.

Upper receiver is fully assembled at the factory, lower parts kit and stock assembly will need to be installed by the end-user.

Don't email me to ask if it is still for sale, if I will take less, or without including a phone number to contact you on. If it is still listed for sale then it is still up for sale. I don't negotiate prices unless it is in person with cash in hand. ONLY replies that include a phone number to contact you on will be responded to.

Best thing about the AK74 is the ammo, the 5.45x39 round is very devastating and extremely cheap - only about $180 for 1080 rounds of milspec Russian surplus ammo. Waffen Werks is known for building excellent AKs, they have the quality of an Arsenal for a lot less money. This is a beautiful Grade A rifle built with matching unissued Bulgarian parts on a Waffen Werks receiver. Features a new chromoly barrel, Tapco G2 trigger, removable AK74 muzzle brake, and side scope/accessory rail. Includes 1-30rd magazine. There are cheaper AK74s available that have cosmetic issues or are built on lower grade parts kits for $50 - $150 less after all the fees and shipping charges, if that is what you prefer to have. Cash price on mine is $800 which is exactly what I have into it with paperwork to prove it. I would rather sell it outright but might consider taking something in partial trade with the difference in cash. If interested and serious please reply with a phone number to contact you on.

Beautiful rifle, but I do not hunt our 4-legged friends (or do long-range shooting).  A family heirloom, but I will never use it.  Great for long-range target shooting or hunting.  Had it inspected by a reputable gunsmith several weeks ago; it's in excellent condition both physically AND mechanically; could make a great 'sniper' rifle.  A steal for $150 with ammo, sling (era correct US GI issue leather), and scope mount.  Basically this rifle will cost you the same as a cheap, used, everyday bolt-action 22!

Great loads in 10 ga., 12 ga., 16 ga., 20 ga., and 28 ga. are shown in Hodgdon’s Reloading Data Center. This propellant provides true magnum velocities with superb patterns. In addition, LONGSHOT is the best choice for those competitors shooting games such as ""Buddy"", ""Annie Oakleys"" and more.

SHELL

The Shell is manufactured utilizing advanced Thermoplastic Aramid and Glass Fabric Composites, which provide a high level of ballistic protection at a weight less than the specification of the U.S. Military ACH helmet. It is built with similar dimensions to the U.S. Military ACH helmet allowing for better unobstructed view and increased hearing capability than the PASGT helmet. The neck trim line provides maximum protection while allowing uninhibited movement when wearing most ballistic vests with collars. The entire helmet is finished off with extruded neoprene rubber trim and protected with scratch resistant non reflective flat paint. Weight is 2.3 to 2.7 pounds.

SIZES

Sizes range from Small through X- Large. Four helmet shell sizes and variable thickness impact absorbing pads (Standard Size 6 at 3/4in or Optional Size 8 at 1in) for personal helmet comfort adjustment.

RETENTION SYSTEM

The retention system for this helmet is the fully adjustable Team Wendy Harness which allows for a wide range of adjustment to fit the operator comfortably while maintaining maximum stability. Reduces or eliminates the need for counterweights when wearing night vision equipment.

MAXIMUM COMFORT IMPACT PROTECTION 7 PAD SYSTEM

The pad system consists of seven ergonomically designed individual pads constructed of multi density shock attenuating polymer foam encased in a thermally sealed moisture proof inner liner. The outer portion of each pad is covered with a soft poly propylene material that wicks moisture from the wearers head to help moderate extreme temperatures. All seven pads are removable and can be adjusted to various positions for better individual comfort and fit.

STANDARDS

The helmet has been tested at certified labs and meets or exceeds the NIJ Level IIIA Ballistic standard for penetration, and meets a minimum of 650 mps V-50 for 17 grain (1.1 gram) tested according to STANAG 2920.

I love this rifle. Extremely accurate, excellent quality, points like a dream, and reliable as all get out. Straight from the famous Russian Izhmash factory. Been fired 150 times. Original owner. Comes with 9 mags, about 300 rounds of ammo, bulldog soft case, hogue grip, and stock grip. Only putting it up to see if some good offers come in. I could really use an officer/compact sized 1911 for carry. Prefer Kimber or Colt. Only high end 1911s please. Do NOT offer me junk or low ball with cash. Everything here is valued at around $1300. I'm told these may no longer get imported so the value will only rise.
