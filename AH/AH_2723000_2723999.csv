Even the silly lowball offers that are common on this site will be politely replied to. Will meet face to face on the West side of Albuquerque. I will not ship.

Maker: Arno Bernard , Sr. 

Blade length: 2.70 in.
Total length: 5.10 in.
Blade width: 0.90 in.
Blade thickness: 0.10 in.
Item weight: 1.40 oz.
Blade: 12C27 stainless steel with a hand rubbed satin finish
Handle: Mammoth Ivory
Sheath: Hand stitched cape buffalo leather 
Photographs:  The photographs do not do this knife justice and, did not come out great from my iPhone.   I can take others with a “real” camera if needed.  Rest assured, this knife is in the very same condition as it arrived from the dealer.
Description: This three finger mammoth ivory utility knife has a dramatic South African feel and look. The mammoth ivory has been polished to a luster and is pinned with five stainless steel pins. The blade has been satin finished in the hollow grind and mirror polished on the flats. This accentuates the dramatic grind lines. This piece is small enough you will not even notice it is with you, yet stout enough to do real work; a great piece for a collection or pocket-carry.
Availability: Not now available elsewhere in the market since Arno Bernard is no longer making knives.  

Arno Bernard lived in South Africa and was a member of the South African Knifemakers Guild.  Mr. Bernard handcrafted his knives from natural and exotic materials.  The knife presented here is a hand-crafted, one of a kind, custom knife made by master knifemaker Arno Bernard, Sr.—indicated by the “Arno Bernard” etched into the blade. 
DO NOT confuse this knife with those currently being made by Arno Bernard’s sons (same name, different logo); they too are excellent, but not the same as Arno Bernard, Sr.

I bought this knife from a California dealer who was closing out his stock.  I have not carried, used, or sharpened it.   It was recently appraised at $240.00 by RGS Imports (U.S. importer/distributer of Arno Bernard Knives)  Please address inquiries to this post, or to REDACTED.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine 16"" barrel length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Eats anything you feed it, no jams ever in the 350 or so I've put through it.  Ireally ddon't have a reason to let it go other than someone should enjoy it.  It features a frontrail, double and single action, decocker, and all controls are ambidextrous.  Not a scratch on it, no holster wear.  Comes with 2 mags 1 loaded, 12 capacity I believe, original hard case, 3 back straps, and a tool for the Taurus lock system and backstrap changing.  Oh yeah it also has Taurus lock that makes it literally impossible to fire, in case you have little ones.  Like I said I really don't need or have to sell it.

Walther Arms 2796091 PPQ M2 9mm 5"" Black Poly Grip 15+1

The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns.
The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest
ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim.
The PPQ M2 has been updated with a traditional reversible mag release
button. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction with a fully
pre-loaded striker assembly. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked
state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The PPQ M2
has a trigger travel of approximately 0.4"" with a relatively short trigger
reset of 0.1"". The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first
shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties
and a firing pin block for safe carry. The frame has interchangeable
backstraps and a Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights
with a windage adjustable rear.

Hex receiver Mosin Nagant that WAS NOT a Century Arms import! It is literally the nicest mosin nagant I have ever seen and I have owned and dealt with many mosins. The finish is great except where the bayonet has been put on an off. The wood is beautiful with only a couple very minor dings (basically unnoticeable). The gun comes with a sling and bayonet but the bayonet no longer fits because I used JB Weld on the front sight when I put the original front sight back on the rifle. If you don't want the MOJO rear Peep sight on the gun i can take it off and replace it with the original rear sight that it came with, however the mojo sight is far superior with windange and yardage adjustments and enables me to be able to shoot a pop can at 150yds every time with iron sights. I once shot a 1 inch three round group with it at 150yds with surplus ammo as well. (no joke). The gun comes with mojo rear sight, normal sight, sling, bayonet, spam can of ammo, 440rds of boxed ammo, 53 rds of bagged ammo, (933rds all together), ammo spam can opener, and cleaning rod. There is no rust or pitting inside or out as the bore has strong rifling and was meticulously cleaned and oiled after each range session. The trigger is also great for a mosin in terms of lightness after slack is taken up with a clean break as well.

It's very accurate, and has a very light, smooth trigger. Recoil is very manageable with the bisley grips, even with +P loadings. The bore and chambers are still shiny and new, but there is a small patch where the bluing wore off the frame (see pictures) and I have reshaped the grips slightly because they came with a sharp edge that cut into my hands during firing. I'm selling it simply because I am finding that I prefer the shape of double action revolvers more.

Hex receiver Mosin Nagant that WAS NOT a Century Arms import! I am looking to sell or trade +/- cash for an SKS or AK. It is literally the nicest mosin nagant I have ever seen and I have owned and dealt with many mosins. The finish is great except where the bayonet has been put on an off. The wood is beautiful with only a couple very minor dings (basically unnoticeable). The gun comes with a sling and bayonet but the bayonet no longer fits because I used JB Weld on the front sight when I put the original front sight back on the rifle. If you don't want the MOJO rear Peep sight on the gun i can take it off and replace it with the original rear sight that it came with, however the mojo sight is far superior with windange and yardage adjustments and enables me to be able to shoot a pop can at 150yds every time with iron sights. I once shot a 1 inch three round group with it at 150yds with surplus ammo as well. (no joke). The gun comes with mojo rear sight, normal sight, sling, bayonet, spam can of ammo, 440rds of boxed ammo, 53 rds of bagged ammo, (933rds all together), ammo spam can opener, and cleaning rod. There is no rust or pitting inside or out as the bore has strong rifling and was meticulously cleaned and oiled after each range session. The trigger is also great for a mosin in terms of lightness after slack is taken up with a clean break as well.

Box, Manual, 2 mags, loader, cleaning rod and brush. (Price listed is for one with everything, and gently used) Price depends on conditions and extras. The furthest I am willing to meet is Alexandria or Florence, only if that is Halfway between you and me. Do not respond with your Phone number saying something like ""text me, or call me"", it is annoying, and extremely rude. I prefer to start the ""deal"" over Email, until it is time to meet. If you are located near or in Louisville or Lexington, please do not waste my time.  I am not travelling even Halfway to either of those areas. Dry Ridge is fine. The gas costs too much and I can get one locally and save the gas money for ammunition. Just let me know what you have, thanks.  If it is a FDE or OD Model, Gently used or used I will of course pay a little more, a Reasonable amount, same goes for a Gen 4.  FDE/OD is a huge plus for me, and my listed price does not reflect that.  I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT A SOLDERING IRON HAS TOUCHED, A DREMEL HAS TOUCHED (SO CALLED POLISHING), AND I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT ISN'T ALL STOCK INTERNALLY. 

PRICE DEPENDS ON CONDITION, LOCATION, AND EXTRAS(Mags and holsters). I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY AMMO. The price I have listed is for a Gen 3 26 in like new condition with no outer wear, 2 flush fit 10 round oem magazines and the Box and Manual and accessories. The better the condition and the more magazines equals a better price. I am not paying new price for a used Gen 3 Glock 26, they go for less than $499 at the LGS."

Sig Sauer MK25CA P226 Navy *CA Approved* 9mm 4.4 in 10+1 Polymer Grips Black 

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig's entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

It is a late production (#165xxx) and is one of the minority that has NOT been drilled and tapped for a scope from the factory or otherwise. Roll stamping is very nice and sharp.

Front sight is correct, rear peep is an S-130 instead of the correct S-100.

Bolt is in nice shape and cycles well. One magazine is included but not shown.

Wood is in decent shape and has been poorly refinished. Whatever clearcoat was used has a grapefruit texture. No stampings or alterations from original that I can see. Buttplate is parkerized, doesn't appear to be original to the gun (but is 44US correct) and overhangs the wood slightly in spots.

Would be interested in a trade for a Ruger MkII or III .22LR auto pistol, either in 22/45 or standard target configuration. May consider other target autos, or other firearms trades as well."

The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state.[3] The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.
