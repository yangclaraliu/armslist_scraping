These things are over $200 at Cabelas, Amazon and Midway (plus you have to assemble).  $140 FIRM.  I've got a solid local offer for $125, so if you want it, get it before I take the $125.

These are heavy duty scopes that are virtually indestructable. Leupold made them to offer a modern, optically superior equivalent of the Lyman Alaskan. The 7/8"" tube makes them especially nice for use on slender rifles. It is my favorite scope for vintage lever action rifles and carbines because the finish nicely matches the blue of old firearms. The side of the scope under the elevation turret is marked 'LEUPOLD ALASKAN 2.5X OREGON, U.S.A.' This scope is 10-1/4"" long, and the eyepiece housing is just under 1-3/8"" in diameter.

This ammunition was engineered to meet or exceed FBI ammunition testing protocols; these protocols put bullets through 10% ordinance gelatin, steel, wallboard, plywood, laminated automobile safety glass and gelatin covered in heavy clothing and measure how well the bullets penetrate, expand and hold together. 

Extensive testing has shown that the on average the 9mm Luger load will deliver 13.63"" of penetration, 0.63"" of expansion, 90% weight retention through all FBI barriers when shot through a Glock 17 at 10 feet. 

One of the great things about this ammunition are high quality features that make this ammunition perfect choice for self-defense ammunition. Each round of ammunition is loaded into a Federal Premium nickel plated brass case with waterproofing on the case mouth and primer. Every load has a consistent powder charge and reliable primer for consistent ignition. Every HST bullet features a tapered jacket profile for reliable feeding, a cannelure that locks the copper jacket to the lead core, patented co-aligned internal and external skiving and a deep tapered hollow point that will not clog.

The rifle is brand spankin new I put at most 100 or 120 rounds through it. I only put non-corrosive through it since I bought it brand new. It's clean as a whistle and just a smooth shooter. I originally got it as a package deal with a case, 4 burned orange tapco mags and a sight rail. Unfortunately, I have to sell a few things because of that evil thing called money.

The rifle is chambered in 5.45x39 if you did not know. I checked the serial number and it looks like this one was produced in Bulgaria in 1989. It is built on a Waffen Werks receiver with a Tapco G2 trigger assembly. These rifles are imported as parts kits with chopped receivers and rebuilt to comply with 922r at Waffen Werks in Knoxville TN. They were originally selective fire, so they were once the real deal. All parts on this rifle match 100%. I am asking $800 OBO with the goody package. If you want just the rifle, I am asking 650.

This rifle can't be shipped to states with ""assault weapons"" bans. Obviously. If you live in the state of Maryland and you are reading this, sorry, I can't sell this to you unless you reside in another state that doesn't have such laws. Buyer pays all shipping fees.

What I am including with the rifle:

Bulldog rifle case
4 Burned Orange tapco mags
2 Bulgarian Mil-Surp mags (circle 10 and 21)
UTG MNT973 AK Side Mount with Double Rails (brand new)

That of course did not include all the extra mags or even the light / laser but I like to help my fellow collectors when possible! This is the newest model 5.7 pistol made today by FN and if you haven't gotten to shoot one with a 30 rounder stuffed in its hole then this is your chance to unleash hell!! If both guns are bought by same person ill also include a hard aftermarket two layer case to carry both pistols and mags in (plus the 50 rounds of 190SS) hope to hear from you guys soon!!

If you want to put a synthetic stock with a pistol grip/collapsible stock on your SKS, you'll need enough US-made parts to make it 922r compliant. For the SKS, that means you need 7 parts - 3 come from whatever stock you use, 3 come from most detachable magazines, which leaves you needing one more. That's where this gas tube comes in: it counts as the 7th part, which makes your sporterized SKS nice and legal.

This type of finish has proven to be the most rugged of all traditional finishes as the finish is in the metal not just on it. This is why some older Winchesters will have virtually all the blue on the barrel while other parts of the gun seem to be more worn. It's because the barrel was rust blued at the Winchester factory. Craftsmen of the day guarded their formulas and techniques very closely for it was a source of great pride to be able to apply such a beautiful and lasting finish to a fine firearm. This little gun was built in 1927 and is ready for the next 100 years of service. I have taken many pictures to help show the condition. The only flaw would be a repaired crack in the stock forward of the bottom butt plate screw. This repair is very solid but needs to be mentioned for proper representation of the item. All screws are very good. Bore is mirror bright. I have shot squirrels with this little gun and can tell you it's truly delightful to shoot and the ammunition really isn't that expensive.

From Springfield Armory:
""At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a 9mm in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."""

The condition is the best I've ever seen on one of these, but there aren't a lot of these out there.. I've shot maybe 10 rounds out of it so theres no visible line on the cylinder.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

It comes with the case, instruction card (in Russian) and battery for the red illuminated reticle. 

Specs: 
Russian scope PO 3.5x21P is arguably the best tactical scope for AK rifles. It is a very solid and extremely robust scope. The Y axis of the reticule is graduated in a way so you do not have to enter adjustments for bullet drop for up to 1000 meters. But the best feature of this scope is WIDE FIELD OF VIEW. It is 12 Degrees on this scope. scope has 3.5X magnification Eye relieve on PO3.5x21P is only about(2 inch) which allows you a good amount of space on that shorty Warsaw Pact stock.

This black version with black polymer Magpul MOE A frame butt stock, MOE+ pistol grip, Mil-spec sized receiver ext. tube, AR-15 non stamped buffer weight (cheaply and easily replaced with an H-1 or H-2 buffer for under $10.00.) The Sig M-400 lower receiver is for some reason, one of the most in-demand M4-type lower receivers on the market today...Why? Here's why: 
#1: The lower receiver is forged aluminum - 7075-T6! 
#2: There is a tensioning device in the lower receiver - this is a spring-loaded pin, that takes any slack out of the upper and lower receiver - no rattling between the upper and lower - Very unique feature (built in accu-wedge)
#3: ambidextrous magazine release
#4: ambidextrous mounting points on the lower receiver for installing a single-point button sling. (Perfect for the Magpul MS-3 multi-mission sling or others like it)
#5 Flared magazine well for positive, fast tactical mag. reloads
#6: Stippling/etched grip enhancements on the front side of the magazine well.

I know I'm stretching it here, but NO ONE is selling these lowers, what I want to trade for: A complete AR-15/M-4. New or used - doesn't matter, brand hardly matters, round count hardly matters. I'm just trying to improvise on a second AR/M4 without having to spend lots of money other than on a new lower for my Sig M400 upper. If anyone out there is interested in this unique and fully functional Sig M400 lower - shoot me an email. If all you have to offer is an expensive DD-M4, BCM, Noveske etc, I'll take it. I could throw in some extra $ or add AR/M4 accessories/furniture, P-mags Gen M2 all with dust/impact covers, ammo (all 5.56 Lake City M193 and XM855), pistol holsters, tactical vests, optics.... I have a lot of stuff sitting around. Or, I'll take a DPMS. Doesn't matter much."

Factory mags come w/steel bases.  You'll get four mags total.  ALL GEAR IS USED.  Good condition, very functional, but used.  

The total for firearm and accessories all together would normally be just over $860.00, (that's accounting for taxes on the gun alone).  So the buyer is basically getting the gear for free.  And since the Jericho 941/Desert Eagle Pistol is an import I must admit that after market accessories aren't the easiest to come by."

Has awesome factory features like 1/0 gauge StreetWires terminals, Xtant intercooling, and Prizm EFX adjustable lighting that pulses with the bass. Stable to 1 ohm over 1600 watts at 14.4v dynamic power, very low harmonic distortion. The MTX factory dyno for this exact model shows it far outperforms the standard levels for all measurable aspects of this amp.

 looking for $500 in trade value, for a higher value trade I also have a brand new complete Del-Ton 5.56 lower I would consider throwing in for the right gun. 
Also have a 1/10 scale Traxxas Slayer gen1 3.3 big block Nitro R/C truck converted to 40 series monster big Joe tires and Revo suspension up for grabs too, just don't have time for it anymore. Only 10 minutes run time on New suspension, still have all parts to convert back to original short course wheelbase. This is a 4wd Nitro burning beast and has been loved and well maintained. $250 invested in just converting the suspension, wheels, tires, spur gear, dual servo steering conversion, ultra strength front hubs w/oversized bearings. Pics available if interested

I'm basically trading in all my hobbies for just the one that I actively participate in now

The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

To protect against the thumb web being pinched by the slide, the top of the grip area is curved to snugly accommodate the shooter's hand. This feature also improves pistol control.

Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize the toughest of forgings for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock. Frames are machined from solid aluminum forgings. It features a lightweight, alloy frame, blued steel slide, tip-up barrel, and double/single action.

Official description-
Rossi shotguns use the timeless single shot break open breech design updated with the most modern safety features. These shotguns include a spur hammer, transfer bar safety action and an integral linkage system that prevents the action from opening or closing when the hammer is cocked. The safety functions are perfect for beginners, especially the smaller and lighter youth models that feature a shortened stock and barrel.

The upper has no flaws, I just need to sell it. Includes the original box and packaging. This version has the 12 inch modular hand guard with a 16 inch barrel. Retail is about $950. 


Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, V7-300 URG, new for 2013, is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.
