Sig Sauer P238 .380 ACP

238-380-TSS

Item Description

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

SPRINGFIELD ARMORY XD-S 9mm BLACK
Item Description

SAFETY--- Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

ULTRA SAFETY ASSURANCE (USA) TRIGGER SYSTEM---The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

LOADED CHAMBER INDICATOR---The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

GRIP SAFETY---All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

FAIL-SAFE DISASSEMBLY---The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

SECURE GRIP TEXTURE---The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

MELONITE FINISH AND CARRYING CASE---To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

ERGONOMIC---Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

PICATINNY RAIL SYSTEM---A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

SHORT RESET TRIGGER---The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

SNAG FREE SIGHTS---The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

MOULD-TRU BACKSTRAPS---With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.

SLIM CONTOUR FRAME---The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.

SURE GRASP SLIDE SERRATIONS---The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol.

BW50G-BL: AccuPin Dual Illuminated Bow Sight Green Triangle with AccuDial™ Mount Right Handed – Matte Black Finish 

The heart of Trijicon AccuPin's innovative design lies in its triangular aiming tip and clear aiming pin. With a precision aiming point and zero obstructions, this one-of-a-kind configuration has an aiming point that actually points to your target instead of obscuring it.

For the ultimate in visibility and aiming precision— even in the toughest conditions—the AccuPin incorporates the acclaimed Trijicon dual-illumination/ battery-free system. With a combination of fiber optics and tritium pioneered and perfected in their world-class riflescopes, the Trijicon AccuPin is the brightest pin sight on the market. 

The revolutionary AccuDial™ mount equipped with BowSync™ technology, has an infinitely variable transmission, it enables exact range adjustment and synchronization for any bow/arrow speed combination. Its laser etched dial makes on-the-fly adjustments quickly and accurately—without having to rely on a clumsy strip of tape. 

Together, the right- handed AccuPin and AccuDial combination form a refined system that stands as a benchmark for sight and mount integration.

The Trijicon AccuPin™ and its combination of fiber optic and tritium illumination are Pope & Young Legal.

It is about 2 months old and has exactly 2 boxes of ammo thru it (40 rounds). This firearm is an absolute tack driver, consistently putting up sub-MOA groupings at 100 yards. It is currently zeroed at 100 yards. 

If you are looking for a coyote or varmint rifle, then look no further. This is the complete package at a killer value. You could easily spend the price of this entire package on just another .223 bolt action rifle; turn around and spend another $300-$400+ on optics and accessories and not have really anything more than this package offers you. This is the best of both worlds...extremely accurate and lightweight. 

Purchased the rifle new and added the following:

- Vortex Crossfire II 4-12x50 w/ AO and Dead-Hold BDC (AO=adjustable objective and BDC=bullet drop compensator). The scope and mounts were professionally mounted, torqued, and leveled.  
- Burris Signature Zee scope rings w/ self centering floating inserts for precise mounting
- Harris Engineering style bi-pod. 6-9"" with adjustable pivot
- 2 additional factory magazines (total of 3)
- Allen Buttstock pouch, cheek rest, and ammo holder
- Neoprene wide weather-proof adjustable 2 point sling 
- Comes with all manuals and boxes if desired, for the rifle and all the acessories as well.

I have over $900 invested in this barely used rifle and accessories. Willing to accept some loss due to it being used, but I'm not looking to give it away either. Price for everything is $725. This is extremely fair considering everything it comes with and all the work that has already been put into having the scope professionally mounted and zeroed for 100 yards. 

To purchase - must be 18 years of age with a valid DL or ID. FTF only, no shipping. Would consider a trade for a Gen 4 Glock 19 + cash depending on the trade and extras. Would also consider partial trades for .223/5.56 brass cased ammo."

No matter the mission, law enforcement officials and soldiers know that the size and weight of their equipment is a critical factor. With the Micro T-1, Aimpoint has created an aiming system that provides the performance of the company's renowned full-sized sights in an incredibly compact package. The small device can be used as a standalone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.
The Micro T-1 ships complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil, and state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the sight to operate continuously for over five years on a single CR-2032 battery. A unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot's selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy, while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction.

Bushnell laser rangefinders provide a much more accurate picture for hunters than, say, your friend's eyeballed estimation: ""Well, it looks to be about 225 yards away."" This all-in-one Yardage Pro rangefinder--which combines a 4-12x42mm riflescope, a laser rangefinder, and a bullet-drop compensator--helps you see your target with stunning clarity and nail it with lethal precision. The Yardage Pro is equipped with fully multi-coated optics that deliver optimum brightness and color fidelity even in dim conditions, along with bullet-drop turrets that eliminate holdover guesswork. And thanks to the wireless trigger pad, it's a breeze to activate the laser rangefinder without drawing attention.

Product Description
Armasight Spark is a rugged lightweight Multi-Purpose Night Vision Monocular that can be Hand Held, Camera Adaptable, Head/Helmet Mounted or Weapon Mounted. Armasight Spark is based on “single tube/single eyepiece” concept where independent use of each eye maximizes the ability of the user to operate under a wide range of low light conditions while reducing the risk of temporary night blindness typically associated with night vision goggles. A built-in Illuminator allows you to see clearly even in total darkness. Spark can be used as a long range Night Vision Spotter in conjunction with state of the art 3x A-focal lens. Armasight Spark is everything outdoorsman, fisherman, tactical shooter, or hunter could ask for."

I have over $900 invested in this barely used rifle and accessories. Willing to accept some loss due to it being used, but I'm not looking to give it away either. Price for everything is $725. This is extremely fair considering everything it comes with and all the work that has already been put into having the scope professionally mounted and zeroed for 100 yards.

I have been making rifle slings for friends and myself for a while, and have decided to start selling them.  Each sling will be made to your specifications after you place your order.  If I have all the materials in stock, turnaround can be as short as a day unless I am out of town or work gets crazy.

To give an example of the type and quality of the slings I build, I will provide the below sample which I recently made for a friend.

This is a single point sling made of one inch genuine multi cam (licensed by Crye Precision, not a knockoff) tubular nylon webbing.  The main loop is adjustable from 30 to 78 inches using the main slider on the sling and the adjustment points on the two fastex type buckles.  The leg of the sling (the part that connects to your rifle) is adjustable from 7 to 14 inches.  The clip that attaches to the sling mount is an HK style steel clip, and is covered by the included 3"" elastic hook cover.  All three parts of the sling come together at an anodized welded steel triangle.  All of the stitching is double bar-tacked using heavy duty synthetic upholstery thread on an industrial sewing machine.  Three elastic strap keepers and one elastic hook cover are included with this sling.  In total, this sling has 3 quick release points.

Based on the preferences of my coworkers and friends, this is one of the more popular sling designs, which is why I am using it as my flagship.

If you want this sling modified, I can do the following and more:
-Add or remove length to the loop
-Change connection hardware
-Add or remove adjustment points
-Add or remove quick release points
-Add a bungee internal to the tubular webbing
-Use different color webbing and hardware

As pictured and described, I am selling this sling at the introductory price of $40.  If a sling you purchase from me breaks through normal use, I will repair or replace it for one year from the date of purchase.

I prefer to do business face to face.  I live near Garden of the Gods, and I work on Ft. Carson."

This was my personal concealed carry pistol for several months. Built in the Kimber Custom Shop, I have never experienced any FTF or FTE issues while shooting this gorgeous gun. The only reason I'm selling this pistol is that I have decided to only shoot/carry full sized 1911s. I have tendonitis in my shooting hand and the smaller frame of this gun causes significant discomfort while shooting. I purchased it new in May 2013, from The Outpost Armory, and have fired approximately 1,000 - 1,250 rounds through it. This is one of the most accurate compact size 1911s I've ever shot. Since I have made the switch to full sized 1911s, the following accessories are being included with the sale of this pistol: 

* Wicked Grips - high contrast Desert Ironwood grips (new cost: $140) * Wilson Combat magazines (3) * Chip McCormick magazine * Crossbreed Super Tuck IWB holster (like new condition cost = $100) * Factory stock Zebra wood grips w/Kimber logo * Factory box, owners manual and lock 

Factory Specifications: 
* 45 ACP 
* 4.75"" (H), 6.8"" (L), 1.28"" (W) 
* 3"" match grade barrel 
* Capacity = 7+1 
* Weight (w/empty magazine) = 25 oz

A concealed buckle helps prevent the fanny pack from being snatched, while the 500-denier Cordura® nylon construction looks good and is long lasting. Available in black.  REDACTED

The gun comes with both 4"" and 6"" interchangeable barrels.
I just recently picked this pistol up from a friend of the family's that needed cash.
The guy had made several attempts to remove the barrel nut from the 4"" barrel and has damaged the nut on the 4"" barrel and put some scratches on the muzzle end of the 4"" shroud.  That barrel may need to be re-crowned when it is finally removed but I'm not sure.
I bought it knowing that the worst case scenario is that the 4"" barrel could be drilled out to remove the nut and save the shroud and I would end up with a beautiful 6"" Dan Wesson revolver with an extra 4"" shroud but I'm thinking someone with at little more ""know how"" than me can salvage the 4"" barrel too.
I messed with it for a couple of hours and decided that it may be best left to someone else.
The frame and the 6"" barrel and shroud are in very good condition.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desirable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF THE CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to use an AA .22 LR conversion kit.
1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 
2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.
3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 
4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.
5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.
6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges)."
