Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled. Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417. Like New with H&K Soft Case."

I would like to trade this rifle for a Ruger M77 Mark II All Weather Stainless  rifle in a caliber that is more suited to my needs.  I would also consider trading towards a No1 Rifle, An African RIfle, or a Mini-14/30.  Details below. 

Absent a trade, I will consider a direct sale on the rifle with factory rings and sling (Scope in photos is NOT included).

(The .300 AAC Blackout was designed to give the M4 platform increased power and penetration on intermediate barriers with minimal recoil while retaining the 30-round magazine capacity. It provides excellent terminal performance and accuracy when run suppressed with subsonic or standard ammunition. 

The .300 blackout uses the same mags, BCG, lower, and upper parts as a standard AR15, literally the only thing you have to change to convert a standard AR15 to a .300 blackout is change out your barrel.)

Flash Hider-

The AAC Brakeout Flash Hider Muzzle Brake combines the best features of AAC's Blackout flash hiders and Blackout muzzle brakes into a single, high performing unit. The Breakout's rear muzzle brake chamber is open on both sides and on the top for reduced perceived recoil & muzzle rise, yet closed on the bottom for minimal environmental disturbance when shooting from the bench or prone positions. The 3-prong front end incorporates elements of the Blackout flash hider's effective design to minimize muzzle flash. All Breakout flash hider muzzle brakes are machined from high strength aerospace 17-4 stainless steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. 

This 51T Brakeout works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

Incl SAPI PLATES!

Same as US Military Issue. THIS is an XTRA LARGE Long - covering more surface area, holding larger than normal sized SAPI Plates - please understand that medium and small vests hold smaller plates and cost less because they use less material.

If you purchase a brand new vest from a manufacture - please note that the same vest jumps in price by hundreds of dollars when sizing up from a medium to a large, etc. THIS IS XTRA LARGE LONG designed for Bigger persons over 6'1 + / who weigh around or over 185lbs

The same vest - by the same manufacture, with SAPI plates included, and side plates, plus all the accessories included here - RUNS in excess of $2000 for the vest only! 

With this Deal you receive brand new plates, front, back and side plus throat and groin protection PLUS additional Kevlar backers that are must have accessories - for a comparable BODY ARMOR SYSTEM purchased new, made in USA - from a RECOGNIZED BODY ARMOR LEADER like POINTBLANK - prepare to spend well over $2500!! Please check for yourself.

Also - I challenge anyone who says that this or any other vests significantly loses protection after 3-5 years as some overseas Manufactures claim - NUMEROUS INDEPENDENT TESTS CONFIRM that Kevlar Vests, older than 10-15 years STILL Perform to LEVEL 3A Testing Standards established by NIJ - Kevlar doesn't ""go bad"", it is true that on some vests, some performance, a marginal amount, can be lost due to being left in UV conditions and underwater for significant periods of time. However, This Vest has never been exposed to conditions even near the outright neglect needed to even marginally reduce effectiveness and even vests that are purposelessly put under the most of extreme conditions are used for testing and still test to standard - again PLEASE RESEARCH for YOURSELF!

http://www.nij.gov/topics/technology/body-armor/Pages/impact-effectiveness.aspx 


PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH to understand not all OTV's are the same - the US MILITARY only used 2 Manufacturing Companies and POINTBLANK is one of them. - NOT ALL VESTS are LEVEL 3A(The best on the market) - THIS VEST Pictured IS LEVEL 3A - ALSO INCLUDES FRONT and BACK BRAND NEW Ceramic SAPI PLATES extra large. Still in the original plastic covering, never used or dropped - manufactured by Patriot Performance Technologies in the USA.

THE SAPI PLATES are what stops the Large Caliber Rounds - NO Level 3A vest is rated to stop rounds more powerful than a 9mm.

There is a lot of confusion about protection levels and what SAPI plates are used for - please do your research and you'll see there is no better vest available - and none at a lower price.

OTHER OTV Vests are made to look and feel like a Pointblank and are made overseas - do not be fooled! Pics on this ad include manufacturing info, date of issue and are very clear THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!

This was manufactured in the USA - with very little use and excellent condition
This is the Best Protection Available in Bulletproof Vests at the Lowest Cost

Includes: Front and Back SAPI Plates 12""x14"" All plates ASLO include Kevlar blunt pad backers (an extra accessory that cost retail another 75 Dollars) these blunt pad backers decrease impact kinetic energy by an additional 10 percent

also 2 x AR500 Metal Side Plates 8""x10"" w/ Kevlar blunt impact pad backers and front spall block Kevlar pads - with attached side pouches - the spall blockers sit in front of the side plates and prevent ricochet, this is another extra accessory included!!!

Complete Description Here: http://www.ebay.com/gds/Interceptor-Body-Armor-IBA-OTV-SAPI-/REDACTED6430041/g.html 

This IS the Best Body Armor available anywhere. Lovingly Maintained in Excellent Condition. All Components assembled.

Rated level 3 OTV outer Shell with Groin and Neck Kevlar Protection. US Military Issued; MOLLE enabled for additional pocket and plates for ultimate upgraded protection. 

This Offers the Best Protection from Hi Powered Threats available on the Market, period.

Rare Item, also including Blunt Pad and Spall Protection Inserts.

Having it All in One. Unparalleled Peace of Mind.

This is Not Just a Plate Carrier!

OTV outer shell 100 percent reinforced Kevlar rated Level 3A protects from incoming 9mm projectiles. SAPI Plates protect against standard SKS, AK-47 and AR-15, M4 platforms. 

When it comes to Personal Protection, No Shortcuts and The Best Equipment Available. 


The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant.
Bullet proof.
The vest stops a 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullet at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50[expand acronym] of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel.

The Interceptor armor also has a PALS webbing grid on the front of the vest which accommodate the same type of pockets used in the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) backpack/carry vest system. This allows a soldier to tailor-fit his MOLLE and body armor system. While not specifically designed for it, the loops can also easily attach All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE)-based equipment, MOLLE's predecessor, as well as many pieces of civilian-made tactical gear, and also features a large handle on the back just below the collar which can be used to drag a wounded person to safety in an emergency.

I got this to try out the ergonomics and function on them. Ordered it several weeks ago and during the meantime I found my grail gun, a SW 686-4 .357 Magnum that I spent nearly $800 on. Wife says I don't get to keep both so the Beretta is for sale.

 This gun is amazing. The fit and finish is excellent and the design is pure Beretta awesomeness. It came in an expensive plastic case with padding and the gun's logo on both sides. Beretta quality is second to none, I trust my life with a 92A1 every time I carry it. 

 It comes with everything shown in the pictures. 20 round magazine, lock, case and I didn't even take any tags off of it. Included is 1100 rounds of Federal .22LR. I understand .22LR is impossible to find right now so it made sense to include a significant amount of ammo from my supply so that you can enjoy this gun. My two remaining .22LR guns don't see much action anymore anyways. Price is very firm at $500 and I will not sell the ammo without the gun. If you don't need the .22LR I will accept $450 cash. Private sale FTF only no tax and no shipping/paperwork.  It has NOT been fired it is brand new.

 I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

MSRP:$1090.91. The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75” rounds in total (7 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 2.75"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. Features. 12 Gauge. 2.75"" Chamber. 14 Round Capacity. 6.9 lbs.

654,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2958654,For Sale:  Kahr P380 W/Crimson Trace & Extra Mags.,"West Chester, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, May 1, 2014",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"LNIB Stainless Kahr P380 w/Crimson Trace Laser Grips, 3-7 round mags, 2-6 round mags, case, Talon Grips, and all original paper work. Match barrel and smooth trigger. Bought this February and it has a less than 50 rounds through it. 

This semi-automatic pocket pistol features a 2.5 inch Lothar Walther match barrel with polygonal rifling, bar dot sights, and a Double Action Only trigger mechanism with Kahr's Safe Cam Action striker blocking passive safety. 
The pistol comes with two factory magazines: one 6 round magazine and one extended 7 round magazine with grip sleeve. Additional magazines available for separate purchase. 
The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. 
Lastly, this P380 comes with the Crimson Trace® Laserguard installed. The Laserguard design is the most compact, instinctively activated, user-adjustable laser sighting system on the market today. 

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP (9mm Browning Short) cartridge, has a 2.53 inch barrel and an overall length of 4.9 inches, with a height of only 3.9 inches. It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. 
The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. 
The P380 features a locked breech, modified Browning type recoil lug and Kahr's ""safe cam"" action. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide. 

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The 3/4 inch wide slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. 
The P380 comes with two high quality 400 series stainless steel magazines. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings. 

The P380 proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

I have all the original packaging, manuals, my receipt, etc. to show I am the original owner and this gun is 100% authentic, guaranteed.

This is (in my opinion, as well as many others) the BEST, piston-driven AR-15 on the market. It comes with the spiral-fluted barrel (16"") coated in LWRC's Ni-Corr coating, nickel-boron coated bolt carrier group, and enhanced fire-control group. Please do your research and you will understand why this rifle costs as much as it does. You can read full specs about the rifle here: https://www.lwrci.com/p-250-m6a2-spr.aspx 

I will include the $100.00 LWRC range bag with the purchase. NOTE: I smudged the serial # intentionally in the attached photos. 

Not interested in trades of any kind, just a straight cash purchase. Owner must be willing to provide copy of ID and sign bill of sale or we can do FFL transfer at a local dealer. 

I can provide additional photos and details - just send me an email. Thanks and hoping to find an honest buyer out there who can appreciate adding a high-end rifle to their collection. Price is FIRM - $600 below what I originally paid (including tax)."

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.

PredatAR® 5.56 Overview:

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.

This is not one of the cheap Chinese knockoffs being currently sold that take proprietary magazines (see: Catamount).

Comes with everything a NIB models should come with--I believe there are a couple of magazines and an oiler, but it is still wrapped in the grease paper from Mother Russia.

And it is, indeed, New In Box--it has never been fired, only taken out and inspected.

These are getting scarce, and could become even scarcer when the next round of sanctions against Russia come down...they've already started blocking ammo (7n6)...guns will be next.

Also have two ProMag 5 rd magazines and a 20rd ProMag drum; these are not included in the listed price, but could be purchased as well.

The Improved Rain Suit (IRS) is a parka and trousers set that form a waterproof outer shell, worn over other clothing and gear. It is patterned to match camouflaged field uniforms, similar to ECWCS or APECS, but is lighter in weight. IRS functions strictly as a rain barrier, offering little protection from cold even with its button-in liner. In rain, it holds up better than Gore-tex according to Soldier's feedback.

Parka/Jacket of the Improved Rain Suit has a roll-up hood with a visor and drawstring closure. There are armpit zippers for ventilation, a heavy duty full-length zipper in front covered by a storm flap that closes with snaps. The pockets are pass throughs to inner garments. The elbows are reinforced and Velcro closures at the cuffs make a tight fit.
Trousers have a draw-string at the waist, a center zipper, pass through pockets, Velcro closures at the ankles, and long leg zippers for easy on-off. The seat and knees are reinforced.

The Parka, Improved Rain Suit replaces the Parka, Wet Weather, Lightweight and the Trousers, Improved Rainsuit replace the Trousers, Wet Weather, Lightweight. The Improved Rainsuit is less bulky and better fitting than the parka/trousers it replaces.
