“out of the box” .45 caliber double action pistol,
started its life as the 9mm Pistole 75, the new
double action sidearm for Swiss army. Developed
during the early 1970s by the famous Swiss
company Sweizerishe Industrie-Gesellschaft or
SIG in short, this pistol was intended to replace
the extremely accurate, but overly expensive SIG
P210 pistol then in service with Swiss and some
other armies. The pistol was indeed a very
promising design, but strict Swiss laws severely
limited the export of war materiel, so SIG decided
to move the manufacture of its newest pistol
abroad. For this reason SIG Holdings AG in 1976
acquired significant stocks of the J.P. Sauer & Son
Company, which was located in Germany, and
during the late 1970s started the manufacture of
the SIG-Sauer P220 pistol in Germany. The P220,
as with most of its later siblings, was an instant
and continuous success. Adopted by the Swiss
and Japanese armies, and by a large number of
European police organizations, this pistol also
rapidly found its way into the USA, first thorough
the Browning Arms Company of Utah, and, since
the mid-1980s, through the SIGARMS Company
of New Hampshire. Initially made in four calibers,
today the P220 is manufactured only in .45 ACP,
as its 9mm version has been largely replaced by
the SIG-Sauer P226, a pistol of similar size but
with a larger magazine capacity. Today the P220
is made in a number of versions which include
both “service” and “sporting” modifications, the
latter often fitted with extended barrels,
compensators and adjustable sights. Service
versions may have the Picatinny rail for
accessories, as well as double-action or double-
action-only triggers. Since the 2006, the PP20
also offered with Single action triggers and also in
""Carry"" configuration with shortened barrel. The
P220 also could be made with an aluminium
frame and steel slide, or with both frame and slide
made from stainless steel. It is worth nothing that
a high-capacity version of the .45 caliber P220
was developed during the early 1990s for the US
market. Apparently designated P221, this gun
was effectively killed by the so-called “Assault
weapons ban”, the infamous legislation that
limited the magazine capacity of civilian arms to
10 rounds, which was enforced in the USA
between 1994 and 2004. The SIG-Sauer P220 is
short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistol. The
locking is of modified Browning type, where the
barrel engages the slide with single large lug
entering the ejection window. The unlocking is
controlled by a cam-shaped lug under the barrel,
which interacts with the steel insert set into the
aluminium frame. The slide is made from sheet
steel by stamping and forming processes, with
the separate breechblock pinned into the rear of
the slide (machined slides are available on some
current production .45 caliber models). The
standard trigger is the double-action type, with
an automatic firing pin block safety and a frame-
mounted decocking lever. Double action only
modifications do not have a decocker. Most
recent SAO (Single action only) versions have
ambidextrous non-decocking safeties located on
the frame, which allow for ""Cocked & Locked""
carry. Magazines are single stack, with the
magazine release located on the heel of the grip
on early versions, or at the base of the trigger-
guard on the .45 caliber versions made for the US
market. The standard sights are fixed, with high
contrast inserts, and the rear sight is dovetailed
to the slide."

169,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2241169,For Sale/Trade:  Large Postal SAFE - Pistol SAFE - Needs Work,"Chesapeake, Great Bridge, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 100,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 6, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a safe from a post office and it currently cannot be opened. The combination is known. When I bought it, I opened it and everything worked fine. Once I transported it home, the vibration was apparently enough to keep one of the bolts from retracting. 

I have been told that this can be fixed by drilling near the stuck bolt and tapping in back in. I simply don't have the time or energy to go through that. 

Safe is 48 high x 37 wide x 28 deep. Weighs about 1,300 pounds so if your interested, be prepared to move it. I moved it onto a trailer with a pallet jack and come-along. I do not have more specifications but it is (or was) Government Services Administration (GSA) Approved.

The last picture is of the inside of another safe to give you an idea of what it looks like. This safe does not have the doors but is divided similarly. Inside configuration can be changed. Would be great gun (pistol) safe, ammo storage or to store other valuables with its flexible configuration. Not sure that it would work well for long guns.

Price is $100 in cash or trade. I'll add cash to a good deal. It's worth more that $100 in scrap. I just don't want to give up on it as a safe if there is someone that will fix it and can get some use our of it. If you can't open it, you can scrap it to get your money back."

A pic of all 3 should be attached.

Here is a YouTube video so you can hear how well they ring:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WpLA0J8mO0

The white parts are made from AR500 steel. They stand up great to regular pistol rounds. And given a good distance stand up to .223 and .308 rounds too. The USPSA 3 gun rules say that 49 yards is the min distance for centerfire rifle on steel. If you were to cut the down 3 area off an IDPA target or the D zone of a USPSA target, that's what the white area of these steel targets represent.

The stands fold up/disassemble making it easy to store in your car's trunk. They are also ""telescoping"", so that the heights are adjustable. If you want to practice the IDPA classifier where the targets are 6 foot, 4 foot, and then 5 foot tall, this is just the thing. The stand is also powder coated, so it is virtually rust proof.

I have some but it's down to the hundreds and that's not where I want it to be.

-22LR-

I'll pay $20 per 250 rounds, or trade a Maverick 88 12GA (3"" chamber) shotgun with 18.5"" barrel for 2,000+ rounds of 36grain (or higher) 22LR. Must be CLEAN ammo.

If you are willing to offer 2500 rounds, dirty/tattered doesn't matter to me so long as it's capable of being cleaned (brasso metal polish takes care of your ammo pretty well :P)

Additionally, if you do the math - the shotgun is valued at $180 here. I am not accepting any cash offers on the shotgun at this time, ammo is the only trade I will take.

-9x18 Makarov-

I'm willing to pay $14 per box of 50.

Or, I will trade the same shotgun as listed above for 640 rounds of 9x18 Makarov. FMJ/JHP, 93gr/94gr/95gr is no matter. Brass / Steel Cased (plated or not) is fine. My CZ-82 eats everything.


ALSO have interest in obtaining a red dot sight. UTG (rebadged NcStar) sights fine; I just want a cheapo red dot. I WILL entertain cash offers on the shotgun if you're offering cash + a red dot. The sights sell for $30 brand new, and I'd be willing to take that full price worth of trade, whether the red dot is included with ammo or cash.

This model is essentially an airsoft replica of a Kimber Desert Warrior. Its been in storage most of the year after I bought it and has never been used in a game. I've shot it about 50 times to test the function. There's a scratch on the paint on the front strap of the grip but otherwise the finish is perfect. Functions well like all KWA airsoft pistols. I have the original box and all the stuff that came with it except the manual. Comes with the magazine it came with as well as a second KWA brand mag that I bought the day I got this. The second mag seems to rattle but works fine and doesn't leak. Other random stuff that goes with it is a nylon dropleg holster that I believe is an uncle mikes, a pair of military issue sand tan ESS goggles and a roughly half full can of green gas. I also have a couple sets of small/short woodland BDUs and a ABS replica PASGT helmet that I'll let go with all this if i get close enough to my asking price.

My price is 150 OBO but no silly offers please. This is the last of my airsoft stuff and I'm not interested in trades so please don't ask.

This is an excellent copy of the famous CZ75 all steel and it weighs about 41ozs. It is new in the box. 
I will meet at a safe place for purchase of the gun. 
I have shot an exact model of this gun and they shoot real accurate and the slide rides on the inner part of the frame as do the CZ75 which this is a copy of. This gun is almost an exact copy of the famous CZ75 and this steel version is nicer than the L-120 Tristar 9mm alloy version. 
You are saving over half the money for a CZ75 and to be honest I have a CZ75 and I can't see any difference and quality is equal. 
I have a coat of oil on the gun if you are wondering what the shine is on the gun. I keep all my weapons oiled down and in a silicone oiled sock for protection against the harmful elements.

I will ship the gun to an FFL holder only. Shipping will be a flat $25.00 to your FFL holder.  I will need a copy of the FFL before I ship with the correct address to ship to.

NO FIREARMS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SALE !!
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

I had wanted one for a really long time, but now I just don't shoot as much as I'd like to. I liked the G23's due to the versatility (could be converted to 357 or 9mm if needed). This Glock has had less than 50 rounds fired through it. There are zero scratches or blemishes anywhere, making it basically new. Included in the sale/trade is the firearm, case, manuals, three magazines, and all factory Glock items. For extra, I also have a Serpa holster, two dual mag pouches, an Uncle Mikes OWB kydex holster, and 200 rounds of FMJ ammo.

This is an excellent bow if you want something fast for a decent price. It's super fast, accurate and quiet.  I can put three arrows in the bullseye at 80 yards. I go the extra mile to keep my equipment in good condition so the strings are waxed, cams are clean, all moving parts oiled with DDW non scented oil and it's never been dropped.  I'm done hunting this season (It shot fast, accurately and quietly) and I'd like to put this on the market so I can put the money towards next years bow and maybe help out another hunter looking to hunt  that doesn't have four, five hundred dollars to spend on a bow. I'll sell my arrows for what I paid for them if you need them. I suggest buying your own release. Reply to this post and I'll get right back to you. I am smart phone equipped.
