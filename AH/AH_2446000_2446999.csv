It is still all original with a ban era thumb hole stockk and can easiliy be converted with a set of furniture from Ironwood Designs.  It does come with one Chinese 30 round magazine. 

The Chinese AK's came form the factory with better fit and function than any other AK, they have: (Sorry your new arsenal doesn't have all these features.)
-Thicker barrels that are always Chrome lined
-Double hook, plated trigger
-Chrome Carrier and bolt

The wood is in good shape, but honestly I always planned to change that to a new set of std grip/stock set from Ironwood designs. The bluing is great and is a great AK that will be more reliable than anything you could buy new today. 

This is Not a romanian Stamped rifle, you can NOT import these any longer.. Please don't lowball me.

Not real interested in trades.
Please be of legal age and status to contact me.
If you don't have one of these it is fun to be able to say you own a banned AK (that's still 100% legal to own!)"

Im looking to Trade my Taurus PT709 for a Ruger LC9.  Id also sell it for FIRM $330 with 1 mag.  if interested i have up to 4 extra mags available at an additional $30 each with purchase of the gun. Its brand new, never fired, still in the box. Just listing it for what i paid. With the FFL fees, illinois tax, etc, this is about the cheapest youll get one brand new for, and having available mags for a decent price is nice too...tauru mags are a bit difficult to find cheap, especially on the slim pistols.

This is not your basic AR15. This is a top tier rifle with all top notch parts built to be the baddest.

This is a brand new, full mil-spec, high quality .223/5.56 AR15 with all the best parts; free floating quad rail with XRM enhanced panels, troy aluminum CBQ modular vertical grip, the absolute highest quality BUIS money can buy, IW QD end plate for sling attachment, Geissele trigger with 3.5lb. JP springs, troy flash suppressor, mil-spec CMV chrome lined barrel with 1/7 twist (most wicked there is), premium chrome lined M16 BCG, the best lower parts kit there is, and all Magpul furniture.

Fresh build that's never been fired. Willing to take buyer out to certify functionality post sale. Have done this a few times and it's always fun throwing lead down range with Nevada Shooters (join the forum if you're not on there yet). I used to fire weapons I intended on selling at least once to reiterate flawless functionality, but I never had a single issue and I've seen many people concerned with it not being ""brand new"" at that point.

Price is $2,000.00 which is just short of the actual build cost. Willing to work with trades (see below build information).

Just plug it in, flip the switch and off you go.

The H&R handgun line has long been discontinued and this particular model was their top-of-the-line .22LR revolver.  The 999 Sportsman has become quite a collector's item and my research on the Gunbroker auction site shows that they have been sold for a low of $250+ in poor condition with missing parts, up to a high of $750+ in like-new condition.  I would rate this particular one as excellent condition.  It is in perfect working condition with all original parts (no missing parts).  The serial numbers on the frame, cylinder, barrel, and rear sight all match.  The serial number prefix on this one is ""AY"", which according to my research, corresponds to a manufacture year of 1982.  

This revolver has been cleaned, lubed, and is ready to either be fired or stored.  I can provide additional photographs if requested.  My asking price is $500 cash, face-to-face in the north Dallas area.  I might also be open to trading depending on what you have to offer.  I'm more of a shooter than a collector, and I prefer 9mm pistols, but I'm open to all other offers."

threaded barrel for suppressor
extendable bipod
nice two point sling

This is my go to gun for match shooting, got some great groups, 1/2"" within 240yards!
I would like to sell or trade this firearm for something nice for my wife for Christmas, as I have developed a bit of arthritis in my dominant hand and have placed target time on hiatus.

I sincerely appreciate any reasonable responses, as I've invested almost $1000 into this rifle, I am not looking for a large return on my investment, just something fair

thanks for reading happy holidays!"

Higgins 10316 or a Marlin Model 80.
The Higgins is a magazine fed, bolt-action rifle. 

J.C .Higgins is a company that produced sporting goods for Sears many years ago.  This particular model has the inscription ”Sears, Roebuck & Company S, L, LR”. The latter means that it fires .22 short, long and long rifle cartridges, which is nice even though short and long are relatively hard to find.  Further research shows that it’s a copy of the Marlin Model 80. It wasn’t uncommon for big box retailers to contract gun makers to produce store-brand guns.

Ranger Model 36 -  this rifle was made by Marlin between 1934-1939 for Sears and Roebuck.

I ask that the rifle be in usable condition."

Unlike other fire starting kits that leave you high & dry in wet conditions, this kit provides you with:

V3 Pocket Bellows
Extending to 20"" and collapsing to 3.5"", Pocket Bellows compresses and focuses oxygen into the heart of a fire. The byproduct of this extra oxygen is extra heat which is the key to overcoming wet firewood.

Baddest Bee Fire Fuses
The 100% organically waterproofed, easily ignitable, long burning cotton tinder knit come 8 to a pack. When ignited with a flint striker, match, or lighter, Fire Fuses produce a 3""-5"" fire starting flame for up to 5 full minutes.

EZ Ignite
A fail proof ignition source that produces a shower of fiery hot embers in a weather condition, EZ Ignite will produce a tall flame in one strike every time when coupled with Fire Fuses and also works great on forest floor tinders.

These tools will give you peace of mind in wet weather conditions and makes fire starting in dry conditions nearly idiot-proof.

I might be open to trades for an ak47 or ak74, NDM-86 and I'll add cash, lighter gas piston AR-15 , 1919a4 parts kit, things of that sort. Please note that before you make me an offer, regardless of what it may be, I know what my rifle is worth, and I know what yours is worth. I probably know everything about your rifle, too. So please, don't go offering me a bushmaster and assume I'm that stupid. I won't respond. Lets be fair here! 

Price is $1,400..

The Troy rails I think were  $350 alone..

I BUILT THIS DESIGN SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM THAT WANTED AN AK (SEMI-AUTO) PLATFORM FOR JOBS WHERE 762X39 AMMO IS READILY AVAILABLE. The only differences are that they put on MagPul Rail Covers on the Quad Rail, MagPul AFT and their own flashlight and green lasers.

DEMAND FOR MY SAIGA'S HAS ALWAYS EXCEEDED MY ABILITY TO BUILD PARTICULARLY NEAR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. THIS IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW THAT I HAVE IN STOCK AND AUCTIONS WILL END EARLY ENOUGH THAT IF YOU OVERNITE PAYMENT I CAN MAKE SHIPMENT THE 18TH THE LAST SHIP DATE FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR FFL BY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS! Firearm in stock and ready to ship.CONTACT FROM BUYER is expected within 48 hrs and payment is due within 7 days from close of Auction. DON'T BE ALARMED BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BANNING IMPORTATION OF MILITARY TYPE WEAPONS, AMMO, ECT TO SEE HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AS IT COULD EFFECT SAIGA'S, AK'S, ETC IN THE FUTURE.

CSS bullet guide installed to accept new and surplus AK47 magazines. 1- Tapco 30rd AK47 Magazine and 10rd factory magazine plus original factory items (cleaning kit, oil bottle). Remember the most important thing with any custom firearm is quality workmanship and reliability in the action, you can always change furniture or add accessories but the heart is on the inside.; compare before you buy. With over 300 sold with nothing but compliments when you buy one of my Saiga's you are getting the best performance that you can get out of a Saiga.

The shell material is impervious to all solvents, oils, fuels and acids, as well as heat and cold. Molded-in bumpers and ribs absorb shock and vibration while adding rigidity and protecting the valance, latches, hinges and handle. A unique bunkbed interior provides two completely protected compartments, preventing damage from guns sliding into each other. SKB-exclusive foam pads separate guns while the sidewall rings prevent contact with case walls. Wide, super-tough valance adds strength and rigidity, while the neoprene O-ring seal keeps out moisture and dust. The cases have four die-cast locking latches."
