MK1, Mod 1 Rifle, 16.1"" Barrel, 12"" KeyMod Rail, .300 BLK, Black, Triad.
PRODUCT DETAILS
Embracing the proven concept of the .300 Whisper, the 300 BLK version of the PWS MK116 extends the capability of the platform by allowing the concurrent use of both subsonic and supersonic ammunition in the same platform even from the same magazine if the user so chooses. The MK116 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with ammunition such as the PWS 110gr TAC-TX 300 BLK round.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK116 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

 Although originally intended for competition, the G34 & G35 quickly became popular with law enforcement SWAT teams, and have even been adopted as standard-issue by some forward-thinking departments. Popularity among both citizens and law enforcment led to the G34/35 being labeled as ""practical-tactical"" or ""tactical longslide"" models. The longer sight radius, better balance and increased muzzle velocity afforded by the longer barrel are certainly appealing in applications where concealment is not an issue. The frame is identical to the full-sized Glock in the same caliber (ie G17/22), and accepts the same magazines.

If you arent familiar with Kahr's they are basically slim single stack Glocks.  Shoots well and has a very smooth, crisp trigger, I'm just wanting something with a shorter grip that I can pocket carry.

I'm looking for a pocket sized 9mm or .40.  Most interested in a Beretta Nano, but would also consider a gen 2 Taurus 709 or 740 slim, M&P Shield, or similar.  Though its a bit different from the others I would also consider a Ruger SR40c.

For those that are interested I also have a ported barrel for it which helps with muzzle flip on it.  For the right trade or additional $ I can add it to the deal.

The first photo is a sampling. The 2nd photo gives you some idea of some of the calibers collected. The 3rd photo is the entire collection (in four boxes).

This is a collection that belonged to a gentleman long since deceased who lived in northern Maine and collected the various cartridges over a period of years.  As far as I can tell the collecting stopped in the early 1960s.  A big part of what makes this collection unique in my view are the handwritten notes taken by the collector that catalog his collection, describe characteristics of the various cartridges and there is even a letter or two written to dealers as this man searched for particular cartridges. 

I honestly have never seen anything quite like it.  Three pictures can hardly do justice to the sum total one finds in this collection, but suffice it to say it is substantial.

The selling price is firm.  I am not at liberty to negotiate.  This is a local sale only (you must be in the Phenix City, AL area or be willing to come to this area to purchase the collection).  Cash or USPS Money orders only."

We do not certify our casings as ""once-fired"".  We collect our brass from several public ranges, sort it, clean it, inspect it, and sell it.  We visually inspect each case for defects as our experience tell us.  We feel certain 95% or more of these casings are ""once fired"" but we did not buy, shoot or were present when the new ammo was fired.  To represent them as such would not be the right thing to do.

Excellent pocket pistol.

The PF-9 is manufactured in Cocoa, Florida by Kel-Tec CNC Industries. Featuring extensive use of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing techniques, its six main components consist of the barrel, slide, frame, grip, trigger group, and magazine. The barrel is manufactured of AISA 4140 steel hardened to 48 RHC, and the slide is constructed of the same steel. The frame, which houses the trigger group, consists of a solid machined 7075-T56 aluminum billet. A transfer bar system connects the hammer and trigger. A hammer block safety is incorporated which helps prevent accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped. The long double-action-only trigger pull provides an additional safety feature. The pistol includes a slide hold-open feature which locks the slide in its rearmost position after the last round is fired. The grip is made of DuPont ST-8018 polymer and holds the steel, 7-round, single-column magazine.[3] The sights consist of a fixed front blade and a windage-adjustable notched rear sight. Three white dots highlight the sights for optimum visibility in low-light conditions.
The PF-9 uses many parts originally designed for Kel-Tec’s P11 and P3AT models, and is in fact a compromise between those pistols. From the P11, the PF-9 uses a slightly modified barrel, trigger, ejector, and front sight. The P3AT parts used in the PF-9 include the extractor and various springs. The grip is available in a variety of colors, while the slide is available in blued, Parkerized, ceramic (Cerakote), and hard chromed finishes. The PF-9 is shipped with an extended magazine floorplate, an allen wrench for adjusting the rear sight, and an owner's manual."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer"

This stock is sweet and is hard too find. If you order it from canada it takes a long time I get through customs and then ups or usps charges another $50 to deliver it to you once it is at your house! You can have it now without any hassle:)

They will be ARC+ treated (Steel) and Milspec Type3 hard Anodized (Aluminum parts).

You are purchasing the stock, not the complete firearm. 

The new Patent Pending NEAG Inc Compact Carbine Stock (CCS) is the ultimate solution for close protection guns: a collapsible stock which renders the NEA-15 7.5” PDW only 21 inches in overall length - nearly 2 inches shorter than a fully collapsed MP5A5, with proven 5.56m NATO performance. A true collapsible stock with a total weight of only 1.5 lbs; only 1oz heavier than a traditional 6-position carbine stock system with buffer and spring. The minimum length is a scant 4.75”, while the fully extended CCS stretches to 8.5” for maximum ergonomic range even on rifles designed expressly for extreme compact size. Materials are 6061-T6 Aluminum and 4041 steel with NEA’s proprietary ARC+ surface treatment. The NEAG Inc CCS is the final evolution of a project intended to provide end users with the ultimate in rifle portability and concealability. Features a single point sling point.  These do not work with piston driven AR's.  US customers can expect to pay about $46 in brokerage fees at the time of delivery.  This is payable to UPS/USPS and not charged at the time of purchase.

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because it features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

1959 5th Issue.

Original wood checkered grips with the Colt emblems.

Double action. 

This pistol is about original as it gets. 

Original box with all the paper work, "" Handling The Handgun '' and Warranty Card, cleaning brush, the round Colt tool with the 3 different size flatheads all in a small manila envelope.

The sidearm is still wrapped in the original paper it was shipped in from Colt.

No cylinder rotation marks. Spotless hammer. 

I personally know the gentleman that originally owned this Colt. He shot 4 rounds thru it in 1959 and she's been in his safe ever since. 

Professionally graded at 99%.

This is a very nice piece. Raised quite a few eyebrows when I took it in to be appraised.
Gun was appraised from 1100.00 all the way up to 1500. 
I know, gun brokers says it sells for less, so did the men that did the appraisals ..........until they inspected it in person.

This Colt was considered a "" Bullseye "" gun back in the day, and still is. 
It was the pistol most all used for competition shooting. It is also referred to as the"" Cheater Gun '' due to it's uncanny accuracy. You'll be hard pressed to find a more accurate .38 to this day. Lots of very interesting reading regarding the history of this fine weapon.

In this condition, the value is only going to go up and would make a great investment for the guys looking to add to their collection. 
Or, for the competition guys that wanna turn a few heads and kick some butt on the range shooting a beautiful old school piece.

Selling because I'm not a collector or a competition shooter and never going to cock this gun, let alone shoot it. 
I lucked out acquiring this piece on New Years Eve while talking guns with a good friend and he pulled it out of his safe. He needed cash, and I couldn’t resist.  
Worst case scenario is I don’t make a deal and I keep what I consider to be the crown jewel of all my 35 years in horse trading guns lol. 

I'd like to trade for a high end 1911 .45acp.  Colt , Springfield. Sig etc. 
Especially interested in a Colt Gold Cup Trophy, or a Springfield TRP.

Would also consider a trade for a decent AR -15.

Other trade options would also be mid - grade 1911s. Rugers, Remingtons etc....  This trade would require 2 .45ACPs from your end, or 1 .45acp and you make up the difference in quality ammo.

Open to sell outright. 1100 cash or 1200 in firearm trade.

I don't have to sell and am willing to wait for the right deal. 

You will NOT be disappointed with this fine classic Colt.

Please, no shotguns or muzzys. I’m very specific in what I’m looking for.

Lowballers will be deleted immediately."

Serial Number indicates 1931 manufacture date.  This rifle is COMPLETE, all original, including the following:

Factory original magazine and original Lyman peep sight and front blade sight.  Also, there is a flip-up V-notch rear sight (in front of the chamber).  

There is a Malcolm straight tube telescopic sight with windage/elevation adjustment in the scope ring base.  The scope glass is clear and the cross-hairs are in tact, but the focus is off.  The scope is complete with the screw-in caps on both ends.

I understand they were originally sold with a web sling, which is missing, but the sling attachments are still on the stock.  Stock has some dings and dents, but no cracks or missing wood – looks right for an 83 year old rifle.  Bluing is mostly in tact with minor rust “freckling” but no major pitting.  Malcolm scope body is tarnished, but not pitted.

The action, bolt, and chamber are all perfectly clean and slide smoothly.  Barrel is bright.

All in all, this is a great example of a collectable rifle and will be beautiful if fully restored.  Not much is needed – maybe just working out the tarnish.  This rifle was new to my Father in Law from Long Island, NY.  It was given to him when he was a boy by his father the 30’s.

Due to complete condition, with the telescopic sight, asking $1,400.  Please feel free to make an offer, however.
