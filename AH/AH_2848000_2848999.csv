I just bought this last week and it is essentially new, only put 80 rounds through it. Has great sights, zero recoil and would make a great plinking/recreational gun, home defense gun, and even an interesting hunting carbine, with Kansas' recent change in hunting laws you can even hunt deer with this, power is comparable to a .41 magnum coming out of the 16in barrel. 

I know its not a Kel Tec Sub 2000, but its the next best thing. Say what you will about the Hi Point handguns but the carbines are almost universally well reviewed and considered to be very reliable. Will come with its box and all the factory stuff, papers, lock, tools, folding foregrip, and two ten round magazines.

I've been wanting to get back into a revolver lately and would like to trade for one of some kind.  Prefer snubs but doesnt have to be, but I'm only interested in .38 special or .357 magnum revolvers.  Might also consider handguns in .40 or .45.

This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo.

MAGPUL PMAG 30rd W/ Window GEN 2 - Black (New)

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

The drawback to the LC9 is the long trigger pull.  This pistol has been modified by Galloway Precision to reduce 3/8"" travel and 1# of pull.  The trigger is now sweet and solid.  
The price is firm.  I'll only sell locally to a permit holder OR through an FFL.  No ""parking lot deals"" to non-licensed individuals.

Used by Germany in WWI, many German Officers carried these guns, private purchase, during WWII, and lots of them came back to the USA with returning GI’s. This example is pretty well-used. It has the Imperial German “Crown N” proofs and Dryese factory markings, there are no importers markings anywhere on the gun. The magazine looks chrome-plated, and it may be a replacement. The pistol has lost almost all of the original blue finish, it has lots of patina and freckling. The original checkered black hard rubber grips are pretty worn, the bore is still somewhat crisp, and overall condition is about 75%.

 Includes Hip belt and Lid

 GEN II - Tan Buckles and Trim

 VERY GOOD Condition - Main Pack does not show any defect affecting the functionality or use of the pack. All zippers, snaps, and buckles are working perfectly. May show slight soiling and/or wear due to previous use to include the possibility of small nicks in the material.
 Manufactured in the USA by Propper International for the US Military
 The Improved Load Bearing System (ILBE) backpack was created for use by the United States Marine Corps based on feedback received during initial combat actions that took place during the first US involvement in Iraq. The system was created by Arcteryx Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF) program and was intended to replace the ALICE and MOLLE systems currently in use. Arcteryx used the noted design flaws in the previous two systems to create a more efficient load bearing pack without increasing the volume of the pack and maneuverability it allowed for. The ILBE system consists of three main parts, the Main Pack, the Hydration System, and the Assault Pack. This listing is for the Main Pack only to include the hip belt and lid.

 There are three main configurations for the ILBE system, the Existence Load, the Approach March Load, and the Assault Configuration. Both the Assault Configuration and Existence Load utilize the Assault Pack component. Since the Approach March Load is designed more for extended survival than combat situations, the Assault Pack was not required. Both the Existence Load and the Assault Configuration are designed to be used in combat ready scenarios making the Assault Pack an essential piece of the configuration.

 The ILBE Pack is designed to carry a load of up to 120lbs but at the same time it distributes the weight so it is comfortable to wear. The key features to the packs comfort is in its internal frame with 2 metal ribs on the outer sides and 2 larger spars in the middle. These spars are already shaped to fit most peoples backs but can be custom bent if need be.

 Next the pack includes soft padding on both the hip belt and shoulder straps. With the wide hip belt it displaces the weight around your body with fewer pressure points. Both straps can be adjusted to custom fit your body and has a sternum strap that can be raised or lowered to fit both men and women.

 To keep the pack snug to your body you will find several compression straps along each side. These can be adjusted for different size loads and keeps your gear in place throughout your hike. Both sides of the pack also includes pockets which makes a nice resting spot when carrying longer items such as trek poles or holds extra water bottles. You will also find heavy duty zippers on both sides for access to your gear in the main compartment.
 The back of the pack offers the ability to customize your pack with MOLLE accessories by using the MOLLE webbing and includes a compartment to help hold a hydration system or the ILBE Assault Pack which can be buckled down and tightened to keep in place. If you choose not to use the Hydration compartment or are strapping a larger MOLLE accessory to the back you can roll down this flap and snap it in place.

 The main compartment is protected by a corded dust cover and can also be clipped closed. The main compartment provides storage to hold enough gear for a multi-day adventure. With zippers on both sides of the main compartment, you are able to access the bottom of the pack without having to pull everything out from the top.
 Great for Hunting, Backpacking, Camping, Hiking, Tactical Operations, Bug Out Bags, or any other outdoor activities.
 These items are priced to sell and typically are at better rates than most competitors on EBay or elsewhere.

I bought this from PSA last year. It was mounted to a lower for 2 months and has 100 to 120 flawless shots down the tube. I shot it once and cleaned it once, and then I just cleaned it again before listing. It will come in the original PSA box. Message me to set something up. 

Built with the most desirable features for an AR; chambered in 5.56 (so you can shoot 5.56 or .223 ammo); it has 1 in 7” twist rate, a 13.5” rail, mid-length gas system, and a premium chrome-lined F&N barrel. If you are not familiar with F&N they make barrels for our military! Very high quality upper!

This has been sold out on their site since I ordered it last May and waited a month to get it. So save over $100 bucks and get it now for only $475! Selling because I have two. I really like their stuff and I know you will too. The slim rail feels really good and handles just as great.

The top picture is the stock pic from PSA and the bottom 2 are of the actual upper you will receive. 

Please send a message with questions. Please include your name, phone, and city so I can call you to set something up.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide,[1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in many Movies, TV Shows and Video Games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun), this allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS-12 shotguns were stopped to the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS-12 to focus on the manufacturing of the SPAS-15 model. The SPAS-12's retail price in its final year of 2000 was $1500.00 averaged for final sales outside the U.S. to non-restricted countries"

I have a LNIB Gen 4 Glock 27 USA version on March 15th for my wife. Put tru glow night sights and clip extenders in all 3 mags. It comes with all original accessories including 3 mags. Quick loader, glock box and 6 different back straps. Original sights are also included. We shot less than 100 rounds out of it at calipers. It's just a little to much for her. I think I need to switch to a 9mm. Would consider trades for a Beretta px4 ultra compact model. Otherwise selling for $600. This setup will save you $110 from what I paid inside store. My walk out price was $710. I have the receipt. I also have two boxes of 50 of .40 ammo I will toss in for $30 more. More pictures upon request.

Both are Brand New. The Gammo Silent Cat current retail is 179.99 and the Whisper Fusion is 319.99. I have many firearms and Air Rifles and these are 2 that I have 1 extra. 
They Both are high grade rifles but I can say as someone who shoots a lot that the Whisper Fusion is every bit equal in performance to an actual Rimfire Rifle in terms of true power and precision. Since these are 2 extra of models I own I am looking to either sale or trade. My son is looking for another 10/22 or possibly different small rifle or pistol. 
At Walmart or academy you would pay around $500 for both...I'm selling both for $350 (bottom line $150+ saving) or a trade which make an offer. Both come with 4x32 scopes and in Box. High end Air rifles have been our answer to the ammo shortage and these 2 are on Par with small caliber rifles in terms of performance. Text REDACTED"

Smith & Wesson produced this revolver for the New York State Police in 1980. NYSP went a different direction, cancelled the order, and Smith sold the revolvers on the civilian market. Only 3000 were made. It has a 4 inch pinned barrel, a six shot recessed cylinder, a case hardened trigger and hammer, and fixed sights. To this day, the original 520 remains the ONLY fixed-sight N-Frame revolver Smith ever made in .357 Magnums. This would be perfect for your collection.

This is a beautiful gun that you just don't come across often. In this condition with box and papers, these guns sell well north of $1,250.

Smith & Wesson produced this revolver for the New York State Police in 1980. NYSP went a different direction, cancelled the order, and Smith sold the revolvers on the civilian market. Only 3000 were made. It has a 4 inch pinned barrel, a six shot recessed cylinder, a case hardened trigger and hammer, and fixed sights. To this day, the original 520 remains the ONLY fixed-sight N-Frame revolver Smith ever made in .357 Magnums. This would be perfect for your collection. CASH VALUE $750 TRADE VALUE $900

The Intrafuse T6 Buttstock Assembly by TAPCO features a 6-Position collapsible buttstock stock assembly built to exacting tolerances and includes a metal sling swivel. Each stock body is machine qualified to the exact dimension of the impact extruded 7075 T6 aluminum extension tube, for a no-rattle fit. This process allows for a smooth action and snug fit between the stock body and the extension tube. Extension tube threads are rolled on, a Mil-Spec process superior to the standard thread ""cutting"" process. The inside of the extension tube is coated with Mil-Spec dry film lubricant that not only keeps the action quieter; it reduces metal-on-metal contact, extending the service life of your buffer. While most other tubes are anodized or have no finish, the outside of the TAPCO tube is grit blasted to leave a non-reflective surface, then coated in Mil-Std 171 Lusterless Black for a smooth matte finish. The extension tube is 100% made and finished in the U.S and is supplied with a certificate of origination; you won't find that anywhere else!

Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

Please do not send us an email asking if it has everything from factory if the item is listed new. Do not ask us how many rounds have been fired in the firearm if it is listed as new. Most firearms are fired from the factory so it will have only been fired at the factory. • Our used firearms are used. We will try to take the best pictures possible and of the worst imperfections we can see. We do not try to hide anything on a used firearm. If we cannot take a picture of an imperfection it will be noted in listing. Bolt action rifles would rarely have a bore that is “shot out”. Think about how many thousands of rounds will have to be bolted in a bolt action rifle for it to be “shot out”. • If you make a winning bid and confirm as it requires you to, do not contact us telling us, you didn’t mean to click the button.
