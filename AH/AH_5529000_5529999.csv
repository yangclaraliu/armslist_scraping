The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.Features:Caliber: 22Stock: Wood stockMagazines: 2 magsAction: Semi-AutomaticCaliber: 22 Long RifleBarrel Length: 16.5""33.5"" overall barrel length Capacity: 24+1Trigger: StandardSafety: LeverStock Style: WoodMetal Finish: MatteWooden furniture Hand weathered finishTape and bandana added Gun Weight: 6.75 lbs"

The overall condition is very good.Has been fired a couple of times. The wood is in very good condition. The metal looks good with no rust but there are some normal use marks. The rear sight moves freely with no binding in the movement. The bolt cycles smoothly and locks on the empty internal magazine. The bore looks shiny. This model does not have the attached bayonet, but does have the groove for the bayonet. Included is the 10-round magazine the box, the green plastic oil bottle, the cleaning rod and bandoleer. This is one of the nicest Chinese SKS rifles we've seen in quite awhile. contact for more info and pics"

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability. The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Walnut Stock
Double Set target trigger. Works nice. You do a pull on the set trigger and then you can adjust the pull on the second fire trigger.
Clean bore with a 1:48 twist. This will be for ballets and standard ball ammo.
Uses a #10 or #11 cap. So, you'll want to use Pyrodex or straight black powder with this one. 
 
In short, its a T/C Renegade. They dont make these any more. I would rather trade it out for something I need / want than go through listing on gunbroker or anything like that. It comes as you see it. I dont have a boot for this.
 
Let me know if your interested in a trade or purchase. Needing AR parts and optics myself. 300.00 OBO"
