Original and unaltered. This is the highest serial numbered Remington Rand I have ever owned. One of the few, original boxed examples from my personal collection. Parkerized 3rd style slide address Remington Rand produced in July 1945. This pistol is in excellent condition and still retains its original WWII shipping box. There were pistols sold through the D.C.M. to members of the N.R.A. in the 1960s in this serial range, that when received, were nearly new condition and included the original Remington Rand shipping boxes. This appears to be one of those pistols because of its high condition and box.

By 1945, Remington Rand was a high speed M1911A1 production line. During WWII, they produced more than 877,000 pistols between late 1942 and the end of production in 1945. This pistol has a Parkerized finish and all late war parts. The mainspring housing and slide stop are serrated. The original High Standard barrel is HS and ""P"" proof marked. This pistol has all original parts and perfectly matching wear patterns, some of which are simply from long tern storage in the original box."

Also, included is a top tier Horsehair Crossbreed SuperTuck Deluxe IWB holster which their most expensive line,  and worth right a 100 dollars. I got it for Xmas this year and haven't got to use it. This gun is safe kept, and well known as the best production 45 Automatic ever made. It is the only pistol that we know for sure was taken by the Navy Seals on the Bin Laden raid. There is not even close to one negative thing that I can say about this pistol. It is in absolutely perfect condition!! Instead of buying yourself a mid tier 1911 or AR,  buy an absolute tier one carry pistol. It is widely considered the best production 45 made!

http://www.greatwestgunsmithing.com/index.htm

Package B consists of a trigger job, receiver bedding, recoil buffer, reduced gas port bushing set and barrel work.
 	Trigger Job - trigger pull weight is reduced and creep/takeup are reduced for a cleaner breaking trigger and faster shot times.  Triggers average 3.5 pounds to 4 pounds pull weight.  Distinct secondary profile can be designed into trigger job for tactical or law enforcement use. 
 	Receiver Bedding - a glove tight fit is achieved with epoxy bedding and added metals for increased durability between the stock and receiver.  This tightened fit will help reduce fliers and stringing.  Receiver and stock will disassemble easily for maintenance chores.
 	Recoil Buffer - primarily for the standard Mini 14 model, my hand cut neoprene rubber buffer will reduce the shock of operating rod to receiver impact and help save your optics.  Buffer is included for Ranch models to work in conjunction with the factory recoil buffer system.  Unlike harder urethane products, this buffer does not require thinning or fitting to allow rifle to cycle and lock back properly.
 	Reduced Gas Port Bushings - one mid sized bushing is installed, and one each large and small bushing included for tuning to reduce the cycling pressure of the rifle and keep brass close and fit for reloading.  This is a non-adjustable, low maintenance product sized for your specific caliber and model.
 	Barrel Work -  	.Barrel has been shortened to 16” with the end threaded. OEM Ruger flash hider added.

Its obvisoulsy in used condition and is in original unrestored condition. It has all original parts and all the serial numbers match to include the original grips. This gun was produced from 1915 to 1942 and this one has a 5 inch barrel and a 6 shot. The serial numbers on this model rangwe from 241704 to 1000000, mine is 381***, putting it earlier in the production time frame, probably around early 1920's based on grips. It is a military and police gun and is in good functioning condition. This is in nickel finish.

Like I said it is obviously used but in original condition and you can see from the pictures that some of the nickel finish is wearing on the one side. ""Smith and Wesson"" is stamped on one side of the barrel and the other side of barrel is stamped with ""38 S & W SPECIAL CTG."" It has the USA patent on top of the barrel. As you can see its all complete and here with all orginal parts and unrestored. I considered this a collectable gun.

This gun is graded between fair and good condition as it still has most of the original nickel finish and still functions. This gun was probably carried by some sheriff's back in the day and no telling what this gun has seen.

Do a simple search and you will see these guns selling anywhere from 400 to 700 dollars.

I am looking for 400 dollars as this gun is a true piece of American history, send me a reply if your interested and Ill get back with you right away as my phone receives emails.

Front trunnion has been riveted and rear trunnion has been partially riveted. Rivets are not professionally done so you may want to remove them and start over. This is what I would do if I had the time & tools.

Bolts on the rear trunnion are just to hold it in place--nothing has been tapped. All the  parts necessary to complete the rifle are there.

All parts are matching. Here's a list of what you get:

- NoDak Spud NDS-4 100% receiver made for 762x39
- Good condition 16"" threaded barrel (rifling looks clean and sharp, some minor pitting on grooves)
- Bolt, bolt carrier, gas tube, recoil spring, dust cover, pistol grip & cleaning rod
- Under folder stock & assembly
- Wood lower hand guard
- Fire control group assembly (trigger, hammer, sear, spring & pins)
- Trigger guard, barrel pin, selector lever, muzzle brake & pistol grip retaining screw
- 3 bags of rivets, more then enough to start over and finish the project

""Tactical Solutions has transferred the innovation from the X-Ring™ series SBX barrel over to the AR-22 conversion.

The SBX barrel has bore length of 12.25” with a permanently attached shroud for an overall length of 16.5” allowing the user to attach a suppressor without adding length. This gives the user all the advantages of a short barreled rifle without the time consuming and costly SBR paperwork. As with all of our AR-22 conversions, it includes our CNC machined bolt assembly with 416 stainless steel bolt and precision ground tool steel guide rails for strength and smooth, reliable, functionality. In addition, the AR-22 SBX includes a forged charging handle with our tactical latch. Each conversion is shipped with a 25 round Black Dog Machine magazine.""

About EXO Technology;

EXO Technology is a patented, nickel-boron coating from UCT Coatings, Inc. EXO Technology provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than Chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing reliability in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition).

Certain models also feature Ameriglo night sights.

736,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2849736,"For Sale/Trade:  1987 Chevrolet Van, amazing condition, ATeam Style (needs Motor) read more below","NNJ, New Jersey, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Saturday, August 16, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For Sale: 1987 Chevrolet G10 van with 101,000 miles on it. The van was owned by the same person for most of its life and the second owner bought it shortly before me. I bought the van for a project as it needs a new motor and I never got around to doing anything with it. 

Recently the second owner had an issue with the engine and the mechanics shop told them it needed to be replaced. The owner decided that with their age and living on a fixed income they did not want to put any more money into the van. Within the last year they purchased a new fuel pump and had the driver's side door lock repaired. The battery in it was recycled as it was older, not holding a good charge and was likely to leak.

I was not worried about the van needing an engine as it currently has a six cylinder and I wanted to upgrade it to an eight. If you are someone that does not mind a six, the engine might need some work, and might not be shot. It is possible the shop was playing games, but I am not sure.

All of the vans fluids look clean (Transmission, coolant, power steering, etc.) Between the condition of the body and how clean the transmission fluid was I jumped on buying this van. It is really hard to find a van from this time period that is not completed rusted and rotted out. The van does not have power accessories or air conditioning like most vans from that time period. The van also has met the states stringent emissions standards as it has a current NJ Inspection Sticker on the lower driver's front windshield. The Exhaust system and underneath of the van is really in great shape.

While this van does have some rust spots on it, it is the best condition 80's van I have ever seen. The undercarriage is in great shape and the shocks are not fully rusted out like every other van I have ever seen. I really doubt the original owner drove this in the snow often. 

This van is a perfect candidate to be transformed into the A-Team van. It also has a sliding side door with a window and has the black (not stainless) trim around the back window. This vehicle qualifies for historic license plates from the State of NJ, if you decide you do not want to make it into a daily driver. For some reason I am unable to load pictures however if you are interested please let me know where you are from so I know you're not spam and I'll get pictures out to you ASAP."

Located in St. Charles, IL.
Smith & Wesson model 327 Performance Center .357 mag/38 special 8 round cylinder. Very rare hard to find 2 inch barrel. Scandium Alloy Frame. Titanium Alloy Cylinder. Super light weight. Awesome conceal carry gun. 8 rounds of .357 in a light weight snub nose. Don't let the pics fool you, this is a full size gun. It's a S&W N frame which is a large frame. But it's light weight and short barrel make it very carry friendly. Only weighs 21.4 oz. Performance Center trigger with stop. Performance Center tuned action. Titanium Cylinder & Barrel Shroud. If you've never fired a Performance center S&W you will feel the difference. Amazingly smooth action in double action. Absolutely no trigger play in single action. Even with the light weight frame the overall size makes 38's feel like you're firing 22's. You will feel the magnum rounds, but very manageable recoil. The soft Houge grips help a lot. This gun is an absolute pleasure to shoot. And amazingly accurate for a snubbie.
Included with gun: 500 rounds of 38 special 125 grain hard cast polymer coated truncated flat points. 10 eight round full moon clips (and yes the cylinder is cut to hold these). 2 eight round speed strips (easier to conceal than moon clips). S&W molded leather OWB holster with Performance Center logo (specifically made for this gun). Nylon IWB holster. Nylon carrying case. Houge grips. I do NOT have the original wood grips or original case.
This is a used gun. In excellent condition. Only 2 small flaws that you can barely notice. A small scratch on the rear part of the frame about the size of a flea. And a nick on the front of the barrel. Not to bad. 
Price is $1200 FIRM! And will include everything pictured! MSRP from S&W is $1309.00. And that's if you can find one. These are rare! All the extras I'm including should more than make up for the depreciation of it being a used gun. I would consider accepting $1000 if I get to keep all the ammo.
Well that's about it. Thanks for reading all this!
Located in St. Charles, IL. I'd be willing to meet you half way within a reasonable distance. Cash only. No trades please. All laws apply. Will skip 72 hour wait for law enforcement.

Everything is as it came from the factory, except I did have a single point sling mount added and purchased a single point sling (as shown in the pics). It also comes with a new unused MagPul Gen 3 30 round magazine, 2 new Aluminum USGI 30 round mags, and rear BUS (Back Up Sight). This rifle is brand new, unfired. 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged barrel), chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made be FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a LWRC and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint.

Here is a link to the PSA website with the specific details of this rifle (also read the reviews).

Price is $825. I have over $900 in this rifle (with tax, FFL transfer fee, and additional accessories). Remember this rifle is still unused.

Must be 18 to purchase with valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. CCW owners preferred. 

NOTE: I do a have brand new EOTech 512 red dot that I purchased to put on this rifle, but never used. I paid $450 for it. Will add it to this AR15 for $400."

It also comes with a new unused MagPul Gen 3 30 round magazine, 2 new Aluminum USGI 30 round mags, and rear BUS (Back Up Sight). This rifle is brand new, unfired. 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

This is the premium model, meaning it has the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged barrel), chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made be FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a LWRC and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint.

Here is a link to the PSA website with the specific details of this rifle (also read the reviews).

Price is $825. I have over $900 in this rifle (with tax, FFL transfer fee, and additional accessories). Remember this rifle is still unused.

NOTE: I do a have brand new EOTech 512 red dot that I purchased to put on this rifle, but never used. I paid $450 for it. Will add it to this AR15 for $400."
