Not one hangup or failure of any kind...no break-in period with this one! Incredibly accurate and smooth shooting 1911. From what I have read, these are made seasonally, and in few numbers. They're hand fitted, with much more attention paid to them at the factory than standard Springer models. It comes with the standard Springfield briefcase, all paperwork/manuals, 2 - 7rd mags, holster, and mag holster. The holster has never left the case (didn't want to take a chance with the beautiful finish).  Match grade barrel, bushing and trigger. 3 dot low-profile combat night sights by trijicon, lowered/flared ejection port, beveled magwell, ambi-safety, pachmayr wrap around grips. I am the original owner and I paid $1397 out the door for it...asking $1200 cash. Would consider trading for a nice semi-auto rifle chambered in 7.62X51 or maybe another nice 1911 or semi-auto .45acp. Thanks for looking. Please email with any questions, or for additional pics."

CHINESE TYPE 53 Mosin Nagant
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------

The Chinese Type 53 Carbine is one of the more interesting of the Model 1944 Carbine clones; however, the Type 53 has never been sought out on a wide scale by Mosin Nagant collectors. The main reason for this folly is the FALSE NOTION that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's. This article will be a brief introduction into the history and production of these little known and misunderstood carbines.
IF YOUR A COLLECTOR ITS A TYPE YOU MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION,
If your a shooter like me who wants an in-expensive piece of history that's as well and sometimes better than their M44 cousins, this is a gotta have!

While the Type 53 has never really caught on in the collecting circles, there is no fault that can be found in the carbine itself. The Type 53 will hold its own in quality with most of the M44 clones, with the possible exception of the Polish M44. The Russian M44 and the Type 53 are also very close in overall quality, but the Soviet made carbines may be a bit better in overall fit and finish. Many US collectors have made the comparison of the Type 53 to the Chinese made SKS and the MAK 90's v.s. the Soviet made versions of these weapons. While the Soviet made versions may be a bit better overall, the Chinese made rifles/carbines are made to hold up to the rigors of warfare. There may indeed be a drop off in finish but the Type 53 is no slouch either. If one can find a Type 53 in VG or better condition, one will see little difference when compared to the other M44's. The trick may well be to find a Type 53 in VG or better condition, as many of these have seen a lot of use. This use is a testament to their durability and quality.



The overall accuracy of the Type 53 is in line with the other M44's on the market. Some are excellent shooters while some are truly horrible. This is not just the case with the Type 53 but all the M44 carbines ( really all surplus firearms in general ). Because of this it is impossible to make blanket statements on accuracy. Maybe the buyer will get lucky and get a ""tack-driver"" and maybe the buyer won't. The Type 53, like all the M44's, are fun to shoot IF one can tolerate a rather heavy amount of recoil.
 NC23GUNS offers you rare examples of Sino-Soviet cooperation from a bygone era! The Type 53 is a copy of the famous Russian M44 carbine, and like its predecessor is chambered in 7.62x54R. We were able to locate a cache of these carbines where they have been preserved for decades just waiting to be re-issued. Needless to say - these won't be around forever. If you are a collector of Mosin-Nagants, this is a fantastic opportunity to add a hard-to-find carbine to your collection. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 20.25"", Overall: 40"", Weight: 9 lbs. Condition:  FAIR TO Good.



The Type 53 may well be the best bargain of the M44 Carbine types on the collector's market, as in most case $139 is the high end of price. It is indeed a lot of carbine for the money and really belongs in any Mosin Nagant collection. The black-eye that it has received in many circles is undeserved and this can work to the collector's advantage. Ignore the bogus information and the collector can make out like a bandit.

Second is a Blackhawk steel clip nylon holster with mag pouch.  Brand new in the box, never worn.  Size 03 fits all full size 1911s with or without a rail.  Has a thumb break that I never installed.  I paid $21 in the store, I'll ship it to you for $15.

I am selling simply because I dont have the time, or place suitable to shoot this rifle. Thanks for your interest."

Comes with Custom Walnut Grips,  factory grips, 2 hi-cap mags, hard case, child proof lock and original shipping box. This gun is very concealable but not too small to shoot accurately.
The CZ 83's combination of small size and moderate weight easily handles the new generation of high-performance defensive ammo that has become available for 'pocket' pistol calibers from leading ammo manufacturers. The DA/SA trigger mechanism operates in the same manner as the CZ 75. The 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine catch."

I have a AP-9 9mm I would like to sell.  It is in Very Good condition and has a couple hundred rounds through it.   I am the 3rd owner, and I know the 2 previous owners both of whom collect guns more then fire them.

Other then it being in awesome condition it comes with the original box, and pamphlet.  It comes with the standard 20rd, as well as a 30rd magazines.

I recently did a full detail strip cleaning on it, and also with a dremel polished all of the internals.  As well as any friction areas for smooth clean operation with some good quality gun oil for lubrication.

Reason for selling is I need money to fix my car, and when you need money toys are usually the first to go...  In addition I have 100rds of ammo I can throw in for the right offer or trade.

Must be able to meet near Vancouver FTF, have valid state ID and be over 21 years of age.   I reserve the right at ANY TIME to refuse sale of this firearm to someone I find shady.  Concealed permits are preferred but not required."

Great to shoot. 

Good condition. 

Comes with one 10 round reduced capacity magazine and one 12 round standard capacity magazine. 

Comes with an IWB Kydex holster and an IWB tuck-able magazine holder (holsters sell for $75.)

Only comes with what you see pictured here. I do not have the original box, it does not have night sights. 
Would like 600 for all of it. 

A lot of people have offered trades, so I'll clarify a few things

Yes, I am open to some trades. 
I have nothing against S&W or XD polymer framed pistols, they are not usually valued at much though, as in right around $400 (I've seen numerous sell for this, even new, I'm sorry, I just can't value them any higher in the event of a trade.)

Specifically I'm fond of the S&W bodyguard, Glock 23/32 or even a Glock 26 - preference to gen 4. or a simple pump action mossberg or Remington shotgun with 18"" ish barrel. 


Trades will involve cash on your part, I am hoping to sell to get some home projects finished."

2002 Dodge Ram 3500 Quad cab, Dual rear wheels, 4 wheel drive. This truck has the 5.9L Cummins diesel motor, auto transmission, and 340K miles. Color matched rhino-liner in the bed, 2"" leveling kit on the front, and firestone airbags on the rear to help with weight when you are loaded. The body of the truck is in incredible condition for its age, there is a couple minor wrinkles on the leading edge of passenger door, and a couple MINOR cracks at the lower rear corner of the passenger side dually fender. No tailgate, back seat, rear bumper, or front bumper. She is sitting on a set of spare wheels, and will need dually wheels installed before much road time is put on. Rear brakes have very few miles on them. 

The Auto transmission MAY need to be replaced. It was brought to me with reported transmission issues, but after flushing the trans today I have been highway driving it and have yet to find a problem. Selling with the disclaimer that although right now she is running and driving great, there is the POSSIBILITY that the trans will need serviced at some point. 

All in all she is a great truck to either put back on the road, or to use for parts. I do not have a title for the truck right now. Long story short, i have been around this truck for years with it belonging to a close friend, and as a by-product of his divorce it was left at my shop while they were fighting over who was responsible for paying for the transmission issues. In the end, they both washed their hands of it and I now own it through a storage lien I have on it. I am selling as it, without a title, and asking $5250. I can finish the paperwork and deliver you a title for an additional $250 on top of the agreed on sale price if your plan is to drive her again, instead of parting it out. The truck books at $12,300 in clean running condition. I have located multiple used transmissions in the area for $800-1000, and a brand new rebuilt is approximately $2200 installed. LOTS of room to repair it and still be way under book value. As a parts truck, the motor alone should bring $2500-3500 depending on the buyer. Up to you....I just need it gone and out of my way. 

All SERIOUS cash offers considered. NO payments, and NO trades unless its fire. Arms, and then I am all ears. After driving it all day, I have even considered taking it back off the market and keeping it, she sounds tough as hell, runs and drives good, and is a sharp looking example of the 2nd gen dodge."

891,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2602891,For Sale:  Are all these private sellers on here? (got ~30 responses),"Hudson Valley, Hudson Valley, New York",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, January 23, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I thought there were no private sales allowed in NY after Jan. 15.  Why are people still selling ammunition in the private party/sellers section?  What is the deal?  Is it still legal until the gun grabbers figure out a background check system, or is it a sting operation to see who bites?  
Please email me because I am pretty confused right now, and I can't find more info on line.

OK guys.  I have received a lot of responses so far.  Thank you!  
The following are the 4 most common responses I got (90-95% of the emails).  Here they are in descending order:

1. 30% of the responders said:  
You CANNOT sell/buy ammo privately in or out of state without FFL or ammo dealer involvement.  This means no face to face transactions either if you are not licensed. You can still walk into a gun shop or big box store to purchase ammo (which I think we all know), NCIS or not.  
Most of the people in this category and a couple of others, also said that private ammo sellers here are just ignoring the new laws, and refuse to abide by them... or they are Dealers and /FFL's.   

2.  25% of responders said: 
You can ship/sell ammo to someone out of state without an FFL or ammo dealer, but NO private sales within the state.  It does not matter that a background check system is not established. 

3.  25% of responders said:
BUSINESS AS USUAL as far as ammo goes, until NY has the NCIS/Background check system in place.  This means sell/buy or ship within and out of state.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED (this one surprised me I must say). 

4.  20% of responders said: 
You can only TRADE ammo privately, because it is not considered a sale. And most of them said other than trading, #1 applies.

So it is apparent there is still a variety of opinions.  Just shows how ambiguous and open to interpretation the SAFE Act really is.  
One thing is clear.  75% of the people think private selling/buying within the state is now illegal.  However, 45% of those think you can sell & ship ammo out of state, or trade for it within the state.  Only 25% think nothing has changed - until the background checks are in place.  Some would say that leaves us with inconclusive results.  Still 75% is a great majority, so I would be seriously hesitant to exchange $ for ammo privately within the state.  With that established, it is still unclear to me if one can trade ammo, or ship/sell ammo privately to a person out of state since the percentages were 25% and 20% respectively.  We probably won't know for certain which opinion has merit, until someone gets convicted or acquitted for some of these acts listed here. 

Thank you all and sorry I could not reply to all of you!  I got a little overwhelmed.  I did respond to the first dozen or so emails."

This 2-3/4"" shell launches a 1 Ounce Hollow Point at 1450 fps. It has superb accuracy and is devastating downrange. 

 A close examination of the big game record books quickly reveals one strikingly consistent fact; the overwhelming majority of trophy book whitetails are found in slug-only states. Why stake your hunt on inferior shotgun slugs? When the buck of a lifetime steps out at 150 yards, go ahead and squeeze the trigger! 

 Coupling the angled petal score design of the Copper Solid Muzzleloader bullet with the ballistic coefficient of a deep penetrating slug round, the Copper Solid Sabot Slugs deliver maximum performance: 100-percent weight retention, 2X controlled expansion and super accuracy. Accuracy is exceptional, producing groups of 2 ½ inches or less from Remington's fully-rifled slug barrels. The result is the most effective game-dropping performance of any known deer slug.

Trade valued at $715.00.  Do your own research and find the P380 retails approximately $160 less than the PM9 whether standard or night sights are equipped, either new or used. Standard sight version vs. NS version is a greater difference. 
Ammo or cash can make up the difference, amount to vary based on how your P380 is equipped.

maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. It
is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces
lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help
to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes
it more accurate for competition or duty use. The G41 Gen4 comes with all
the standard features of the Glock Generation 4 pistol group, including the
modular backstrap design, Gen4 rough textured frame surface and dual recoil
spring assembly. 20.00 Shipping to most States . We will ship to your dealer with FFL or pick up in our store. All guns sold in NC or picked up at our location please add 6.75% sales tax. No tax on out of State transfers. NEW IN BOX Call Lindsey for info. This gun is a 10 rd not the 13 rd.

In a gunfight, the most important rule is ..... HAVE A GUN!!!
Shooting advice from various Concealed Carry Instructors. 
If you own a gun, you will appreciate these rules...
If not, you should get one and learn how to use it and learn the rules:
RULES:
A: Guns have only two enemies: rust and politicians.
B: Its always better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.
C: Cops carry guns to protect themselves, not you.
D: Never let someone or something that threatens you get inside arms length
E: Never say ""I've got a gun."" If you need to use deadly force,the first sound they hear should be the safety clicking off.
F: The average response time of a 911 call is 23 minutes; 
the response time of a .357 magnum is 1400 feet per second. 
G: The most important rule in a gunfight is:
Always win - there is no such thing as a fair fight; cheat if necessary.
H: Make your attacker advance through a wall of bullets ...
You may get killed with your own gun, but he'll have to beat you to death with it, cause it will be empty.
I: If you're in a gun fight:
If you're not shooting, you should be loading.
If you're not loading, you should be moving.
If you're not moving, you're dead.
J: In a life and death situation, do something ... it may be wrong, but do something!
K: If you carry a gun, people call you paranoid. Nonsense!
If you have a gun, what do you have to be paranoid about?
L: You can say 'stop' or any other word, but a large bore muzzle
pointed at someone's head is pretty much a universal language.

M: Never leave an enemy behind. If you have to shoot, shoot to kill.
In court, yours will be the only testimony.
N: You cannot save the planet, but you may be able to save yourself
and your family.
If you believe in the 2nd Amendment, forward to others you know who also believe.
