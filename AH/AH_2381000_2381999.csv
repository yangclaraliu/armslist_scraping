I am listing them together because Armslist is giving me issues with trying to list 2 nearly identical guns - it keeps deleting the second one.  These rifles are like new - they were only taken to the range once and bench fired a few times to sight in the scopes.  These guns are like brand new and are in 99%+ condition.  They are a great gun for varmint or predator hunting, precision target shooting, or would make a great sniper rifle.  The Remington 700 claims to be the most accurate production gun in the world with sub-moa accuracy (less than 1"" at 100 yards) out of the box.  The Remington 700 is a tack driver, you will not be disappointed.

The Remington 700:
- Bolt action - one chambered in .223 caliber, the other in .308 caliber
- Varmint contour 26"" heavy barrel
- X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger 
- Hinged floorplate for quick unloading
- Synthetic black stock
- Original box, manual, lock, etc.

To each I have added:
- Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40 scope with BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator)
- Hogue overmolded stock with channel pillar bedding in ghillie green
- Harris BRM Series S bipod adjustable between 6""-9""
- Bipod swivel lock
- DNZ 1 piece scope mount
- KRG oversized tactical bolt knob
- Buttstock cartridge holder
- Neoprene scope cover
- Quick detach sling
- Hard carrying case

After adding it all up, I have over $1,200 invested in each one of these set-ups.  
I will let each caliber go for $1000 FIRM for EVERYTHING!!!  That is $1000 PER GUN PACKAGE - NOT FOR BOTH! - $2000 if you want both calibers.

I am NOT interested in trades at this time, I am only selling because I am buying a house and need down payment money.  I will sell the .223 and .308 separately, but I will not separate any of the components - they are being sold as complete packages only.  Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale, show a valid Ohio driver's license, and sign a bill of sale.

Design details[edit]

The P series are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. They utilize a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel. The P series were made with a traditional double action/single action (DA/SA), or double action only (DAO) trigger mechanism.
The standard models have an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.[3][4]
The pistols make extensive use of investment cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel; while the slide and ejector are carbon steel. The P85 through P944 use an investment cast aluminum frame, while the P95 and later models use a fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane frame.

This is a great gun for varmint or predator hunting, precision target shooting, or would make a great sniper rifle.  The Remington 700 claims to be the most accurate production gun in the world with sub-moa accuracy (less than 1"" at 100 yards) out of the box.  This gun is a tack driver, you will not be disappointed.

This Remington 700:
- Bolt action chambered in .308 caliber
- Varmint contour 26"" heavy barrel
- X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger 
- Hinged floorplate for quick unloading
- Synthetic black stock
- Original box, manual, lock, etc.

To which I have added:
- Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40 scope with BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator)
- Hogue overmolded stock with channel pillar bedding in ghillie green
- Harris BRM Series S bipod adjustable between 6""-9""
- Bipod swivel lock
- DNZ 1 piece scope mount
- KRG oversized tactical bolt knob
- Buttstock cartridge holder
- Neoprene scope cover
- Quick detach sling
- Hard carrying case

After adding it all up, I have around $1,200 invested in all of this.  
I will let go for $1000 FIRM for EVERYTHING!!!

I am NOT interested in trades at this time, I am only selling because I am buying a house and need down payment money.  I also have the exact same gun listed but in .223 caliber.  I will not separate any of the components - it is being sold as a complete package only.  Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale, show a valid Ohio driver's license, and sign a bill of sale.

Thanks for looking!"

M48: 1950-1952- The initial version of the M48, with full crest, M48 mark on receiver and all machined steel parts. These rifles have not been available for a long time. They are a must for the military rifle collector. Very few of these true M48 rifles are available.

GRADE:This rifle is in very good condition. The bore looks great with deep rifling.

The M48 Mauser is a post World War II Yugoslavian version of the Belgian Fabrique Nationale designed Mauser model 1924 short rifle. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's MauserKarabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well.

I am most interested in trading for other C&R firearms rifle/pistol/revolver. 

I may be willing to throw in a little ammo if the offer is right. I would love a keltec PMR 30 so if you have one and will trade let me know what you want and we can try to work a deal. Otherwise I am open to almost anything.

Other items high on my interest are: Bulgarian Makarov, British Enfield, French Mas, AR Lowers and parts, Chinese SKS in very good condition, sporterized mosins hit me up with whatever. Ammo: 7.5 Swiss, 8x56r, 303 Brittish, 7MM Mauser, 7.62x25 tok, 10mm, 9mm possibly other.  I would also be interested in bayonets for k31 or a 7mm brazilian mauser

I have also already modified the bold release to the automatic style so you only have to pull the bolt back to release it instead of fumbling around trying to push the bolt relase and pull the bolt back at the same time to release it, now its much more convienent.

Hogue rubber grips are molded from a durable synthetic rubber that is not spongy or tacky, but gives that soft recoil absorbing feel, without affecting accuracy. This modern rubber requires a completely different molding process than ordinary neoprene and results in a much superior grip. The material we use does not come apart or deteriorate and is resistant to all solvents and oils used around firearms. Hogue Grips give you a lasting precision fit and durability that will provide years of dependable service. The flexibility of our materials and molding process has allowed us to produce superior rubber grips with features that out perform all other makes."

I came up with this because I’m tired of using cases and placing them all over my fifth wheel I want them easily accessible and protected.
Thank you for considering my gun rack it’s made in the Northwest by hand and always will be, never overseas or will they be mass produced! 
My wishes are that these will be around to be passed down or used over and over.
 I’m willing to work with each customer if there is a need for a unit that holds more or less guns or even design changes it’s about you and what will make you satisfied!
I’ve placed many rifles and shot guns in this rack but not every style of firearm will work in this model, I’ve tried to fit the most common style and sizes. 
It’s critical that you measure your guns to identify if they will fit this unit or what changes I can make for you. Also measure the overall vertical length of your guns to ensure they will fit in the space that you want to mount the rack.
Gun Rack Dimensions – 
36” Height x 25.5” Width x 7.25” Depth
From the bottom of the rack on the felt where your gun will sit to the center of the clip is 34.25”.
The oval for the stock is about 2” Wide x 5.25” Long.
Barrel/Stock Holder Dimensions –
Two holders below available depending on the size of gun you want to place in the rack.
Small Holder -
• Holds objects from 5/8"" to 1 3/8” (16 to 32mm) in diameter. • Each clamp supports a safe working load of 25lbs (11 kilos). 
Large Holder –
• Holds objects from 1 3/4” to 2 7/8” (44 to 73mm) in diameter. • Each clamp supports a safe working load of 50lbs.
Lastly I work retail and email is the best way to let me know what you need or to call you at my soonest, if you call I will absolutely pick up if I’m able to or leave a message if that is easier. I take this serious and will treat you as I would like to be treated and not be a flake.

This pistol has around 800 rounds through it and the only issues I have ever had were with bad ammo. I enjoy shooting this pistol a lot and feel confident in the 14-round capacity of .40 S&W ammunition. It is impressively accurate, even at distances beyond most pistol ranges. This summer I was able to hit a target 100+ yards across a pond that rifle shooters were having trouble hitting.
This gun features several safety features including an external decocker. Two 14-round Sig Sauer made magazines will be included (.40/.357) as well as the the original box and owner's manual work.
I will include some extra Winchester JHP with the gun and, for a total of $800 I can include 350 rounds of Aguila 180g FMJ too. I have fired a lot of this ammo with no problems. It is brass cased, made on Remington equipment, just produced in Mexico.
I will sell the pistol for $700 with the case and magazines but no Aguila ammunition.

Everything pictured is included in sale plus the stock sights I removed (front and rear), the Dawson Precision tools for mounting their sights, Walther manual, Walther speed loader, Walther case, and wire lock and key.

Purchased this new in the summer of 2013 to try it out as an alternative to Glock because I heard about the incredible factory trigger and reset.  Used it in a couple of three-gun type shots, on the indoor range, and shooting steel targets at the range.  In each case I found it well beyond my expectations (and abilities for that matter).

I made a small change to the foam in the hard case using an Exacto blade to make it so that I could carry two clips in case, one in gun, and the speed loader (see pics).  I have widened the holes on the carrying case so I could fit padlocks through the holes.  I have almost 1000 rounds through it and carefully cleaned and oiled it after each trip to the range."

This gun looks and feels great! The Enhanced model features upgraded grips, fiber-optic front sight, upgraded trigger, two 8-round magazines, and extra checkering on the slide and front strap. 
I have only fired around 400 rounds of ammunition through this gun. I bought it new earlier this year. It has always been treated well, cleaned immediately after range trips, etc. The only flaw you will see is the inevitable ""idiot"" scratch just under the slide catch. This is barely noticeable to the naked eye from a few feet away. 
This is my first 1911 and everything I hoped for. The pistol feels like a Cadillac and fires with precision. I would love to keep it but I acquired a few more toys so those less used need to go.

794,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2381794,For Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Washington, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 26, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 100 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W.
I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping. I will also be in Spokane for the holiday weekend and can meet there.

Previous owner had the slide and frame PROFESSIONALLY Ceracoated and installed a Wolff spring kit and custom carbon fiber grips. I added a touch of Hi-Viz paint to the front sight blade.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing.
I live in Puyallup, but I will be in Spokane this weekend for the holidays and can meet in the area if you are on the east side."

MSRP: $$529.00

Description
M620U-A
Compact and extremely powerful, the M620 Ultra Scout Light® uses a virtually failure-proof LED to produce 500 lumens of output, and it continues producing blinding tactical light for 1.5 hours on a set of batteries. This brilliant output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into a far-reaching beam with an intense 13,000-candela central area that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications.

The compact size of the M620 Ultra—under 5.5 inches long—minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights.

The M620 attaches to your firearm's Picatinny rail via an integral SureFire Swing-Lever™ clamp. The Swing-Lever clamp provides rapid, secure, rock-solid attachment — even to out-of-spec rails — by moving a single cammed lever, and it detaches just as quickly should the need arise.

The M620 Ultra comes with two switches: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; and (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing.

Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M620 Ultra is O-ring sealed to keep out the elements. Like all SureFire WeaponLights, the M600 Ultra is built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Tan.

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends).
Features

    High-performance, recoil-proof LED generates 500 lumens of blinding white light and continues producing tactical-level light for 1.5 hours
    Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens creates intense, versatile beam with enough reach for longer-range applications and significant surround light for peripheral vision
    Construction: Mil-Spec hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, optically coated tempered window, O-ring and gasket seals
    Ergonomic tactical switching: click-on/off tailcap and pressure-activated tape switch (both included)
    Integral Swing-Lever™ clamp attaches securely to Picatinny rails, even those that are out of spec
    Powered by two 123A lithium batteries (included) with 10-year shelf life"

 most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without
 the need for modification to the base gun.
ACP will accept most railed guns with barrels up to 5"" in length.

Description
M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black and Desert Tan.
