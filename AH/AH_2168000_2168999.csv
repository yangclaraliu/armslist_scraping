I am selling it with 2 40 rnd clips,  a 20 rnd clip,  sound suppressor, and a carry case plus 100 rounds high defense ammo .  This weapon (handgun) is the ultimate peace maker, I have run about 300 rounds through it, and the sheer speed and the fact it has never jammed, NOT ONCE, it empty's a mag of 40 in less than 30 sec.  I would say that will bring the peace to any situation.  I am going to hate to let this one go.  total package is worth over  750.00 but like I said I am looking to get a new toy so it is priced to move  quickly...............  text me at 4seven9806one6nine6"

This is a Yankee Hill Machine complete Specter Black Diamond upper on top of a YHM lower that includes a $230 Timney drop-in 3lb trigger group and $260 MagPul UBR stock that I‘ve upgraded with their $25 Aluminum Strike Plate and $20 Enhanced Rubber Buttpad. There’s also an ambidextrous selector and enhanced bolt release. The upper has a Young Manufacturing bolt carrier group (the best BCGs on the market) and Bravo Company Gunfighter charging handle. The MAID grip, AFG and multi-color XTM rail panels are all from MagPul and the BUIS are YHM’s low profile Q.D.S. sights.

The optic is a $765 1.25-4x24Trijicon TR21 AccuPoint. This Trijicon combines the best of ACOGs and zoom scopes. Like the ACOG, its dual-illuminated triangle aiming point glows at night from tritium, and during the day from the fiber-optic system. There is also a feature for dimming the fiber optic in really bright days. Advanced, multilayer coated optics permit excellent light transmission without parallax and the quick-focus eye-piece gives users rapid clarity adjustment. It also has a wider field of view and longer eye-relief that accommodates large caliber rifles and being mounted farther forward on flat top uppers. It’s mounted with a $100 Burris PEPR one piece mount.

Included with this package is the $200 Pelican 1700 case shown, $45 VTAC sling, 14 magazines and 640 rounds of fresh factory ammo. All but 4 of the magazines are brand new, one is a $50 Barrett that holds a full 30 rounds, three are 25 round $45 Precision Reflex, one is a 10 round $38 also by Precision Reflex, seven are cheaper 25 round and two are 10 round by C-Products. Each 25 round mag has a MagPul Ranger Plate installed. That’s over $360 in mags alone. For ammo there are 24 boxes of Hornady 110gr V-Max, three boxes of Double Tap 110gr Rifle Defense, three boxes of Remington 115gr HPBT. There is more than $800 in ammo here which saves you the trouble of hunting some down (if there is any actually available).

I have more than $2900 in the firearm and optics alone, another $360 in mags, $250 in the case and sling and $800 in ammo. That’s more than $4300 invested all together but I’ll take $3400 for everything. THE SCOPE HAS NOT BEEN ZEROED SO THAT WILL NEED TO BE DONE BY THE PURCHASER.

I have no interest in selling the ammo, optics or magazines alone, it goes as a package unless someone first purchases the AR by itself.

 You simply can not go somewhere and buy one of these like a lot of military collectibles
 I am relinquishing parts of my ww2 collection so that others may enjoy them.
 This is an alligator skinned leather photo album from the tours of the very first anti aircraft/anti tank unit that Germany created for world war two
 I Flak/Regt 5 
 Alligator skin/leather is in really good shape for it's age and you have to see it to appreciate it.It has a leather strip tied that is binding the pages to the album.Pages are in great shape and still have the onion paper dividers so the pictures don't stick together.
 I have all of the photos removed so they can be viewed without man handling the album it self.(almost 100 pictures)
 There were only six of these units created and they never existed before ww2.This was the very first unit created and remained in service the longest (unit created 10 January,1935 and remained in service until the end of the war in 1945)
http://www.ww2.dk/ground/flak/flargt5.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_corps 
 This album chronicles the units tours through the war.

 Some of the pictures are nicely captioned and dated and include pictures of bombed and burnt out vehicles,artillery,soldiers digging graves and trenches,the huge range finders they used and also a lot of candid shots of the soldiers smiling and having fun playing soccer in the dirt,stacks of wine bottles,playing music ,hanging out in their field tents,etc

 Anyway,i have decided to let this piece go.This is a must have for anybody who is a ww2 buff.Like I said before,this is simply not something you can go out and buy and there will NEVER be another one

 I have added a few pictures here but can take and email more although it would be best to meet and let you see it in person."

I will use a ffl dealer to make sure you pass a background check.

The nickel plating isn't perfection, but it is descent you won't be able to see the flaws in the pictures. The rifle was test fired by the factory, but I have not fired it.
The machining isn't as nice as a ruger.  
922r compliant rules apply if you are going to convert it.
It has the ablity to attach a scope mount to the rail on the side not pictured.
The nickel plating has caused the adjustable rear sight not to lock into position properly so
that will have to be worn in or replaced to function properly.

I purchased a new Sig Sauer 1911 Fastback. Put 50 rounds through it and then decided to do a custom build.

First things first:
Beaver Tail Safety and Main Spring Housing was blended into the frame. All hard edges were smoothed out slightly. Everything was coated with a custom Cerakote mix; Sniper Grey, Armor Black and a tiny bit of Titanium.
Grips are custom VZ ""Frag"" G10, Wilson Combat stainless grip screws.
Wilson Combat Internals.
Fusion Lightweight Adjustable stop trigger with polished bows.
This entire Sig was disassembled and rebuilt and has not been fired since it's completion. It was cycled a few 100 times to ensure feeding and extraction.
The barrel was polished as well as the barrel throat and feed ramp. Assembled using Mil-Comm grease.
It comes with TWO factory Sig Sauer 8 round magazines, case, manual and Sig Night Sights.
This started out as a $1000 Sig Sauer 1911 and was completely customized.

My price is OBO.

Free floated 18"" stainless steel match grade barrel by Green Mountain (high end competition barrel maker) with guaranteed MOA accurate, and a super slick new full length Keymod style rail system by Parallax Tactical. If you are not familiar with the Keymod system it is the latest in rail design developed by Noveske and VLTOR with the emphasis on eliminating the unnecessary weight and also the bulk of unneeded lengths of picatinny rails. It has a normal full length top rail with Keymod slots at the 3,6, and 9 o'clock positions. As an added benefit this particular rail also incorporates slots on all 4 of the 45 degree positions which are completely compatible with Magpul's MOE system and any MOE style mounts, rail sections, or accessories will mount directly to it, so it is really the best of both worlds. Also has a few built in QD points as well. Very slim with a total diameter of only 1.5 inches so it fits very comfortably in your hand. Mid-length gas system which has many benefits over the standard carbine length gas system. Mid-length gas systems run cleaner and cycle softer, creating not only a smoother shooting rifle that provides the shooter with the ability to stay on target better for faster follow up shots, but also means less recoil and less wear and tear on all internal components. Mid-lengths are the best, plain and simple.

It is set up for a scope (I no longer have the scope) and it also has a railed gas block added for use with a bipod, but I will include the original A2 front sight post with it as well in case you want it. Has had under 50 rounds run through it just to function test and sight in the scope that was on it. Comes with 1 Magpul 30 round PMAG.

tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.
Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using
fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional,
precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

Up for sale is my 18"" SPR-style mid-length upper. It has roughly 400 rounds through it. It is so incredibly accurate that you may find it disturbing! Easily puts 5 rounds under 1/2 inch at 100 yards using match ammo. I have made consecutive hits at 600 yards all within 4 inches of each other. 

Features:

DD 14"" Lite Rail ($400 new)
White Oak 18"" barrel with a .223 Wylde chamber ($275 new)
DD low profile gas block ($55 new)
Failzero Carrier ($125 new)
JP Enhanced Bolt ($118 new)
BCM Gunfighter Charging handle ($40 new)
Bushmaster Upper ($100 new)

Note: None of these prices include installation cost or shipping costs. The prices listed are the prices that I paid and are the same as what you would pay today for these parts online from MidwayUSA and similar distributors. New, this upper cost just over $1,100 to build in parts alone. Another $200 or so was spent on shipping and gunsmith services. 

Basically, you are saving $320 by letting me put the first 400 rounds through it. Not to mention the amount of time spent researching all of the individual components.

Please do not waste my time with low-balls. This is a high quality build with top-of-the-line components that is sure to please!

The Bushmaster C15 Carbines are a unique hybridization of traditional AR-15 type features with space-age Carbon 15 composite molded receivers for light weight and rugged durability. The Carbon 15's lightweight 14.5"" M4 profile barrel is made of chrome-lined chromemoly steel and includes an Izzy flash suppressor pinned and welded in place to achieve 16"" overall barrel length.
