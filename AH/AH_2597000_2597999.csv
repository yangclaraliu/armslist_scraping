The knife is large, sturdy and built for use with an improved push button lock that is 30% stronger than the original. The AFO 2 has an over-sized firing button for easy operation, even with gloves. The 154-CM stainless steel blade deploys quickly and the 6061 T-6 aluminum body is an ideal size for a rock-solid grip and now includes a steel glass breaker tip.

But due to a new addition to the family my priorities are clear.

If you recognize these two beauties you have probably seen me at a different gun shows in the Midwest.

My custom built saiga 12 and my Fnx tactical.

This is by far the best saiga 12 on this website bar none.
 saiga 12 I bought new off a guy 2 years ago. Stripped it down to bare parts. From then on I began researching the best saiga 12s around to see what I could do better or learn from. In two years time I managed to contact and get custom orders from every saiga 12 guru on the forums. Some of which no longer offer their services.
To start off
I ordered updated reliability parts from Carolina shooters to replace the factory puck, gas plug, and recoil system.
The recoil system is from JTE. Both factory spring have been replaced with tromix springs. Gas ports have been opened up to proper spec.
A recoil buffer was added to assist function.
The bolt carrier and bolt were shipped out to pauly steelin now retired. The best in the business when it comes to working internals for an platform based weapons.
He polished and reprofiled the bolt. The op rod was replaced with tom Coles heavy duty replacement built to handle any and all abuse. The trigger reworked to match trigger specs by pauly as well. The charging handle was welded on to a vertical piston style handle. Tromix firing pin installed.
The rail you see is a chaos titan rail. Extends all the way to the back. High quality. For add ons I have a combat spec light that also features a strobe and blue light filter. The optic you see is a eotech 512. Two mbus 2 flip up sights. On the right side a k-15 weapon laser. Built to handle the recoil of a full auto 30 cal. 
For the stock I have added a mako recoil reduction stock and recoil reduction buffer tube. You can shoot all day will very little should pain compared to shooting 00 buck and slugs with a regular shotgun. Aftermarket heavy duty trigger guard and magazine release extension. Safety extension. Rock n lock magwell attachment. Adjustable front grip. The last custom upgrade was a muzzle brake barrel shroud combination making muzzle flip extremely controllable and adds great looks to the weapon. Lastly and I'm sure I'm forgetting something on the saiga. Is the hand painted urban camo duracoat that took weeks to perfect. Saiga comes with 8 10 round stick mags. 1 12 round. 1 20 round drum. And 1 5 round. Include tons of ammo to get you started.

The fnx is a standard fnx tactical with the same paint job. Features 3 15 round 45 acp magazines with the same paint job

Comes with cases and bandoliers. Ammo cans and ammo.

If I get my goal price I will include my entire brand new reloading station for 45 acp. Never been used.

Thanks for your time and let me know if you have further questions. Selling as a complete package. Can send additional photos as needed.

Only trade offers will be 4 door all wheel sedans.

You can use these with rubber bands around your existing Sharpmaker stones for much, much quicker reprofiling.  Silicon carbide cuts wear resistant steels FAST.
These are also the perfect size to be attached to Edge Pro blanks, and are a MUCH cheaper option than the standard Edge Pro stones.
I used the 120, 240, and 400 on one knife and that's it, so they are barely used.  The 320 hasn't been used at all.  I'll sell all 8 stones for $25.  Pretty good deal considering one Edge Pro stone is $16 plus shipping.  I've upgraded to the Wicked Edge so I'm trying to pretty much give these away.

102,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2597102,"For Sale:  Ruger LCP - NIB - ENHANCED VERSION, with 375 rounds of ammo & pocket holster! Lowered package cost!","Western Burbs, Chicago, Illinois",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, January 27, 2014",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Up for private sale is a NIB – “New in Box” & never fired Ruger LCP, along with lots of ammo (you need to practice and you need to break in a new pistol, folks!).   I have dropped the package cost  to $475, WHICH IS FIRM (please don't waste my time or yours with a lower offer - thanks).  If it does not sell in a week or so, I will go ahead and keep it.

You are probably already familiar with the LCP, a gun the website thetruthaboutguns.com says: “is a masterpiece of pocket-carry mousegunnery.” They also note that “the LCP (Lightweight Compact Pistol) has single-handedly reinvigorated the pocket pistol genre.”  It is a great value, is reliable and this one is brand-spankin’ new and unfired.  Included is a pocket holster.

This is the recently enhanced version, with better trigger action, etc.

Besides researching the best value for a pocket pistol, I also took the time to look into ammo.  TTAG website rightly points out that .380 ammo is kind of hard to get at the moment.  As you know, it ain't cheap either!  That said, you would not be a responsible gun owner if you were unwilling to run some rounds through it!

I am including 250 rounds of Federal American Eagle 95 grain .380 target ammo and 125 rounds of THE BEST short-barrel self-defense ammo.  100 rounds of Precision One HP/XTP and 25 rounds of Fiocchi Extrema HP/XTP, ranked #1 and #2 for the combination of penetration and expansion.

Go to http://shootingthebull.net/blog/final-results-of-the-380-acp-ammo-quest/ to see the story and video.

You will learn about the testing done on a variety of commonly manufactured .380 ammo.  The usual suspects, like Hornady Critical Defense and Federal Hydra-Shok did not do nearly as well as the ammo noted above that scored the best.

Why am I selling?  My gal pal took one look at the gun and said there was no way she was going to shoot it!  So much for buying guns for xmas….and, I already have my carry guns.

I am pricing here simply to recoup most my costs in acquiring both the pistol and the ammo (my cost was $525).  You get the benefit of my research and a nice package of gun and ammo at a very decent price.

No special tools are needed to install the Key Hole/Dual Sided buffers. Make sure the firearm is unloaded! Step 1. Remove the receiver dust cover. Step 2. Take the recoil assembly out of the firearm. Step 3. insert the recoil assembly through the buffer. Step 4. Re-install the recoil assembly and Step 5. Replace the dust cover. Done! Less than 60 seconds to protect your investment. These are the only buffers that can be reversed to increase the life span of the buffer. Now you have 12 recoil buffers! Each side should give you protection for 500 to 750 rounds. Look at both photos you will see 6 buffers total.

This one was bought with 3 others in July this year. I have sold three of these in the last two months for $700 each that were new in box.

This has been my personal shooter since July and I have done a trigger adjustment  with replacement trigger spring(10oz), Recrown barrel, and have lapped and polished the bore with JB Cleaner and Polish.    

These are very good shooters for the money. It has been shot maybe 1500 rounds through the bore using both CCI Std Vel and SK Std Plus. I always weigh and seperate the CCI and in doing so it shoots nearly as well as SK Std Plus. 


UPDATE: Check the link to the Photobucket. The bumps are near gone with an application of Steam. I will be working on them further. Looks alot better now

As you can see the rifle has several bumps on the right hand side of the stock. There is a very light one vertical about 1"" long on the left side mid forearm. There is also a mark from a set screw on the top of the dovetail. It is from the wrong set of rings I first mounted.

There is a series of photos of the rifle in my Photobucket acct which you can view by copying and pasting the link below to your browser.

http://s872.photobucket.com/user/gotafish10/slideshow/Kimber%2014xx

This rifle considering the 20 I have seen and owned 5 of them is no worse than most. It does not have a gash in the stock which must be sanded out. But it does have some handling bumps in the wood that do not affect its shooting performance. But can be taken out with some effort using wet towels and a steam iron. 


Rifle includes everything that came with it from CMP (Rifle, Front and Rear sights, authentication letter, inspection certificate, packing box and shipping box)
Bolt and Rifle serial numbers match USGM0014xx.

I will transfer the rifles at this point, one of three ways. >>

I will ship to your FFL dealer if they will receive from an individual for actual shipping cost. If not then I will have the rifle shipped through my local FFL dealer. The fee depends on how much he charges me. Receiving FFL must provide copy of their FFL certificate prior to shipment..

I can legally ship person to person using USPS within the state of Florida ONLY. Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost. Cost within the state is $34 insured and priority 2nd Day.
Or I will do a FTF transfer in Sebastian, Florida. A copy Drivers License is required for instate transfer. Receiving FFL must provide copy of their FFL certificate.

The problem is the ""SHEAR"" stress, caused by the original design of the bolt. We can't change the design of the bolt's so we tried to work on the material used in the manufacture of the firing pins. We've made pin's from various kinds of steel including A2 tool steel. That did not work. We heat treated pin's to many different hardness's. That didn't work! We've made a batch out of Titanium. Much to our surprise....that batch broke even faster than the other pins. What we found is Titanium is very strong but it doesn't react well to ""shear"" stress.

Rifle as pictured $3,800 FIRM

Of course, due to Colorado's ridiculous new gun control laws, which were forced through by our moronic Democrat-controlled State House and Senate, I cannot transfer, give or sell you one of my 20-round PMags with the rifle, IF you live in the state of Colorado - out-of-state transfers (where legal) are okay. For Colorado residents, 10-round PMags are readily available at your local gun shop.

Buyers in a private sale must now pass Colorado CBI Background Check and the sale will be registered through a local FFL Dealer. Thank your Colorado State Legislature Democrats for that. 

Thanks for your interest."

Rifle was $725, (680 + tax), sling and case $50, ammo $270. Ammo was 6 @ $22 a box, 4 @ $35 each.  I'm $1045 invested.  Asking 900 cash firm or 950 trade. Ok with taking a little loss to be honest, but can't give it away. Can't bring myself to be like alot of others on here and charge you and extra $2 or $300 more than what I paid for it either. This is a good deal and you know it people. Here are Henry specs.

The base rifle is a Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD chambered in .308 Winchester. It originally came in a black Hogue overmold stock, but I have since replaced the stock with an cadex defense Chassis System This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it, and I am selling it simply because I don't have a place to shoot it to its maximum potential. Everything on this rifle is like-new.

I only run SSA 175 grain match through it. . I will also gladly provide more pictures of any aspect of the rifle to serious buyers, since Armslist only allows 3 pictures to be uploaded.

There are over $7500 in parts in this rifle.I am asking 6000 OBO. I may consider a trade for a FAL, SCAR 16, SCAR 17, H&K MR556, and LWRC AR or other high-end semi-auto rifle. .I would STRONGLY prefer cash, though. Make me an offer."

The sight picture the Tech-Sights give you is very similar to the sight picture of the Springield M1A and the AR-15 rifles.  Since these types of rifles are the ones many shooters use when shooting at full-distance, it just makes sense to use 10/22 sights that replicate the sights of their long-distance rifles.  Plus, they are easier to adjust than many other types of sights are. Includes one factory Ruger BX-25 magazine (25 round capacity). This rifle dates to 1989-90 and is in excellent condition. Metal trigger guard and barrel band unlike the plastic you see on current models. Standard 18"" tapered barrel with shiny bore and great rifling grooves.
