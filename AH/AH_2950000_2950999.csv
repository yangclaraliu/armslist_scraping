1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2950001,For Sale/Trade:  NICE LAPTOP - for gun or best cash offer,"Denton, Dallas, Texas",$ 350,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 16, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Nice HP Laptop. Has Windows 7, 8GB ram and a 500GB hd.  A good upgrade if you are getting rid of your XP.  I recommend trying out a computer with Windows 7 before you buy the giant mistake that is Windows 8.  Some people like it, but for the rest of us it just plain sucks. Anyway, this is a classy laptop with a backlit keyboard and sort of macbook-like design. Even has a fingerprint reader for added security.

Only issue it has is the battery is pretty much shot. Works fine plugged into a wall but if you're taking it on the go I recommend buying a new battery.

With it's ability to find a single silver dime at depths of 12 and even 14 inches, the Minelab Explorer XS became a must have detector for the serious metal detectorist. I have personally found Seated dimes at depths that I estimated to be 14 inches deep with one of these units. I purchased this detector off of Kenny Wray owner of Wray's Treasure Shop and a metal detectorist of over 40 years. He said that the owner of this detector only used it a few times and being an older fellow he thought that this unit was too complicated for him. The unit is in really nice,clean shape. Every function works on the detector and money back if it doesn't. This detector comes with standard battery pack, NiCad rechargeable battery pack with charger, car charger,Minelab headphones, coil stand, owner's manual, coil cover and fast start field guide. The only thing not here is the original box.  The LCD screen on this detector is flawless. The detector shows a little scuffing on the coil cover from normal use. I prefer to use the Minelab Explorer as a turn on and go machine. The only thing I change is the sensitivity setting. You simply push a button a few times to turn the sensitivity setting up for increased depth. You can also program this detector anyway you like. There are several books written on this subject. Please email any questions. Thanks! paid 1300.00"

(Sound Of Madness) muzzle brake. We've always had specific goals in mind and would not accept anything less. 


Remove muzzle flip and lower felt recoil. 


Minimize grouping size due to less shot anticipation. 


Decrease shot split time by keeping your sights on target.

Engineering of the Rifenbark Armory Muzzle Brake: This is a ducted port muzzle brake that is calibrated to remove barrel rise and keep your sights on target.  The directional top ports are angled to provide compensation to the rising rotary force of muzzle climb. The 'valve cover' ports form a directional jet of gases as opposed to the typical plume you see in most muzzle brakes. Once muzzle rise on the S.O.M. (Sound of Madness) was controlled we began to remove felt recoil.  We accomplished this by incorporating characterized interruptions at specific locations in the side ports. These unify side to side forces as the bulk of the gases are dumped perpendicular to the axis of fire.  These features allow a precise amount of gas to release through the top ports (keeping the muzzle flat) while gases are re-directed out of the side baffles to prevent excessive felt recoil.

The upper is from PSA, with a 1:7 twist, 16"" barrel with an A2 flash hider. It has a phosphate finish and is chrome lined, chambered for 5.56. I put Magpul MOE handguards on it with a Magpul vertical grip. The BCG is from AIM surplus, and is HPT and MPI tested, and I believe they offer a lifetime warranty. The optic is a Vortex Strikefire red/green dot.

It has a blem Aero Precision lower with PSA lower parts and buffer tube kit (I have a picture of the only blemish I could find on it, and it's nothing too crazy, I can email it to you). Has a Magpul trigger guard, Magpul MOE pistol grip, and a Magpul CTR 6 position stock. 

Like I said above, the only part on this rifle that isn't brand new is the trigger, and I can put a new one in if you'd prefer. To top it all off, the rifle will come with 4 brand new PMags in OD green, and 120 rounds of Federal American Eagle on stripper clips. 

The whole package is $750 firm. If it's not sold before the weekend, I'm going to keep it as I have a shooting trip planned for Saturday. No trades, sorry.

   Looking to sell one of my AR-15s. I finished the build on this one last month and have never shot it, I just have other projects I'd rather put the money in (plus I already have other ARs that don't get shot enough as it is). All the furniture is OD green Magpul stuff. Everything on it is brand new except the trigger; it has an ALG Defense QMS trigger that I took out of another rifle. It has about 300 rounds on the trigger/hammer, but I can put a brand new mil spec one in if you'd like, although the ALG one is better. 

        The upper is from PSA, with a 1:7 twist, 16"" barrel with an A2 flash hider. It has a phosphate finish and is chrome lined, chambered for 5.56. I put Magpul MOE handguards on it with a Magpul vertical grip. The BCG is from AIM surplus, and is HPT and MPI tested, and I believe they offer a lifetime warranty. The optic is a Vortex Strikefire red/green dot.

        It has a blem Aero Precision lower with PSA lower parts and buffer tube kit (I have a picture of the only blemish I could find on it, and it's nothing too crazy, I can email it to you). Has a Magpul trigger guard, Magpul MOE pistol grip, and a Magpul CTR 6 position stock. 

Like I said above, the only part on this rifle that isn't brand new is the trigger, and I can put a new one in if you'd prefer. To top it all off, the rifle will come with 4 brand new PMags in OD green, and 120 rounds of Federal American Eagle on stripper clips. 

         The whole package is $750 firm. If it's not sold before the weekend, I'm going to keep it as I have a shooting day planned for Saturday. No trades, sorry. If interested, send me an email through Armslist or text me anytime at  and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for looking!"

Ill be honest this is not in good condition but the pump, and trigger cycle and function.  It has a fairly clean boar, and I fully believe it is salvageable.  There is lots of surface rust, and the wood is in fair condition.  This is a rare gun and hard to find parts for.  It is missing the bolt. If you have or can find a bold for it you will have a very cool pump action .22 From my research I believe it was manufactured by Remington for Ranger arms in TX some time in the 70's but I might be wrong.

All of this for a nice gun. I do not own one piece of cheap electronics and can get up to twelve hundred more dollars for the right weapon. But I don't want to and need the rest of my money for other things, but when and if push comes to shove, I can offer $1400.00 of my money that I need for far more important things and the weapon is for a concealed weapon license to protect my father who was given two years to live a year and a half ago. One blow to his chest and he's dead. Point is, I want to keep him alive a lot longer than two years. I don't want your sympathy. I want this gun to protect my father and keep him alive two or much longer than that. So if you see something you want or must have, we can trade even up or I might add cash if your gun is worth it. Thanks.

Call, text or e-mail me. Just be quick. I need a new gun sooner than later to protect his well-being and livelihood:

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million
produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the
Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is
famous for its lightweight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. The
Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished Grade I Walnut stock,
blued barrel and receiver, large loop lever, Marble front sight, adjustable
rear sight and a 20"" button-rifled barrel with recessed crown. The steel
contoured carbine strap buttplate is quick to shoulder and protects
buttstock from damage.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Photos show genuine factory Smith & Wesson Magazines for the M&P .45 Smith & Wesson Pistols chambered in the venerable .45 ACP caliber. The M&P Pistols haven’t been in service long enough for us to get many of them or their magazines, but we do frequently trade with other dealers; and we trade and buy from police officers and our customers throughout the country. The photo specimens came from a 5 year tour of duty with the Distinguished Officers of the Agawam MA Police Department. Construction is serrated body matte stainless steel with black polymer floorplate and followers. These will work in any Smith & Wesson M&P 45 Pistol; these fit flush on service size variants but will protrude a bit on the Compact Variants. This magazine holds 10 rounds of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. These magazines themselves show the most significant of Smith & Wesson’s improvement upon Gaston Glock’s design; these magazines hold together, free-fall eject, and always lock the slide open just like they’re supposed to, something that cannot be said for Glock pistols and their magazines, admirable though they are. Surface wear on these comes more from carry in unlined leather magazine cases than from insertion and ejection. We estimate each one has been fired 300 times during annual qualification. We rate them as Very Good, but photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Our single mag onesy twosy price is $39.00. We’re offering the magazines in the photos, however, or their substantially identical mates from the same Department, in lots of 3 or more at $29 each. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.

I am wanting to buy a smith and wesson 3rd generation semi auto (5906, 4006, 5946, etc) in stainless steel. I love these guns and carried one issued to me as a police officer. Some police officers and depts still allow this tank of a gun to be carried. I owned one but due to hard times after I lost my job I had to sell it. Now times are better and I WANT ONE. Used  or semi new (please just make sure your not selling junk) doesn't matter. Looking to spend between $300-500 for a used one. These are no longer in production so I am unable to find one but thought I would try here. Please contact me if you are going to sell and leave me your information. Would prefer in 9mm but not too picky. It would also be great if you have the box and a magazine or two. DA/SA please."

Restrictions apply on high capacity magazines in many jurisdictions of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE Magazines; winning buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Most of the SW-99’s we’ve had in the past year served briefly in the States of Nevada or North Carolina. In the past few years, Smith & Wesson cranked up production and vigorous marketing of its new M&P Series of Autos, so several of the 99s have been traded in along with their magazines. The Ones we had stayed in service for fewer than four years, and we assume these are some of their magazines, manufactured shortly before the Brady Ban expired on the Federal Level; and since they are 12 round capacity, they had to be marked Restricted Law Enforcement during their year of manufacture, 2004. Another marking is even more important. Each magazine reads Mec Gar USA Meriden CT, and that puts these factory S&W Magazines in the class with all the best magazines in the world. Mec Gar is the principal magazine supplier for Beretta, Browning, Kel-Tec, and Sig Arms, and wisely so. Their magazines are solid steel construction, superior springs, followers and floorplates. They free-fall eject like they’re supposed to; they lock the slide open when they’re dry like they’re supposed to, and most important, they work reliably. Wear indications are negligible on these magazines, all of them are in excellent condition, and the photo specimens come from the same batch. Some of them have minimal amounts of carbon blacking on their red followers. These will fit standard size Smith & Wesson models 99, 990, 990L, and the Walthers in the same caliber with full grip frame. They will also fit the identical descendant currently being marketed by Magnum Research, the Desert Eagle Fast Action 40. S&W Product Code is 193580000, and they are no longer listed on the factory store page at S&W dot com. These are well maintained, clean, strong magazines. Replacement pricing on new Ones, if a person can even find One, usually runs $50 apiece. Our Single Mag onesy twosy price is $33. We’re offering these fine magazines, however, the Ones in the photos or their identical mates from the same batch, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, D.C., Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 11 round or higher magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement. No shipments to Maryland Civilians after 9/15/13.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact

will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are factory Walther Magazines to fit the popular SW99 Pistols that are a joint effort of Smith & Wesson and Walther. They are also identical to magazines issued in Walther models 990 and 990-L; and more recently in the Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action pistols chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson Caliber. Each magazine is actually manufactured by Mec-Gar of Italy and so marked; and that puts these factory Walther and S&W Magazines in the class with all the best magazines in the world. Importer on these was Walther Arms, a recently divested arm of Smith & Wesson. The reason we got these at a good price is, that the Smith & Wesson wing in Springfield MA and Houlton ME is giving way to Walther USA in Fort Smith AR. Manufacturer Mec Gar is the principal magazine supplier for Beretta, Browning, Kel-Tec, and Sig Arms, and wisely so. Their magazines are solid steel construction, superior springs, followers and floorplates. They free-fall eject like they’re supposed to; they lock the slide open when they’re dry like they’re supposed to, and most important, they work reliably. Construction is smooth finished blue steel bodies with steel springs. Cartridge followers are high impact black, red, or blue polymer, with slightly extended black polymer floorplates so that each magazine holds only 10 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson or .357 Sig caliber ammunition, down only two rounds from standard issue magazines for the SW99 and its counterparts and competitors. Smith & Wesson Factory number is 19279; Walther number is 2796503; and Magnum Research number is FA4010. Some magazines may have the Smith & Wesson name on them, but they are the exact same magazine, whether they bear a Walther Banner or S&W logo. Buyers in areas where they are permitted may take four excellent condition Smith & Wesson number 19358 standard twelve rounder magazines for the same price as three of these tens. We have the regulations for that posted on our me page. Single mag onesy twosy price on the ten rounders is $39 per. We’re offering them, however, in lots of 3 at only $33 each. Own 3 for only $ 99.00. . Not for sale to residents of New York City.

Restrictions apply for higher capacity magazines like these in some parts of the U.S., so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. These are 11 shot Ban Period, factory S&W Magazines for the Smith & Wesson 4000 type metal frame pistols in .40 S&W caliber, including the standard 4003 4004 4006  4026 4043 4044 and 4046. These magazines also fit the Kel-Tec P-40 Pistols. Construction is stainless steel body, with high impact  polymer cartridge followers and black floorplates. About one in four have a finger rest floorplate, but we sell them like we got them, all in a big Smith & Wesson box, mixed. These will not fit the small single-stacked 4013 type pistols. We estimate these magazines were manufactured between 2002 and 2005; marking on right side forward area reads Accu Guide TM / Pat. 5014456; on most of these, front of mag is marked Smith & Wesson, Springfield MA / Restricted: Export, Law Enforcement / And Government Use Only, SN# 9xxxx. Marking, of course, was required until the Federal Ban sunset in late 2004. A few magazines from this lot, mostly from Atlanta Police Department, have Yellow Followers. These magazines are in Very Good condition, probably even Excellent condition, and relabeled with Smith & Wesson bar codes. Most of these magazines have moderate carbon deposits on their blue polymer followers and moderate amounts of insertion and ejection scuffing on their stainless steel bodies. Photos show the actual magazines we have from this lot. Replacement pricing on these factory magazines is upwards of $50 per unit, and they aren’t easy to find locally. Single Mag price is $29.00 per. We’re offering these fine factory Smith & Wesson Magazines, however,  in lots of 3 for only $19 each. Own 3	for only	$ 57.00.

 This is a truly unique and collectable piece. Made in the '90s, this is a fully legal, ATF approved ""Pen Gun"". This gun was allowed by the ATF because it has to be converted to a ""Gun Shape"" in order to fire it.

 This is a one shot gun that even has a safety to prevent it from firing prematurely. Machined entirely from stainless steel bar-stock, this is a remarkably solid, well made and durable gun.

 It come complete with two barrels. One for .25 ACP and one for .17 HMR. The barrel includes the chamber for the round.

 These were only made from about 1992 to about 1997. They were revived from about 2002 to 2004. Since then there have not been any new guns made. 

 This is an incredibly well made and fun gun to shoot.

 We are asking $395 for the Stinger complete with both barrels and the soft case you see in the pics.

NO NYC. This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Photo shows representatives of a specialty Smith & Wesson magazine for a specialty, briefly produced pistol, the 4013 TSW Compacts. These .40 caliber pistols had the same size grip frame as the highly popular 6900 series pistols. These magazines are labeled with part number S&WU4053MGR, indicating their trade-in status to Smith & Wesson. Manufacturer is Accu-Guide, Smith & Wesson’s primary subcontractor for metal frame semi-automatics. Construction is stainless steel body, steel spring, blue polymer cartridge follower, and red polymer finger rest type floor plate. The reason these magazines have red floorplates is that some larger departments request that for the benefit of their range and training officers. For any shoppers who might be concerned about the aesthetics of a red floorplate, we have included photos of one on a California Department of Corrections 6906 Grip Frame. As the photos show, it looks every bit as good as red toenails on a beautiful woman. Each magazine holds 9 rounds of .40 S&W caliber ammunition. All of them are in Very Good to Excellent Condition, excellent mechanically. Insertion and ejection scouring is minimal, same way with carbon deposits on the followers. They will fit models 4013TSW and also the 4056TSW. They WILL NOT FIT models 4043TSW, or the 4053TSW, or the standard 4013, because the 4043 is the same as the full size 4000 series, and the standard 4013 is a single-stack pistol with a 4513 size frame. These are .790 wide, so the pistol’s magazine well, or grip frame interior, should accommodate that. Since these magazines are 9 round capacity, so they are legal in all 50 states. Please understand that we nor anyone else guarantees any magazine, new or used, to lock the slide back on the last shot all the time, and that is not a legitimate reason for a return. Replacement pricing, if a person can even find these, is $50 apiece or more. We're offering these, however, the Ones in the photo or their identical mates, each for only $ 29.00. Not for sale to destinations within New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Asking $1200 for the whole package, not really interested in trades, no lowballs.  I can accept PAYPAL. I am willing to sell separately. This is my pricing:

Bushmaster 5.56 Gas piston A2 upper - $600  this is not a retrofit, it is a factory fitted upper that I purchased through Midway( a respected online retailer). It has a Trijicon night sight front post(2yrs old).  Plus 2 MAGPUL mags. A fair asking price.

Plus 2 mags. A fair asking price.

Bushmaster mil-spec lower assembly with Ergo grip and ACE skeleton A2 stock upgrade - NOT FOR SALE SEPARATELY will only be sold as complete gun. But I consider the value to be $175.  So if you buy the 5.56 upper as a gun separately it would be $775, the 7.62 would be $675.

Comes with two 5 round magazines and three different chokes.  The controls are pretty much the same as an AR-15.  So it's very comfortable and familiar to operate.  Perfect condition.
