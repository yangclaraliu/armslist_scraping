I have a Judge Pistol and loved the way it shot and what you can do with it.  I bought the Circuit Judge because I loved My Judge Pistol so much but just never got around to shooting this rifle and it's been setting unused only to come out on occasion to show it off.    

I never filled out the Davidson Guarantee Card so I think that means you can register it as the original owner and get their lifetime warranty on it.  When was the last time you saw one of these for sale???  I am asking $675 for this rile and I will include a box of 410 shells.  This is an absolutely new rifle and it's polished stainless steel.  I will consider trades but will only value a trade for what it will actually sell for less 10 to 20% for me taking the time to sell it.  That means if you have a pistol worth $500 in real money I'm going to give you between $400 and $450 for it not $700.  If it's worth $700, you sell it and then you get to keep the extra money...  I'm not looking to be difficult or snotty I'm just not interested in selling your stuff and taking my time for nothing,  So cash is King here but I will work with you.

The Circuit Judge delivers amazing versatility, accuracy and simplicity.

this  is  great 30-06 rifle  very smooth bolt action holds 4 rounds & 1 in  chamber. shot 16 rounds through it. great deer gun.
and a pro fire trigger system. The Pro-Fire trigger system has an articulating trigger-release lever that moves through a slot in the trigger bow and will not allow the trigger rearward until it is depressed. Parts are housed in an alloy casting, and sear engagement and overtravel are preset by the component’s geometry. Pull weight is adjusted by first loosening a jam nut on a threaded set screw protruding from the front of the housing and then turning the set screw either in or out with an Allen-head wrench.

Turning the set screw in will increase the pull weight, and turning the set screw out reduces the pull weight. The pull weight ranges from can-hardly-make-it-go-off heavy to 2 1/2 pounds, where the unit bottoms out. Triggers come from the factory preset at 3 1/2 pounds.
It has never been used  other than zero in scope.  its the smoothest bolt action I have shot.

In perfect condition and used only a couple of times they are identical to a brand new version. They are made of steel with a no tilt follower and a high power magazine spring to ensure amazingly reliable feeding. Because they are made of steel instead of aluminum or polymer they are also much more durable than any of the other magazines available, no matter how hard you use them they will keep on working. They also have a darker black coloring than the typical grey aluminum versions, so they will match most black colored AT-15 lower receivers much more closely. They can still be taken apart for cleaning and repair the same way most other magazines are so they are not overly complicated. These magazines usually sell for about $50 each, but I am offering you 2 of them in perfect mint condition for $80.

It also has a belt clip on the back. The knife is in great condition with no cosmetic blemishes, and the blade edges are both still razor sharp. The double action also works perfectly and the springs are clearly still extremely strong. I have tried other OTF knives and without question this is the best one available. Its sturdy construction along with its sleek styling and its amazing build quality all add up to one of my favorite knives ever. So much so that I ended up buying two of them... and now I have decided to sell one. These knives sell for about $550 or more in most places, I am offering mine for $475.

About the Handgun:
This is Sphinx's offering into the sub-compact, blowback, semi-automatic arena. Slightly smaller in general overall dimension than the Walther PPK/S, it also has a larger magazine capacity. Tolerances on this pistol are very tight and quality very high, as with all SPHINX pistols. 
About the Manufacturer:
This is a Swiss based manufacturer of high quality pistols used mainly by special forces, elite police units and sports shooters. This machine-tool and engineering company started in the gunmaking business when it acquired gunmaker ITM of Solothurn in 1989, along with the rights to its handgun designs. Sphinx is best known for its ongoing development of the original Czech designed CZ 75 pistol, which has been evolved into the Sphinx 2000 and Sphinx 3000 designs. Sphinx pistols are not mass produced and are fitted to tight tolerances, so Sphinx pistols are more expensive than mass produced products. 
About the Cartridge:
Designed by John Browning and introduced by Fabrique Nationale of Belgium, this cartridge has achieved world-wide acceptance and has even been adopted as the standard pistol cartridge by several governments. One reason for the round's success is that it is the largest practical cartridge that can be easily adapted to small automatic pocket pistols. Ballistics fall far short of even the 9mm Luger, but still prove adequate for most self-defense situations. The round has established quite a niche position in this role, often being chosen over more traditional small calibers such as the .25 and .32 Autos.

I'll save you some time on google. in this condition stock these are $350-425 guns however you are about to find out this one is anything but stock. This .45 is based off and resembles the colt 1911 however is not a clone. No grip safety and some parts are different. The parts that are in common are the barrel, link guide and spring, bushing and the magazine. All of which have been replaced and upgraded with superior quality parts. These include a colt mil spec barrel part number 7791193, ED Brown stainless 2 pc. guide rod, ED brown stainless bushing and recoil spring and a McCormick ""shooting star"" 8rd mag. The parts that are not shared with the colt are obtainable via the web. This gun is all steel and will be still around in another 75 years (the serial numbers which all match put it in 1944-45 year production) and function just as it does now. The slide is smooth and affirmative, unlike some modern Far eastern imports. The ejection port has been lowered and scalloped (popular on high end 1911's to enhance ejection and ensure optimal reliability) the work being well done and tasteful. I bought this as a project and now its time for me to move on. The only thing it could use is a more modern set of grips which are available reasonably from a number of retailers. I obtained this gun legally and i will sell it the same way. I have my CCW and if you wish to purchase you should too or at least a pistol purchase permit. If you feel like sending a low-ball offer save your time as I will tell you to stick with your hi-point. I will not entertain trade offers of any sort. I do not NEED to sell this piece as I carry it routinely and enjoy it. This is ideal for someone who wants a simple .45 that is quality and they don't have to worry about spending money on upgrades as it is already done. I meet in Asheville no where else nor will I ship. I will post a picture, if you want more and your genuinely serious you'll meet me to see it firsthand. Bring a permit and your NCDL, otherwise don't waste my time."

I consistently shot expert in the military, and recently got my Appleseed rifleman patch (using an AK action), so I'm thinking it's not operator error. Tried zero it in at 25m and 100m. The 25m looked like a shotgun, the 100m looked like a blindfolded shotgun. Bore looks good. I have no idea what is going on with it, therefor I'm calling it a ""gunsmith special"". Here are the particulars: 

-Front sight was moved back to expose the factory threads, but reinstalled canted. A thread adapter was installed over the factory threads to accept an AK74-type brake. I have no clue what the thread pitch is. It is held in place by a set screw. 
-Wood handguards and buttstock. Handguard conversion looks Dinzag. Buttstock is missing the sling loop attachment. Cleaning kit in buttstock. Grip is plastic/bakelite. 
-Even the rear sight seems a bit canted. I have to keep it up on the 300m/25m zero setting for a clear picture. 
-Reciever has a scope rail, but a set screw keeping a trigger pin from walking out prevents mounting. Trigger group is Tapco. 
-Comes with 1 ten round factory magazine, 1 twenty round Surefire, and 4 twenty-five round Surefires. 

It is a project, beater, or bubba rifle, take your pic. If you have the patience to clean it up, more power to ya.

The rest of the components in the lower were from a PSA build kit. The upper alone cost me $800.

The upper was ordered from Lancer Systems and it includes a low-profile gas block under their LCH rifle length carbon fiber handguard. Lancer systems is big with the 3-Gun crowd for their light weight and ability to mount accessories anywhere along the length of the handguard and every 45 degrees around. Thanks to the light weight of the upper this carbine weighs a bit less than 6.5 lbs. with the empty magazine installed. Included is 1 FDE MagPul PMAG with Ranger floorplate installed.

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with a 13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21 pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles.

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

I also have a box full of unopened brand spanking new knives (stiletto style, very very durable, still wrapped in plastic in their original boxes), if you want that then we can work something out, you can sell them at gun shows for 7 bucks each and they WILL sell.

my price is firm, only because that is the price of what I bought item 4, 5, and 6 for. if you go to gun shows I know you can sell what you don't keep and flip it.
