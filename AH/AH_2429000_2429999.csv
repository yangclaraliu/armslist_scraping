The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-auto pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense borrowing features from the M9 & 92, and is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for on and off duty law enforcement, private security forces, and responsible citizens. The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Like the M9 and 92, the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way-only fit for ease of mind. Ambidextrous de-cocking and a positive thumb safety prevents unintentional discharge if the gun is dropped and a non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

Consider the RUGER LC9 NRA is a Special Edition, double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull for your next concealed carry firearm. Slightly larger than the ever-popular LCP, the control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. For peace of mind, a loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication of a chambered round, as well as internal, manual, & magazine safeties. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. With its unique Natural Gear Camouflage frame, this Limited Edition LC9 totes a NRA prefixed serial number and provides a donation to the National Rifle Association with each purchase. It also comes with a lifetime repair or replacement warrantee as well as a custom Ruger carrying pouch to protect your “concealed” investment.

“THE JUDGE – Public Defender”; What more needs to be said!?! The newest version of the Judge might just revolutionize small frame revolvers. The Model 4510 delivers the same devastating firepower in a new scaled-down size that can travel with you. The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). Available in a carbon steel or stainless steel frame and with the option of a Titanium cylinder, the new Public Defender also features a reduced profile hammer that won't catch when it needs to come out quickly.

It was my CCW gun last winter so it has been shot very little, mostly just carried. It's not shown in the picture, but this comes in the original box with all paperwork, 2 mags and and a finger extension baseplate for the spare mag. The big update to this gun is that it has the APEX M&P DUTY/CARRY ACTION ENHANCEMENT KIT (DCAEK) from APEX Tactical (https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid35.html) which takes all the grittiness out of the factory trigger and lowers the pull to 5 lbs with reduced pre/over travel. This kit goes for $100 and is installed and included in the price above. The APEX kit improved function and accuracy so well that I installed it in all 3 of my M&P pistols. The original parts are also included so it could be changed back to factory if desired.

Text Jake at REDACTED if interested. I may be willing to return the pistol to factory parts and sell at a reduced price, but would rather sell as is."

Why settle for second when you can OWN THE BEST!?! The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). A long-standing tool for defense that has passed the test of quality.

I decided to sell the gun and scope separate and someone informed me that the scope was counterfeit. 
  I called Leupold and spoke with a tech. He said it is sadly true. Here are the keys to look for, the most used serial number on fakes is 8888SC, also on the turret cover it will have the Leupold ""L"" is printed on it. On real Leupolds there is a 6 digit serial number with a single letter, and it will have a small brass Leupold medallion set in the turret cover. 
   He aslo stated that most of these are coming from pawn shops and eBay. 
Please pass this info along to anyone you know. Personally Im going to take mine to gun shows and put it on the table to show people the difference, and what a $1000 mistake looks like.

Short Description: 	Beretta JS92F500 92 FS Inox 9mm 4.9"" 15+1 Blk Syn Grip Inox Stainless
Detailed Description: 	The 92 series of semi-automatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system with a safe and time-proven double/single action. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance and a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The open slide design virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the chamber to be loaded one cartridge at a time. The attached disassembly latch simplifies field stripping. The user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. The external hammer design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer, and provides immediate indication of cocked/uncocked status. Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. These Inox models have a stainless steel slide and barrel with an exceptionally corrosion-resistant and durable gray-anodized frame to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The other metal parts (trigger, hammer, safety, magazine, etc.) are black finished.

Hi-Point model 995 carbine is produced in USA. Reliable for purposes of training, plinking and self-defense, and can be fired with reasonable accuracy out to 100-150 meters, especially if optical or red-dot sight is used. Its appearance is in the standard configuration, but it can be upgraded with after-market polymer stocks manufactured by ATI in USA. 

Hi-Point model 995 carbine is blow back-operated weapon which fires from closed bolt. Receiver is made from aluminum alloy, with stock (pistol grip, butt and forearm) being made from polymer. Bolt is of wrap-around type, with most of its weight being placed around the breech of the barrel. Cocking handle is located on the left side of the gun, ejection is to the right side only. There is no bolt hold-open device, but bolt can be manually locked back by pushing the cocking handle inwards once it is pulled all the way to the rear. Manual safety is located on the left side of the gun, above the grip. Magazines are inserted into pistol grip; (compatible with Hi-Point in respective calibers) can be used. Magazine release button is located at the base of the trigger guard. Standard sights are of open type, adjustable for range and windage. Optional Picatinny rail can be installed instead of the rear sight base; this will accept any compatible sighting device (a red-dot sight is a preferred type for pistol-caliber carbines). No rear sights are mounted on this Rifle."

MATHEW'S CRAZE 
Bought this bow brand new about a year ago just didn't get into it like I wonted to. I'm a nursing student and time to hunt is rare. It has everything you need already on it. Weight can go up to 70 and draw can go from 19-30. It's quiet. Would be a good Christmas present. I've waxed it everytime I've shot it or it's been in its hard case. Looks just like the day I bought it.

MADE IN AMERICA!!! There is no other way to ensure such a high level of quality. Kimber is the most popular 1911 pistol in the world, a family with twenty one models in four calibers, whose quality is unequaled with accuracy and dependability right out of the box. The STANDARD is now the Custom II. It incorporates the Kimber Firing Pin Safety that makes each pistol more secure without impeding performance or altering trigger pull. As with all Kimber pistols, standard features set Customs apart from other brands: Match grade dimensions for barrels, bushings, chambers and triggers, ejection ports that are lowered and flared, dovetails mounted sights, extended thumb safeties, and the list goes on. The LAPD SWAT Team carries the KIMBER 1911, as do United States Marines, thousands of law enforcement officers, and hundreds of thousands of American shooters who refuse to compromise on quality.

I got $904 invested Glock 23 cost me 545.00 $33 tax, $210 for laser sight 2 $40 holsters = $80 extra mag $36 holsters extra mag and Crimson Trace Laser Grips, so some total cost me $904 and it been in a secure box 3 years fired 200 rounds 3 years ago never holstered or carried its a new gun I gave the box away price is a steal at $695. ($209) less than I paid out in cash.Sell I $695 cash to legal Florida buyer.

The quality and craftsmanship of the rifle is very nice, comparable in my opinion with a military-grade Garand or M14/M1A; MUCH better than any SKS or AK-47.  Finish is almost 100%, and the stock is nice, with a few small scratches and dings normal to an off-the-rack military surplus firearm.  It's a heavy arm, very well made, and has provisions for an adjustable grenade launcher just behind the flash hider.  It was quite fun to shoot as well!  Very easy to break down  to clean, and easy to put back together.

Comes with the stock sling and one factory 10-round detachable box magazine.

The CPX was created to provide a high-quality alternative to other brand name firearms without the high cost to the buyer, and is now expanding its line with the CPX GEN 2, to incorporate other markets as well. With benchmarked success of over 45,000 firearms produced to date, SCCY continues to grow and share in the concealed carry market.

Ruger’s newest addition, the SR45 pistol is perfectly sized to be comfortable and controllable with slim, ergonomic grips and narrow slide. A short reach from the backstrap to the trigger creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. It’s structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and stainless steel slide combine to create low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handgun. A unique reversible backstrap (flat or arched) allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools. High-visibility 3-dot night sight system features a raked-forward front sight for easy removal from the holster. Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. Integral Picatinny rail for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. The SR45 is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. This is a great home defense or concealed carry gun and it is California approved.

The popularity and success of the Sweet Sixteen from 1937 through 1947 earned it a permanent place in Browning marketing as the 1948 engraved “Sweet Sixteen.” 1947 is also the only year the 3 shot 2 ¾ 16ga was marketed in the USA. Getting one of these extremely rare original factory issued guns at a standard gun price is a trophy in itself.
