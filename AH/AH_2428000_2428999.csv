This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

3050 fps - Kimber 8400 Montana, 24 inch barrel
2970 fps - Winchester All Terrain (circa 1995), 22 inch barrel

***H&K MP5 A5 .22LR 25rd Magazine***
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5.

I bought two if these while assembling a lower because I have had poor experiences from other LPK's (parts missing). The one I installed was complete and is VERY nice. Trigger is about 5.5 lbs, very smooth, little take-up, and a nice, crisp reset! The safety selector is crisp and positive and the quality of the parts appears to be very nice. The springs, pin, and FCG look to be on par with any of the high-end parts kits that are $80. Keep in mind, this is the review of the parts kit I installed, the kit you will receive is new. I does appear that everything is there, but if there are any issues, PSA has outstanding customer service from what I am hearing. This is NOT their P-TAC series parts kit, which is of lower quality... I have compared them side by side, and there is a noticeable difference in the finish and quality of parts! This exact parts kit is on sale for $60 on there site now, normally $70... I am asking $50. I paid $60 +shipping; you are saving $30 from what you would normally pay!

For trade I have the following:

Norinco Sporter SKS: Equipped with Tapco synthetic stock, top rail for scope/sight, 3 30rd Magazines, Stock 10rd Magazine. Mags are all steel. Also includes the original wood parts, original sling and oil w/ bottle. Gun fires great, really reliable and eats anything. Lightly used (occasionally).

Remington 870 Express Tactical: I have only shot this twice, probably a total of 10 shells fired out of this beautiful synthetic 12 gauge shotgun. Shoots really well, feels good to shoot. This is one of the most popular shotguns (along with Mossberg 500) and there are tons of things you can do to this thing.

I'm primarily looking to trade the SKS for an AK or another AR or something. The Remington 870 is more to add more value on my side if needed.

I can throw some cash into the deal if needed, or it could go the other way with the cash too."

I have a Patriot muzzleloader that is in very good condition (see pictures) and I am also including all of the loading supplies shown. In addition, I have 600 - 650 cast bullets for the pistol, that I am including.
I have had the gun for about 15 years, and never had space to fire it more than once. I do not see any rust or corrosion on the gun, but I do not have a bore light. When I cleaned the barrel, the rag came through without any dirt or rust on it.

The only blemish is a small ding on the handle where the gun bumped into something. There is no cracking of the wood that I can see anywhere, the grip is in excellent condition.
The bullets are cast with an antimony alloy, so they are not completely soft lead.
Please ask me any questions you may have.

While I am willing to ship, the weight of the bullets will make that expensive. Prefer to do the sale through a gun store so both of us feel comfortable."

I love this gun, its a great collector and shooter, very clean no claw/scope marks on receiver, but unfortunately with the recent passing of my father I've got an excess of bills to deal with in the handling of his estate, so she must go. I paid $2200 back in 2000 for this, then upgraded the mag release and added the stock extension (I'm a big guy needed the extra length) and bipod. Everything I have for it is included, hopefully she'll find a new loving home. I haven't shot more than four magazines through it, but I bought it used and it probably had a few hundred rounds through it before it came to me. I believe this came from a sell off from a Montana PD originally, me & three other friends each got one, though mine is the only one with the ""longer"" style flash suppressor (you can see the short style on other HK93's for sale around the net) to make up for the shorter LEO barrel - but that's about all the information I have about it.

Glock first released the revolutionary model 17 in 1982. At that time it was one of the most futuristic designs on the market and incorporated little seen features such as lightweight polymer frame and a high-capacity double stack magazine. The model 17 also served as the first introduction to Glock's Safe Action Pistol concept. This revolutionary design featured 3 integral safety systems to ensure operator safety, but did not include an external, manual safety that might impede unpracticed or unfamiliar shooters. Since the 80s Glock has come a long way in improving and expanding on this design and they now have guns ranging from optimized competitive target shooting guns to concealed carry weapons. The Glock 19 is a compact model and is the most popular Glock model in production. It features a 4 inch hexagonally rifled barrel that increases weapon service life, decreases fouling, simplifies cleaning and improves muzzle velocity over a traditionally rifled barrel. The model 19 measures in at 7.36 inches is length and 1.18 inches in width, making it an ideal choice for a do-everything pistol. The Glock 19 ships from the factory with 2 15 round magazines but can also accept higher capacity magazines ranging from 17 rounds to the extended Glock 33 round mag. A double-action, striker-fired operating system is used to provide the ultimate in safety as well as a short, crisp trigger reset. Glock has earned a reputation for making some of the most reliable pistols on the market. This is due to their simplistic design, which utilizes only 35 components including the magazine and sights. This design ensures that there are no complicated assemblies to break at the worst possible time. Whether you are looking for the perfect carry gun, a home defense pistol, a target pistol for shooters with smaller hands or just want to own one of the best pistols ever made, this Glock 19 is perfect for you."

Rifle is being sold with, 420 rounds of Russian ammunition, cleaning kit, boresnake, hard rifle case and lock, and the original hunting stock.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. This Varmint Target model is a predators worst nightmare, and a target shooters dream. So weather your taking that long range shot at a coyote in that distant canyon, or the little 10 ring on your match target this rifle will perform with the accuracy you expect from a Ruger. This fine rifle is in stock & ships directly to your FFl in the legal lower states for $35.00 insured for your protection."

Glock first released the revolutionary model 17 in 1982. At that time it was one of the most futuristic designs on the market and incorporated little seen features such as lightweight polymer frame and a high-capacity double stack magazine. The model 17 also served as the first introduction to Glock's Safe Action Pistol concept. This revolutionary design featured 3 integral safety systems to ensure operator safety, but did not include an external, manual safety that might impede unpracticed or unfamiliar shooters. Since the 80s Glock has come a long way in improving and expanding on this design and they now have guns ranging from optimized competitive target shooting guns to concealed carry weapons. The Glock 19 is a compact model and is the most popular Glock model in production. It features a 4 inch hexagonally rifled barrel that increases weapon service life, decreases fouling, simplifies cleaning and improves muzzle velocity over a traditionally rifled barrel. The model 19 measures in at 7.36 inches is length and 1.18 inches in width, making it an ideal choice for a do-everything pistol. The Glock 19 ships from the factory with 2 15 round magazines but can also accept higher capacity magazines ranging from 17 rounds to the extended Glock 33 round mag. A double-action, striker-fired operating system is used to provide the ultimate in safety as well as a short, crisp trigger reset. Glock has earned a reputation for making some of the most reliable pistols on the market. This is due to their simplistic design, which utilizes only 35 components including the magazine and sights. This design ensures that there are no complicated assemblies to break at the worst possible time. Whether you are looking for the perfect carry gun, a home defense pistol, a target pistol for shooters with smaller hands or just want to own one of the best pistols ever made, this Glock 19 is perfect for you."

Bustmaster M17S .223 / 5.56×45mm Rifle

A generally rare find, released just before the weapons ban, one of the more exotic and fun .223 bullpup rifles to shoot. The rifle chambers the 5.56×45mm and accepts STANAG (M16 rifle) magazines. I need to sell this to cover some estate expenses from the passing of my father, otherwise I'd keep it in my collection.

Bushmaster manufactured it as the ""Bushmaster M17S"", starting just a few months before the approval of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The M17S was the only American-made bullpup rifle to be offered commercially, and the only one not banned by name.

More Details/History: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmaster_M17S

Bushmaster hard case, strap, manual, etc. all included.

From the Manufacturer:

JP Original Fire Control Kit for .154 small pin receivers consisting of a JP trigger with engagement and overtravel screws and disconnector spring installed as an assembly, disconnector, Instructional video, and your choice of a trigger and hammer spring:

Spring selection:

Standard
The standard spring sets included in all JP Fire Control kits include the yellow hammer and trigger springs, which may be used for competition and recreational applications with hand loads or domestic made non-military ammunition. The yellow/yellow combination results in a release weight in the 3.0-3.5 lb range on most receivers. Also included Is the red hammer spring for use with military (5.56 NATO) or foreign manufactured ammo with low sensitivity primers. The red hammer spring MUST be used on any tactical duty (LE) installations and any AR-10 type installation for 100% ignition reliability. The yellow/red combination results in a release weight of 3.5-4.0 lbs on most receivers.
Duty
The tactical spring set includes a full powers (grey) hammer spring and yellow trigger spring. It may be required for agencies that specify a trigger release weight of over 4 lbs mandatory. This set up also insures 100% ignition reliability on both AR-15 and AR-10 type rifles.

This is a very unique, one of a kind muzzleloader that has hundreds of hours of skilled craftsmanship and labor involved in it's creation.

Barrel: Colerain Barrel Co. 38"" Turkey Choke 20 Gauge. These barrels are for shot only due the tight restriction at the muzzle.

Lock: L&R Queen Anne Lock, this lock’s gently rounded plate and sculptured hammer indicate the influence of the English artisans of the “Queen Anne period” architecture. Many such locks were used from the early 1700s into the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Imported from England and used throughout the Colonies, it is of particular importance on guns of the southern sea port regions

GLOCK introduces revolutionary design changes in Gen4 to the gun commonly known as the ""BABY GLOCK"". The G26 has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994; a market once dominated by the 5-round snub-nose revolver. Standard with a 10 round magazine, it’s highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is a mainstay backup firearm among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

Checkered wood stock, factory sling holders, 21"" barrel, windage sights, wide trigger and release button it front of trigger guard for bottom loading. Nice gun for being 24 years old and the wood is in great shape. This gun has never been taken in the woods. There may be 1 scratch here and there but that is it.

The picture is shown with optional scope included at a different price. I put this scope on the gun intending on sighing it in and never did.
