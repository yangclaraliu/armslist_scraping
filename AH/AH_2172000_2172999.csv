Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:

The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.Synopses of the variances are provided below.


870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.   
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.   
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.   
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.   
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.   
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.   
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.   
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.   
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.   
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Purchased it early this year used probably 10 times or so. These are retailed at $699.00 at Joe's Sporting Goods, but don't get this confuse with the smaller screen Vs625sd. THAT one has a smaller screen but not just that, LOWER resolution which means less pixel and poorer graphic. It comes with a panning device with a remote that will twist your camera line into the right position. I forgot to mention this is a colored screen with technology to compensate for low light condition. NOW this is a great camera don't get me wrong why i'm selling it, but its also hunting season and I need new parts for my M4. I love the outdoors so I do what I can to give you all a good priced item and myself a little help here.

CASH ONLY… NO TRADES… Prefer delivery within the Triangle, but will ship if you have a Paypal account. Shipping is likely to be expensive for this package, though. 

Model 6304-148-541

Bought for a Springfield Armory XD Service Model 4”. The holster will fit an XD 4” .45, 9mm, .40S&W, or .357SIG. 

Near as I can tell, Safariland no longer makes a version for the 4” XD; they just offer one for the 5” version. I’m not sure if this one will fit a 5”. 

I bought this to add to a tactical setup that I have since switched away from. The whole thing is in very good shape, with a little scuffing, but that’s all. 

I also include the following two items (shown in the photos):
Safariland Receiver Plate with Guard, Brown 6004-18-55	

Safariland Holster Locking Fork, Brown 6004-15-55

These are attached to the holster and thigh rig to make it easy to remove the holster without having to remove the thigh rig. Also, the locking fork will let you slide the holster into tactical gear equipped with MOLLE attachment points (although, to be honest, the holster will flop around a bit). 

The plate and fork can be removed and the holster can be reattached directly to the thigh rig as it was new. I include the screws and allen wrench.  

Here’s a description from LAPoliceGear.com, which is offering this holster for $139.99:

Model 6304
ALS® Tactical Holster

The Model 6304 includes all the features of the popular 6004 Tactical holster, with one key addition - SAFARILAND'S exclusive Automatic Locking System (ALS). While the model employs the SLS as the primary security system, it also includes the ALS internal locking device that retains the weapons in all directions when the primary device is open.

The Model 6304 Tactical Holster design with Level II Plus Retention provides three key design elements different than previous models. Once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" into place, providing an extra measure of security for the weapon. Further, the holster is completely operable with the thumb, making it very instinctive to use. And finally, once these retention devices are released, the weapon can be drawn straight out of the holster with no twisting or other motion required.

The Tactical finish protects the gun in scrape, scratch and dent incidents. Thermal-molded SAFARI-LAMINATE protects the gun and the molded sight track and soft SAFARI-SUEDE help protect the sight and finish. Key to comfort and stability of the 6304 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. The leg harness is lightweight and simple to operate.

Features

(ALS®) Automatic Locking System secures weapon once holstered
Includes SLS hood assembly and Hood Guard
Hood Guard is standard on 6304 holsters

 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT
 Manufacturer: Kel-Tec
 Model #: P-3AT
 Finish: Matte Black
 Sights: Fiber Optics, Dovetailed Aluminum Front Sight
 Barrel Length: 2.76""
 Overall Length: 5.2""
 Overall Height: 3.5""

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

liquidating inventory or going out of business. This gun came to me on a trade for another high end gun I was offering and the gentleman preferred to trade his gun to me.

I live in Washington, but I'm in St Charles and Chesterfield multiple times weekly, and I can meet during most evenings based on our schedules aligning.

I have priced this gun to sell quickly, not to haggle about. It's a deal and we both know it!

Perfectly designed for fun-filled plinking, the TP 22 is perhaps the safest pocket pistol ever created. The durable TP 22 uses an internal firing pin block. When the manual external safety has been activated, the firing is blocked at both the front and the rear, leading to greater peace-of-mind for anyone handling the pistol. Similar in many respects to the Walther PPK, the TP 22 has a blued finish and employs a snag-free rounded hammer. This pistol features two-piece plastic grips, fixed open sights, and a 7-round magazine. Its grips, metal, and bore are all in very good condition.

* Galati Gear Holster with Magazine Pouch included with reversible belt clip for both left or right  hand use.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

When gripping the pistol normally, the instinctive front-activation button allows shooters to project the laser wherever the gun is aimed. This provides immediate feedback and gives shooters confidence their shots will hit their target.
The Ruger LCP, a .380 autoloader with a 2.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 5.16 inches, offers legendary Ruger reliability and quality in an ultra-light, compact carry pistol. Winner of the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence 2008 Handgun of the Year Award, the LCP also delivers superior ergonomic design and handsome styling. It incorporates state-of-the-art polymers, aircraft quality aluminum alloys, and high-grade precision steel components engineered for strength and maximum weight savings.
The 9.4-ounce LCP pistol has a capacity of 6+1 rounds. With a height of only 3.6 inches and a width of .82 inches, the LCP is a reliable back-up or carry pistol. The high-performance, glass-filled nylon frame is topped by a through-hardened blued slide.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately. 

Made in U.S.A.

This is an older Mossberg 500, New Haven 600AT.  The stocks are actual walnut, not the birch they use today.  The receiver has some decorative etchings.  The barrel was the infamous (and ugly) C-Lect Choke, that I had cut down to 18 1/2.  The front sight is fiber optic.  The action is broke in nicely.  Its been completely striped, cleaned, oiled and reassembled.  This would be great under the bed or in the field.

My price is fair and firm at $240

The .30-1903 was adopted by the Army in 1903 to replace the aging .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) which had been adopted in 1892. Winchester first offered the model 1895 in the .30-03 cartridge in 1905. Unfortunately, the '03 cartridge became all but obsolete only a year later with the adoption by the Army of the .30-06 in 1906. (Commercial ammo for the '03 was made up until WWI.) It wasn't until 1908 that Winchester produced the 1895 in '06. This pictured gun was born in 1912. Bright bore with great rifling, 50% bluing, wood has no cracks and has great wood to metal fit, originally had a Lyman 21 sight which was removed and a rear marble was installed. I would replace marble with a Lyman 21 to bring it back to originally configuration. This gun is also more desirable because it does not come with the standard 28"" barrel, but the 24""."

I purchased this rifle in 2001, and estimate 200 rounds have been fired from this rifle.  Bushmaster currently sells this rifle under the model number DCM-XR Order No. 90543.  See link http://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/competition.asp   Current sale price is $1,360.39 plus tax and shipping.

If you are just looking for an AR, you do not want this rifle.  This is a specific purpose, serious competition rifle, not just a range blaster.  

This rifle is specifically designed to compete in the “Service Class” high-power rifle competition like that held at Camp Perry each year.

In keeping with the DCM (Department of Civilian Marksmanship) rules, this rifle looks like a stock M16/AR15 but includes accurizing modifications that will give you the winning edge.
Features include;
•	An A2 rear sight specially modified to accept interchangeable “micro-apeture” peeps; 0.036”, 0.040”, 0.046” and 0.052” will be included with the rifle.
•	The rear sight windage and elevation mechanisms feature ¼” MOA adjustment with each click of adjustment.
•	Competition front sight blades (0.052” and 0.062” included with the rifle) ground for optimum visual clarity.
•	A 20” extra heavy competition barrel – a full 1” diameter under the handguard.  Precision button rifled in a 1 x 8” right hand twist with an 11 crowned competition muzzle.  The barrel is machined from Chrome-Moly Vanadium steel and hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32.  This barrel is superior to stainless or chrome lined.
•	The upper receiver is matched to both the bolt and the lower.
•	The lower receiver houses a finely honed competition two-stage trigger set for 3.5lb 1st Stage and a 1lb letoff (2nd Stage).
•	The forearm stock/grip is ‘free floating’, not attached to the barrel, but directly to the receiver.  The sling swivel is attached to the leading edge of the stock, so likewise it is attached to the receiver and can not influence any barrel deflection from your grip or wrapping the sling.
•	The buttstock has a tune-able and/or removeable 3lb lead insert to allow you to tune the rifle to achieve the balance you would like.  I have not altered this weight.

This is a pro competition rifle, not just a range blaster.  If you’re just looking for an AR, you do not want this rifle.  Mostly because it weighs 13.5lbs and is a chore to drag around, but if you want to get into high-power rifle competition shooting service class than this is your ticket."
