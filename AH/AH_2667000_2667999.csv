The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

The Screw heads are sharp, though showing light use. The markings are crisp. Overall, this gun rates in about fine condition."

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments, from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation.

Lowe, Berlin Germany","South East Virginnia, Virginia, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, February 8, 2014",Rifles,Mauser                                                                                ,7.65mm Argentine                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"NOTE: it is the buyers responsibility to confirm that this firearm is legal to own in your state and/or locality.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) chambered in the original 7.65X54m/m Argentine round and manufactured by Lowe in Berlin Germany. This model, along with the very similar Model 1889 Belgian Mauser and 1890 Turkish Mauser was used by the following countries as a primary battle rifle during the years indicated. Argentina 1891–1909; Belgium 1889–1940s; Bolivia 1895–1930s ; Philippines 1889-1940s; Spain 1889-1940s; Ottoman Empire 1890–1940 ( Turkey).

As normally encountered, the Argentine crest has been removed from the receiver bridge. In removing the crest, it appears that the sanding wheel came in contact with the upper edge of the stock on the left side thus removing a small portion of the wood. This can clearly be seen in the pictures. Outside of this, the rifle is in excellent condition given its’ age. With the exception of the number on the cleaning rod all other serial numbers are matching. The bore is bright & shiny with very strong lands & grooves and shows no sign of any corrosion caused by using corrosively primed ammunition.

Also seen in the pictures are the correct arsenal and manufacturers’ cartouches of the period. They are easily visible and very crisp. There is only one blemish that I feel worth noting. It is on the right side of the stock near the top edge close to the serial number. This can also clearly seen in the pictures. There are no import marks on this rifle, and since it was manufactured prior to 1898 there is no FFL required in order to purchase it. Additional pictures upon request.

An Olympic Arms AR-15 Model M.F.R. 97.
If you are looking for a 'Safe Queen' or a 'Perfect LNIB Gun' this gun isn't for you.

This is an older AR that is fully functional but has a few small rust spots, and minor mechanical dilemmas.
The rifle itself has a DPMS adjustable stock, a flip up (2 sizes) rear peep sight and a 'flipable' front sight, so it can be a post or a ""V"". It does show some wear, but is fully functional and ready to go. There are a few spall rust spots, but nothing scary. The thumb safety apparently has a broken spring, IT DOES WORK, but it does not stay where you put it, if you shoulder the weapon, it swings into the 'Fire' position, but if you stand it straight up, it swings into 'safe' position. I thought it was kind of handy like that, so I never fixed it. I have never put a scope on it, but with the open sights, it is pretty darn accurate.

It comes with 2 magazines: 1 is a Colt 20 round capacity, and 2 is a Center Industries Corp. 30 round capacity.

Also included is 10 - 30 round boxes (300pcs) of 5.56 X 45 ammo This is NEW ammo, not reloads, they were repacked from bulk (by me) into these new 30 round boxes. 7 1/2 boxes are Sellior and Bellot, 2 1/2 boxes are Lake City. All of the ammo is 62gr Full Metal Jacket - Steel Core - Boat Tail, complete with Green Tips. I think the Military Designation is SS-109, they are nicknamed 'penetrator' rounds. NOT Armor Piercing, but you will get your point across pretty well with them.

This is a package deal for $850.00, complete, you can go shooting with it tomorrow.

I am in Pittsfield, NH and will travel (within reason), I may consider a partial trade for interesting handguns of any caliber, 'Pretty' doesn't matter to me, if it works, that matters.

YOU will need a NH Drivers License, AND a Concealed Carry Permit to buy from me. Sorry no exceptions.

They make more not paying taxes on it. NOW YOU WONDER WHY THEY HAVE THAT ""I DONT CARE ATTITUDE"" WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE STORE. The store is a front for the website.

527,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2667527,For Sale:  Mosin Nagant 91/30 (2) M44 (1),"Cranberry / Moon / Harmarville, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, February 8, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have three excellent condition Mosin Nagant rifles for sale. Will sell separately or as a package. I am firm on my prices - it's what I have in them. Each of these are unique in their own way. 

Top rifle is a 1938 Izhevsk 91/30 import marks shows Century Arms International. All this rifle needs is a cleaning rod, forward end cap needs blued, and the rear sight spring is missing. The most compelling feature of this rifle is the bent bolt - it appears done here in the states, and was a nice job. Gives the appearance of a former sniper, but this is not a former sniper. The stock is impeccable on this rifle, and the finish appears to be arsenal finish based on the stock markings. The stock has multiple interesting stampings. The receiver, magazine floor plate and butt plate all have matching numbers. The bolt numbers were ground off whenever someone did the bent bolt modification. 
The bore on this rifle is like new. I have $185 in this rifle and I am not budging off it.

The middle rifle is the most interesting of the three. 1936 Izhevsk 91/30 with no import marks at all. This rifle is believed to be in the US since at least the early 1960's or maybe earlier. Brought in before import markings were mandated. The receiver, bolt and magazine floor plate all have matching numbers. The butt plate is not numbered. This rifle, like the 1938 Izhevsk, are both from the manufacture era in the USSR when the Spanish Civil War was going on. Neither 91/30 show any evidence of SCW duty. This 91/30, although no SA (Finnish) markings exist, has Finn written all over it. The one piece stock is Finn, and has marks and an engraving that just yells interest. The sling hangers and sling are Finn, as is the front sight. The barrel bands are M91 type 1 bands - the earliest made - and are no later than 1910. The front barrel band is in place with the wood screw the Finns used, and the rear band holds itself in place with a small plastic shim I cut and installed. The stock has evidence of a rear band screw at one time, and what's left of the screw is still in the stock. If this rifle could tell history imagine the story it could tell. The only thing this rifle needs is a cleaning rod, and I've not found the right rod to match the aesthetics. The bore is excellent, and I am firm on $250 for this rifle.

The third and final rifle I am offering for sale is my M44. 1945 Izhevsk complete, except it needs a cleaning rod. Bayonet stows and extends fine, and the bore is like a mirror on this rifle. Numbers match on this rifle for everything except the bolt. Complete with sling, the only other aspect of this rifle is the stock has some battle wear, the down side being one area above the trigger on right side which was an attempted repair. You  know that T-53's are all over the place and M44's are getting harder to find. This rifle is also a Century Arms import. I am firm on $225 for this rifle, and you know that's the fair price in our local market.

I would be glad to send more pictures and description on request. I am willing to FTF in the Cranberry, Moon / Airport or Harmarville areas as I frequent those areas. Must show valid PA drivers license to prove PA residency. Please feel free to contact me here or at seven two four nine nine one eight eight five three and I text too.

737,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2667737,For Sale:  Joe the Plumber/Circa 2017.,"COLORADO/USA, Colorado, United States","$ 12,345","Listed On: Saturday, February 8, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Only weeks after leaving office, Barack Obama discovers a leak in his house, so he calls Joe the Plumber to come out and fix it.  Joe drives to Obama's new house, which is located in a very exclusive gated community where all the residents are quite affluent  and make generally more than $250,000 per year.  Joe arrives and is escorted to the guest bathroom that contains the leaky pipe under the sink.  Joe assesses the problem and tells Obama that it's an easy repair that will likely take less than 10 minutes.  Obama asks Joe how much it will cost.

Joe checks his rate chart and says, ""$9,500"".  ""What?!  $9,500""?, Obama asks,
stunned, ""But you said it's an easy repair!"" Joe says, ""Yes, but the new way is to charge those who make $250,000 per year much more so I can fix the plumbing of less fortunate people for free"", explains Joe.  ""This has always been my philosophy.  As a matter of fact, I lobbied the Democratic lead Congress, who passed this philosophy into law.  Now all plumbers must do business this way.  It's known as the 'Affordable Plumbing Act of 2014.'  I’m Surprised you haven't heard of it.""

In spite of that, Obama tells Joe there's no way he's paying that much for a small plumbing repair, so Joe leaves after placing the bill for the service call on the entry table.  Obama spends the next hour flipping through the phone book & checking Craigslist for other plumbers, but he finds that all local plumbing services have gone out of business.  Not wanting to pay Joe's price & succumb to the newly instituted business trends, Obama does nothing and the leak goes unrepaired for several more days and, of course, becomes worse.  A week later the leak is so bad that a bucket has to be placed under the sink.  Michelle is not happy as guests will be arriving the next morning.  The situation quickly becomes worse and this bucket needs to be emptied repeatedly, and there's an increased risk that the room will flood, so they call Joe again to explain their predicament and plead with him to return.

Joe goes back to re-examine the leaky pipe, checks his updated Union rate chart and says, “Let's see, this will now cost you $21,000.""  Obama quickly fires back, ""What!  A few days ago your price was $9,500!""  Joe explains, ""Well, because of the 'Affordable Plumbing Act', a lot of higher-income people are now learning how to maintain and take care of their own plumbing, so there are fewer payers into the plumbing exchanges.  As a result and as you should easily understand, the price I have to charge higher-income people like you keeps rising.  Not only that, but for some odd reason the demand for plumbing work by those who get it for free has skyrocketed unbelievably!  There's a long waiting list of those who need repairs, but the amount we receive is far short of covering our costs.  This unfortunately has put a lot of my fellow plumbers out of business, they're not being replaced, and nobody is learning the plumbing trade any more because they know they can't make any money at it.  I'm hurting, too, thanks to greedy rich people like you who won't pay their fair share.""

Obama says, ""Joe!  This looks pretty bad.  If all the rich people learn how to fix and maintain their own plumbing and you can't charge the poorer people, you'll likely go broke!  What will you do then?""

Joe replies, ""I've been thinking of becoming a Community Organizer & see what happens after that."""

The Noveske 300 AAC BLACKOUT is designed to run optimally firing both subsonic suppressed and supersonic unsuppressed. This barrel is tuned to lock back on the last round using subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition with a sound suppressor. The firearm may not lock back with subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition without a sound suppressor. Also, the subsonic 300 BLK ammunition is more susceptible to a malfunction due to carbon fouling and adverse conditions than supersonic ammunition. The barrel is tuned to operate correctly with the back pressure provided by the AAC 762-SDN-6 using an H2 buffer, or a Surefire 762K suppressor and an H buffer. In the development of this barrel, we found evidence that the suppressor may require a symmetrical baffle stack as found in the AAC Cyclone K, 762-SDN6, and Surefire 762K suppressor. Suppressors which cause off axis turbulence, such as those with K type baffles, may cause baffle strikes and/or point of impact shift, and may damage your suppressor. Noveske Rifleworks LLC will not be responsible for damage or injury under ANY circumstances. Consult you suppressor manufacturer to determine if your suppressor is suitable for this application.
The barrel ships with gas block installed. This barrel is designed for our gas block that is 1"" long(INCLUDED). A standard front sight base is 1.9"" long and WILL NOT FIT. Barrel installation should be performed by a qualified gunsmith. Installation of the gas block dowel pin and gas block is required to complete the assembly process."

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Croatian PHV MV 9 – 9m/m semi-auto pistol. From the country, (Croatia), that has brought the American shooter the highly popular Springfield HD series of semi-automatic pistols, comes their first semi- automatic 9m/m (9X19m/m) caliber pistol, the PHP MV 9. The designation PHV stands for Prvi Hrvastski Pistolj, or first Croatian pistol. It was developed in Croatia in the early 1990’s during the counties war for independence and was produced in a long barrel version, (PHP MV 17), and this shorter barrel, compact model, (PHP MV 9). Some years later both were replaced in production and use by the HS2000 pistol. 

The design of the PHP MV 9 is a combination of the Beretta 92 and the Walther P-38 pistols. It is of a short recoil operated action with a vertically tilting locking piece, similar to both pistols. In appearance, the open top slide is similar to the Walther design and the single return spring, located under that barrel, is reminiscent of the Italian design.

The trigger is a traditional double action design with a manual de-cocking lever incorporated with the safety lever which is located on the rear, left side of the grip frame. The magazines are double stack and hold a total of 15 rounds. Additional pictures upon request.

The 6"" is also a hard to find gun in this condition but has label. I know the the owner and have bought Colts from him for a couple years. He has a few safes full of these babies. More to coming. The 6"" has a slight turn line, but shows no firing and what looks like a nick on the right side below top strap wiped off. See first photo. The 4"" has no turn line but looked to me that it may have been fired a few rounds. The lines and edges on both are crisp, clean and sharp. Anything you see is only lint, dust or a spot I missed wiping them down. 4"" # P79938 & 6"" #P44384. Priced to sell as a pair."

Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.
