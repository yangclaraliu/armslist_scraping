The Smith & Wesson 686+ has the more versatile round butt grip frame that
can accommodate a wide selection of aftermarket grips to suit any hand
size. With its intermediate size and weight, it is comfortable to grip by
its finger grooved grip. Its overall configuration allows for a good
position of the trigger finger around the narrow smooth trigger. The
narrow, smooth trigger allowed the finger to roll over its surface,
preventing the tendency to pull the sights off target during the long
double action stroke.

Year: 1945

This Colt Sistema is a unique piece of history with unique markings and modifications for custom carry, simply one of a kind. The serial number from 24xxx indicates that it was one of 6000 made in the first year of Argentine production, many of which were destroyed.  The modifications include a 4lb trigger, upgraded sights, and polished hammer for the lightest and smoothest pull that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing on any 1911, also the barrel and firing pin have been replaced. Included are several sets of grips, two 7rd magazine, and one 8rd magazine. I will obviously run the required background check. I am open to trade for pistols.

All original with correct box, onion skin, grips & some papers.  Serial # checks to be 1961.  Beautiful, tight, perfect timing & lock-up.  These were only made for a couple of years (late 1959-early 1961) & then changed to the 18-2 & later were the -3 & -4.  It is extremely rare to find in like new condition  Has double pins & 3 screws & recessed cylinders..  Very little specific information is available on these.  All parts match including the grips.  The screws aren't buggered & all lines & seams match perfectly.  It has adjustable sights & they have never been touched from the factory.  This gun is like brand new.  

This is a very rare gun to find in this condition.  The only trades that would interest me would be a H&R 999 4"" Sportsman, a Ruger Single-six 4 5/8"", .223/5.56 or 45acp ammo plus considerable cash.  I'll listen to offers, but save the $500 ones for the beat up 18 -2, -3, etc.  Also, I have no use for fishing gear, old cars, appliances, boats, scooters, mopeds or other assorted crap laying around in your garage or basement.

All Stainless and much more beautiful than pictures can show!
I’ve owned this beautiful gun since early 2008. I bought it from a fellow Sig forum member who stated that it only had 300 rounds through it. Therefore, I’d say it has somewhere around 1,500–2,000 through it now.
This gun has been, by far, the most accurate gun I’ve ever shot.

Now, with that being said, I want to disclose that last winter when I took it out to shoot for the 1st. time in almost 2 years, I discovered that I had somehow stripped the hole that held the screw that held the compensator in place. So, I ordered a new compensator($200) with the front sight installed from Sig about a month ago. I installed it and tested it out a week ago.

Continuing on:
First, the original box and papers from the factory are included.

From the Beretta Website:

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

From the Beretta Website:

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

PPQ NAVY 9 mm x 19, PS, AM, LM
Semi-Automatic Pistol
Developed in collaboration with special forces:
The PPQ NAVY is WALTHER’s pistol for tough police missions.

Power in spite of water resistance.
The firing mechanism of the WALTHER PPQ NAVY has been optimized for operations in and near water. A hole in the striker channel ensures sufficient water displacement if the weapon becomes completely flooded with water. Hydraulic resistance is offset by means of a stronger striker spring. In addition, special guides reduce the water resistance when the striker moves forward.

PX4 Fullsize or Compact $499.00 + tax 

From the Beretta Website:

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

The upper comes equipped with heat resistant polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 birdcage flash hider.

From Botswana to the Brooks Range, no other rifle has traveled so extensively in search of big game or is held in such high esteem as the Model 70. Foremost in the series is the elegant Super Grade. You feel a surge of pride as you slide it from the case. The warm grain and figure of the fancy grade walnut stock with finely cut checkering complement the contrasting black fore-end tip and pistol grip cap. The sleek lines of the sculpted shadowline cheekpiece flow across the stock. A blued steel stock crossbolt is tastefully engraved, adding both strength and elegance, while inletted blued steel swivel studs grace the underside. A tasteful black Pachmayr® Decelerator® pad helps soften felt recoil. The cold hammer-forged steel barrel is free floating for enhanced accuracy. The M.O.A. Trigger System puts the Super Grade under your total control. With no take up, no creep and no overtravel, it’s the finest trigger ever offered and will immediately help you realize the gun’s MOA accuracy potential. When you’re ready for super accuracy combined with super elegance, you’re ready for the Model 70 Super Grade."

I just rhino lined the outside of the actual Jeep a few months ago. That makes the entire Jeep scratch resistant and very easy to clean also. It has 33"" tires, side step rails, a K&N Air Intake, Airaid throttle body spacer, ORV steering stabilizer, Dana 44 rear, manual transmission. I also just replaced the sound bar and put in a brand new 6 speaker bar. The radio is brand new and has bluetooth capabilities. It can connect to your phone for hands free talking. Most of the inside of the Jeep is also rhino lined. It has KC Daylighters on the front bumper which are not wired in right now. They need rewired but I haven't gotten to it yet. I just replaced one of the hydraulic arms on the hard top lift glass and it works great now. It comes with an offroad Hi-Lift jack which has a mount for the hood. The Jeep also comes with a bikini top and cargo wrap for the summer. The hard top is great for the winter because it really holds in the heat much better than a soft top. The only issue with it is that the transmission grinds a little. If you read up on the AX-15 transmission it will run forever even with the grinding. They are extremely durable and built to last. I will be swapping out the transmission fluid shortly if I don't sell it first. I've heard that that can be the problem so it may be a simple fix. Hopefully. The Jeep is great for offroading. I just had it offroad a few days ago. It climbs hills and rocks like they're not even there! Let me know if you want to come check it out and take it for a test drive. Price is slightly negotiable. Write me with an offer and I'll see what I can do."

everything is practically brand new except the lower receiver. has approximately 15 rounds of 5.56 through it for function testing and approximately 25 rounds of .22lr via conversion kit through it for sighting in the aimpoint. aimpoint came from the SKD group buy and has only been in my posession since 9/30/10. 

the round count may sound like bullshit but you can ask gloftoe, zhukov or any of the TX crew how much i actually shoot
