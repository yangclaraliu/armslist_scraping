This is a Government Model with the brushed stainless steel finish on the flats of the frame and slide. It also has the ""100 Years of Service"" roll mark on the slide. I purchased this gun new last year (2012) and it has never been out of it's original blue plastic case since I brought it home from Kames in Canton, with the exception of being removed to take pictures for this ad. This 1911 was an impulse buy and I never felt the desire to shoot it after purchasing it. I am only selling to make some room in the safe for several semi-custom 1911s that should be completed in the next few weeks.

This Colt is absolutely perfect, as you would expect from a NIB firearm. There is not a scrape, scratch or ding anywhere on the pistol with the exception of the unavoidable small scrapes on the side of the grip safety from being held while it was for sale at my local gun shop. Even the light scrapes on the barrel hood that occur when the slide is racked are almost non-existent.  Truly a perfect Colt 1911.  Everything the gun came with is included in this sale.  That means the 1911 itself, the original blue plastic case, two 7-round Colt mags, gun lock, owner's manual and every single piece of paperwork that was there when I bought it.

I have plenty of high resolution pictures uploaded to Photobucket, just ask and I will email the link.

Must be over 21 years old and able to legally own a firearm in the State of Ohio. Will need to see a valid Ohio driver's license at time of purchase. CHL holders are preferred and will get first priority but are not required. Price is $900 cash and I am located just a few miles west of the Akron-Canton Airport. Again, this is a cash only sale and I am not interested in any trades at this time. Thanks for looking."

I am selling it because I currently live in Chicago and it just sits in the case at my parent's place in Indiana. I have shot approximately 300-500 rounds through it and it remains in excellent condition. I have been in the military for over 5 years and I have cleaned it and taken care of it just like a standard issue rifle. Along with the rifle, it comes with the original case, sling, MAGPUL pop up sights, and manual. It also comes with 2 PMAGs, MAGPUL MOE foreip, MAGPUL angled foregrip, and the EOTech 512 holographic sight. 
For those of you who aren't familiar with the ACR, it is one of the premier piston operated assault rifles. The last time I checked, the Army is currently testing the ACR, FN SCAR, the HK 416, and a new piston operated version of the Colt M4 for a replacement for the current gas operated carbine. It has also been featured on several FPS video games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. The spring and action are in the center of the rifle which allows for the collapsible stock, unlike a traditional M4/AR15. It is also considered a ""multi-caliber"" rifle because the barrel and bolt can easily be changed (in under 2 minutes) to fit 6.8 SPC and eventually 7.62x39 cartridges. Cleaning this rifle is extremely easy as well because all the carbon is captured in the front piston block (no need to clean that pesky star chamber). The ACR is a rifle for someone who is looking for the next generation assault rifle. It has less recoil, more adaptability, more versatility, and better performance than the 60yr old M16/M4 platform and it is completely ambidextrous out of the box. This rifle truly is the best rifle I have ever had the chance to shoot.

Interested buyers please email me and we can discuss shipping details. I am not opposed to meeting up to discuss the sale."

Produced from 1898 – 1907. This model was unusual in in that the hammer was concealed, so it could only be fired as a double action, and a safety bar set into the backstrap had to be simultaneously squeezed with the trigger to fire (led to the nickname “Lemon Squeezer”). This gun was manufactured in 1899, and requires a copy of a FFL or C&R for shipment. It is in overall excellent condition, both cosmetically and mechanically. It was not factory engraved, but the engraving is very high quality. Likewise, the pearl grips were not on the gun when it was shipped from the factory. But they are of high quality and fit well. The gun is inscribed “Buck Garrett” on the left side, and has the initials, “BG” on the left grip. Buck Garrett’s law officer career started at the age of 18 as a “posse man” in the Indian Territory. From this early start, he graduated to being a deputy sheriff, and then was a federal marshal for nearly 20 years. During this time, he worked with fellow officers in rounding up the celebrated Dalton gang, the Nations gang, the Johns gang, the Oates gang and dozens of other outlaw gangs whose names brought fear to settlers and trainmen. After he retired as a marshal, he ran for sheriff in Ardmore, OK and was elected several times. Sheriff Buck, like many law officers of that time, frequently kept confiscated weapons and had the better ones fixed up specifically for his collections. He was reputed to be the possessor of over 100 pistols. Pistols of all calibers and conditions from tiny .25s to giant .45s. They were ivory handled, pearl handled, wooden handled, horn handled, and were blued, chromed, or silver plated and some were extensively engraved."

This rifle is in approx. 85-90% condition.  There are a few small indentations on the wood, and the bluing is slightly worn in some areas.  Rifle's action is not the incredible smoothness I'm accustomed to with my Marlins, but I'm told this is the norm for older, lightly used Winchester 94s.  Outstanding collector, or would make a fine hunting rifle.  Since this is a pre-1964 model, all parts would have been machined and hand-fitted in Winchester's original New Haven, Conn., factory.  That pre-'64 thing does not apply to Model 70s alone!   
I do not want to give this rifle up, but at the same time I can't afford to keep it.  Price is negotiable, but keep it within reason.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.

The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A."

You are misleading in your post. First off, the Thompson in the photo is not the SBR version. That requires a federal tax stamp for $200. Second, you posted the item in October for $200 less than you are now asking. Has it gone up to you in value in a month and a half? Third, you are asking way more than MSRP. Are these that hard to locate?

I have built hundreds of these with 100% satisfied customers. Sorry for the quality of my photos I have a Gunsmith shop and build firearms not photography. At the bottom if you care to read are answers to 2 of the most commonly questions I get; my Background and Value of a Polished Bolt?

I BUILT THIS DESIGN SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM THAT WANTED AN AK (SEMI-AUTO) PLATFORM FOR JOBS WHERE 762X39 AMMO IS READILY AVAILABLE. The only differences are that they put on MagPul Rail Covers on the Quad Rail, MagPul AFT and their own flashlight and green lasers.

DEMAND FOR MY SAIGA'S HAS ALWAYS EXCEEDED MY ABILITY TO BUILD PARTICULARLY NEAR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. THIS IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW THAT I HAVE IN STOCK AND AUCTIONS WILL END EARLY ENOUGH THAT IF YOU OVERNITE PAYMENT I CAN MAKE SHIPMENT THE 18TH THE LAST SHIP DATE FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR FFL BY CHRISTMAS.

DON'T BE ALARMED BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BANNING IMPORTATION OF MILITARY TYPE WEAPONS, AMMO, ECT TO SEE HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AS IT COULD EFFECT SAIGA'S, AK'S, ETC IN THE FUTURE.

CSS bullet guide installed to accept new and surplus AK47 magazines. 1- Tapco 30rd AK47 Magazine and 10rd factory magazine plus original factory items (cleaning kit, oil bottle). Remember the most important thing with any custom firearm is quality workmanship and reliability in the action, you can always change furniture or add accessories but the heart is on the inside.; compare before you buy. With over 300 sold with nothing but compliments when you buy one of my Saiga's you are getting the best performance that you can get out of a Saiga.

1-Background 30yrs in executive textile management, 35 years build an competing with 1911's. Obama's election resulted in millions of $$ contracts canceled. Thank God I had a few gunsmithing skills; most blessings. Some local 3-Gun Competitors asked me to build them some ""True""Saiga Conversions for them.

Shortly after I was asked to build some tough and reliable semi-auto AK's for a security firm.

Brown frame, blued slide. Has belt clip installed (in matching blued finish). 
Gun has been ""fluffed and buffed"" and operates MUCH better than new. 
Gun looks and feels new, but has many improvements over new. 
Looking for $300.

Comes with 1 magazine, finger extension mag bottom (installed), flat mag bottom, trigger lock, manual, original hard case, belt clip (installed), original frame pins (if want to remove belt clip).  
Basically everything you get with the new gun, plus the belt clip. 

Also, I filed down the sharp edges on the ridges that are on the back of the grip.
This greatly improved comfort for me when shooting without gloves.  Visually no different, simply more comfortable. 

Whats a ""fluff and buff""?
You can google it, but basically it is doing all the hand finish work that Kel-Tec does not do to keep prices down.  This helps the gun operate smoother, giving better feel and (IMO) better accuracy and less perceived recoil. 
Here is what was done:
Polished feed ramp
Smoothed out machining and casting marks in areas of contact on slide and frame
Broke sharp edge at bottom of bore in frame where barrel rides and polished inside bore
Broke sharp edges where feed ramp meets frame
Polished slide rails
Polished outside of chamber where it slides against slide
Broke sharp edges of magazine where grips casing and polished these edges
**NOTE:  Polished means improved surface finish through polishing using a felt bob and various stages of polishing compound. I only went up to a high-gloss in the feed areas and around the chamber, as these areas build up carbon quickly and the higher gloss finish does a better job of resisting build-up."

It's superiority has been evidenced throughout extensive testing in arctic, desert, jungle, and maritime environments. It features a well executed design, select materials, special anti-friction surface finish, advanced spring material, attention to production tolerances, and a heat-treated steel magazine housing and follower. 

For use in extreme environments HK now offers a special Maritime coating which easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test, the HK High Reliability Magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt mist and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this test procedure each magazine was fully loaded with rounds and fired twice with no problems experienced. In U.S. military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability of the system by 30-50% overall.

This is the civillian version of what the military carries. Has all the bells and whistles...night sights, internal coating, quick trigger reset, etc. Comes with three 15-round FACTORY magazines.

Has 150 break-in rounds through it.

Not willing to accept less than $800 so please don't waste my time if you're not willing to pay. Any offers for lower than that will be ignored! We are not desperate for the money so we will sit on it for as long as it takes. If you go to Gander Mountain, expect to pay $1,199 MSRP + $30 transfer fee + tax. So add it all that up, it will cost a total of around $1,400! 

We're going to leave it up for 2 weeks only and if not sold, wll keep it. 

These aren't Obama prices so better snag it while you can!

The only reason I'm selling is I have my eye set on a rare, classic, German-frame Sig but it's not something I need so that's why I can sit on this. 

Make sure you have a valid driver's license with you or this gun does not leave this house. Would prefer if you have a CCW.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

I have built hundreds of these with 100% satisfied customers. Sorry for the quality of my photos I have a Gunsmith shop and build firearms not photography. At the bottom if you care to read are answers to 2 of the most commonly questions I get; my Background and Value of a Polished Bolt?

I BUILT THIS DESIGN SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM THAT WANTED AN AK (SEMI-AUTO) PLATFORM FOR JOBS WHERE 762X39 AMMO IS READILY AVAILABLE. The only differences are that they put on MagPul Rail Covers on the Quad Rail, MagPul AFT and their own flashlight and green lasers.

DEMAND FOR MY SAIGA'S HAS ALWAYS EXCEEDED MY ABILITY TO BUILD PARTICULARLY NEAR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. THIS IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW THAT I HAVE IN STOCK AND AUCTIONS WILL END EARLY ENOUGH THAT IF YOU OVERNITE PAYMENT I CAN MAKE SHIPMENT THE 18TH THE LAST SHIP DATE FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR FFL BY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS! Firearm in stock and ready to ship.CONTACT FROM BUYER is expected within 48 hrs and payment is due within 7 days from close of Auction. DON'T BE ALARMED BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BANNING IMPORTATION OF MILITARY TYPE WEAPONS, AMMO, ECT TO SEE HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AS IT COULD EFFECT SAIGA'S, AK'S, ETC IN THE FUTURE.

Features include: ACE SHELTON STOCK MACHINED FROM BILLET ALUMINUM (can be fired with stock folded), CSS FOLDING HINGE, CSS SOLID Internal block This is a rigid set-up. Houge Monogrip Pistol Grip , DPH Vetical Bolt Handle, Tapco G2 Modified Trigger group; Hammer, Bolt and Bolt Carrier polished and treated with FrogLube(good stuff), Leapers/UTG Quad Rail (made from billet aluminum), ""Red Jacket"" Birdcage Flashhider and Extended Mag Release. CSS bullet guide installed to accept new and surplus AK47 magazines. 1- Tapco 30rd AK47 Magazine and 10rd factory magazine plus original factory items (cleaning kit, oil bottle). Remember the most important thing with any custom firearm is quality workmanship and reliability in the action, you can always change furniture or add accessories but the heart is on the inside.; compare before you buy. With over 300 sold with nothing but compliments when you buy one of my Saiga's you are getting the best performance that you can get out of a Saiga.

1-Background 30yrs in executive textile management, 35 years build an competing with 1911's. Obama's election resulted in millions of $$ contracts canceled. Thank God I had a few gunsmithing skills; most blessings. Some local 3-Gun Competitors asked me to build them some ""True""Saiga Conversions for them. After a while I got my FFL and began building and offering them for sale online in early 2010. I Try to Build guns with the Best Reliability. Shortly after I was asked to build some tough and reliable semi-auto AK's for a security firm.

2.Simply polishing the FCG, bolt & carrier has minimal advantage. Radiusing the hammer, stone polishing the hammer hooks, radiusing the bolt and carrier, polishing, heat treating, lubricating metal at contact points; DOES MAKE DIFFERENCE.

 I am the original owner having  purchased  the gun in September, 2013. I am selling it because my need is for a pocket-carry only and the P238 is too heavy for the dress pants I wear. I just purchased a Ruger LCP and will use this exclusively for my pocket-carry needs. (I would keep the Sig if it was not such a source of dissidence in the family; My wife does not understand why I would want two similar weapons. She thinks I am a maniac). The Sig was used weekly over an eight-week period. I shot twenty-five (25) rounds per week for a total of 200 rounds. The gun was cleaned and oiled per Sig guidelines after each use. Snap-caps were in place for all dry-fire training. It was never dropped or carried, only used at a range as described above. I used only Federal Ammunition American Eagle 380 Auto 95GR ammunition.

I don't have too much information on its origin other than that it appears to have been manufactured in the late 80s (based on serial number search), and that it's had some custom work done to it, such as:

- replaced guide rod
- lightened trigger pull
- polished muzzle (god knows why)
- the letter 'T' inscribed on the top of the barrel, which I was told is the mark of a popular gunsmith

Given the slimmer profile of this gun, it is very comfortable to hold and possibly even carry. Love the classic checkered grips, love how easy it is to shoot accurately.

Only downside I can see here is wear on frame and finishing slide do it's age. I think this is kinda cool though since it adds a bit of character to the gun.

These pistols are a bit difficult to come by as they are no longer manufactured, so my price reflects that. Comes with extra factory mag, which are pricey.
