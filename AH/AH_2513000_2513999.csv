With the announcement of the Nikon D3200, Nikon has raised the bar for image resolution in the sub-$700 camera category. The Nikon D3200 combines a 24MP DX-format (APS) CMOS sensor with a feature set that's designed to please snapshooters who are stepping up from point-and-shoot photography and for more serious shooters looking for a low-cost second body. Nikon's popular Guide Mode, which was introduced with the D3000, offers on-screen guidance for beginners and holds your hand as it allows you to explore the camera's range of creative picture-taking options. Full HD 1080p video capture should appeal to budget-conscious videographers. 

The camera is lightweight; it is well-suited for soccer moms who want to capture Junior's sports activities with its 4 fps burst rate. The Nikon D3200 is compatible with a new WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter ($59.95; also available for pre-order), which can send images to mobile devices like smartphones and tabletsand let you control the camera remotely from your device

It has a Rock River Arms upper and a Double Diamond Law Enforcement lower that accepts Glock 9mm magazines (There are NO magazines included). It is also running a Rock River 9mm bolt that has been ramped and cut to work with Glock magazines and provide greater overall reliability. It has a low profile gas block and is ready to accept optics. The buffer is the famous 9-Q buffer weighing 8.5 ounces. It also has an extra power spring from Wolff. This makes the gun (which is blowback) run smoother and will extend the life of the internals. I have also installed an ambidextrous charging handle latch.

It is basically brand new with less than 100 rounds through it.Â I had a local gunsmith look at it to see if we needed to alter anything and I did slim down the bolt release to make it run a little smoother. It is very accurate!!! I could hit the leaves of a dueling tree from 80 yards away very easily. It is very fun to be able to shoot steel up close!

Got this tactical North Face soft shell as a gift.  Stupid me cut the tags off and threw them away right away.  Wore the jacket a couple of times and decided these kind of jackets are not for me.
Looking to sell or trade it...it is in perfect condition, like I said, only wore it twice. Not a single mark on it.
Has removable zip off hood. I am a non-smoker so the jacket does not smell.  New this jacket was $200, obviously I don't have the tags, so i'm willing to take a loss at $100 or best offer, thanks.

PURPOSE BUILT
Our most popular concealed carry jacket, the upgraded Sabre 2.0 has been engineered with direct feedback from 5.11 users to provide a covert and stylish appearance that hides a wealth of tactical features. A high performance microfiber shell and a waterproof/breathable seam-sealed membrane keep you insulated from wind and weather without heating you up during periods of high activity. Our patented Quixipâ¢ system provides immediate access to a holstered sidearm, and zipping handwarmer pockets are Backup Belt Systemâ¢ compatible, allowing you to customize your accessories for the mission at hand. Utility pockets at each shoulder and roomy internal pockets offer ample storage space, a secure lumbar pocket offers additional covert storage, and an integrated hood can be rolled up into the collar or removed entirely in warmer weather. Integrated storm cuffs keep out rain and cold, and three zip-out ID panels allow you to go from covert to overt in seconds.

One of the holy grails of Daisy BB gun collecting. In 1942, just before Daisy shut down operations due to steel shortages caused by the World War II war effort, Daisy manufactured its 3rd military style bb gun. It was called the No. 140 Military. The No. 140 was manufactured for a very short period of time.  Only about 30,000 of these guns were made.  The No. 140 featured a bolt action that acted as the guns' safety mechanism and a canvas sling, but no bayonet. The shot tube was the same style as the Red Ryder âLightning Loaderâ. This is one of the rarest BB guns due to the low number manufactured and is highly desirable and very rarely comes up for sale. This one is particularly nice as it has the original sling and works. Look carefully at photos to judge condition. Slight dent at end of barrel tube (near where bb shoots out of tube). Both front and rear sights are fully intact. Bolts and nuts come as pictured. Ask questions and we will reply rapidly. I think you will be very pleased with this item.

FROM CZ: The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61â bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZâs corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooterâs strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005âs IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Questions? Shoot me a message.  Cash FTF in Fridley or Burnsville.

I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only, shipping additional.  No trades involving shipping.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.
