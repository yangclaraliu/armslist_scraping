Only 100 of the rifles were made by VFC before they went out of business, they are now a collectors item and only available from someone who already owns one.

Honestly the gun is horrible for field use, and is out-performed by even a lightly upgraded AEG, so as stated, this is a collectors item.

It is a remarkably well detailed and faithful recreation of the Barrett M82A1, real metal construction and precision welds put this baby together.  I had this thing sitting in a local gun/airsoft store for a while in an attempt to consign it, and people would come in all the time thinking this was a real Barrett M82A1, despite the entire muzzle break being blaze orange.

Only thing off with these is that the early generation models would have a tendency to blow out the o-ring at the valve that delivers the firing charge of gas, this one had that occur, I had a replacement o-ring sent, but never got the gun taken apart and the new one installed.  Considering this is a collectors item and crap for a field gun I will not be replacing the o-ring myself (at this things price tag it's better left to a professional) and I will not be marking down for non-firing status (seriously, its like a 25 cent o-ring).

I have calculated current market value for every item I have on here, what I paid for the items, condition on the item, and what extras I have thrown in to increase worth-while-ness to you the buyer.  My asking prices are more fair, and usually at least a couple to several hundred below market/what I paid.  I have taken very good care of my firearms.

Second, buyer will pay all fees.  I can't believe this has to be said here in CA, but its the number one question I get.  When you buy one from the store they don't pay your DROS for you! I will not either, again my prices are more than fair for what I'm selling.

Third, all transfers will happen at a public place, neutral ground if you will.  Firearms including blackpowder will be at an FFL/gun store(yes I know blackpowder won't DROS, the meet is for protection of both parties).  Airsoft items I have listed can be at any suitable location, Store, Play field, etc.  For items I list on consignment, I will direct you to the appropriate store.

Fourth, if you didn't figure it out from three, you need to be legally capable of owning the item and it will be transferred in accordance to applicable laws.  If you do a firearm transfer with me and your background check gets denied(which you should know if it will or not beforehand), then you had better find a new buyer, cause you're not getting a refund from me, idiot.

Finally, if you are a scammer, phisher or what not, you probably wont bother reading this this far.  But if you do, got straight to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  My only means of contact from here is an e-mail I set up that I don't mind getting ""burned"" i.e. sold to companies, spammed, DDOS'ed, whatever.  You'll also be lucky to even get a reply from me if I think you are a scammer or wasting my time.  NO one on here will receive my phone number, address or an other contact info, you can have my name once we meet at the store, again, neutral ground, safe place for both parties.

If you are interested in an item let me know a time and suitable place(per 'Three') to meet upon first contact with me, or at least some proof that you're human, and actually in my area.  That's the best way to get a reply from me.  Stupid questions will be ignored."

Windham Weaponry's Rifles...

From the onset, Windham Weaponry has had one goal: to build the finest AR type rifles in the country.

As ""America's newest rifle manufacturer with decades of experience"", we gathered a team of highly qualified and very experienced Gunsmiths and Builders, supported them with the best Customer Service & Sales people, added seasoned firearms industry Quality Control, Purchasing, and Marketing experts, and lead them with a Management team that has built ""America's Rifle"" for literally two decades.

We are so sure of the quality of our rifles that we back them up with the strongest Warranty in the industry - one that guarantees against all manufacturer's defects in material and workmanship for the Lifetime of the Firearm to the Purchaser. Additionally, this warranty is Transferable from the original Purchaser to subsequent buyers (view the Complete Warranty).

As you look over the models below, note that they feature the finest 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel barrels which are chrome lined for long wear and ease of maintenance. See the durable black hard coat anodize finish on the 7075 T6 Aircraft Aluminum Receivers.

I have these parts leftover from other builds and replacements. I have tried my best to price these accordingly by researching what they are selling for on Amazon, eBay and the manufacturer’s sites. These are perfect for someone who is building an AR and does not want to pay new prices for parts. All of these parts were either taken off of a new rifle for were replacement parts that were stripped prior to selling a rifle. I guarantee that they are in perfect working condition as they have come off of my guns. I have thrown a lot of items away that were worn out or of no value but I would put any of these on a rifle that I would use for personal protection. I would like to sell them all in one lump sum to anyone building a rifle but would piece them out if you wanted more than just one item. I travel from Winston-Salem to Wilmington on a regular basis for work so meeting somewhere public is not an issue. I am asking for $165 for all of the items listed but would entertain other offers is the lot is to be broken up. Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking.

A month ago my girlfriend and I moved out of my parent's home with our 4 month old son. I come from a decent middle-class family and allowed my girlfriend to talk me into moving into a low income area, it was the worst decision of our lives. Gun shots can be heard every few days, fights in the cul-de-sac over who gave the mail man the best oral sex last night between the local women is a monthly occurrence, and every gas station owner in the area says they've been robbed at gunpoint at least twice.

I decided to go about posting this ad after some thug attempted to rob me at my car with a kitchen knife last Thursday night in a McDonald's parking lot. My girlfriend and I have tried a Maverick 88 at the range and the thing kicked her in the face and bruised my shoulder up pretty good, she refused to use it for any kind of defensive situation. We are now in search of preferably a semi-auto of both the rifle or shotgun variety to lessen the recoil, however, I will gladly consider any and all offers.

We're both 18 and we also only have about $200 dollars to spend, its the most we can save in a month and is quickly spent by the next month. If anyone would like to get rid of a rile or shotgun that's just collecting dust, is too small for you, won't sell for a reasonable price, or is just hurting your eyes to look at, I will buy it off of you if your willing to take $200 for it. I would prefer to meet during daylight hours in a public place and will show you proof of my age if needed. If you have any questions, I will gladly answer them."

Trades I may consider will be listed towards the bottom of this post. Trade option is only for local face to face transactions. If I ship the gun I only accept USPS money orders for the figures listed above. +shipping and any FFL fees on your dime. 

Please read carefully. This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! Sorry I won't let you pic-a-part! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. I included a price break down above to show what I have into the gun. Some parts were readily available and some I had to pay shipping on. Just being honest up front! You may not agree with these prices so please spare me any negative responses. I don't have time to fetch and process correspondence from trolls and tire kickers. Please respect that this is a quality set up and I want to recover as much as I can without being low balled or bullied. Lets keep it simple, if you don't have the trades I list, valid requests/questions, or cash on hand today, kindly move along in your search.  Sorry for the disclaimer but internet transactions of such have been getting pretty ugly as of late and I want to avoid the drama. I will communicate via e-mail until I feel comfortable enough to hand out my mobile number. No dealers please! No hard feelings but I know you have a business to run and you're not in business to pay retail or close to it. I will ship the gun via my FFL dealer to an FFL dealer of your choice ( where legal ) within the lower 48 US states on your dime. In that case bare in mind the 25 round mags. may have to stay with me. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two 25 round mags. Out of area buyers if I ship there will be no inspection period, reason being this is not a prized collectible or museum piece. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if treated properly.  Thanks for stopping by my listing.

It's not a do or die to find everybody's grandfathers D Day invasion gun. I would prefer to ad a Winchester or IHC to my collection. I'm aware of the current inventories at the CMP South and North stores. I'm very versed on the Garand market and pricing. I have taken trips to the south store just to hand pick rifles and I'm a member of the Garand Collectors Association. Please no inflated values or auction pricing.

For sale is my IWI Desert Eagle MKXIX in .50 AE. (made in Israel, not the US.) It's in very, very nice condition. Shot very little, I purchased it new, and have shot about 2 boxes of ammo down the pipe. Here is what's included with the gun:

2 original magazines (one is basically new, still stiff)
Original case, takedown tool
About 200 rounds of factory Hornady ammo, that's why the price is high, as the ammo is very expensive. One box of Magnum Research 350gr. SJSP also included.

This is the original model of the Desert Eagle, made in Israel, these are known to function better than some of the US model DE's.

So to wrap up this listing includes:
200 rounds of factory Hornady Ammo (maybe around 180-190, about $35 for a box of 20, you do the math... okay I'll do the math, $350 of ammo)
Extra factory mag (hard to find, there about $40-$50)

I could go on and on about this rifle. I could talk about Mini14 vs. M4/AR platform etc. I bought this initially to test it and to debunk that it can hang with my M4. The fact is, this is a reliable rifle. It is battle ready. It will hold it's own and then some just as it's big brother the M1A / M14. There is a reason why 1 Navy Seal out of every squad is fitted with an M14. I've had much success with this rifle. 1590 rounds through it and not a single FTE, FTF. I've done some work to it to get it where it's at now.

The Rifle is below and so are the groupings at 100 yds. The red circle is 1"" on that 8.5"" x 11"" standard copy paper.  The first single shot is trying to put it through a circle the size of a nickel. Those are not some slow, concentrated 5 min long acquisition shots.

I like these a lot, they stay put after thousands of rounds, stays tight and holds sight. Has dual Aperatures for close up and long distance, that is what makes em cool! And has what I called speed sight in notches on the top for fast acquisition of longer shots!!

I hate to sell it, but I just dont get to shoot as much as I want and its just sitting in my safe. This is a 1988 JJ West German stamped Sig Sauer P226 9mm. This pistol was one of my grandfathers police friends and we found it in his attic about three years ago in the original box. He used it for about three years as a service pistol, then they switched to glocks and he put it away in the box in his attic. 
I took it to a gun smith in Greensboro, he replaced all the springs with factory Sig parts completely dissassembled, cleaned, and light polished the internals. He also took out the original guide rod and replaced it with a polished stainless steel one made in usa. I have put at least 500 rounds down range with zero issues and a trigger that breaks like glass. It has some wear marks and holster wear, but overall in good condition and I would trust my life with it. 
It comes with two RAMLINE 18 round magazines, I also have a couple of MECGAR 18 round magazines that are brand new int he box for sale seperately if interested. 
This pistol also comes with a RARE SIG SAUER HEPCO HOLSTER that was also made in West Germany. These are impossible to find and match the pistol perfectly. Comes with original Law Enforcement Labeled Box, Mags, and Holster. Currently has like new hogue rubber grips and also comes with factory plastic P226 grips as well. Has the german stamping on the frame and slide. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Must have ID, PERMIT, and I will have a Bill of Sale to sign, we will both get a copy. 
Not really open to trades, prefer cash please. If this ad is still up, pistol is for sale. 
Would trade for Glock 17 or 19 and some cash.

2nd Annual Colorado Freedom Shoot
 *** EARLY EVENT DRAFT ***
 Join us for the 2nd Annual Colorado Freedom Shoot at one of Colorado’s largest Public Shooting Ranges, Pawnee Sportsmen’s Center.

This is an event where you’re privately owned Standard (“high”) Capacity magazines are still welcome (course your supposed to have previously purchased them). 
All good law abiding citizens are welcome to enjoy the full freedoms afforded us in the United States of America. Some Colorado politicians have forsaken our nation’s values, sold themselves to out-of-state interests, and caved to party agenda while ignoring the good people of Colorado, sending jobs, revenues, and manufacturers to other states. An arbitrary number of rounds to be held in a magazine was plucked out of the air in a feel good measure “to do something” while ignoring all real solutions to public safety for you & I and all other Colorado Residents. We here in Colorado, We the People of Colorado “did something too”, the good citizens of Colorado fired (Re-called with a capital R) the Colorado State Senate President (D) for his blatant disregard of their voices of reason and we continue to support the strong efforts to restore our State’s name back to being that of a Free Sate. Incredible and very special people who support our Freedoms will be available for all to rub elbows with.

From the LWRC website:
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.
