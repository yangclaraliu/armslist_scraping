The sight and mount are both in excellent used condition. Mounted once on an picatinny flat-top, and fired approximately 100 rounds while mounted. No scratches or cosmetic damage on the sight. One small scuff on the mount. Both work perfectly as intended. I actually hate to sell these but I can't really afford to keep such a luxury item right now. I paid approximately $750 for this optic and mount just this past summer, so I'm sure you'll be satisfied with your purchase."

That's just what inventor Jason Giddings and his new company, Inteliscope, LLC, decided to do when they combined guns with smart devices to launch the Inteliscope Tactical Rifle Adapter. Along with an iOS app, the adapter allows gun owners to mount their iPhone or iPod Touch to a firearm and use it as a sight with a heads-up display showing real-time data on their surroundings. The Inteliscope adapter provides a protective cover for an iPhone or iPod Touch that can quickly attach and release from a Picatinny (Mil-STD-1913) or Weaver tactical rail. Using an app, the iOS device can then act as a gun sight, complete with 5x digital zoom and an adjustable mount that lets users peek around corners. The app also works in portrait mode, so the adapter can be affixed to the side of a firearm if needed. It's hard to imagine an iPhone giving a clearer view than a standard scope, but the included app does offer some features to turn it into a handy heads-up display. Aside from a choice of different cross hairs, users will be able to see data on local prevailing winds, GPS coordinates, a compass, ballistics info, and a shot timer, all at a glance. The attached device can even act as a mounted flashlight or strobe, but probably the most useful feature is the ability to record and play back video of each shot."

It's a compact pistol with the full firepower of eight rounds of .45 ACP (seven in the magazine and one in the chamber). The aluminum alloy frame and carbon steel slide and barrel result in a weight of 29 ounces unloaded, making it an excellent choice for carry.

The sights on the 457 are fixed white dot. The rear sight has rounded edges to eliminate snagging on clothing. The pistol is finished in a durable matte black for eliminating glare. The magazine has a rubber extension that serves as a finger rest as well as an aid in slamming the magazine home.

I have 4 additional polymer mags and 1 Yugoslavian steel magazine available.

Purchased NEW. The rifle has been sighted in and 240 rounds fired through it after purchase. The rifled has been zeroed at 100 yards to 2-3"" MOA. Paper plate shots at 200 yards were easy with this yugo. It cycles absolutely flawlessly. I have wrapped paracord around the folding stock bars to enhance cheek weld (and also because I like the way it looks). I replaced the standard polymer forend with a metal UTG quad-rail ($50 value). The quad rail comes with all parts, extra bolts, and rubber rail covers. Also installed is a MagPul Forward Assist to enhance support hand grip. I installed a rubber buffer behind the spring; this further protects the receiver from the countless rounds this AK is made to fire. The sights have the unique M70 flip up night sight attachments on them which you can add radioactive tritium inserts into if you so choose. Grenade launcher site, thick re-enforced trunion. This is a real M70 AB2 which are getting almost impossible to find these days. This is not a ""PAP"" AK like you see all over armslist and for sale elsewear -- PAPs don't have the features that the M70 does because they are made for import into the american civilian ""sporting"" market.

 The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today's
 shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
 and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
 lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic

Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable  “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface.

This gun includes an extra MR magazine [7 rounds] and 200 boxes [20 rds ea.] - 400 total rounds of factory 300 -325 Gr. ammo. This gun and the ammo are very hard to find on the open market, NIB [New in the box] as these are. I have four as described herein for $15K.

This piece is USED but in GOOD condition with light wear due to use with a holster. This pistol has been diligently maintained and cleaned after each occasion of use and periodically when not in use for extended periods while being kept in the safe. I am a firearms collector and I take care to diligently maintain all of my guns. This particular gun is ITALIAN MADE and IMPORTED, that is, this is not a US made 92FS. Moreover, this piece is also constructed using ALL STAINLESS/METAL PARTS unlike the newer models of the 92FS which use plastic parts...These include the de-cocker mechanism and the guide rod which are metal components FROM THE FACTORY IN ITALY. Of additional favor is the ABSENCE of ""lawyer proof"" rollmarks. This means that this pistol does NOT have the warning roll marks which are included on all modern 92FS pistols. The italian PROOF MARKS on the exterior frame and on the barrel are also clearly visible and pristine. This is a really nice piece for Beretta collectors and firearms aficionados alike. Included with this pistol are TWO FACTORY 15rd 9mm MAGS, original to the gun. In addition, I have installed Hogue wrap around rubber grips as I prefer them for comfort while shooting, however, I do have the orginal black Beretta grips. I am willing to consider any and all offers, I would however prefer a trade for a NEW Gen 4 Glock 20SF w/ all the accessories and maybe some extra goodies. As stated, I will consider all offers.

Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface.

Will not meet other than Binghamton Area. Will not ship. If you're going to bitch about the price you have no life. This is not including the price of gas to go find these either. I bought this in the intent of buying a 10/22, but instead bought an Arsenal Ak, due the the scarcity of the 22LR Cartridge, but the abundance of the 7.62x39. Thanks for reading.

Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride - Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface. The DE is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. Warranty papers are in each box, including safety cable and Bolt tool.

Desert Eagle Technical Data
General Features

The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired."

It also has a polished trigger shoe up grade and a Hogue grip sleeve.  Additionally, it comes with 2 factory Megar 10 round magazines, 2 trigger locks and a hard storage case. This gun runs smoothly with out jamming or any other malfunction. 
Manufactures description:
   The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds ten rounds, or twelve rounds in states not limited to 10 round magazines. Both fit flush to the bottom of the pistol. At 14 oz (400 g) unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires nine pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith and Wesson 59 series magazines.[2] An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59 style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12 round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, belt clips, steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray and OD green colored polymer grip housings, night sights and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer."

It is chambered in 6.5x55 Swede and comes in box with owners manual. Check out the MFG Specs below:

The CZ 550 FS features a classic Bavarian-style Mannlicher stock, steel muzzle cap and a 3-position safety. This safety is unique in the CZ line to the FS and Carbine - Kevlar models. It locks the bolt and is on 'safe' when fully to the rear, remains on 'safe' with the bolt unlocked for unloading in the mid position and is ready to fire with the bolt unlocked in the forward position.

While the aesthetics of this model remind us of rifles from times gone by, with its short 20.6"" barrel, fast handling stock and iron sights, it is even today perhaps the most appropriate configuration for quick shots required when hunting in dense cover.

I bought this shotgun to keep in my vehicle for high-threat situations while working on a tactical enforcement unit in Las Vegas after EAS'ing from the United States Marine Corps. I built this with nothing more than function and flawlessness in mind, no tacti-cool BS. Wilson Tactical sells ones just like this for $1500+, so I decided to build my own with the same parts. I carried it and put around 60 rounds through this one, using my other 870 junker to train on. This has sat in a case in my vehicle or in my gun safe since I have owned it. The shotgun is flawless. This shotgun started off as a Remington 870 tactical with the door breacher muzzle, 18.5 inch barrel, and pistol grip stock. Below is a list of add-on's, and you can do the research on pricing:

-MagPul Forward Sling Mount (Ambidextrious)
-Daniel Defense Sling Mount Remington 870 Burnsed (Right Hand)
-Wilson Combat Jumbo Head Safety, Rem. 870
-Tac-Star 6 Shell Side Saddle Carrier, Fixed
-Tac-Star 8 Shot Magazine Extension
-Professionally Polished Action- Slide Rails, Trigger, Bolt, and Bolt Carrier
-Upgraded Stainless Spring and High Visibility Mag Follower 
-Blue Force Gear Vickers Combat Application Sling, 2 pt, quick detachable (discontinued model)

I understand most backyard shooters aren't interested in slings, let alone a combat sling. The price reflects the firearm minus the sling. I am asking less than I am into it. I prefer to keep the sling as it is discontinued, but will throw it in for extra. I don't need feed back or comments, only serious inquiries and serious offers. Don't waste my time, and I won't waste yours. I will consider trades up or down, as I am looking at picking up an M1014 I carried in the Marine Corps to replace it, and we both know the thousands they command. Feel free to reply with any serious questions or offers, and I hope we can work something out."

Excellent gun for hunting whitetails, hogs or inexpensive centerfire plinking. This gun has a 16 inch barrel and is very light and compact. It would make a great home defense, youth or ladies gun. 

The good: it is a Winchester, has the best trigger pull I have ever found on a factory lever action, slick operating action, good clean bore, reasonably accurate - shoots 3 1/2 inch groups at 80 yards with cheap ammunition and iron sights, fast handling, a joy to carry, and the stock is in very good condition with just a few minor scratches. It is absolutely fun to shoot!

The bad and ugly: This is a hunter/shooter grade firearm. While everything works perfect, this gun was not babied by its former owner. There are scratches, wear marks and some previous rust freckles on the receiver and barrel that are not a big deal for a utility field gun but in the real world make it less desirable for collectors and folks looking for perfection.  I did my best to take photos that fairly represent the cosmetic defects.

Give this gun a good home and put some venison on your table. Despite its cosmetic imperfections, it still is a handsome Winchester that will not lose value.

Comes with a bikini top and frames for a full soft top. Super fun to bomb around in. Tires are 30x9.5R15 BFG Mud Terrains with a ton of tread and a brand new full size spare (the ones shown mounted in the pictures have been replaced. See the picture of just the tire, they all look like that) . There is some rust damage with cheap body work. Paint job is sloppy in my opinion, but it looks decent going down the road. No rust issues on the frame. It runs great, just drove it on a 2hr trip to the Outer Banks with no issues. The trans is okay, 3rd gear syncro is fading and 4th gear syncro is dead so it must be double clutched when shifting into 4th. Exhaust system replaced recently. There is a short between the right turn signal/brake/marker lights, I think it's in the rear lamp assembly. There is a little bit of a wobble around 50-55 mph but nothing preventing it from going on the highway (pretty standard for jeeps) 

The winch pictured has been removed but the mounting plate is included. I would like to keep the winch for another vehicle but I will sell it with the jeep for the right offer.

Selling because I got a new project truck and I need to make some room.
