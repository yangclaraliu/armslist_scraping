This rifle has been in our family for over 30 years, has a few hunts and just shot enough to sight it in and give an excuse to clean and oil it every so often. There is a bit of oxidation in a few spots, very minor, but I also have an extra barrel with it sealed in grease paper. I can only assume the extra barrel is also RIA, but can't say for sure. Included is a Leupold scope, either 4x or 8x (not sure) with no lens covers. I have 30 rds of factory ammo and 100+ rounds of safe reloads - my dad has been reloading for 40 years and all his loads are by the book, if you want the ammo. I've got a sissy pad on it at the moment which you can have as well. If you want them, you may have the hard case and trigger lock as well. Most of the 1903's listed are $375 and up and don't have all these extras. I want to sell this quickly, preferably locally, and I'm asking $350.

higher magazine capacity and is completely interchangeable with any other
92 family magazine. The A1's frame includes an integral Mil-Std 1913 rail

buffer increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver. The
single one piece captive recoil spring assembly simplifies the assembly and

Love this rifle, had it for less than a year and never got to take it hunting. Shot about 40 times at the range out to 350 yards, consistency held zero. With this scope, I could dial in @20X and easily hit targets all day. The scope has really cool push/pull locks so you never need to worry about dials getting bumped or moving. Lightweight and perfect for hunting anything in North America with the 30-06. I am trying to save up money for a truck once I finish TACP School. Iâve itemized the list below that part of this package for only $345. Email or text REDACTED.

RIFLE â Mossberg ATR (All-Terrain Rifle) 100 â 30-06 Springfield. Black synthetic Monte Carlo checkered stock. 22â Free-floated barrel to recoil lugs. 1/10 Twist Barrel. 4+1 top loading magazine. Swivel studs. 13.5 length of pull. It has a recessed muzzle crown that is great for barrel life. Recoil pad and side-lever safety for easy access. Wt. 6.6lbs. 

SCOPE â BSA Panther 6.5-20X44. The Panther has fully multicoated camera quality glass lenses for superior image quality in any lighting condition. It has double-protected from extreme temperature change by the dual o-ring seal system on both the objective and ocular lenses. Patented âpush/pullâ locking system. Includes hood and haze filter. It has a parallax adjustment from 25 yards to infinity. Â¼ MOA windage and elevation knobs. (MSRP $180)

RINGS â DNZ Mossberg ATR Long Action in Matte Black. Machined one piece design for extreme accuracy. No moving parts between firearm and scope. Lightweight. Approximately a third of the weight of steel. These are perfect ring alignment with no lapping required. This eliminates or reduces scope damage from tightening rings. They are made of billet tempered aluminum. Grade 8 hardened steel screws. (MSRP $60)

BIPOD â Blackhawk Sportster Pivot Bipod 6â-9â. This swivel bipod is compact and lightweight, it helps you hit your target. Swivel feature eliminates rifle canting on uneven terrain for a better aim. It also has a rapid-adjust pivot lever for faster shooting and provides for unshakable prone and bench shooting. The no-rust anodized legs have spring-returns that make adjustments easy. Lifetime warranty. (MSRP $60)

RELOADING SUPPLIES â RCBS and Lee Precision 30-06 Dies and trimming tools. I will no longer need these, and will just buy some in your rifleâs caliber. I will also throw in about 150 brass casings that have been decapped, sized, trimmed and polished. 

AMMO â I also have 2 boxes of 30-06 ammo that I will no longer need. Herterâs and Remington Core Lokt."

We took it to the range two weeks ago and unfortunately, it's just not going to be a hobby for her. Now I'm stuck with a pink handgun...not the manliest firearm I own.

Just in time for Valantine's Day, give that beautiful shooter of yours an awesome present! This is NEARLY brand new. Only 20 rounds have been shot. Everything is included and I'll throw in 20 9mm rounds as well. It would be great for defensive carry and is fun to shoot. I'm making no profit at all. $300 is what I have in it. I simply don't need a pink gun and would like to spend the money I get back from this on a better-but-belated Christmas gift for my girl.

Trunnion, bolt and bolt carrier have matching numbers and the rifle is basically in mint condition. It's better than new in that the God-awful thumbhole stock has been replaced with a standard AK stock (also has spot to store cleaning kit in the stock). Installed a nice Hogue pistol grip and Tapco handguards with a rail on the upper handguard.

For those that don't know, the NHM-91 is a bit heavier duty than a standard AK. It has a thicker receiver than standard AKs and has a 20 inch chrome lined barrel. The longer sight line (due to the longer barrel) gives the NHM91 the reputation as being one of the most accurate AKs, and for that reason the rail is nice--you're ready to throw a red dot on there.

Comes with a 30rd Chinese steel mag that locks in nice and tight. Price is firm; there aren't many of these out there and this one is in excellent condition. Plus the upgrades have some value as well. The only trades I'd be interested in would be for a lesser (but decent and functional) AK in 7.62 or 5.45 and cash. I guess I'd prefer cash though. If you're interested send me a message and I'll get back to you ASAP.

Thanks for looking

Brand new, never used. This is the latest and most compact EOTech magnifier that's shorter and has a quick detach base. Great for quickly switching from long range to CQB shooting. 

$475 OBO. I am willing to ship.



From EOTech website:
The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

At the end of the 1982 Israel Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close quarters engagements and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission.

Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) the TAVOR rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a MilSpec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high impact strength polymer uni body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy.

Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF tested and approved magazines but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Both of these pistols are literally almost new. The 23 is a .40 cal and the 17 is a 9mm both have no scratches nor finish issues. you basically are looking at two brand new pistols for sale. The 23 is less than 4 months old and the 17 is less than a year old. I took them both to the range twice and put aprox 200 rounds through each. They were both bought out of bradis brand new. I have all of the accessories and boxes glock provides as well as holsters for both. will sell the 17 for 450 and the 23 for 490. these are fair and if you are interested in a package i will sell them for a discount. i am a glock activist and i have no desire for either of these pistols I am willing to wheel and deal.
