You can offer trades but really just looking to thin out collection. Maybe a nice 12 ga. If you have cash text me at 717940538five. I'm having problems with the email off of armslist"

I will sell it with out the CT laser for $350 if you wish but and extra $100 is a deal on it, they sell for $179 and up.  I have 2 of them so am parting with one. I did not know how well made and nice of a gun these were until I started reading about them.  The customer service is excellent and they have a lifetime warranty.

From what I have been told this is a true warrior’s carbine and it was kept to show that. This is not an imitation. Not an import, and no rebuilt marks.
This is a rifle kept by a veteran for a lifetime, and due to no heirs, now has come the time to pass it to someone else. This carbine was in the war but it has been kept in excellent condition, and was not shot for many long years.  It has the bayonet lug, the mag release and the rear sights that were added later on by the military.
I am no expert in the field, but I am trying to explain and post pictures with what I have. These are the markings and info about this firearm (I have pictures with all of them):
“Inland Div. 2969XXX” marked under the rear sight on the receiver.
“US Carbine Cal. 30 M1” marked on the receiver, close to the barrel.
“Inland MFG. General Motors, 1-43” is marked on the top at the front of the barrel
“I.R.CO 7160060” marked on the adjustable rear sight. 
Last three markings just mentioned above still have most of the white paint in the groves.
“N” is marked on the front sight.
“Inland” is stamped on the Trigger housing assembly.
“M” is marked on the Magazine catch.
“P.I” is stamped inside the operating slide.
Different numbers marked on the integral gas cylinder.
“KI” is marked on the front band assembly.
“H.I.” is stamped on the hammer.
“M” in a circle is stamped on the safety.
“AI” is stamped on the bolt
“LA” are the last to letters stamped on the firing pin for Rock-Ola. I did not disassemble the bolt, but you can see the letters with the pin assembled. 
“SI” is marked on the oiler
“DI” is marked on the recoil plate
“OI” is marked on the sling well of the stock, and the acceptance “P” mark in a circle is partially visible on the bottom of the stock. No other marks on the stock.
“OI” is marked on the inside (side wall) of the hand guard.
The metal butt plate is original Inland, in perfect like new condition.
The stock is walnut rare high wood, and it is nice, smooth and solid, no cracks or repairs, with only a few old and minor dings. It was cleaned in the past so it might have lost some of its shine. 
The hand guard has two deeper old dents and a minor chip from hitting something either in the war or during transportation somewhere. I took pictures of those so that you can see. These are the only blemishes that I see on the gun.
It also comes with the original magazine pouch that goes over the butt plate. The pouch is marked ”US” on the front and RUBON K.C. 1942 on the back. It is lightly used, but like new.
It comes with two 15 round magazines marked “AI” for Inland. They are used, but in very good condition. 
The original finish on the metal is about 99%.
Bore is shiny with no signs of rust or pitting.
This is a very hard to find original with all the parts made and/or marked by or for Inland.
It also comes with an original bayonet and scabbard.
“USMA8 BMCO” is marked on the scabbard.
“USM4 UTICA” and the flaming bomb are marked on the bayonet guard. One side of the bayonet guard (with the round hole that goes over the barrel), got broke some time in the past, and it looks welded or glued back together. It is not visible unless you look closely.
There is also an original NRA printed booklet about M1 Carbine functions, parts, assembly and disassemble, etc…
The collection comes in a dark brown painted patriotic box that has been equipped with lockable draw bolts, 2 new locks with a key that fits both, and heavy duty handle. The box also serves as a carrying case.
It is a perfect gun for someone who collects these vintage items, or wants to offer a great gift to their father or grandfather that fought in a war for the American flag.
REDACTED
I can send more pictures if I am not able to download all of them on the website, or upon request.
I realize that you can buy a cheaper M1 Inland, but if you want something special, early edition, this is it. I know that an original in mint, almost new condition goes for $2500. I will let this one go for much less."

I have a LNIB Ruger LCP for sale. It is .380 auto, holds 6+1 rounds, and I have only put 100 rounds downrange (all FMJ). It functioned flawlessly, and the serial number is in the range manufactured after the hammer recall, so no need to worry about that.

The gun originally came with only one magazine, but I purchased two more genuine Ruger mags made in Italy. The gun new is about $290 before tax and transfer fees, while the mags cost me a whopping $45 each (yeah that sucked). I am selling everything you see in the picture, which is:

1) 1 Ruger LCP pistol ($289.99 before tax and fees)
2) 3 Genuine Ruger magazines ($45 EA)
3) 18 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense in the mags ($20 per box of 20)
4) 40 rounds of Speer Gold Dot ($20 per box of 20)
5) 1 De Santis stippled pocket holster (something like $25)

If you add it up, I spent about $500 for everything here. I am selling the whole package for $360 since I do not have the original box, manual, or gun lock that came with it. This is such a great pistol for concealed carry, with the holster it does not print (at least for me). I would like this gone by this afternoon (Fri, 1/17/14), shoot me a reasonable offer!"

The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

I have had this rifle for three years and have used it for various hunting purposes. It has been extremely reliable and has never jammed on me once. It has been very well maintained and does not have any rust or any other issues. 

Very reliable, VERY accurate, and an overall great rifle. I replaced the iron sites with an Eotech XPS2 holographic sight and an Eotech 3x magnifier with a flip-to-side mount, which really helps increase the accuracy out to 150+ yards. The magnifier easily comes off to be used as a monocular that I use instead of having to carry around binoculars while hunting. I also replaced the original synthetic stock with a tactical Tapco stock with vertical forward grip and 2-point strap system. Lastly, I have 2 - 30 round magazines that are not pictured that I will be included in the deal if interested.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.



The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

Up for sale is an excellent example of a hard to find complete correct as-issued M1 Rifle from WWII. Condition is overall excellent with over 95% original finish. Typical dings and wear in stock and finish wear on high points, but that's to be expected. No import marks, rebuild marks, repairs, cracks, or evidence of rebuilding, sanding, refinishing or restoring. 8/44 dated original Springfield Armory barrel has TE 0.0 and ME 0.0 and mirror bright sharp bore. No chrome at gas port and chamber in the white. Un-modified revision 9 curve side operating rod, lock-bar rear sights, and very nice SA/GAW cartouche stock with nice matching hanguards. No buggered screws or any signs rifle was played with. You would be hard pressed to find a better example of a very desirable as-issued WWII M1 rifle. A great addition to any M1 or US Martial collection."

This is just the barrel and receiver, no stock.  Everything you see in the photos comes with it minus the magazine and ammo.  Price is $200 OBO.  Money, money orders, personal checks (must clear before turning over weapon), gold bars, silver bars, old coins/paper money, etc....accepted.  Cannot do credit cards though, sorry.  No PayPal either.

I am not sure how old the receiver/barrel is but as best I can tell it is late 1970s or 1980s.  The lands and grooves of the barrel are very distinct and not worn or pitted.  15 and 30 round magazines feed both FMJ and HPs (I used Aguilla FMJ and Hornady Critical Defense as test feedings).  The receiver has the adjustable, unmarked rear sight, much like late WWII/rebuilt M1 Carbines.  Front sight is standard blade sight.  The magazine release has a ""M"" stamped on it, possibly surplus military (see magazine release ""B"" here: http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff325/x97541x/milsurps/carb_mwo_magcatch.jpg).    The barrel band appears to be similar to a Type III except it has no bayonet lug.  Serial number is in the 458xxx range.  No GI markings on the receiver, hammer or trigger that I can see.  Has a small lever on the rear right that acts as a slide catch, unlike GI M1 Carbines.  More pictures are available upon request, just ask!  Price includes shipping and FFL from my FFL (you are responsible for the FFL transfer fee on your end)."

This is a completed ZK-22. The ZK-22 is a custom aftermarket stock made by Red Jacket Firearms in Baton Rouge, LA. The stock is a copy of the FN PS90, I've been asked if it was one. The action and barrel are from a Ruger 10/22, so it will always be reliable and will shoot any .22LR rounds you put in it.

The stock moves the action to behind the trigger, making it fit nicer and be more comfortable to shoot. The barrel is still the stock length (18.5in) but since it's moved back, it feels like you have a shorter gun.

There is a top rail for mounting optics. On the front there are nuts preinstalled on either side for attaching accessory rails for lights/lasers/ect.

I have somewhere around 400rds thru it, unsure of how many more (was a used 10/22 before I got it). I cleaned it after every range session, as I do all my guns. It is fun to shoot, lightweight and really accurate (like any Ruger 10/22 would be).

The scope is probably a little much for it. Its a 3-9X zoom, 40mm lens. It's zeroed in at 100yds, which is a little much for a .22lr rifle. The scope is meant for a larger caliber hunting rifle. It was on sale when I was looking, so that's why I have it.

List of all parts pictured and their original prices:
Ruger 10/22 Action and Barrel         $150

I upgraded myself to an AR15, so I just don't shoot this anymore. Looking to sell as a complete package. Asking $500obo for the whole package. If you don't want the scope then it'll be $50 less.

I won't sell it to you without a valid Handgun Purchase Permit or CCW Permit to prove you can legally own it. I currently have it in Nebraska, so if you are from Iowa (or it you'd rather), I will meet you at an FFL holder of your choosing. If done at an FFL, buyer pays any related transfer costs."

Compact (pocket sized), dual-output SureFire® E2D LED Defender® flashlight is designed for self-defense and personal protection. The E2D LED Defender® features a solid-state, two-stage light emitting diode that generates six times the output of a typical two-D-cell flashlight at its high setting and five lumens of useful light (enough to read a map or negotiate a dark path) on low. And should 120 lumens of blinding light not be enough to convince an aggressor to back off, the E2DL's crenellated Strike Bezel® and scalloped tailcap provide two sets of hard-anodized aluminum ""teeth"" as a last line of defense.

I believe in a fair price so, I did some research online and they're selling for around $600 new without shipping. Besides a scuff or two from moving it mine is in excellent condition. With that said I think my price is fair. The last thing you want is a model light enough for a coupe guys to pick up when it's full of all your expensive guns and valuables. Sorry I don't have a picture of the inside I currently have all my stuff in it and didn't want to advertise what I have. The inside is carpeted with adjustable shelves. I have all the original paperwork and parts to go with it.

I cannot deliver or help lift because I have a bad back. Please come with a truck and help to load it please. If your wondering why I am selling its because I am getting a larger safe.

I am available today-Sunday. I'm not interested in trades at this time. If you have any questions please feel free to text me at 216-five77-three884. Here is a link which shows all the specifications and dimensions. Thanks for your time.
