I've got this beautiful CzechPoint VZ-58 rifle I've had for years (since before Obama took office), but now that I have another rifle in this caliber, I can't really justify having two.

If you are unfamiliar with VZ-58's, just imagine a more ergonomic AK-47 that is more accurate, lighter, with a milled receiver, and really works more like an MP44 (short stroke piston) than an AK.  Okay, in actuality it doesn't have a lot in common with the AK except for its looks...

This rifle was well cared for and is completely flawless.  Here are some things the rifle has with it:

* Aftermarket grip
* Birdcage muzzle device
* [Troy (NorthEastern Arms) hold-zero aluminum top rail and aluminum forend](http://www.vz58rifle.com/products/predpazbi-troy/) (cost me like $300)
* Bottom rail
* Buttstock recoil pad
* Bayonet lug
* Folding stock (paratrooper model)

This is my last .40 I'm consolidating down to .45ACP and 9mm only. So I'm looking to trade it as a package. It will come with the pistol, hard case, paperwork, two larger back straps, cleaning rod/brush, four 15rd mags one of which is marked LE/Gov only for you glock buffs about a $50 value. I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol. Due to this being my last .40 I am also adding 100rds of FMJ and 55rds of quality jacketed hallow points. I am putting the specs from glocks web-sight below.

This 8mm Mauser is an Italian Carcano M38 conversion.  I've put hundreds of rounds through it, and it shoots nice and safely.  I've shot military surplus ammo and modern hunting rounds.  I am also including a modified en bloc stripper clip that allows you to load the magazine with 5 rounds.  This is a rare combination to find the Carcano and a stripper clip to fit it.  The stock on this gun is in solid condition, but there are a lot of signs of wear.  I have been through the whole action and mechanism.  It is clean and in good working condition.  

This is a great piece whether you want a BIG boom to impress the others at the gun range or if you want an authentic piece of history to add to your collection. 

I prefer to sell locally person to person, but I will ship it if you pay the shipping costs.  I will be traveling to Boise on Thursday, April 10th.  I can deliver this gun to anywhere between Idaho Falls and Boise. 

I'm pretty firm at $250, but I'm open to trades.  I'm looking for other rifles in calibers smaller than 8mm.  I have cash to add to the right deal.

Last fall, I bought this used Glock 17 from a local gun shop and from what I was told, this was an original owner who carried it a lot but shot it little.  This is an original Gen 1 Glock 17, with German proof marks and an EB serial number which places its date of manufacture in 1988 -- the early years when Glocks hit the scene and were what some consider to be at their best.

The pistol has slide wear toward the front on both sides from being carried but otherwise is in  very good condition.  Since I bought this used, approximate round count is unknown.  Unfortunately, there was no box when I bought it.   Aside from the pistol, it will come with two original 17 round Glock magazines.  If you know your Glocks and appreciate a Gen 1, then you understand how much fun the G17 is in this series.

Asking $425 FIRM/CASH ONLY.  I live in Pierce County and will drive a reasonable distance to meet you.  You MUST have a valid Washington State driver's license and a valid Washington State Concealed Pistol License.  I just need to peek quickly at each.  No trade offers, please.

The original stock was painted black when I bought it a year ago, probably to hide a slight crack in it that revealed itself after about 100 rounds... It has:
-Tapco Intrafuse SKS Extended Mag Catch installed
-Synthetic SKS hand guard installed
-BARSKA SKS Mount with Integrated Rail, uninstalled
-UTG SKS Shell Deflector, uninstalled
-Front sight adjustment tool
-Bayonet mount bipod, uninstalled

-Receiver cover mount w/ top and side weaver rails, uninstalled
-NcStar SKS Gas Tube Weaver Scope Mount, uninstalled
-Original hanguard, uninstalled
-2x PROmag 20rd magazines
-120rds ammo
The gun shoots great, and I had planned on turning it into a bullpup gun, but job circumstances dictated otherwise...

1948 Beech Stock
The K31 is a very well made and unique rifle using the straight-pull bolt action.  They are largely in very good condition because the Swiss took excellent care of them and did not use corrosive ammunition. This one is a typical specimen that has a slightly dinged up butt stock which was common given use of ice cleats. It is chambered in 7.5x55 also referred to as 7.5 Swiss which is quite comparable to the .308 Win-even using .308 diameter bullets.  These are also INCREDIBLY ACCURATE shooters.  With Surplus Swiss GP11 ammunition (available from Midway, others) they can shoot extremely well.  All serial numbers match."

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Rosewood Grips round out this package.

Here are some of the new upgrades It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1) It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left"
