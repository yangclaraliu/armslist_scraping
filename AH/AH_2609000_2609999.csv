Questions? Shoot me a message.  Cash FTF in Fridley or Burnsville.

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only, shipping additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

    In terms of power, 9x18 is about half way between .380 and 9mm.
    I have shot probably 500 rounds through it, and I have NEVER had any failures of any kind no matter how I grip it or how well it is lubricated; this gun is very reliable.
    The barrel has polygonal rifling and is pinned to the frame, which makes this a very accurate handgun, as accurate as any I have shot.
    The recoil spring has been replaced with a Wolf spring, which really smoothed out the recoil.
    New grips from CZ USA are included and have never been installed on the gun.  I was going to parkerize the gun because the original paint is chipping, but I never got around to it.  The paint is worn, but this is a great shooter.

The following 9x18 ammo is included:
    374 rounds (~7 1/2 boxes) of Silver Bear FMJ
    48 rounds (~2 boxes) of Hornady XTP hollow points

And before you ask, no, I won't deliver it to Indianapolis.  If you are willing to pay for shipping to your local FFL, or if you have a C&R license, I can ship it."

Works great, looks good. Spent shells are dumped from the bottom. There's a wing the slaps the old shell out and then throws the new shell up into the receiver. The timing is correct and it functions amazingly for its age. I've read that these are collectors items, but I think it's just a nice old design that gets the job done. The 10A is the WWI trench gun. This one was made for civilian use. Skeet, waterfowl and so-on. A lot of people like to saw these off to look like the 10A. My opinion is if you have a 30"" barrel in 12G, you got a lot of options there.

USP:: back to pistols | general | specifications :::: select an image ::   USP

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer framePolygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel lifeCan be converted to any of nine trigger firing modesCorrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finishOversized trigger guard for use with glovesOne piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steelAmbidextrous magazine release leverExtended slide releasePatented Lock-Out Safety deviceUSP Variants:

Variant 1:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Variant 2:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on right side of frame.

Variant 3:  Double action/single action without ""SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on left side of frame.

i drive it almost everyday. there are no issues with this truck. burns no oil, coolant or whatever else you can think of. 
would really like to get rid of this this truck this weekend due to an upcoming deployment. a Gun is easier to store than 3 vehicles.

Ive been asking 1750 cash on the truck. if you want it thats fine. Trade wise the Ar-15 must at least be a package value of 1200 for me to consider. Thompson by itself id trade straight across. my loss is your gain. I need it gone, i have no where to keep it.

Included are two Factory Browning Invector choke tubes in Modified and Improved Cylinder. 

The condition is good. The shotgun shoots perfectly with absolutely no mechanical issues. There are some areas showing wear in the bluing and a small cosmetic scratch on the barrel about 1 inch from the muzzle. A very solid firearm with many years of use left.

FROM THE WEBSITE: ""BPS. A solid steel reputation for durability and dependability.
 Few firearms ever earn the level of respect the Browning BPS boasts. The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working in spite of what Mother Nature does to stop it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise because the BPS has what most other pump shotguns don’t — features like rigid dual machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation, and legendary Browning balance and handling. That’s why the BPS continues to be the pump shotgun serious shotgunners like you can always rely on."""

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. 

The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. 

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

- yes do have original forward grips
- 22 inches folded / 37 inches with stock extended

When I list a gun on here I usually take a loss and sell than my LE pricing I get them for. AND FOR THE HONEST PEOPLE HERE SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE MY RANT. But I'm sure you understand.
The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models"
