The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite and Mustang XSP are small, lightweight and boast enhanced durability, reliability and accuracy, making either an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining process, use of high quality materials and improvements in design make Colt’s new .380 Mustang Pocketlite and Mustang XSP two of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the market. The stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. With loaded magazines, each of these handguns weighs less than one pound. They both measure 5.5 inches long and have a 2.75-inch barrel. The minimal weight and length of these guns, combined with the short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs and firing pin safety block make these firearms ideal for personal protection.

Usually this will drag on for a while, and will involve the ""buyer"" wanting to send a much larger check than required, and of course wanting you to return the difference. They don't even want your property, they only want you to cash their phoney check against your bank account, and cheat you out of your own money in the form of a ""refund"". You will end up getting ripped off for however much you give them. Most banks will verify funds before cashing any check, but if you've been with them a while they may cut you some slack, and only help you to get scammed.

Be careful and good luck."

I also never fired the gun and kept it in my humidity controlled safe. 
It is in its original blue box from the factory with the tool kit and the paperwork and it also comes with about a dozen full moon clips and a half dozen half moon clips.
The bad: Unfortunately there is a scratch on the end of the barrel. It was there when I bought it. This gun is priced according taking into consideration the small scratch.
The gun is a beautiful piece and very collectible. The 2nd picture shows the scratch as best as I could capture it.

Price is $1075 FIRM    REDUCED NOW $850 FIRM!

These guns are selling well beyond book value, just check the auction sites and remember the minimum bid is not what they are selling for, the person may have a reserve set.  I have this gun priced very fairly.

With all the scams going on these days I really don't want to ship this gun.  Now even cashiers checks and postal money orders are being faked and very good fakes that fool the banks and your stuck, so any scammers looking to contact me please don't waste either of our time.  The only way I will ship this is if I receive your funds and I let them clear my bank well beyond when the funds become available.  Paypal is a good option. I believe the bank said it can be up to 3 weeks after I deposit a cashiers check before they really discover if its a fraud sometimes.

308,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2409308,For Sale/Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Washington, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 4, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Current retail price on this is between $1.25/round and $1.50/round - I am only asking $1.00 per round for cash offers.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

(I highly recommend leaving the stock on unless you're Rambo - I saw one guy firing this model with only the pistol grip and his wrist was NOT happy afterwards.......)

Price is firm - no low ball offers, please. Must have KY driver's license & be willing to sign a bill of sale. CCDW preferred.

time of 60 minutes. The X2 and X2L easily mount to most subcompact pistol
rails utilizing Insight's patented Slide-Lock interface. The ambidextrous
rocker switch allows the X2 and X2L to be activated in either a Momentary
On or Constant On mode. A two position laser switch on the X2L turns the
laser on and off so it can be used in a White Light Only or White Light and
Laser mode.

Hey everyone,
This listing is for a SCCY CPX-2 Bi-Tone 9mm. It has had less than 50 rounds down the pipe and has given me zero issues. It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Will need to meet in or very close to norman due to my time constraints."

No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

ACCURATE SIGHTING SYSTEM features precision-adjustable rear, fixed front sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver®-style scope base adapters (included) for easy mounting of optics.
COMFORTABLE, PRECISION-MOLDED ZYTEL® POLYMER GRIP FRAME with a serrated front strap and backstrap.
This model does not have the replaceable grip panel.
INTERNAL CYLINDRICAL BOLT CONSTRUCTION ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than
conventional moving-slide designs.
MANUAL SAFETY positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in
the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
PATENTED LOADED CHAMBER INDICATOR provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
MAGAZINE DISCONNECT prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
ALSO INCLUDES: bull barrel, contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, a conveniently located push button
magazine release on the left side of the frame, two magazines and plastic hard case.

Don't let that turn you off though, Austrian rifles are some of the finest in the world...I'm sure you've heard of Steyr...and now you're aware of Voere. This rifle has a control round fed mauser action with rear safety lug, not a push feed action. You can look up some of these rifles on Granitearms.com. New rifle price runs $1200-$1400 respectively. You can find them on the big national sites from time to time in the $600-$900 price range for used rifles. Do not confuse Voere, Austria with Voere, Germany...there is a difference.

I have a safe queen, NIB, Glock 21sf with full M1913 picatinny rail, ambidextrous mag release, and night sights. This gun was designed by Glock back in 05-06 for SOCOMs, Joint Combat Pistol program. The program was scratched but Glock had released these onto the market for about 2 years. Maybe a bit less. It came in 3 configurations, very few had the ambidextrous mag release, even fewer had the M1913 rail. Ones with both are hard to find now to say the least, especially NIB. It was a short lived blunder by Glock and there are not too many out there. This comes with two 13 round factory mags, hard case, etc.

This pistol is .45 caliber, with ambidextrous mag releases, night sights, and a unique picatinny rail that is on no other Glock model. Holds 13+1. 

Has never been fired. Brand new in box. Will make a great collectors piece, or one amazing shooter. Asking $725 obo

There may be a small percentage of brass picked up at the range that may or may not have been previously reloaded.  There may also be a small percentage that has been de-primed or that has live primers. (In buying and selling guns, I end up with ammo that I am unsure about, so I pull the bullets and dump the powder)  The live primers are probably still good, but I make no guarantee.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.

No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

Threaded Barrel: The 4.5 inch, factory 1/2-28 thread barrel accepts many popular muzzle accessories. These pistols are some of the best 22 caliber suppressor hosts available. When a muzzle device isn't being employed, protect your barrel's thread and crown with the supplied muzzle cap.
ACCURATE SIGHTING SYSTEM features precision-adjustable rear, fixed front sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver®-style scope base adapters (included) for easy mounting of optics.
COMFORTABLE, PRECISION-MOLDED ZYTEL® POLYMER GRIP FRAME with a serrated front strap and backstrap.
REPLACEABLE GRIP PANEL: this model features replaceable, checkered, cocobolo, 1911-style grip panels for a great appearance and
comfortable, non-slip hold.
INTERNAL CYLINDRICAL BOLT CONSTRUCTION ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than
conventional moving-slide designs.
MANUAL SAFETY positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in
the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
PATENTED LOADED CHAMBER INDICATOR provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
MAGAZINE DISCONNECT prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
ALSO INCLUDES: bull barrel, contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, a conveniently located push button
magazine release on the left side of the frame, two magazines and nylon soft case.

Chambers and triggers are also match grade. They are easier to carry and conceal, and are perfectly balanced.

Like some full-size Kimber pistols, both Pro Carry RL models have an integral Picatinny rail for light mounting. Along with TLE and designated night sight models, they also have Meprolight® night sights.

All Kimber pistols have slide serrations with beveled edges that will not snag clothing or holsters. Serrations are deep and wide to ensure positive grip even with wet or cold hands.

Chambered in .45 ACP, 9mm and 38 Super, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

Some cons
- Missing the muffler, I accidentally sent the stock one to the scrap yard while i had it removed and cleaning out the garage. Ive been trying to find a stock replacement to keep the sale price down but will raise it if I end up having to put an aftermarket one on. It does have a muffler on it but not the correct one. It muffles the sound and gives it proper back pressure. 
- Tear on front right corner of seat
- Small plastic piece under the headlights cracked. No its not attached to the fenders. Fenders are still in great shape.
- One headlight I beleive is burned out. Still has high and low on the one that works.

I am asking a fair price for this quad. If your planning on offering me $500 save your breath. 

I will not allow test drives unless you have cash asking price and I hold it during your test drive.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

I want to give a little background on this gun, I bought it at the gun show in Concord from a guy walking around with it in his hand. I paid $600 for with the under standing it worked great no problems just the modified butt pad. So I said OK what the hell I know the Brand is good and I thought it all worked and wanted a different trap gun so I gave him the money and off I went. Went to the range the next day to try it out and one of the barrels only shoots when it wants too that sucks, but wait after 3 or 4 shots the forward hand guard is cracked! He had used some sort of glue to hold it together. I am not blameless in this deal I should have looked it over a lot better but what can you do? You win some you lose some. So now you know what you are getting if you want to buy this. Atleast I have the courtesy to tell a potential buyer. So make me a reasonable offer and it can be yours. I know I am going to take a loss but I don't need to sell it so don't be ridiculous! If the ad is still up than I still have so don't ask I will not respond."

The engraved figures illustrate a number of Tongass National Forest characteristics and historic features. On one side of the receiver, you see the Tongass National Forest and the centennial dates. Teddy smiling at you, looking “Bully.” An eagle soars, a bear starring at you above the trigger, the magazine reads, “Big Medicine,” the name Teddy gave his .405 on his African hunt in 1909. On the other side of the receiver, you see “Seventeen of One Hundred” among filigreed vines embellishing the magazine. Above it on the left floats a Forest Service ranger boat, the “Tongass Ranger.”  To the left of the Tongass Ranger is a totem pole, representative of the traditionally close ties the forest has to the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples. To the right of the Tongass Ranger is the Forest Service shield. And higher up on the receiver is the recognition that the Forest Service has been engaged in “100 Years of Conservation” on the Tongass National Forest. Absolutely a beautiful gun, and I may add very rare with only 100 being produced."

Item Description:I have here an ATI Sultan 12 gauge Shotgun. Semi auto action, 4+1 capacity, ATI T6  collapse-able stock, side saddle, and 18"" barrel. 
I have shot everything from birdshot through defensive buckshot and have never had any feeding issues. Chambered for 2 3/4"" or 3"".
Would make an excellent home defense or trunk shotgun.
Has a small amount of surface rust on the end of the barrel, that can be seen in the close up pic.

I bought this new, and have enjoyed it very much, but I haven't traded in a while, and it is time."
