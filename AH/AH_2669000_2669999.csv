Great gun, great manufacturer. It's seen some use and holster wear as a carry gun but it's in great condition. Had some trouble with the recoil spring which seems to be resolved now but just in case you're running hotter or weaker loads than I was, I have all of the springs that I've tried out in addition.

All brass comes from an indoor gun range that does not allow reloads to be shot. They're usually pretty good about checking (I can't even sneak mine in), but as always, sometimes they slip through the cracks. Regardless, I would never sell any brass that I would not deem acceptable and safe for my own personal reloads. 

That being said, I currently have the following. Prices do not include shipping. I ship USPS flat rate boxes for everything, priority mail, and will combine shipping. Takes about two days to get anywhere in the lower 48. Local pickup is available. I accept cash, checks, paypal, or USPS money orders. 

All brass or nickeled brass, no steel, no Berdan primers.

I ship USPS flat rate. Anywhere in the country. I accept paypal and USPS money orders. Personal checks are okay with time to clear.

The Ruger Mini-14/30 Ranch rifle is a favorite with Western ranchers for protecting their cattle from coyotes and other predators during calving season. It is also popular with varmint hunters throughout the United States. However, the Ruger proprietary scope ring mounting system available for this rifle severely limits the choice of scopes that can be used and is very expensive to modify. Mini-scopes cannot be used with the Ruger proprietary mounting system and until recently, there were few mounts made that could accommodate mini-scopes on this rifle while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique Picatinny rail scope mount that attaches directly to the integral bases of this rifle and offers the versatility of using Weaver style rings to mount a scope in multiple positions forward or to the rear. This is an ideal mounting system for a mini-scope. 

We used this Picatinny rail system as the platform for a variable power 3-9x40MM mini-target scope. This scope has an adjustable objective lens to fine tune the parallex settings from 10 Yards to Infinity, a feature highly desired by serious target shooters shooting at known, fixed distances. Hunters shooting at distant small game targets will also find this feature advantageous in defining their target more clearly.

To use this scope for hunting, leave the power setting on 3x or 4x power and the parallex setting at infinity. If a close-in or moving target presents itself you are ready to shoot. If the target is at a longer range, increase the power to obtain a better sight picture. If you find a smaller, non-moving target, adjust the power ring for the optimum view and then adjust the objective ring until the target is in fine focus.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your mini-14/30 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

Straight from the first original line-up of Honda to replace the all-terrain 3-wheeler, the Fourtrax series of quad runners had some mighty big trail shoes to fill, but they did not disappoint, and this bad-boy trail racer was no exception. It might be “just” a 250cc, but this quad is NOT for the kids. The top end of the motor has been bored for that extra “pop” in speed, and this racer jumps off the starting line better than most new models,....... you won't be disappointed.

This machine has been ridden hard, but has also been maintained with genuine Honda OEM mechanical parts, and regular oil and air filter changes. It has never been sunk in the mud or wrecked. The frame is in perfect condition, and there are no fluid leaks from the motor or mechanics.

 In the last 300 miles of riding and in addition to the minor maintenance, it has also had: a carburetor rebuild and tank flush; new drive sprocket and cover, drive chain, tension pad and rear axle sprocket replacement; the rear end was rebuilt with fresh bearings, grease and seals; a new skid plate and rear brake disc and pads were installed; the mono-shock was replaced; the front wheel bearings were cleaned and freshly repacked; the brake fluid was drained and fresh fluid put in; new rear aftermarket body plastic was installed; rear and then front racks were added.

 In addition, I have the stuff but haven’t gotten around to installing yet: a rear tow hitch; a new front light/ignition key housing; a new control switch cluster; new vinyl for the seat. I am also including the helmet with 3/4 flip visor, gas tank saddlebags, owners’ service manual, a spare grip, and some older parts like an air filter for high-dust riding, the last drive chain for spare links, and some other miscellaneous items.

 I will accept cash or certified cashier’s check; absolutely no personal checks. I’m asking $1,600 with all the new parts, and the fact that Honda's are ultra-reliable as long as they are taken care of. You will have a better chance of negotiating price if you have cash, although I may be interested in trading."

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 Would meet face to face anywhere between Lynnwood and Arlington Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

NO CREDIT CARD FEES. READ OUR FEEDBACK AND BID WITH CONFIDENCE.


We recently had police departments and special units who carry the 1911 approach us to build them a more reliable and durable 1911 to replace their current carry pieces. Since we did not have a model to meet their specific needs, we created the Specialist just for them. Knowing our customers the way we do, we knew we had to offer these to the public as well.

The Specialist is a 5” 1911 chambered in .45 ACP that is full of features to satisfy an officer’s special needs.

Starting at the top, the slide wears our popular Clark Style serrated rib and like all of our guns with night sights, the Specialist wears dual-colored Tritium night sights. The rear sight is our new tactical ledge rear sight with single amber tritium dot and the front utilizes a green lamp with white target ring.

The forged slide is mated to our new forged tactical rail frame. The frame utilizes the standard 1913 picatinny rail and features 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and a recessed slide stop for use with laser grips (not included) and tactical operations. Each Specialist comes standard with our ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and a detachable two-piece magwell. This duty-ready piece comes dressed with a set of awesome G10 VZ Operator II grips and two 8 round magazines with bump pads.

The Specialist is available in either a matte stainless finish or our matte black Duty finish.

We think this pistol would not only be perfect for duty and tactical purposes but for home defense as well. Check out the Specialist and see if it fits the bill for your needs.

I'm really looking for a handgun to replace it with, or something I may be able to get more use out of. I'm only interested in firearm deals.

This is customized Savage .308. It comes scoped (3x-9x40) with the bipod. Also comes with aftermarket thumbhole stock, an extended 9 round magazine, extended bolt and everything else you see. On the other side of the gun, there is a dime sized piece of paint missing, showing the black stock. It's not pictured because it is new. I should have somewhere around ~120 rounds to go with it. About 80.308 Winchester Power-Points, 20 Remington Express Core-Lokt, and ~20 of some milsurp stuff.

SAFETY

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

ERGONOMIC

Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Picatinny Rail System
A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Short Reset Trigger
The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

Snag Free Sights
The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight.

Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Mould-Tru Backstraps
With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.

Slim Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.

Sure Grasp Slide Serrations
The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol."

It comes with a BSA sweet .22 scope and heavy duty rings. This gun is a real head turner and is extremely accurate. The gun has become a safe queen so it's time for something else.
I have over $600 invested, but I will let it go for $500. I will even throw in 200 rds of federal ammo. These guns are going for a lot more on gunbroker.

As I understand from the Keltec forum there were only a total of about 3500 of these made - of all magazine types. Kel-tec didn't sell many and so made a cheaper version - which is now sold as the sub 2000. This rifle was much more expensive initially than the sub-2000(because it has much more steel). Just a superficial glance at the photos and you'll be able to see how much better the build on this is. If you want the details on the difference a quick search on the kel-tec forums will give you a wealth of info. There weren't many of these made and even fewer around now.

This from Wikipedia:
The AMT Lightning 25/22 was a .22LR-caliber semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Arcadia Machine & Tool (AMT).
As is alluded to in the nomenclature, the Lightning 25/22 is functionally a clone of the Ruger 10/22 with the substitution of a larger 25-round magazine instead of the 10-round magazine used by Ruger. Also, the receiver is stainless steel rather than aluminum and features a Stainless Steel and Nylon folding stock and pistol grip rather than the wooden stock mounted on the 10/22.
The AMT Lightning line, which included direct clones of the Ruger 10/22 and Mark II pistol, eventually prompted a lawsuit against AMT that forced them to discontinue the line.
The AMT Lightning was also exported to the UK and tuned by Theoben Engineering, the result was the AMT/Theoben Target Model. This rifle is known for its reliability; accuracy and rarity. Produced in very small numbers this rifle had a bull target barrel and a special evolution moderator to fit the larger barrel (.917). Many have suggested this rifle remains the most accurate factory finished semi-automatic ever produced and is a credit to the Anglo-American alliance of AMT and Theoben."

Traded for this recently and have too many shotguns.  Has signs of use, such as scuffs on receiver but overall finish is fine, which some might not like but I think it adds to the flavor.  Has the following:
>870 police magnum with Ohio state highway patrol engraved
>7+1 ext tube capacity (2 3/4"") with 5 additional on side saddle for a total of 13 in and on the shotgun
> high vis white sights (very cool and easy sight acquisition)
> blackhawk spec ops recoil absorbing 6 position stock with limbsaver pad built in
>Blackhawk knoxx powerpak adjustable cheek riser system
>matching blackhawk pump handle

This is built like a brick shithouse.  Typical 870 reliability, just more combat ready.  I have  multiple shotguns and need to unload a few.

Trades considered, just send an offer.  Cash can be given or received depending on trade.  Lowballers ignored, you know who you are.  You know what these cost and this is a special police magnum that's heavily modded.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1800 with scope or $1600 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't

The Chiappa Rhino's barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to the Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target.

I bought the gun used from Gander Mountain last December 2013 for $375.  The gun is awesome and has been a blast, I’m just looking to try something else. I also have 600 rounds of CCI Mini Mag and 400 rounds of CCI Standard Velocity for sale. I’ll let all the ammo go for another $100.  I’ve put about 500 rounds through the gun since I bought it. I put 100 rounds of Standard through it and it jammed once.  I ran 400 rounds of Mini Mag through it and it never jammed. A while ago I had both guns listed and sold them, buyer at the very last second backed out, so I decided to keep them because they’re awesome guns.  I just bought 2 more guns, so decided to sell them again.

I have fired exactly 1 box of .357 mag ammo thru it and no .38's.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this gun but I came across a 6"" GP100 that I'd rather have & no need for 2 .357 wheel guns for me.

Lockup is very tight on every cylinder.  Timing is perfect.  Cylinder to bore gap is good - I haven't measured with a feeler gage but a thin business card barely fits with some wiggling.  Trigger is excellent in both SA & DA.  Finish is a peened stainless, barrel is ported, and it holds 8 rounds.

In factory box with everything that came with it.  No accessories like holster or speed loader.  

Absolutely nothing wrong with this gun that I could tell from 1 range trip & 50 rds.  Went bang every time & grouped very nicely @ 15 yds with 158gr JSP American Eagle ammo.

Price is firm.  $500 is very fair in my opinion because that's less than you can get it new esp without tax or shipping+ FFL x-fer fee.  MSRP is $688 & discount retail on these is about $540 + tax.  I'll show you original receipt from last month from a discount FFL & you'll see it's a bargain when you come to check it out.  I'm not selling to get out of a broken or crappy gun.  I found what I really wanted originally at a great price or else I'd be hanging on to this one & shooting it frequently.

Not looking for much in the way of trades.  I'd take in trade/partial trade for the following only:

NIB AR-15 complete upper.  Complete from a reputable, well-known manufacturer.
Excellent condition (minty) Sig P220, P226 or 1911 Max, STX, Nightmare, or Scorpion
Excellent condition (minty) Kimber CDP or higher Kimber line 1911
New/like new Nikon Monarch 3 6-24x50 w/ SF
New/like new Aimpoint T1 on a LaRue 660 or 751
Very little else I'd want in trade - no hunting rifles, shotguns, other wheel guns, or ammo.

858,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2669858,For Sale:  Remington R-15™ VTR™ Predator Carbine CS .223,"Fountain Inn, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 1,140","Listed On: Saturday, February 8, 2014",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"PRICE CHANGE - ""Remington AR-15 style Model R-15 VTR Predator"". Purchased for Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.
