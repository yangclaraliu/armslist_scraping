The Super Hawg met or exceeded my expectations. From the ambidexterous safety, skeletonized trigger & hammer; ramped, match barrel; increased sight radius (long slide) ;luminous front sight; non=glare matte finish; crisp, consistent trigger to it's natural point & feel (not to mention its stunning appearance) the pistol left little to be desired. 




gun reviews 


I fired my first five rounds sitting, from a bag rest at 10 yards. The rounds all over-lapped and produced an irregular, 1.25 inch hole. I reloaded and reprduced a similar but different shaped 5 round hole on another target, confirming the irregularity was all mine.

 The slide operated like silk, returning to battery lock-up everytime; requiring little, if any, sight adjustment to reaquire. The grip texture and fore & aft frame stippling assured positive grip at all times during the shoot. 


gun reviews 


I am 6'3"" and have a large (but not huge) frame. so the grip width of the hi-cap was perfect for me and perhaps the 8+1 Super Hawg width would better fit a smaller hand. Nevertheless, I'm sure it too, would perform just as well.

 Disassembly & cleaning was very easy with no surprises.

 I have owned a number of 1911's and have shot on Navy pistol team events so I have some commonality of experirnce with most shooters. I believe you will be thoroughly pleased with the Super Hawg whether the single or double stack is your choice. It is truly a fine pistol that will make you smile when you handle and shoot it!"

Developed from the original GS05 Gunslinger, it has a slightly larger scabbard, to better accommodate weapons with larger cross-sections or bulky optics. The scabbard is wide at the bottom, giving the option of carrying weapons butt-down or butt-up. It features both front loading and top loading features, giving exceptional flexibility. The scabbard on the G2 folds into the bottom of the pack and is secured by a buckle. This configuration is good for shorter weapons and other gear; it's also a great place to carry a laptop computer. Also note the side handles; these make it easy to get the loaded pack out of a vehicle, and for mounting the pack with a heavy load. Heavy duty compression straps always cause the pack to ride quiet and tight; it can be compressed completely flat. In this photo, they are routed through the scabbard compression loops, which allows you to selectively compress the scabbard. Dimensions: 22""h x 10""w x 8""d Weight: 6 lbs. Volume: 2,600 cu in.

Burl Walnut stocks, blue finish, 165 round pan magazine.  This is a very rare and unique rifle designed and manufactured by Richard Casull, who also brought us the .454 Casull pistol. The Casull Model 290 is similar in appearance to the American 180 as the 290 round drum magazine is mounted on top of the receiver in a similar manner. It was one of the most expensive guns of its time (mid 1960's) selling for around $1060.00 at that time. Only 87 pieces were manufactured and all are hand made with quality that compares with a Colt Thompson, the receiver is machined out of a solid block of steel, all parts are hand fitted, built to last forever. The firearm fires from an open bolt with the bolt face striking the .22lr rim fire cartridge on two edges for positive ignition. At the time it was a popular gun to present to foreign dignitaries. Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines owned one. I believe that it is the highest capacity drum magazine (290 rounds) ever produced. An extremely rare and unique firearm. It's concept lives on today as the American 180 submachine gun.This rifle is truly a piece of art, from the fine machning and fit to the beautiful walnut stock.  It breaks down into 4 parts to store compactly.  There is one ding in the butt stock on the under side of the grip it is shown in the last photo, other than this one mark it is blemish free"

Several years ago, our customers asked us for a great all-around daypack, and we developed our x-type packs to answer the call for lightweight, high quality, ultra-versatile hunting packs. We focused on the essentials to give you some lean, mean, hunting machines. The X1A1 (called the X1 for short) is carefully made with premium components, thoughtfully laid out. With our exclusive patented and patent-pending features, the Quickdraw Backscabbard and the Ripcord Bow Tether. Both on one pack. If you're looking for a great all-'round daypack, look no further. Because you won't find anything better on the planet. Major features include: Front ""x pockets"" form a saddle for your bow to ride in, so it's completely stable while you go hard. Deeper scabbard accommodates a full-scale hunting rifle. Padlock webbing tie-points all over the pack, including on the larger ""mainline"" waistbelt. New ""shooter harness"" is vertically adjustable for varying torso lengths, and is both thinner for shooting, and more comfortable for heavier loads. The X1 is designed for the hunter that wants light and fast mobility. Whether you're a bow hunter or a gun hunter, once you've discovered the ability to move with your hands free from carrying your weapon, it'll change the way that you think about the hunting experience. Of course, this applies to everybody who carries a gun or a bow, whether you're climbing 7000' up to the rim of Hell's Canyon, or climbing out of your pickup truck for a walk to your tree-stand. There's something wonderful about being organized when you move about with your gear, and the X1 is designed to make that happen. Although made for a full-sized man, the X1 is also a great kid's or woman's pack when combined with our small pack harness. Above, these tigah's are well set up for a weekend adventure, with rods and Red Ryders tucked into the scabbard. At the opposite end of the scale, it'll make a great daypack for a customer who's 6'5"" when fitted with our large harness. It'll change the way that you hunt. Dimensions: 22.5""h x 11""w x 7""d Weight: 5 lbs. 8 oz. Volume: 1,900 cu in.

This is a extreme high end scroll saw - the best in the world. It has a retail value over $1700 with the saw, stand and extras - its brand new and has never been used. 


ALL realistic offers/trades will be considered. I am in the market for a new safe, so it is a option that would be considered.  Includes a FULL assortment of blades as well as the tool and stand. Will ship, pickup is an option. For guesstimate purposes - use Milwaukee, WI as the closest city. 

In the thirty years since HEGNER Saws were introduced, hundreds of experts and even more importantly, tens of thousands of satisfied owners have confirmed HEGNER technology and performance as the world-wide standard of the industry.

HEGNER scroll saws are known for easy blade installation, long blade life, superb cutting control, smooth and quiet operation, accurate sawing, smooth edges without sanding, and unsurpassed reliability.

The HEGNER 18"" Variable Speed saw is compact, quiet, precise and versatile, lets you cut almost any material and make a wide variety of projects. It features a 400-1700 RPM variable speed motor, dual-tilt slotted table, plus all the other features that make HEGNER a breed apart from all other scroll saws. 

The Hegner Multimax 18V was WOOD magazine's choice as ""best overall performer"" of all major premium brands, and winner of American Woodworking's ""Editor's Choice"" Award October of 1996.!
HEGNER mainframe parts are crafted from cast iron to provide optimum strength and dampening characteristics, while the light alloy arms afford complete control with minimal reciprocating weight. As a result, HEGNER saws are known for being smooth and quiet. Just as important, their unique blade motion lifts the work less than a typical scroll saw, so using your HEGNER is more comfortable and relaxing than working with a lesser saw. You don't have to hold the work down as hard, so you can saw comfortably for hours, and the reduced friction also increases blade life as well as the quality of your cuts!"

We all know how collectible the snake series pistols are, and especially the nickel plated ones.  However, I want to be up front and point out this gun has been handled and shot.  The nickel plating is NOT 100%, but the gun is still very desirable.

I do not have the box.  I am mostly looking to sell this pistol, but would possibly consider trades on high end firearms.

I can take more pictures and send them upon request.  I know people are asking between $1,500-2,500 for these in mint condition, and I am acknowledging mine is not mint.  So please make me a fair offer knowing the rarity of the gun and the condition.  I did my best in the last photo showing what I mean by the nickel plating is chipped.

From the Manufacturer:
The name Kalashnikov is recognized around the world, even by people
who have never held a rifle in their hands. The GSG-AK 47 is built with
expected German quality, and is priced to jump off gun stor racks.
And to make it even more appealing, GSG has been afforded the honor,
directly from Mikhail Kalashnikov himself, of allowing this rifle to
bear his name.
