This sight goes from a 1X to 4X zoom by the swipe of a lever. Adjust reticle from thick to fine for close range to long range shooting. This optical is top of the line and used by the most elite military tactical teams. The glass is crystal clear and can take a beating! This retails for over 2,200$ More info from online....The ELCAN SpecterDR Tactical Rifle Scope represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR from ELCAN offers the best single solution for both CQB and long range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

My 2 year old was playing in the front while I was cleaning it out and suddenly it stopped coming out of all the speakers but one.  It's probably just a button somewhere but I haven't tried figuring it out yet.  Once I do have the time to sit down with the manual and figure it out the price will go up.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  However, if you ask my lowest price, if it's still for sale, or offer me a price without coming to see it first, you will be IGNORED.  I have plenty of pictures I can e-mail or text, but AL will only let me post one picture."

Matching dents on either side of the gas tank do not affect functionality, just looks, previous owner didn't remember how they got there. I fixed it up and just hit 20,000 miles on it a few days ago.Here's everything I did:Rebuilt the carbsBalanced the carbsChased out the electrical gremlinsNew spark plugsNew fuel petcock and fuel hosesNew low-fuel sensorNewer tires (June 2015 - 3500 miles on them)Newer battery (June 2015)Changed fork oilChanged shaft oilNew rear shocksAddedPlexifairing windshieldSoft saddlebagsSteel top box with adjustable backrest (I have the original sissy bar as well)Fork seal boot protectorsGreat-running bike, averages 40-45 MPG depending how hard you run it. Has no problem cruising 80-85 mph on the highway, the 6th gear and windshield really helps. Has highway pegs as well to stretch out you legs.This is a great bike for around the city and to cruise around the metro. This is the bike I learned to ride on. I am 5'11"" and I can easily flat-foot this bike with knees bent. Bike weighs around 450 lbs wet. I have always used non-oxygenated gasoline in it. Holds about 3.3 gallons of gas, low fuel comes on after about 2 gallons are used up, around 80 miles or so on the trip meter.Let me know if you are interested or have questions.Thanks!"

I unfortunately had to sell all of my firearms due to having to deal with some health issues at the time. I regret everyday selling this specific pistol due to it being my primary carry pistol, home defense, woods defense etc etc. Anyways if your out there, and purchased a Glock 29SF gen 3 serial#PWK813 from maybe Gander Mountain or Cabelas or The Ammo Box or Deerfield Pistol  so pretty much anywhere in the Madison/Dane County area. I was just wondering if there would be any chance to chat about this specific pistol I bought it awhile ago, and like I said above unfortunately had to sell it due to medical reasons at the time. I'm hoping that somewhere out there  does own this specific Glock 29SF gen 3 serial#PWK813. It has sentimental and intrinsic value to me and I would love to see if we could work something out maybe a trade all I have now is an Heckler and Koch VP9 LE package so night sights and 3 magazines or purchase of firearm if at all possible I hope your out there and read this post and would be willing to potentially talk about a trade or purchase. I do have my Wisconsin CCW permit along with my Utah Permit. Anyways again I hope your out there and we could make a deal. Thank you all for listening and reading this message."

After the mistake was caught, they destroyed all of them- except for approximately 70 that had already left the factory.This thing looks great with only two spots in the finish on the slide (which I believe has the factory K-kote.) The slide rails (which are scalloped, something that was done to make it more reliable in dirty environments to better compete with the M9) have very minimal wear for 30 year old gun.I have replaced all springs and put newer-style grips to allow for room for the new style trigger return spring, and have also retained all original parts.May also be interested in selling but not really wanting to sell outright so make an offer.
