Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights. This pistol ships with a flush fit 8 round magazine and a 10 round extended magazine. Combat ready and built to last.

It is an incredible pistol yes, but this one is even BETTER than new.  Yes it has the original awesome specs like Sig Nite Sites, phospate coated internals, accessory rail, hicap mags, and all the goodies - but mine is done up right!
I have had the SIG ""short reset trigger"" or SRT installed, so that is a huge upgrade!  I will include the original trigger as well.
I also have a small DeSantis leather holster for it, a slightly larger DeSantis leather holster, and a Blackhawk molded Kydex holster for it. The leather holsters have been broken in with Blackrock leather rub with the gun left in when treated, while wrapped in wax paper. The 3 holsters are important to the gun since the MK25 only fits a few of the holsters that regular P226's use, since the MK25 has a true Picatinny rail and not the smaller Sig specific rail on ordinary versions of P226's. 
I have 3 original SIG mags, and one 20 round mag from MecGar who makes the mags for SIG (which is the 18 round MecGar mag that has the +2 mag bumper on it - you can see them on any website).
When the trigger work was done, I also had the feed ramp polished and the barrell hood coating stripped and polished. As you know, the black coating on SIG barrel hoods scrape off with even minimal use, so I have mine stripped down and polished - as the polished stainless steel is a much cleaner look.
The MK25 has Hogue overmolded black grips on it, I will also include the original grips.
Gun is a pure joy to shoot, I have only shot it three or four times at the indoor range, mostly has been sitting in my safe.  It isn't new as it has about 300 or 400 rounds through it, but that is barely even a break in period. You will love this gun!
Price for basic gun is about $925, plus holsters ($125), plus SRT trigger work ($100), extra mags ($35), plus feed ramp & hood work ($100), plus Hogue grips ($20). So I have approx $1300+ total into this rig. If you buy the gun I will also be happy to sell you 9mm ammo at my cost, FMJ and/or hollow point defense ammo.
Selling for needed cash in the next week!  I am asking $900, cash only.  Click on the ""contact seller"" link above and I will answer any questions very quickly.
Thank you for your interest and God bless!"

It'd make a great bird gun. Fiber optic sights. Vented barrel. It's flawless, except for where I removed the giant mossberg sticker on the stock, as it also removed the paint under it. It's in the first pic, on the butt, about an inch wide or so, this little black mark. I can send a better picture of it if you want, just ask for it. I will write a bill of sale for both of us, and I will take your DL # for it.

They shot the gun and said it shoots excellent and the gun is in great shape. It comes with the two 15 round clip and the packing slip from Ruger for prove of the work that was done. 

The reason I am selling the gun is because where I work at we just found out they are buying new weapons and I would like to buy the same gun we will practice on. Please don't try to talk me down on the price I am already taking a loss and the Ruger DAO are very hard to find not like the Ruger DC that have flooded the market . You will be responsible for the taxes and the delivery cost Thanks."

I have a H&K P2000SK Variant 3 chambered in 40S&W
I am looking to trade the H&K P2000SK for a 9mm. I am doing away with majority of my 40S&W and going to 9mm. The H&K is in great shape and has 142 rounds through it and has been in the safe most of its life. It will come with everything it came with new.

All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh CZ 455 Varmint .22 Mag Rifle! This excellent precision rifle features a 20.5"" barrel that can easily be changed with any of the other Varmint style barrels. It also features a beautiful walnut stock and blued finish. CZ is known worldwide for their incredibly accurate guns right out of the box, and this model is no exception.


I only have one in stock, and it is priced to sell quickly for only $429.00 (cash price).


CZ 02141 Model 455 Varmint Rifle, .22 Mag, 20.5 inch Barrel, Walnut Stock, Blue Finish, 5 Round Magazine, Heavy BBL

In addition to the advantages gained by the interchangeable bbl system of the 455 platform, the 455 Varmint features a heavier, stiffer barrel than its predecessors in the 452 and 453 lines. The 20.5 long .866 diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available today. Any of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint weight barrels in .22LR, .22 WMR or .17HMR, can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model.

Typical swiss quality, high quality machining.  Very smooth bolt and a great two stage trigger that breaks clean.  The rifle is chambered for 7.5x53.5mm Swiss. 

This rifle will chamber and fire the common 7.5x55mm GP11 swiss round.  But it’s not recommended as pressure is a lot higher with that round.  Many folks fire that round through these rifles with no issues at all, but I still wouldn’t feed an 1889 a steady diet of them.  

Sporterized stock, that has slight finger/hand groves for your trigger hand.  12 round box magazine.  Excellent bore, that’s bright.  Strong land and grooves, I don’t think too many rounds have been fired through her.   Very neat and unique rifle.   

Serial # dates this rifle to 1892, so this is considered an antique, so I can legally ship this rifle if you’re willing to pay for the shipping cost.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple brand new, factory fresh CZ 455 American .22 Mag Rifles! This excellent precision rifle features a 22.5"" barrel, beautiful walnut stock and blued finish. CZ is known worldwide for their incredibly accurate guns right out of the box, and this model is no exception. The 455 also comes ready for scope mounting out of the box.

CZ USA 455 American Bolt-Action .22 Mag Rifle, 22.5″ Barrel, Walnut Stock, Detachable Magazine, No Sights- CZ 02111

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.
