It features a wide target-style Adjustable rear sight, 17 round magazine and a 9MM barrel for a caliber conversion. The 22 TCM sends a 40 grain bullet down range at 2,100 FPS.

The MVP (Mossberg Varmint Predator) Series is based on Mossberg 4x4 centerfire rifle, combining this classic bolt-action platform with the features most highly-desired by dedicated varmint and predator hunters and long-range competitive shooters. The MVP Predator features a stylish spiral bolt with a 20"" fluted sporter bull barrel, the LPA adjustable trigger and Weaver-style bases. It is set in a laminate sporter-style stock. Notably setting this family of rifles apart from the competition is its unique, patent-pending bolt design which allows MVP Series rifles to accept and reliably feed from AR-15 style magazines.

It's a great shooting rifle and a great brush gun for hunting! I have put about 40-60 rounds through it. The only downside is I lost the rear sight when I went to the shooting range, however it's no big deal. A rear sight is about $8 I just haven't had the time to order one. It comes with two boxes of Winchester 30-30. I am asking $400 or best offer, I am open to offers the worst I can say is no. You must have a valid FOID card.

This is the info I got from a browning expert. In summary, I  dont want to go past 1983...................

For a NICE ""T"" series, expect to pay around the $1000 range. These pistols were built between 1964 and 1970ish.

For a NICE ""C"" series (directly after the ""T"" series, you could probably find a nice example for the $800 range. Built from 1969 to 1975.

For a NICE post ""C"" series, still MADE AND ASSEMBLED in Belgium (recommended), I've seen them go for as little as $750 with a few slipping through for even less. These start with a 245 on the serial number and have an alpha code after the 245 that will tell you the year. So if you find a Made in Belgium HP with a S/N that starts 245PX, it was built in 1983.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

Operation

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

The press is mint.  I'm moving for work to a place at which I can't shoot, so I'm selling my stuff.  I've used the press literally once to load 100 rounds of .44 Magnum.  The entire system is brand-new condition.  Yes, it hurts to sell it and also to not be able to shoot soon!

I'll sell the press system and one complete calilber setup (powder system, primer tubes, changeover kit and dies) for $400.

I'll add a whole additional caliber changeover kit, powder system, dies and tubes for $150 more (a $240 value, if you can find them).  Each powder system has two powder-measure bars for convenient readiness to throw different weights of powder.

I'll sell everything I have -- that's three complete caliber systems -- for $600 and throw in 1) over half-full Blue Dot and Red Dot powder containers, 2) 100 bullets of your choice (.44 JHP Speer or .40 S&W TC Winchester) and 3) 100 new brass of your choice (.44 or .40).

Shotgun. Serial numbers all match on both barrels and stock. Both barrels are skeet barrels. Inside the barrels look nice with no pitting of any sort. The stock and both barrel sets look to be in good condition, wood looks nice as does the blueing. The entire gun including both barrels appear to have been re-blued, it looks like a really nice job but I do not know who or where it was done. Also the very front bead sight on the 28 gauge barrels was broken and replaced with a fiber optic sight. This is easily replaceable with another white bead sight. On the very upper rear area of the forestock, right as it meats the metal of the barrels appears to have been cracked and reaffixed on both sides and both barrels. Its unnotiacable  unless looked at closely. The gun functions and feels great in the hands. Original case included. I can gladly email more pics if requested.

The rifle is in great shape, pretty much perfect, and come with everything you see in the pics including the original charging handle, the Eotech 552.A65, and a magpul sling but plate.  LWRC is one of the industry leaders and this rifle shows why.  If interested text me 7 five 7 nine 9 five 4 nine 5 seven.

The new M6-SL is a replacement of the LWRC base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price."

The bore is about as bright as it can get and it has the modified choke. I'm mainly looking to trade for quality handguns. Sigs, Kimber, or multiple Glocks, Walthers,etc. had a FFL buddy of mine look it over and he said anywhere from $900-$1100 price tag. Just let me know what you have to offer.
