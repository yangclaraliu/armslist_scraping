This one is new in the box and comes with test target and all papers, manuals, tool and hat. supplied with 2 magazines and original RRA BLUE CASE. This is a Beautiful 1911 and FLAWLESS High Polish Blue on the frame and slide flats.The last time a Tactical Model like this came up for sale on here was Nov. 12 th. 2010 so I'm not interested in trades unless you have a highend handgun on this one. Its far to pretty for me to ever use so I'm only selling to fund the purchase of a Wilson Compact 1911 or Nighthawk PDP Carry or ED BROWN Executive Carry or Similar to actually carry and use. It has always been stored well oiled and in a climate controlled safe and never in a holster or handled. These will only go up in the future since the President and Founder of RRA Mark Larson recently passed away and there will never be anymore of these made.  I will meet FTF if you have a N.C CCW Permit or Handgun Permit, I will ship but you must send a FFL and extra for shipping and insurance.

Bedford County Information:
A distinguishing feature of the Bedford County rifle is its length. These rifles tended to be quite long and were constructed on maple stocks of excellent quality. Numerous inlays of silver and brass decorated the length of the stock.
The rifles often used a patchbox of modified floral design held with six to nine screws. The barrel was pinned to the stock with three or four pins, depending on its length, and the pins were set through brass or silver inlays.

The cheek piece usually featured some inletting on this type rifle and almost all of the inlays included a certain amount of engraving. Relief carving in a vine pattern that seems to cover and wind around the stock seems typical of rifles from this region. The butt seems to angle down from the wrist in a gradual slope. The wood used for Bedford County rifle stocks was always of the finest quality obtainable and carving and inlays highlighted the luster of the wood grain.

Some of the men who carried these rifles ranged through the Appalachian Mountains to open and settle new lands. The Bedford Rifle played an important part in the heritage of the families who settled this area. Hanging over a fireplace, it was an object of pride, and in the hands of its owner it was an important and efficient tool for survival.

Sig 938 Extreme with a lot of extras.  Gun has about 300 rounds through it.  It's been my daily carry for about a year so it has been in a holster but it's still in very good shape.  Night sights glow very nicely.  It has been converted to a single sided safety with original Sig parts.  The ambi safety parts are not included, they are now in a P238.

Package includes FOUR six-round magazines, two are still brand new in the packaging.  Two holsters and a spare mag holder included.  One is an IWB leather and kydex hybrid made by Old Faithful.  The other is a leather high-ride OWB with full body shield made by UBG Holsters.  The mag carrier is a kydex model made by Atomic Dog Holsters.   Black Sig hard case included just as in it came in when new.

Asking $700 for everything.  That's about the price of a 938 Extreme new, but with two extra $40 mags and $150 worth of holsters and mag carrier.

During WWII Browning had Remington make the A5 shotgun is St. Louis, MO due to the events taking place in Europe. There were appx. 45,000 made from 1940-1947. There was a different engraving pattern on these models and the serial numbers are on the side. There was an early attempt to refinish the wood. There are no cracks in the wood, but it needs refunishing. The bluing is VG. This is a pretty un-common version of the A5 16 gauge.

384,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2450384,For Sale:  Pair of Pretty Czechs!! (Firearms of Course),"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 31, 2013",Rifles,CZ USA                                                                                ,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"As I get close to finishing the sale of my lifelong military firearms collection - I have two beautiful Czech pieces left.    

The first is a VZ52 SHE rifle made in 1955 and chambered in the 7.62 x 45 round which is more powerful than the 7.62 x39, but less powerful than the 7.62 Nato.    

I bought this rifle 27 years ago from an elderly gentleman who had a rather extensive collection. He told me that he personally brought it back from a trip abroad in the 70's and that it was an arsenal refurbed rifle that was going to be exported to the US to one of our big importers. However he said he purchased and brought it here himself before it was sold to the importer. Truth is that I can't confirm or deny his story, but I've looked it over pretty closely and don't see any of your typical import stamps.    

The rifle is in great shape, and I'd have to rate it a solid 95% with regard to overall condition. The metal is in excellent and so is the wood. There is no rust or pitting on the metal and no gouges or cracks in the wood. The bore is excellent as well.    

Over my 37 years of collecting I've only see a few VZ52's that were on par with this one. Many of these that came over in the 1990's were so beat up that the importer elected to use a spray on plastic ""bed liner"" material to refurb them which created one ugly sucker in my opinion.    

Rifle comes with the correct sling, plus a complete and original cleaning kit that stows in a compartment in the buttstock. Additionally there is a spare mag that looks brand new. These mags are tough to find and often cost $75 or more when you do.    

Finally there is 11 boxes of original CZECH 7.62 x 45 ammo included. Ammo is packed in 15 round boxes and has a lacquered steel cases. It's also very magnetic meaning it has a steel penetrating core. I know Numrich used to sell a chamber insert that converted this rifle over to fire the 7.62 x 39 round. They used to cost about $25, and were easy to install. This was all that was needed as the factory mags work with the slightly shorter 7.62 x 39 cartridge.    

The other pretty Czech is a CZ52 pistol chambered in the very potent 7.62 x 25 round. Pistol was originally made in 1954, and was arsenal refurbished after it was retired. It was imported to the US by Century Arms in the early 90's and I am the original owner since import. The pistol is unfired since imported so it's in excellent condition. Metal & grips are 98%+, and bore is mirror bright.    

It comes with a correct original holster that is excellent, correct rope lanyard, cleaning rod and three original magazines.    

Additionally there is an assortment of 7.62 x 25 ammo from all over the place that I collected over the years:    

(1) 70 round box brass case Polish surplus    

(2) 40 round boxes Czech brass case surplus on eight round stripper clips (this ammo is steel core magnetic)    

(5) 16 round paper packs Bulgarian brass case surplus (also steel core penetrator)    

(2) 50 round boxes PPU commercial brass case, non-corrosive with lead core.  

All together 340 rounds    

Both the rifle and pistol come with reprinted operating manuals.    

Asking price for the rifle with accessories and ammo is $800  and $500 for the pistol, accessories and ammo. Or if you'd like them both I'd take $1200 for everything. This is a local sale with pickup in the Brandon area to a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old.    

I'm only allowed 3 pictures so I'd be happy to provide more to a serious buyer.    

If you happen to have a SIG 522, Beretta ARX .22, GSG STG44 .22, or an ISSC MK22 rifle that you'd like to trade - I would be interested in working out a deal.  

Thanks for looking."

The first $425 takes the P380 & the holster. It kills me to have to sell it all, but I marvel over the fact that nobody has snatched this up at the previous price. 

A truly special firearm! Anyone who knows better, knows that the Kahr P380 is one of the best (and best-made) 380s on the market. (Don't believe the hype on the CW380--it's inferior to the P-model in almost every way).

This gun is all broken-in with only 600 rounds put through it. Like-new condition. Includes original foam cut-out case with all paperwork and two mags. 

PLUS, it comes with the most-excellent (AND UN-USED) Sneaky Pete concealed-carry holster. I never got my CC permit, so the holster is brand new, selling on Amazon for $55. Pete is made of leather, has a strong metal belt clip that won't slip off, a magnetic flap, and is made especially for the Kahr. The internal structure of the holster prevents you from retrieving the Kahr with your finger on the trigger, making it a very safe pull. It's very slim and is hardly noticeable with a light shirt or jacket hanging over it. Now I'm moving to where I can't take any guns, so this is purely a must-sell situation and is breaking my heart! Price includes the Kahr, original case, and the Sneaky Pete holster.

$425 is over $250 less than I paid for gun and holster not too many months ago. It's still practically new, with only enough rounds through it to meet Kahr's recommended break-in period.  If you pass up this offer, you'll be singing the blues later. 

I'm moving abroad and *have* to sell--I can't take it where I'm moving. Do us both a favor and snatch up the best 380 out there, for a price that *seems* too good to be true, but in this case it *is* true."

It's in pretty good shape. The upper is relatively new. As in it has less that 5 mags through it. The lower is from my first ar so it has some rounds through it but has always functioned flawlessly and has been very well taken care of.

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.


KEY FEATURES:

Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
Non-glare matte finish
Adjustable big game iron sights
Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable, 10-shot metal box magazine

I have up for sale a like new Charter arms Lavender Lady 38 spl Hammerless model. This is the model that has ""The Lavender Lady"" engraved into the barrel rather than anodized on like some of them do. This is also the Hammerless model which isnt as easy to come by compared to the hammer models that run 399.99+ in stores. This little 5 shot is perfect for conceal carry for a man or woman. The color actually grows on you and has a great sheen to it. Haha. It has had less than 75 rounds through it and has zero issues. The grip is fantastic and pockets very nice for being this kind of gun. The kick is very light considering its weight and the punch it is delivering. I would keep this but I already have a conceal and my gal just isnt in to revolvers. So, I will pass this great gun on to someone who will use it for more than just a safe queen! Included for the asking price are the original case, paperwork, lock, and the pistol itself. I can also possibly include ammo on my end for the right trade. I need to meet in or very close to norman if possible due to my current time constraints, but Im not unreasonable. For any questions or for more pictures please shoot me an email or text me at REDACTED and we can try and make a deal."
