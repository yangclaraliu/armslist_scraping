This is a striker fired rifle and only resembles an AK in looks, but shoots like an SKS.  She was designed by the Czechs to be the ultimate F U to the Russians, as it has proprietary mags and non soviet compatible parts.  She has tighter tolerances than an AK, leading to better accuracy, and the milled receiver makes it 1 lbs lighter than an AK even loaded.    It comes with 5 surplus 30 rd mags, bayonet and scabbard, cleaning kit (minus the rod), extra foreguard with minor crack, surplus sling, leather surplus magazine pouch, a M-16 style ""Phantom"" Muzzle break installed, and the original factory AK style slanted muzzle break.

I have owned this rifle almost 3 months and have only put about 10 rounds through it of non corrosive.  It is in almost brand new condition.  She does have one quirk related to the magazines; they are in ""surplus"" condition, but have the tightest springs I've ever encountered.  This leads to the occasional feed issue when the mags are loaded to 30rd capacity.  The bolt just can't strip the round off the top of the mag due to the high tension.  Through exhaustive research, I have found that this can be remedied by putting her through her break in paces, or trimming the mag spring.

I no longer have the time or enthusiasm for this gun due to recent love affair with AR builds.
I am not really interested in trades, but may consider partial trade of a nice AR optic.

For an additional $100 I can throw in 2 Red Army Stardard range packs (total of 351rds)-Nice non-corrosive 123gr. FMJ with lacquer coated primers and steel case.

•LVOA Rail Bungee installed
•Color: Foliage Green

The LVOA AR ships with Rail Bungee (Shock Cord) installed on the rail. The “Bungee” provides better grip under wet conditions, reduces the noise and harmonics the rail may produce, gives the shooter a quick -n- easy way to secure cables from lights, lasers, etc… The bungee can also be utilized to “suspended” the muzzle end of the weapon when conditions permit (Vehicle applications, HELO applications, wounded Shooter, etc…)

The LVOA design principle was to engineer an SBR platform (Entry Weapon, CQC, CQB, etc…) that offers the lowest Flash Signature without the use of a sound suppressor (Go Loud, Go Fast without the Flash). The final outcome of our testing also produced one of the flattest shooting AR’s on the market with almost zero felt impulse. Target acquisition and follow up shots with the LVOA AR is very fast even for the novice shooter. The LVOA -S (SBR) is a very accurate system from 0 – 300yds with plenty of knock down energy.  We accomplished these benefits by using a full muzzle brake and designing a rail system that encompasses the muzzle brake and acts as a “Flash Hider” and temperature regulator, so basically you get a the best of both worlds (Flash Hider + Muzzle Brake).

We have tested most ammo spending much of the testing on “cheaper” ammo to achieve the best results. We found that quality ammo from 69gr and up perform the best. We also tested from Sea level and to upper altitudes. Sea Level combined with cheaper ammo (Inconsistent Powder) provides the worst results even though still out performs any SBR in regards to flashing.

The LVOA AR design was developed by the needs of the “CQC Shooter” who learned the hard way what doesn’t work and what does in combat. We (War Sport) did not set out to develop gadgets and devices which add weight and complexity to the AR/M4 platform. Instead we reduced material to add some basic old school functionality and features

They offer for sale fine guns - usually Colt's revolvers or 1911 style pistols - on this site at very attractive prices. They correspond by email, as probably do you, but they may provide a phone number to call, and of course a name and address to send payment.

IT'S A SCAM!

I am a non-stocking dealer that does this part time. I do not currently have any handguns advertised on this site, nor am I working as the transfer dealer for any of my customers. The scammers have a copy of my FFL license, which is now an old version, but looks current - it's a forgery! ATF and USPS know this and have an open investigation.

If you are suspicious of a listing copy some of the text in the ad and search the Internet for it. You will often find the original auction ad, from which these scammers stole. Click also on ""other listings by user"" here and you will see what other items they have for sale. Search the Internet for these. These scammers are good. The person accepting payment is probably not directly involved; they just cash money orders and forward most of that on, keeping some for themselves. Real innocent, right?"

For anyone not familiar,  this is very much a Turkish clone of a Walther.   Two 17 round mags. My favorite features of this pistol are the top mounted decocker (drops the striker for double action only trigger), and I is double strike capable, which means if you pull the trigger and the round doesn't go off due to a hard primer or something, a second trigger pull will strike the round again WITHOUT racking the slide again.

Several folks have asked. I ordered this online, but it wasn't in our budget, but returning a firearm online is more hassle than I can stand, so I'm selling it at a loss after looking at it for a month :-(

Ready to follow your every move, the MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles.

The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and .308 Winchester, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits.

The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended.

Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.

From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

*First Shipment inside the United States

*NEW black finish

*First production double-barreled semi auto in the world

*The special inside-out heat and surface, non-scratch treatment of the barrels will also outperform any other by allowing about 7% + bullet velocity as opposed to a non-treated barrel.

* LOWEST SERIAL NUMBERS POSSIBLE

*The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.

No shimming necessary and it's rock solid. It is currently sighted in at 100 yards using Bulgarian silver tip surplus ammo.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Walther P38 – P1 semi-automatic pistol chambered in the very popular 9m/m, (9X19m/m – Luger), caliber. This P1 is in excellent condition showing only very minor finish wear on a few sharp edges. It comes with a period German camouflaged holster, cleaning kit, original Walther P1 magazine, and owners manual. It was manufactured in April, 1974.

In late 1963 the postwar military model P1 was adopted for use by the German military, identifiable by the P1 stamping on the slide. The postwar pistols, whether marked as P38 or P1, have an aluminum frame rather than the steel frame of the original design. The aluminum frame was later reinforced with a hex bolt above the trigger guard. During the 1990s the German military started replacing the P1 with the P8 pistol and finally phased out the P1 in 2004.

Henry H004SE Silver Eagle .22S/L/LR Lever-Action Rifle w/ 20″ Octagon Barrel, Nickel Receiver, Walnut Buttstock

The Henry Silver Eagle is based on the engraved scroll and silver plated Serial Number 9 Henry Rifle presented to US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles by The New Haven Arms Company. Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy’s Medal of Honor.

Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover.


The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20″ octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860.
