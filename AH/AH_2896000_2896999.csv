Reason for sale: Basically I bought 5 guns.. 3 compacts, one full size gun, 1 rifle. I normally carry a revolver and was weighing my options, the gun I decided to keep was a full size gun for a bedstand gun, the compact I liked the most was this m&p 9c, it was better than the m&P shield especially because I'm lefty but I liked the more rounds and the all around feel to the weapon more. But I want the full size gun and can't keep both financial wise. So in other words this gun is truly flawless. I'm not selling off my problems like most gun sellers, I just need the money.

This gun is not cheap - http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Smith-Wesson-MP-Compact-Handgun&i=422363

You can't find it in a store for less than $550-$650 then you add tax and processing fees..

Its tubular magazine was loaded through the bottom of the gun. Empty shotgun shells ejected to the right. Depending on the particular wooden transformer plug installed in the magazine, two, three, or four shells could be stored in the tubular magazine. The magazine holds six 2¾-inch 12 ga. shells, when no plug is installed, unlike most shotguns of today which hold four or five shells. With forged and machined steel parts, the ultimate reason for discontinuation in 1964 was that it was too expensive to produce at a competitive price. The primary competition at this time came from the much less expensive Remington Model 870, which had been introduced in 1950. The The majority of ""modern"" Model 12 shotguns manufactured after 1927 were chambered for 2¾-inch shotgun shells only, although some specialized models such as the Heavy Duck Gun Model 12 were chambered for 3"" Super Speed and Super X shells (basically a 3"" magnum). The early 20 gauge Model 12 guns had chambers that were 2½"", and the 16 gauge Model 12's were chambered for a 2 9/16-inch shotgun shell... for any more info pls contact +1-(862) 243-2971"

This is, without a doubt, the finest rimfire match rifle in the world. It is more accurate than any shooter, and adjustable enough to fit anyone regardless of age or size. The only reason I'm considering selling it is that I've moved to an area where I have literally nowhere to shoot it, so the rifle just sits in its case. I would prefer to see it go to someone who will actually use it the way it should be. The gun is in brand-new condition, minus some small scratches on the accessory rail from regular use.

Why you may ask well let's start with the 4 round detachable magazine it allows you to shoot just about any 270 wsm you can find next let's go with the fact that the trigger comes down with the lever so no pinching the hand when reloading next let's go with the bolt that rotates and locks in like a bolt action rifle then there is the hammer that allows you to engage a safety by moving in a bending motion which stops the hammer from going all the way forward and that's just a few of the features I will mention the high gloss walnut stock and the very comfortable recoil pad. It is also outfitted with a nikon buckmaster 4.5-16 X 40 scope and it also comes with a box of ammo and a hard case all in all there is around $900 in this rifle. Now what I am looking for is a pistol I'm not to tied up in brands but I do like glocks and spring fields but as I stated I'm pretty much open so show me what you have you can text me at ( four two three ) 9462263 thanks for looking and Semper Fi.

Choose it over the 1-4 mtac because you can still shoot both eyes open very fast with 1.5 and get 6 magnification. The reticle has been great for .223 and the red illumination is great for night time. You can see the reticle at night with a flashlight with illumination on or off very clearly. The reticle has a 2.3 moa dot which picks up very fast at close range and is not over powering at a distance. 

Have a MOA drop chart for the reticle as well as Butler Creek Scope caps installed.

I zeroed at the top of the center dot for 50 yards, suprisingly the bottom of the line right above was perfect for 100 yard precision shots. SWFA mount is rock solid. I believe it uses a size 10 torx wrench if you want to change scope location within the rings. 

I have the boxes for both scope and mount. 

Only selling cause I don't need lightning fast 1.5 CQB magnification and would rather have a little more on the top end. 

Would consider trades for scopes with at least 10x power and some adjustable turrets.

Gun comes with case, original magazine and extra handgrip (not pictured here). 

A few details about the gun. This is Sig's polymer 9mm. It has a nice DA/SA trigger that has a good pull in DA and a much shorter pull in SA. It also has a decocker next to where your thumb rests. As a DA/SA, it doesn't have a manual safety. Wear is minimal, because I've put very few rounds down range and it's been stored inside a padded Stack-On pistol safe. 

This has been my nightstand pistol for most of its time with me, and I'm the original owner. It was thoroughly taken down, cleaned and oiled in January. Since then, I've only put 20 rounds through it to qualify for my concealed carry permit. It has been an excellent firearm, but I just purchased a hunting rifle and have two SP2022s, so this one has to go.

HISTORY : 
Vis (Polish designation pistolet wz. 35 Vis, German designation 9 mm Pistole 35(p), often referred to as the Radom in English sources) is a 9 mm caliber, single-action, semi-automatic pistol. Originally designed by Piotr Wilniewczyc and Jan Skrzypinski in 1930 at the Fabryka Broni (Arms Factory) in Radom under Director Kazimierz Oldakowski, it was adopted in 1935 as the standard handgun of the Polish Army. Considered by many to be one of the finest handguns ever produced, it is highly prized among collectors of firearms.[1 History VIS Pistol construction The design was generally based on American firearms inventor John Browning's Colt M1911A1, operating on the short-recoil principle, with the barrel being cammed down and away from the locking lugs in the slide. Unlike M1911, the barrel was not cammed by a link, but by a ledge of sorts, which contacts a portion of the barrel and forces it down as it is moved rearward with the slide by the recoil force, similarly as in Browning's FN Hi-Power pistol and Spanish Ruby 0.45 ACP.[2] It differs from M1911A1 also in other details. Its characteristic feature was a triangular grip shape, wider at the bottom, offering good ergonomics and firm grip.[1] On the right side grip cover, the pistol had letters VIS in a triangle, on the left side—FB (for Fabryka Broni—""Arms Factory""). How Vis worked The handgun was prepared in late 1930, and at the beginning of 1931 the first pistols were ready for testing. Initially it was named WiS (an acronym of the Polish designers' names), later the name was changed to Vis, meaning ""force"" in Latin, with the wz. abbreviation for wzór (""model"").[3] The tests proved that the handgun was very accurate and stable (due to its size and mass, most stresses are absorbed and not passed on the shooter), while at the same time remaining reliable after firing more than 6,000 rounds.[1] The Vis was generally regarded as one of the best military pistols of that period. Production started in the state armory Fabryka Broni in Radom in late 1935, and the following year it was introduced as the standard weapon of Polish infantry and cavalry officers. Successively, other units were to be equipped, and by 1942 all other handguns were scheduled to be withdrawn from service. By mid-1938, it was introduced to the armored and air forces. Before the Invasion of Poland, approximately 49,400 (out of 90,000 ordered) were delivered to the army.[4] There was also a small information series of .45 ACP version, with 7 round magazine, but they were not produced in greater series.[4] A .22 LR variant also existed, but no details are known, and its series was not produced in great numbers.[4] Grips or Stock, LOP"

For sale or trade is a very nice Browning Gold Hunter 20 Gauge - Semi Auto Shotgun.  It has a 26"" vent rib barrel and comes with 2 Invector screw in chokes.  The wood is in excellent shape with only minor handling marks.  Metal is very good as well.  I list it as very good as there is an area at the muzzle where the bluing has been touched up and a new Hi Viz Spark II bead sight has been installed.  This is a very smooth shooting and reliable shotgun with relatively no recoil as in a 12 gauge.  You can install a Nordic magazine extension for $74.00 and make this an excellent home defense gun with an 11 shot capacity.  I do not shoot shotguns anymore so this one needs to go.

DANIEL DEFENSE M4 CARBINE, V7 LW

The Daniel Defense V7 LW is five ounces lighter than the standard V7. It uses our Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, providing each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the shooter to customize the rail set up. The DDM4v7 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Engineering 'Dragunov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragunov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragunov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering also offers a magazine adapter, not included here, to use AK47 mags. $450.00 OBO Cash only at this time.
