This rifle is in VGC and rare. So, please no tire kickers. The trades I listed are the ONLY trades, any other offers will be deleted and ignored. If you do not know these rifles, please do the research on them before you make any offer. The rifle is  numbers matching except the mag (electro-penciled on bolt and carrier). Good bore, strong grooves and excellent blue on the metal. It is in the RARE Naval AVT stock, with no arsenal repairs! Has new recoil springs installed as well, NO IMPORT MARKS!!! Shoots like a dream, and has nice cartouches on the stock, plus it has the BLACK bolt carrier, not the plum refurb. Rifle comes with a sling, roughly 400 rounds of ammo (silver tip surplus) AND a battle field dug up bayonet with scabbard. The bayo handle is rough, but the wood is intact, the blade is in VGC(was dug up from the Kurland battlefield last year after being buried almost 70 years!). Neat piece of history to go with the gun, restore it or leave it as is! Will not separate, cash price is $1675(or rifle alone, with nothing is $1550), or $1600 without the ammo. For as rare as the rifle is, and the extras it is priced at what it is worth, most SVT rifles are either in the standard stock (with arsenal repairs) or the standard AVT stock. This stock configuration is a rare bird. Price is firm, if you think you can find a better deal in KY please try, not many of these for sale anywhere, and I could not find ONE in the country for sale in this configuration and this good of shape. Can send more pics upon request, rifle is now on gunbroker for auction but I reserve the right to cancel the auction if it sells BEFORE someone bids on it. You must be willing to travel to me, I do not have time. Thanks for looking! Partial AK trades below. I will ship to your FFL on your dime(i will not ship ammo)"

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50. You can email through the sight or call or text me @ 931-312-912two

The last picture is from Actiontarget.com. I selected one rimfire target and one AR500 target. With shipping is well over $860! Who has that kind of money to waste? I know I don't!

Rimfire trees:
6 paddle = $200
8 paddle = $235
AR500 trees:
4 paddle = $275
6 paddle = $325

For an unbeatable deal, order one 8 paddle rimfire tree and one 6 paddle AR500 tree and get BOTH trees for only $475! You can't even buy 1 commercial AR500 tree for that price! 2 commercial trees like this would be well over $800.00!

The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$.

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade.

My store updates at 9pm - 3am. Stocks at 7am.

I received it from a friend who was downsizing his paint/body work shop and no longer needed it. THE TOOLBOX IS LOCATED IN MADISON GA, BUT I CAN DELIVER FOR A SERIOUS BUYER!!!!


After receiving the toolbox I cleaned it thoroughly inside and out. I removed the drawers one by one and cleaned them as well as lubed the tracks. I bought rubber mat and custom cut it to the size of each drawer. The last few pictures show this. My favorite part about this toolbox is the top. I bought a butcher block top and cut it to the perfect size to fit. It looks BEAUTIFUL!!! It is a sturdy butcher block made of solid wood. It's 1 and a half inches thick. 

I am also including the key which successfully locks all the drawers. 
I also have a bottle of red snap on touch up paint that I will include as well. 


Please give the pictures a good looking over before you offer.  I can email more pictures! This toolbox is in great shape and I have a good many hours of work cleaning it up and restoring it. I know what this toolbox is worth. It retails for $4,500. And aside from the light wear, this toolbox is just like what you would get straight from snap on.

Plain green
or
Rain stripe

I bought these in Lodz Poland about 10 years ago so it is unlikely you will see this type again.  They are a little odd but they are fairly well done.  The cover on the plain green one is not removeable.  It is actually molded it seems over the bottle.  Bottle, cap and retainer are a good quality plastic.  The molded cover has a foam inner surface that would help insulate the contents.  The rain stripe cover has a felt like liner and can be removed.
The caps are aluminum with fold out handles.  The caps/cups are painted and not suitable to hold or place in a campfire etc.  Straps are a little old fashioned but they lost the war I think, unless you ask Putin.......
Price is per canteen.  Buy 2 or more and I will take a buck off each.  If you need them mailed inside the CONUS better add $4 each for postage.

Ruger No. 1H Tropical .458 Win. Mag.

This is the older variant of No. 1 with the red recoil pad and the single line of text on the top of the barrel. The rifle is in amazing shape, the pictures do little to convey the figure in the wood and the beautiful bluing. While the .458 Win. Mag. is eclipsed by a handful of more powerful cartridges and only hurls its 510gr bullets around 2000fps, this remains a substantial round in one of the most stout guns ever built, this rifle is a striking example of a fine old Ruger Tropical rifle.

This particular rifle was purchased used in the mid 1990s and has taken its share of large rocks and water jugs over the years. It has spent most of the last decade living in the dark corner of the safe and has not been fired in several years. As time passes my shoulder will tense at the thought of taking it out again and the slight recoil generated by its enormous power; the time may have come for the gun to go to a younger, less frail owner. Serial Number is: 130-16xxx

There is no box or paperwork, just the beast itself along with three factory loaded rounds (turning green as it has been so long since its been fired) and five pieces of once fired brass."

Upper is a Del-Ton 16"" M4 that I bought new, 1x9 and Chrome-lined. I installed a Troy lo-pro gas block, Magpul MOE handguard in Foliage green and just installed a brand-new Armalite clamp-on FSB. I have a Battlecomp 1.0 muzzle brake out front, does everything it was advertised to.  The upper has t-marks.  Included is a small section of rail on the port side.  All pics taken on 04/03 and are accurate.

Includes Del-ton charging handle and BCG, with BCM extractor upgrade kit.  Ejection port cover is laser etched and reads ""Break Yo'Self"", kind of subdued but I thought it was fun. Some edge wear on the FWD assist and some marks on the barrel, edge of the Battlecomp, etc. Nothing major nor concerning.

BCG is a semi-auto style carrier.  I bought the upper from Del-Ton about 3-4 months before they started MP testing their bolts so it is not MP tested nor has any marks.  The extractor has BCM's ""donut"" and spring with insert, and it flings brass with authority.  I've never had a single failure with this upper.  I have shot Tula/Wolf no problems, typically I shoot Winchester brass cased .223 from my local Farm'n'Fleet.  Total round count is no more than 12-1300.  Cleaned and oiled after every use.



I would sell the upper alone for $540 shipped and insured.  I accept discreet Paypal plus fees or as a GIFT.  Knock off $20 if you pickup with cash in person.  I have excellent feedback on AR15.com and E-Bay, etc. 

-add the MBUS Gen2 in Foliage for $45 (its new but no box, Genuine and not PTS)
-add a Vortex SPARC red dot with mount in 9.5/10 condition (including all factory stuff and screw-in 2x magnifier) for $170.

The upper includes a set of faux-Larue index clips (I rec'd in trade a while back ) that I used to cover the sections of rail unused."

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

This rifle was over $1,200 new and now sales locally (Gander Mountain, Academy, etc.) for $1,099 plus tax. I am not asking for brand new prices but will only respond to reasonable offers. You won't have to pay sales tax on this new rifle so that's an extra $70-$90 savings.

When I got the holsters, I found them all too bulky for me and my activities.  I still prefer a kidney carry although with a smaller weapon.  This paricular one has a break in the strap behind the butt of the gun.  It should attach just forward of the tip and perpendicular to the strap coming out of the top.  In the picture of the back of the holster it is as it would look if attached.  The other strap that attaches to the buckle seems to have lost a little of its length.  It is a Hunter marked ""56L"" on the back.  Couldn't find it on their charts but got it as a 1911 holster.  I'm guessing that the strap on the back with a snap goes around your belt to hold the holster down while drawing.  It has no safety strap but holds the pistol snugly.  I am pricing it reasonably to cover repair and am still losing money."

For sale is my newly acquired S&W model 10 police trade in. I purchased this a few weeks ago, but unfortunately have had some unexpected bills come up. I have not fired this pistol since picking it up. Only cleaned and oiled it. This being a trade in, is not a show quality pistol, but the model 10s are legendary for accuracy and reliability. There is no play in the cylinder, and everything functions exactly as it should. This will make anyone a great shooter, or even a project gun if so desired. I am a maryland resident but have virginia military orders so i am legally alllowed to sell the pistol in either state. If in maryland you must have your HQL and we can meet at a police barracks. We will file the correct paperwork and after 7 days we can meet and you can take it home. If a virginia resident (again because of my orders i am legally authorized to sell in the state of  virginia) We can meet at a public place, and i will ask to see two forms of ID with preference shown to a carry and conceal, and ask you to sign a simple bill of sale. Or will happily meet at an FFL to perform the transfer however the fees will be on you. Only trades i may be interested in right now are noveske 5.56 barrels or noveske NSR. I can add cash for the barrel."

Quote from the website; The Ruger GP100 has long had the reputation of being an extremely rugged and utilitarian revolver.  Our Sales Manager was showing off his newly acquired Colt Python one day and it struck us that a GP100 with a high polish blue finish was something that needed to be done.  The Hogue rubber grips were replaced with nicely figured wood grips and the package came out better than we had ever hoped.  As a bonus, Ruger high polishes both the trigger and hammer, resulting in a nice, smooth, double action trigger pull.  Many owners of the Royal Phoenix have commented to me that these guns have the best out of the box actions they have ever seen on a GP100.  I think the polished parts play a major role in this.  With all the matte finished, plastic and rubber part guns out there, it was refreshing to offer a gun that harkens to the days of mirror blue finishes and figured wood grips."

This is a wonder to shoot. The gun is in great shape other than minimal wear mark from being shot. The gun has has about 200 rounds down the pipe, cleaned, and put into the safe. The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$.

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I answer email immediately, or can be reached by text. Please no calls.

SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA

It is in excellent condition with bright and shiny bores and chambers.  It has a couple of very minor dinks on the Schnabel forend, from incoming clay fragments.  The wood and bluing are otherwise virtually flawless.  It is equipped with a HiViz comp sight, but the original Bradley bead is included.  Comes with 3 Invector Plus chokes (F,M,IC), OEM choke tool, HiViz pipe kit, original box and manual.  It also includes a Browning Cynergy hard case with combination locks, that is in brand new/perfect condition.

The action locks up perfectly and the lever position is as new.  The receiver is nitride finished (factory) and there is no engraving or etching.  It is a very austere looking shotgun.  If bling is your thing, this probably won't warm you up very much.  The chambers will accept up to 3 1/2"" shells, but it has only seen 2 3/4"" to date.  The barrels are Invector Plus choked.

It can be easily converted from shell ejection to shell extraction, which is how I used it.  The ejectors thus have very little mileage on them.  I also used it with extended chokes so the barrel ends have been well protected.

The gun is available for sale and inspection at Gilcrest Farm Supply, John Taylor proprietor."

Trooper: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Trooper
1953 - 1969 The original Trooper was basically a heavy-barreled version of the Officers Model Match, and was based on Colt’s medium .41 frame. It was offered in .22 Long Rifle and .38 Special chamberings. Manufactured with fine carbon steel, it was available in both blued and nickel plated finishes. Early blued Troopers boasted a two-tone color scheme with dull Colt Royal Blue on the flat surfaces and a black bead blasted texture on the edges and cylinder flutes. Both Target and Service versions of the Trooper were available, the Target models sporting hand-filling Walnut grips, larger and wider target hammers, and adjustable iron sights. Service versions featured smaller more basic hammers and stocks, and fixed sights. Barrel lengths available included four inch in .22 caliber and four and six inch in .38 Special; the .22 was intended as a ‘practice’ weapon. All the Troopers from this series had hammer mounted firing pins. The Trooper was targeted at the entry-level and Law enforcement service-level segment of the firearms market while the highly polished and expensive 357 model revolver was intended to be their premium offering. Both models shared the same forged and labor intensive hand-fitted internal lockwork, however.[1]

After the introduction of the more expensive Python in 1955, most purchasers bypassed the .357 model, in favor the Python for a top-end revolver or the Trooper for a more basic one. This development motivated Colt to discontinue the basic .38 Special Trooper in 1961, and to do away with the .357 moniker, so they renamed it Trooper. The new offering retained the .357 magnum chambering and frame-mounted firing pin, but kept the entry-level revolver’s more subdued finish. The Trooper continued to be offered in .22 Long rifle, and like all .357 Magnums, offered the capability of firing .38 Special ammunition as well.[1]
