This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired. Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters. Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum. 

Condition is new old stock! It comes with an inspection receipt, original box and copy of ART MPC manual VAL AT $1,200.00"

All handgun, rifle and shotgun sales here on arms list will become a FELONY !   

 Call your state reps ASAP -- major anti-gun bill
 HB 1589 goes for a full House vote
 on Wednesday, Feb. 12





As reported earlier, HB 1589, which would make it a felony to sell or otherwise transfer a gun in New Hampshire without going through a licensed dealer, passed the House Commerce Committee by a party-line vote of ten Democrats to eight Republicans.   This Wednesday, February 12, it will be voted on by the full House of Representatives, whose party makeup is similar.  Because there are anti-gun Republican reps and pro-gun Democrat reps, the outcome is not foregone.  CALL YOUR STATE REP(s) ASAP and tell them why they should defeat this bill.  See the left side of the Pro-Gun New Hampshire website home page, at www.PGNH.org, for links on contacting your state representative(s).  

Here are some talking points when you call your state representatives:

1.  “Human rights and the specter of tyranny.”  The entire national gun community is well aware of the history of gun control: HB 1589 means that the government will eventually know who has what guns, meaning universal registration – which has historically, around the world, led to confiscation.  Think Jews in Nazi Germany, Armenians in 1920s Turkey, everyone in Soviet Russia and Ukraine... and contemporary Americans in California and New York City.  (1930s Germany was the most advanced country in Europe; it can’t happen here...right?)  See www.noubc.com.

2.  “Unintended consequences.”  HB1589 is such an outrageous, over-the-top attack on the Second Amendment community that people have already said that if it passes, they’ll ignore the new law, even at the risk of imprisonment.  This creates disrespect for government and police: think Prohibition, think marijuana laws; both encouraged generations of lawlessness and cultural change.  The ultimate expression of resistance to ever more Draconian anti-gun laws will be armed revolution – which is already being discussed in national conservative forums.  There are over 300 MILLION guns in private hands in the United States.  (That’s not a guess; it's from a US General Accounting Office report of a few years ago. The data is from the US Justice Department, which tracks manufacturing, imports, and exports of guns.)

3.  “Political poison.”  If New Hampshire’s Democrat legislators insist on this extreme anti-gun crusade, even union members won’t vote for them in the next elections.  Besides, if HB 1589 makes it out of the House, the NH Senate will kill it; think last year’s HB 135, which was less aggressively anti-gun from the viewpoint of Republicans.  Bills like this, if pursued by most Democrat legislators, will destroy the Democrat party in New Hampshire, which is still a basically conservative state.

          IF YOU DONT STAND UP NOW THEN WHEN?          GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND CALL.  YOUR ACTIONS WILL MAKE OR BREAK THIS BILL.

Do your homework.  This is not a run of the mill .257 Roberts.  If that's what you want, this is not the gun for you.  This was a special / uncatalogued run by Bill Ruger himself (see Jim Carmichel's book The Modern Rifle (page 202 top paragraph).

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired. Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters. Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum. 

Condition is new old stock! It comes with an inspection receipt, original box and copy of ART MPC manual VAL AT $1,200.00"

With durable synthetic stock and fore-end fully camouflaged in the high-quality Mossy Oak® Break-Up® pattern, this 12-gauge pump action shotgun is ready for the harsh weather and environment so often associated with turkey hunting.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around.

The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

(google it to see what it looks like) This is the gun that Ruger copied for their LCP version. It's a double-action semi auto that holds seven rounds. Only weighs 6.8 ounces!!  Neither the Keltec nor the Ruger are sold in California to non- law enforcement personell.  They are not on the Ca Approved Roster. HOWEVER, Mine was brought into the state legally & self-registered with the DOJ. It can be legally transferred. This may be the only P3AT that you can buy legally in this state. Gun is is good working order with a small amount of holster wear. Low round-count. 
     If you wish to get a micro-sized .380 in CA you can buy the approved Kahr P380 for $700-$900 or this. I can send you a cellphone pic if you'd like. Perry in La Mesa REDACTED.

It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 3 or more students).  The class is $75 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.

It is only worth what someone wants to pay for it.

This pistol has just been refinished to as good as its going to get.
Unfortunately, it sat in a holster for 30 yrs.
There was surface rust and some pitting, and the original finish was shot so i opted for the nickel refinish
It  is not flawless, in certain light you can see subtle specks of pitting on the receiver, barrel and inside of the trigger well, and a few other minor imperfections.
I will meet up with serious buyers for a full inspection and you alone decide on the purchase.
It does not come with a grip, you add one for $30 on up and make it look how you want.
I am listing all that I see in the interest of full disclosure and honesty.
Now for the positives, lock up, timing and action are perfect and everything is solid.
The owner passed 30 yrs ago and has not been shot since then, it is everything you expect in the 60's model pythons actions.

I am aware that removing a original finish diminishes the collector value, but believe me the original finish was gone already and it had no collector value left.

If you want a collector grade nickel or for that matter a 1965 python (if you can find one) to collect then plop down the $2500 to $3500 your going to pay for that piece.

I will let the market decide on this.
I will only accept cash offers and will send detailed pix to serious individuals since I can only post 3 here.

If I don't sell within a week of posting I will decide on any trade. Do not send me a trade offer at this time.

Leave me a number with your offer so I know you are a serious buyer, I know that Armslist is full of scammer colt offers, but this one is legit, and I have had many successful transactions on here.
I also have other listings for corroboration.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9.The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. 


Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Plus, he's an engineer and he works 5-7 days a week. No time for entertainment. He gave it to me as a gift but my house is too small for this large screen TV, so I'm looking to sell it.

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired. Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters. Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum. 

Condition is new old stock! It comes with an inspection receipt, original box and copy of ART MPC manual VAL AT $1,200.00"

The M2 Tactical, like all Benelli semiautomatic shotguns is Inertia Driven®, which uses recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. The M2 Tactical fires all 1? oz. or heavier 2¾"" and 3"" shot loads plus slugs.



The M2 Tactical features a fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sight and military-style fixed-blade front sight or adjustable rifle sights. In addition the M2 Tactical comes with either a matte black synthetic stock with tactical pistol grip, or with a ComforTech® stock that reduces felt recoil by as much as 48%. The M2 Tactical is a shotgun you can bet your life on.

The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro’s forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum.

The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.

I fell in Love with this Handgun at a Show in Nov. I placed an order and just received it on the 8th. Since then, I have joined a team that competes only with 1911s.
So I am selling my favorite handgun, to fund my new favorite hobby.

This Sig ran me over $1100 with shipping, fees, and taxes.
She comes with Sig Night Sights, 2 Sig Mags, Sig Tool, Sig Case, a lock, and the Best Part...
Sig's Lifetime Warranty that stays with it for the Life of the Firearm.

Sig said: The large-framed model, originally available in 9mm, .38 Super and .45 ACP, is the Sig P220, one of the company’s first handguns imported into the U.S.
Since then, it’s only been produced in .45 ACP and has a single-column magazine with a standard capacity of eight rounds.
Recently, Sig Sauer introduced the large-frame P227, which is also chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, but has a staggered, flush-fit magazine that holds 10 cartridges plus one in the chamber for a total capacity of 11 rounds. There is also an extended magazine available that increases the cartridge count to 14+1."

Look up the sights, indication markers are on front post sight reading: TG-H3. The reason I am selling the pistol so cheap is because I would like a new variety to my weekly shooting and I no longer have the fancy Case it came in from the store; along with any lock. The pistol comes with two magazines that was with the pistol originally. I purchased the pistol used, and have fired roughly 150 rounds through the weapon, if not less. The pistol is in good condition as seen in the photos, but there is a little wear and tear. Few cosmetic damages, such as surfaces scratches, none that are deep. As you can see the barrel is a little worn down, just from general use. 
At point of sale I require a PTP or a PTC and a valid MN state ID, for I want to feel comfortable that I am not selling this pistol to a felon or someone who has a violence related misdemeanor. I am not calling anyone a criminal, but I think you understand what I mean. 
OFFERS ARE FINE! please don't low ball me.. I'm willing to listen to any offers, but they require some type of firearm relation to the deal. Trades are ACCEPTABLE, but we both have to agree on terms.
This is the lowest I am willing to go for cash related offers, unless you can present me some type of proof to why I should go lower..or even higher. Send me your offers and I will respond shortly. Also, I will give you my phone number in email. I too am busy throughout the day and do not need a lot of random offers while I'm doing something important. Things I am looking for: Glock, AR15 related materials, Beretta, FN, and many others PLEASE don't be afraid to ask. Thank you, Derrick.
P.S. Bring our own case to carry the pistol home when purchased."

 I have only shot 1-30 round magazine through this to test function.

For those who may not know, AR pistols are 100% legal to own, as long as it is used as a pistol. If you add a 6 position shoulder stock, it is a short barreled rifle! If you add a vertical foregrip, it becomes a short barreled rifle! If you put this pistol upper receiver/barrel assembly on an AR lower from a rifle, it is a short barreled rifle!
 The good news...this was built as an AR pistol from a virgin lower, and is 100% compliant with all ATF rules & regulations. Ready to fire and have fun.
