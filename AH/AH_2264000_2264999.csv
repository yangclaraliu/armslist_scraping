Cal. 30-30. Serial # H151XX puts date of manufacture at 1951. 24""  barrel with Ballard rifling and 2/3 length magazine. This classic is an unmolested ""Waffle Top"" in excellent condition, made at what was probably the height of Marlin quality. If I had to grade it, I would put it at above 95% condition. The walnut stocks are are excellent, with no cracks or chips, and just a very few compression dents. The metal is also very fine with a hint of bluing wear on a couple of the sharp edges. The Ballard rifled bore is great with sharp shiny rifling. The action is smooth and tight with absolutely no issues, and it has the original sights and front sight hood. The Marlin ""Bullseye"" trademark was missing from the butt stock, and I have replaced it. There was a funky looking swivel tapped into the forend cap which I replaced with a plug screw. Other than that, no other changes or ""improvements"" have been made to it.
If you prefer to snipe deer at 400 yards, this one is not for you, but if you like to ""hunt"", in the traditional sense of the word, this is your tool. Traditional rifles like these are, sadly, gone and are not coming back. You will not be disappointed with this one in your collection, and it will only appreciate in value.  
Price is $495.00 + $20.00 for USPS insured delivery to your C&R or FFL. REDACTED or 3855HL(at)gmail(dot)com for questions, info, or more pictures.

Other info: In 1989 Colt made 500 of these bad boys and this is number 55. Has had a zip tie on it since leaving colt custom shop and has never been cocked, or racked or dry fired. This has the outer box, inner box and all paperwork straight from custom shop. Yes that is even the 24 year old string and safety label. It is probably one of few NIB ones that will show up in a lifetime as most were taken to cartels, or sent to ffls for their collections or stupidly fired. This is one of the rarest Colts in California and is staying here. It has been appraised at 4500 retail at 2 different shops and would be trophy in any collection. Please PM or text me at REDACTED. I am not against trading but will need at least 3k cash plus 1k in trades and I am into CZ and CZ clones and some Hipowers and Sig 226s.

Comes with Factory Hard Case.  When things go bump in the night nothing settles your nerves more than having a shotgun nearby that you know tips the odds in your favor. Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers. More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, you will need this."

Both have each had one mag ran in it just to check function and both ran great nice smooth glide on the bolts and both straight sights and gas tubes. rifle has a tapco ak-74 muzzle break added and pistol I had the thread cover weld broke and filed down so I could just slap on a muzzle break on when I found what I wanted each comes with 1 steel mag I bought a few more so I MAY include it if it makes or breaks the deal

I am selling my AR15 I bought from a friend who works at Mega Machine shop after they got the 'ok' from Colt to produce their own for their company workers and friends I was told. The upper is a basic Colt model with 16 in barrel with muzzle flash suppressor. The lower receiver is built by Stinger Arms & Mega Machine shop here locally near Seattle area. They have a good reputation for reliability and durability and I haven't had a single jam or problem what so ever and put roughly 200 rounds through it (.223&5.56both). Inside the chamber looks flawless even with flashlight. Bolt slides smooth and it is the model with the dust cover so sand and dust cant get in. Gun is is 90-95% new condition cosmetically. Accessories include - Adjustable butt stock, 30 rd mag (the good kind), aluminum quad rail with 90 deg angel fore grip that's easily removable and just basic sling which is actually quite comfy. Comes with stock 20 rd mag and 5 other aluminum mags and some stock parts.  Any questions feel free to email or text REDACTED. Also interested in partial trades for nice .300 caliber hunting rifle. Asking $1200 due to like new condition w/ some ammo and extras but open for offers. Sorry Stupid pics wont load right now trying to fix soon but feel free to text for pics. I lowered the price because the top carry handle is not removbeable but can still mount a sight on the rail provided. Thanks for looking and I did not know before posting this that the handle was unremoveable I'm sorry. Gun is still flawless and works like a dream. Good AR for people thay can't afford the exspensive ones for the same value -Thanks - Jason"

New in 1975, I bought it for squirrel hunting FOR ME. Magazine fed bolt action with open sights, the rifle will accept scope rings if you want. In the late 90's I had it customized to teach the Grandkids to shoot. The barrel was cut down to 16 1/2"", RECROWNED, and the front sight dovetail CUT back in. The birch stock was painted flat black and has a Jurassic Park Dinosaur decal. The bore is perfect as they learned how to clean as well as shoot. It takes S, L, & LR .22's and you can start with single shot and work up to 7 rounds so they won't waste ammo like the semi-auto kids of all ages. Originally it looked like the Marlin 50 pictured in the antiques category. It's a Model 25. The Grandkids are in communist New York so can't have it. The work cost as much as some kid size rifles. If I can't get $200, I'll carry it on my ATV at the farm. It has never been transported out of the case yet so still looks very good. After a ride in the woods I'll expect some scratches but you'll still never have to worry about failures to feed like semi-autos. LOCAL CASH SALE ONLY TO OHIO RESIDENT. NO TRADES OR SHIPPING.

The seat and bench of the Big Game Swivel Action Shooting Bench swivels 360 degrees, so you can find the most stable shooting position no matter what type of terrain you're on. Once you find that position, lock the rest in place with the swivel lock for a steady shot. Made out of steel, the bench has a weight rating of 300 lbs. but weighs just 39 lbs. itself, making for easy transport and setup. The 29 x 29 inch bench top has extended armrests on both sides, so you have a place to lean even if you're a left handed shooter. The 2 inch thick seat is 12 inches W x 14 inches D, so it gives you plenty of space to get seated just right just before you start shooting. The versatile gun rest accommodates all shooters and is adjustable to nearly any position. The rest is coated with non scratch rubber to protect your firearms. The bench top is covered with padded vinyl and has two shell gear pouches to hold spent cartridges, or other shooting accessories."

Other info: This is not your typical mosin. This is a Ex-PE sniper, one of the more rare variants of the Mosin snipers. There are three models: the PE, the PEM, and the PU. This mosin has distinct markings on the receiver (the C and N) as well as circles on the side of the receiver to show where it was drilled and a scope was mounted. Bought this rifle about 2 months ago from a guy on craigslist. It was sporterized when I bought it so I purchased an original stock to drop it in. It is a 1935 Tula Ex-PE and it is beautiful. I had every intention of restoring it to its former glory but alas my funds have run out and I need to focus on my Savage MKII and AR. I've put 60rds of privi partizan through it, very accurate and awesome to shoot. The package includes the original sporterized stock, a full stock(has a recoil pad but I have the original metal buttplate), and a rifle sock. Rifle is not all matching and the original owner used lime-away or something on the magazine to get rid of some rust and messed it up in the process. However, magazines are cheap and I may even purchase one to replace this one. The overall condition of the rifle is fair to good and would make an excellent restoration project for someone with the time. This is C&R so just cash and carry. First person to pm me saying ""Ill take it"" and puts cash in my hand gets it. I need to sell this soon before I change my mind and decide to keep it . Will meet at oak tree gun club.

It rivals speeds of the 5.56/.223 round in the 2,600 to 3,000 fps depending on grain size. 

I will post pics in a few days as my camera on my phone gave out. So I apologize for that up front, however the gun is simply incredible. This is not your normal Savage B.Mag out of the box like others. 

I have tweaked the gun to shoot smaller MOA and have added some upgrades. The main thing is that this is not your out of the box gun in how it functions. It was great before the upgrades, but the tweaks have made it a proper shooting Varmint Sniper. 

Open to negotiate price within reason. So lets make a deal...   

Gun includes: 

- Savage B.Mag .17 WSM 
- 4-16x50 Mildot IR Reticle Scope and Base
- Bipod - 7.5"" Low Profile w/ Folding Legs
- Gun Strap
- Gun Case

Work done: I resin bedded the stock for stiffness along with other work to the stock which has given it a much stiffer for accuracy shooting. The Gun was broke in as described here: 
Break In Process Includes: 
- Clean Barrel with Solvent
- Shot 1st Round then Cleaned (Repeated 10 Times)
- Shot 5 More Rounds then Cleaned (Repeated 3 Times for 15 Rounds)
- Shot 25 Rounds and Cleaned
Shot 50 Rounds Total. 

This gun has only 50 Rounds shot which was the break in process. This break in process is so vital for any gun that you purchase. If you don't, then you will have a less than accurate gun over time because of the initial left over microscopic slivers of metal from the factory or other debris. So always break in your gun straight out of the box. It will extend the life of your barrel.

The cylinder is near perfect, excellent bore and wood, an overall prestine example of what this revolver must have looked like when handed to a proud new owner. This is a 'piece of History'. Will send more pictures upon request. Seller will pay shipment FLL to FLL. ( one just like this sold for $2,070.00 on 9/7/2012 Rock Island Auction item # 1751)."

The Interceptor armor is also compatible with the Molle gear system, but the system is rapidly declining in popularity among troops and turning more to the Interceptor. Addition of the SAPI plates brings the level IIIA basic interceptor armor up to a solid level III protection. Plates are 7.62mm resistant and up. Plate is as thick as a quarter coin shown in picture, open to all trades."

The barrel is stationary or locked in place at all times but is easily removable for service. The pistol is fed by an 8 round detachable box magazine. It utilizes a blade type front sight and a V notch rear sight. The pistol uses a one piece wrap around Walnut wood grip. The total length of the pistol is 6.1 inches and it weighs in at an unloaded weight of 21 ounces. The pistol has a manual safety that is located on the left side of the frame and operated by the users thumb. The pistol also incorporates an automatic magazine safety which blocks the firing of the pistol when the magazine is removed. There is a slide hold-open device installed on this pistol, but once the slide is in the open position, it can only be released by inserting a fresh magazine either empty or charged.


 ""MAUSER - 7.65"" This stamping indicates that the manufacturer of the pistol is Mauser and that the caliber is 7.65mm(.32 ACP).
The picture on the right is of the markings that are found on the left hand side of this pistol. These markings are as follows, ""WAFFENFABRIK MAUSER A-G.OBERNDORF A.N."" and then underneath that is ""MAUSER'S PATENT"" Then underneath all of this and located on the side plate of the frame is the Mauser logo. The first line translates to Mauser Weapons Factory incorporated in the city of Oberndorf on the river Neckar. The abbreviation A.G. indicates Aktiengesellschaft or literally translates to corporation. German companies that are publicly traded are designated by the letters ""AG"" after the company name. The letters ""A.N."" at the end of the top line is an abbreviation of ""am Neckar"" which indicates on the river Neckar. This is an important marking as there are several Oberndorfs in Germany and Austria, but there is only one Oberndorf on the river Neckar in Germany. The bottom line tells us that the pistol is made under patents that the Mauser firm holds.
The serial number is found on the four main steel parts on this model 1914 pistol.

    I anticipate that the cost of ammo is gonna go way up, if you can get it at all.

    Posted on October 25, 2013

    In December, the final primary lead smelter in the United States will close. The lead smelter, located in Herculaneum, Missouri, and owned and operated by the Doe Run Company, has existed in the same location since 1892.

    The Herculaneum smelter is currently the only smelter in the United States which can produce lead bullion from raw lead ore that is mined nearby in Missouri's extensive lead deposits, giving the smelter its ""primary"" designation. The lead bullion produced in Herculaneum is then sold to lead product producers, including ammunition manufactures for use in conventional ammunition components such as projectiles, projectile cores, and primers. Several ""secondary"" smelters, where lead is recycled from products such as lead acid batteries or spent ammunition components, still operate in the United States.

    Doe Run made significant efforts to reduce lead emissions from the smelter, but in 2008 the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for lead that were 10 times tighter than the previous standard. Given the new lead air quality standard, Doe Run made the decision to close the Herculaneum smelter.

    Whatever the EPA's motivation when creating the new lead air quality standard, increasingly restrictive regulation of lead is likely to affect the production and cost of traditional ammunition. Just this month, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that will ban lead ammunition for all hunting in California. The Center for Biological Diversity has tried multiple times to get similar regulations at the federal level by trying, and repeatedly failing, to get the EPA to regulate conventional ammunition under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

    At this time, it's unclear if Doe Run or another company will open a new lead smelter in the United States that can meet the more stringent lead air quality standards by using more modern smelting methods. What is clear is that after the Herculaneum smelter closes its doors in December, entirely domestic manufacture of conventional ammunition, from raw ore to finished cartridge, will be impossible.

The Interceptor armor is also compatible with the Molle gear system, but the system is rapidly declining in popularity among troops and turning more to the Interceptor.

Just an FYI you might not buy this gun but I think we need to get behind these American companies. This company is in Daytona Beach and as long as you have the warranty card that comes with the gun it is warrantied for life (it follows the gun). They show they want to improve by listening to the consumers and changing things to make the Gen 2. Support AMERICAIN MADE when you can, That's all I'm saying."
