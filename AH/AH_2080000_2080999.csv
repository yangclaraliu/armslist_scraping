30,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2080030,For Sale:  DPMS LR-308 (AR 10) .308 WIN Hog Slayer!,"Frisco, Dallas, Texas","$ 1,700","Listed On: Thursday, September 5, 2013",Rifles,DPMS                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I am selling my DPMS LR-308 with the following upgrades:
Tri-Delta Steel Muzzle Brake, Picatinny Rail Handguards, 800 Lumen Flashlight w/mount, Tactical Foregrip w/ bi-pod, Tactical Pistol Grip, Vltor Mod 4 Charging Handle (Large Latch), Quick-Release Sling Swivel, Israeli Sniper Butt Stock w/adjustable cheek rest and Leupold VXR Patrol 3-9x40mm Scope w/ Fire Dot Reticle and Leupold Scope Mounts. I am also including 2 - 30 round steel magazines, 2 boxes of Hornady .308 WIN 155 gr OTM W/C Match-Grade Ammo, 15 rounds of Remington .308 WIN 168 gr Hog Hammer Ammo and a locking hard case (w/ keys). I will also throw in a handful of 147gr FMJ. The rifle does not like them so I only shot a couple out of the box.
The rifle is about 4 months old and has had about 150 rounds put through it and dropped numerous hogs over the Summer. It is broken in but has not been abused. I have fired one magazine rapid-fire just to ensure that the rifle would cycle rounds that quickly if I wished to do so. I bought it to shoot hogs not to play Army so I have not had the need to do so a second time. And good ammo is too expensive to burn through pointlessly. 
The scope is zeroed dead on at 100 yards. The Fire Dot reticle is awesome. Since I zeroed the scope at least 90% of my shots were quick shots that I would not have had time to take aim with a normal scope reticle and would likely not have even been able to see the reticle in the very low-light conditions. I just put that red dot on the pig and it's over. I have dropped pigs from 25 yards to 320 yards with no problem.
My cost to build the rifle to its current state is $2,677. I will sell it without the scope for $1700 or with the scope for $2200.
I would consider offers of trades for a crossbow, higher magnification scope, Taurus Judge Magnum or other handgun of at least .45 ACP caliber, or other hunting gear of good quality plus cash."

I have quite a bit of ammo that I am looking to off load for a complete high end AR lower.

The first up is 585 rounds of 45 ACP 230 grain, mixed FMJ and hollow point. The bulk of this 45 is reloaded. This was done by LAX firing range. I have personally inspected and fired this ammo. I had no FTF and or FTE. I looked at each case for dents,dings and or any case damage that would impede the function of this ammo. I could not find any. 

There are two boxes of factory loaded 230 grain FMJ and three boxes of PDX 230 grain hollow points.

Second up is 300 rounds of new steel case 7.62x39 ammo and four new steel mags still in the bag, oh and one lonely Tapco mag. 

As stated, I am looking to trade this ammo for a complete lower, no polymer. So lets hear what ya got! 

Thanks for looking!"

22LR Aguila .22 Interceptor--Copper Plater--Hollow Points--1470fps

Bullet details....40-grain copper plated lead round nose bullet. Screaming hot and hard-hitting! Gives 1470 fps with a 40 grain bullet. Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

The Lower consists of a Spikes ""Florida Hometown"" lower which was a limited run of 500 with a Daniel Defense LPK, Magpul MOE grip and Stock in FDE with a Magpul ASAP sling attachment.

The upper is a PSA with a 16"" FN MPI/Chrome Lined barrel, LMT Full Auto BCG, BCM Gunfighter CH, and a FDE Troy Flip-Up Rear Battlesight.

To be included in the package is 5 Magpul Pmags all in FDE (tough to find right now, unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for them) 3 of which are still in the wrapper. Also to be included is roughly 300 rounds of 5.56/.223 consisting of 180 rounds of Winchester 62g 5.56 Green Tip, 50 +/- federal 55g .223, and 60 rounds of Silver Bear 55g .223. Finally I will throw in a Blackhawk Sportster tactical soft case with the rifle. Just FYI some of the ammo is already loaded into the 2 open mags, I can take it out but it will be loose.

This pistol was purchased brand new less than a year ago and has had less than 100rds through it, never carried, never in a holster and is essentially brand new. It includes all of the factory paperwork, case and (2) 10rd magazines. Extras include a Pierce base-plate extension on one magazine and an A&G spacer for a 17rd magazine so that you have an extended grip. Also installed is an OEM Glock smooth trigger as I didn't care for the serrated trigger face. The original is included as well. 

I don't need to sell it, but since it is a safe queen that doesn't get shot, I thought I'd offer it for trade or a good cash offer. I'm really looking for two pistols right now; which include a full size Springfield XDm 45 in similar condition (5.25 competition or 4.5 standard length) as well as a nickel S&W 39-2 or stainless S&W 639. I like S&W revolvers as well. If you have a quality handgun trade, feel free to email and I'll respond promptly.

You must be a Wisconsin resident and willing to sign a bill of sale. I have a Wisconsin CCL that I'm happy to show you as well for your peace of mind. Thanks!

Note, This picture is all I have at the moment, but can email a better picture later this evening if needed."

Cross Wynoochee river on hwy 12 towards Aberdeen, go up hill, take left on Clemons rd, about a mile down.  Lots of typical garage sale items, priced to sell, just need gone. I will also have a good selection of ammo from my personal collection. Some of the ammo was bought pre shortages, others were just bought here and there. Some of the calibers available will be .22lr, .22mag, .380, .40,.45,10mm. Some of the hardest to find rifle calibers on the market .223, 6.5grendel, 5.7x28, several varieties of 300 blackout,.458 socom(yes you read that right, it does exist) a little bit of .308, and 30-30. Now I am not looking to gouge but not just giving it away either. Prices for the most part will be around current retail, maybe a couple bucks more depending on caliber. Example .22lr will be a few bucks more than it would be on the shelf (if it were on the shelf, it is not in my area at least). Some ammo might even be cheaper, i.e. fn 5.7x28, which I haven't seen on a shelf for more than 6 months less than 50$ for a box of 50.  No taxes and no buying limits, this is first come first served basis only, sale starts at 9am, no early birds please. Please do not send emails asking to hold ammo or making silly offers, I am not desperate for cash or anything. I am just trying to allow fellow shooters to acquire some ammo in which they may have been searching.  I also have a good condition, older Winchester model 70 375h&h mag with a box of ammo for sale. A few other related items, a few mags, some cleaning brushes, a brand new call, etc.   Thank you.   p.s. some of the items in the pic of all the ammo may be gone and others added, just trying to give an idea of what types and amount of ammo that will be available."

•	Inspection for Damage Process
All LTL freight deliveries MUST be inspected for damage at the time of delivery. The banding will need to be cut and the box taken off the safe in order for proper inspection. The safe itself should be inspected for any signs of damage to include indentions and friction marks. Any signs of damage MUST be noted on the delivery receipt for any attempt of a discount or refused for a replacement and you MUST notify us within 24 hours. Please note that the driver cannot leave until the delivery receipt is signed for. If you are uncertain of the proper procedures please contact Hollon Safe immediately. Again, Do NOT sign for the shipment until you have thoroughly inspected for any damage. Hollon Safe is not responsible for shipments that are not signed for as damaged upon arrival. Occasionally there may be damage that is not apparent upon receipt of a shipment. Some freight carriers allow up to 15 days from receipt of shipment to accept claims of concealed damage, others do not. After the allowable time of concealed damage claims has passed, Hollon Safe Company cannot assist with freight claims. For this type of damage, a replacement safe is not an option. Any discount will be given once the claim has been approved. 

All freight shipped via Hollon Safe is shipped in an upright position, banded down to a wooden pallet.

Under NO circumstances shall the consignee discard the pallet or packaging material until the safe has been determined to be in good working condition and/or all claim issues have been resolved. When the delivery receipt is signed by the consignee in good condition.
