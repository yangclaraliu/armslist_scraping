DESCRIPTION BELOW:

While this Sig sells new for MSRP $1,000.00 without upgrades, you can now take advantage of purchasing it for less with the following: It comes equipped with night sites (new would run $100+), I also have original Sig equipped wood grips on it (new, just over $100). I also am throwing in a pair of rubber-based Hogue grips ( new, at $24.95).  I am also including, for self defense purposes a 20-round box of ammo ( containing 16 rounds of Cor-Bon hollow point +P and 4 rounds of Federal hydro-shock hollow point +P), a $30.00 plus dollar value.  And for safety around the home (child proof) I am throwing in a lock (roughly a $10-$15 dollar value).  If you bought all this in Ohio, new, plus tax at 7%, it would run you $1,353.50!  However, since I need to move this gun I am sacrificing it for a FIRM PRICE OF $650.00!  No background check, no finger printing, just a straight up sale!

ALSO IS EQUIPPED WITH TWO (2) BRAND NEW, NEVER FIRED, HIGH CAPACITY SIG SAUER 15-ROUND CLIPS (PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM SIG ARMS, MADE IN ITALY).  ALSO HAS A NEW RECOIL SPRING (ALSO FROM SIG ARMS & +P of course).  NOTE: IT DID NOT NEED A NEW SPRING, I PUT ONE IN AS TO RE-MAKE THE GUN AS NEW AS POSSIBLE.  

[RULES OF ENGAGEMENT]

1.SERIOUS INQUIRES ONLY.

2. NO DRY FIRES -- ONE MUST ACCEPT THE HIGH QUALITY AS IS, THIS SIG IS IN SUPERB CONDITION!  IF YOU FEEL OTHERWISE PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT.  YOU ARE BUYING A GUN WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DRY FIRED, EVER.

2.WILL BE SOLD FOR LOCAL PICK UP ONLY, WITH WITNESS VERIFICATION.

3.MUST HAVE LICENSE PICTURE ID OF PERSON PURCHASING AND BE WILLING TO SIGN OVER A TRANSFER-CONTRACT FOR MY BUSINESS RECORDS AND LEGAL    PURPOSE (ALSO, FREE OF CHARGE, WE WILL HAVE BOTH OF OUR CONTRACTS NOTARIZED ON SITE AT THE BANK).  THIS ENTIRE BANK TRANSACTION WILL ONLY TAKE AROUND 5-MINUTES OR SO.  WE'RE DONE!

4. PAYMENT MUST BE MADE IN FORM OF CASH ONLY AND TOGETHER WE WILL SIMPLY MEET AT MY BANK,  DEPOSIT THE CASH INTO MY ACCOUNT. 

I MAY BE REACHED AT REDACTED MOST ANY TIME.  PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE IF I AM NOT AVAILABLE, AND I WILL RETURN YOUR CALL AS SOON AS I CAN.

Gun is absolutely beautiful. It has been professionally re-blued and is of collector quality, furniture is perfect and is untouched. I have owened 3 of these during my years and this is by far the nicest one not that I have owened but the nicest I have ever seen. Gun is very rare and these Winchesters rarely come up for sale so I am sure it wont last long.  Can text pics upon request.Thank you for looking."

The photos do not represent the durablity of this rack.   I had it custom build by a local welder.  After the initial build, it was so heavy that moving it was difficult.  So, we made the legs removal.  Honestly, it is still heavy.  I've shot it with hundreds of rounds of .40 & 9 and it holds up great.   Its also been shot with .45 and the plates handle it fine.   

Plates reset with the pull of a rope.  If you want to work on speed drills and have years of fun shooting steel; this is what you need.

M6A2 SPR
in Flat Dark Earth

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The VENOM quickly and easily mounts by simply twisting out the existing cylinder pin and twist in the new LaserLyte integrated laser and cylinder pin configuration. The VENOM integrated laser holds the tiny 4x377 batteries, the switch and laser all in one compact package (less than two inches). The VENOM adds very little bulk to the gun, yet provides the user with the gained confidence of aiming accuracy. No sighting in is required with the VENOM due to the fixed-point-of-aim provided at the LaserLyte factory.

The minuscule circuitry within the LaserLyte VENOM laser holds a programmable laser with: constant on, pulse mode and an auto-off after 6 minutes. The battery life is five hours* in constant on and ten hours* in the pulse mode.

*Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

So basically you get $100 off the price you would buy it at the store for since you dont have to pay taxes or anything. It is the NEW edition that just came out that is ALL camo, not like most you see that dont have a camo barrel.

 Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.
 Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.

I just picked this up in trade, and I am loving it, but since arms list is addictive, I am testing the waters to see if I can find something I can't live without. This is a bitone sig sauer p220, sporting bright siglite night sights. It is in near new condition, and has been cared for responsibly. The original blue (not a CPO red box sig) box is included, and it comes with three magazines. I put about 60 rounds through it last night, and it performed perfectly and SCARY accurate. 

According to sig sauer, these were designed to be the most “accurate out of box .45"" available...it won't let you down!
