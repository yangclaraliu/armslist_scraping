78,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2740078,For Sale/Trade:  PRICE DROP! HOLD OUT ON PYTHONS AND COLTS A LITTLE LONGER!!,"Wisconsin, Wisconsin, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 25, 2014",Handguns,Colt,no type,no type,no type,"Hey just giving shooters a heads up on Colts, especially Pythons. Just wait it out a bit longer if your looking to get one of these fine guns because the market is about to drop big time later this year. Unfortunately a lot of investors got into them for investments only which drove up the prices. This caused shooter like myself not to be able afford them because they went from $800-$1500 guns to now $2,000-$4,000 guns depending on which version you had. These puppies are made to be shot and not tossed back and forth between investors. Pythons are still very common online and offline, but thanks to investors who bought them at a $1000 to sell for $1500 and so on till now, investors are peaking. Investors are now stuck trying to sell a blued python for $2000+ and they aren't moving. Keep the waiting because if you go to the shows like I do and go online a lot you see they aren't moving like they use to. Hell some people are trying to get a MKIII Troopers which is a $500-600 gun all day for over $1000. These guns weren't built smooth and are a poor mans Python. My Smith 19 and Ruger with outlast troopers all day long and are much smoother to shoot. With this sluggish economy and Obamacare sticking it to people, no one is going to drop $2000 on a python.  So keep holding out and watch the prices drop! This isn't anything different then when investors destroyed the Muscle Car market and the Comic book market. In the 90's certain comics sky rocketed and were valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars, today you cant give them away, Those same comics can be bought online at Ebay for $5. SO HOLD OUT BECAUSE WHEN THE INVESTORS LEAVE THE PRICES WILL DROP!! I hope a lot of you investors take a huge hit!"

Made when Stalin was just consolidating power, and when Hitler was barely on anyone's radar screen.This is  an early one dated 1933 with the tiny CAI St. Albans import mark only on the barrel. Grips are a nice dark reddish brown color and not the current crop of orange ones. It is matching and the action on this one is smoother than most of the Pre-World War II Nagants I have owned. SA trigger pull is a joy, and the DA pull is quite manageable even before using the famous ""bullet trick"" to lighten it. I bought this one from a local collector, so it doesn't have one of the holsters that the later imports come with. I do have a leather lanyard for it, so that will be included as well. Since it doesn't have a holster, I thought I might add something you would actually use. I have 2 boxes of older Fiocchi ammo for it, plus 26 rounds of current PPU that is not pictured. I like this older Fiocchi ammo better than the current crop because it is loaded closer to the original power of the original surplus ammunition. This was made before the lawyers got to Fiocchi. So that's a total of 126 rounds of ammunition.  After you shoot it, save the box, because if you look again, they misspelled ""Nagant"" as ""Naganat"" lol. The PPU ammo is just some that I had left over so I may as well send it along so you can have plenty of ammo to play with the revolver. 

These shoot a unique and very cool round, the 7.62x38R or 7.62 Russian. However it also will shoot plain old .32 S&W, and it really likes .32 H&R Magnum, which fits it nicely. SO ammo is not a problem. All three are sold in most gun shops. The .32 H&R is a cool little self defense round by the way, especially with some of the hot rounds out there.

Birch stock, parkerized finish on the metal. Comes with GI style sling and oiler, plus a dual mag pouch for the stock. Will come with two blued 15-rd magazines, both stamped with a ""U"" on the back (Union Tool company, I think).

I also have 570 rds of .30 carbine ammo. Original milsurp Lake City FMJ from 1952. I opened the spam can myself , and fired 30 rds of it. It all comes on 10rd stripper clips, and comes in 5 cloth bandoleers. I also have 95 rds of 110 gr SP ammo made by PPU (sold under the name Monarch at Academy sports).

I'm asking $550 for the rifle by itself (with sling, mag pouch, and magazines), and $800 for everything. That works out to 38 cents per round, which is less than anything on Gunbot right now.

I'm in Chattanooga, and I can drive a fair distance to meet, but I would rather not ship. If you absolutely must have it shipped, you'll need to cover the actual shipping cost, and the transfer fee on my end if your end won't accept it mailed straight from me. This firearm is not C&R eligible."

While the Colt name is virtually synonymous with handguns, Sam Colt’s initial revolvers off the assembly line were longarms. Manufactured with a rifle stock and a 32” barrel, it featured an eight-shot cylinder that the operator rotated by using a ring lever located in front of the frame. Later, Colt introduced one of the first practical slide action rifles. Then in 1963 the AR-15® and M16 5.56mm automatic rifles made Colt ""the small-arms sensation of modern warfare”. Their unmatched accuracy, performance and durability are available in their direct descendant, the Colt semiautomatic-only sporting rifles. They’re ideal for hunting, plinking and competition shooting.

This rifle features a Chrome Lined 16"" Cold Hammer Forged Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel with a popular 1:7"" twist rate.

Telescopic sight attaches to grooved receiver with included rings.  Stock modified by installation of sling mounts, swivels and nylon sling.

Acquired about Mar 2012, approximately 1000 pellets fired since, so it is well broken in at this point.  No BBs have ever been near this rifle, let alone fired through it.  The .177 pellets it likes include:  Beeman 7.7 gr coated wadcutters; Crosman 7.4 grain competition and 7.9 grain premium wadcutters; Crosman 10.5 gr premier ultra magnum domes; JBS 13.4 gr match diabolo exact monster domes; and RWS 7.0 gr basics wadcutters.  As would any other self-respecting air rifle, it despises Daisy 7.2,3,4,5,? wadcutters.  I have used it to retrain in rifle marksmanship after a break of several decades.  I am looking to part with it now as I have since acquired and use as my principal air rifle a Benjamin Trail gas piston air rifle, have limited long gun storage space, and wish to use the space I have available for firearms.  Otherwise, I would keep and continue occasionally to shoot this rifle.

Springfield Armory XDS9409B XD(S) Slim 9mm 4"" 7+1/9+1 Black Poly Grip/Frame Blk

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S
model comes with a durable rugged case and two  magazines--one
flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag
X-tension 9-round magazine.

This is a ALMOST MINT Sig 1986 P226 with the Mud Slots cut into the frame.  This design was implemented to utilize in the military for when a pistol is dropped in mud, sand, water, and it will spit out the mud and the gun will still function.  I have the last gen of the mudrails.  The frame has ZERO wear marks and the pistol is in immaculate shape.  Only spots are on the barrel.  I have a set of E2 grips that I will throw in.  I also have a holster I will throw in.  I also have 4 mags to go along with this gun. I will also throw in a hard case.  

These guns are hard to find and to the right person may be a collector.  This is a German made gun and was produced when Sig was in Tysons Corner.  This was the best years for Sig.  

If you want to trade, must at least be of value because chances are unless I really like it, I will be selling it too.  I have CHL and would like you too as well.  If not i will snap a photo of your DL and create a bill of sell for my files."

Telescopic sight attaches to grooved receiver with included rings.  Stock modified by installation of sling mounts, swivels and nylon sling.

Acquired about Mar 2012, approximately 1000 pellets fired since, so it is well broken in at this point.  No BBs have ever been near this rifle, let alone fired through it.  The .177 pellets it likes include:  Beeman 7.7 gr coated wadcutters; Crosman 7.4 grain competition and 7.9 grain premium wadcutters; Crosman 10.5 gr premier ultra magnum domes; JBS 13.4 gr match diabolo exact monster domes; and RWS 7.0 gr basics wadcutters.  As would any other self-respecting air rifle, it despises Daisy 7.2,3,4,5,? wadcutters.  I have used it to retrain in rifle marksmanship after a break of several decades.  I am looking to part with it now as I have since acquired and use as my principal air rifle a Benjamin Trail gas piston air rifle, have limited long gun storage space, and wish to use the space I have available for firearms.  Otherwise, I would keep and continue occasionally to shoot this rifle.
