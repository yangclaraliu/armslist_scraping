I’m more of a Glock guy but here is what I know about the Vaquero. 

Ruger “New” Vaquero in 45 Long Colt, 4 5/8” barrel, case hardened finish, Altamont pearl grips (factory black cheese grater grips included), Triple K Single Action western style holster, 20 rounds of Corbon Hunter and 50 rounds of Herters lead round nose, original box, docs, and lock keys included.

The original owner indicated that he had fired one box of ammo before placing this in his nightstand. Judging by its pristine condition I have no reason to doubt the statement. Also, this is appears to be a “New” model Vaquero as it begins with S/N 510 – xxxxxxxx  and was produced with the revised cylinder bore process as the Ruger “Billboard” safety warning is under the barrel as opposed to the side… more aesthetically appealing in my humble estimation.

I priced all of this online and would be looking to get $725 cash,  would consider partial firearm and assy. trades, or even a motorcycle project trade.

Let me know if I missed anything on the details or if the pricing is way off.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle."

They are 37x12.50x16.50 with double beadlock rims included. Lower tread BFG sets (60%) are $380. All tires are mounted on 24 bolt beadlocks. New these tires retail for $550 each, the rims retail for $250. For less than the price of one new tire and rim you can get 4 mounted on double beadlocks. The bolt pattern is 8 on 6.5 and fits nearly all 3/4 ton and 1 ton applications. Don't overpay for super swampers or other inferior offroad tires that puncture easily and wear out quick on pavement get military grade tires. These tires are made of a much stronger rubber compound that is tougher and far more expensive to make than what is used to make standard tires. Tire companies use cheaper compounds to increase profits and make tires wear faster, forcing you to buy new ones quicker. The military demands performance that the public can't. Tire companies compete for huge military contracts for 2 reasons: one is a whole lot of money, and two is bragging rights on the brand that supplies the military with the tires that take them anywhere. These tires are highly puncture resistant and wear very little on pavement all while getting excellent grip in all conditions. Look around online and you'll find these are the best prices out there (miltaryoffroadtires.net $920 for set of 4 tires with rims and beadlock inserts, wartires.com $999 for a set of 4 tires with rims and beadlock inserts.) No trades cash only. Ive already done a little trading and need to get cash out of what I have left. Prices are FIRM I have had a lot of interest and know that soon they'll be gone.

They are 37x12.50x16.50 with double beadlock rims included. Prices vary depending on condition. I have 1 Lower tread BFG set (60%) they are $380. All tires are mounted on 24 bolt beadlocks. New these tires retail for $550 each, the rims retail for $250. For less than the price of one new tire and rim you can get 4 mounted on double beadlocks. The bolt pattern is 8 on 6.5 and fits nearly all 3/4 ton and 1 ton applications. Don't overpay for super swampers or other inferior offroad tires that puncture easily and wear out quick on pavement get military grade tires. These tires are made of a much stronger rubber compound that is tougher and far more expensive to make than what is used to make standard tires. Tire companies use cheaper compounds to increase profits and make tires wear faster, forcing you to buy new ones quicker. The military demands performance that the public can't. Tire companies compete for huge military contracts for 2 reasons: one is a whole lot of money, and two is bragging rights on the brand that supplies the military with the tires that take them anywhere. These tires are highly puncture resistant and wear very little on pavement all while getting excellent grip in all conditions. Look around online and you'll find these are the best prices out there (miltaryoffroadtires.net $920 for set of 4 tires with rims and beadlock inserts, wartires.com $999 for a set of 4 tires with rims and beadlock inserts.)

It has been through the SIG Custom Shop for the SIG Service Package, which consists of replacing all of the springs and pins, as well as SigLite night sights. Just about every P6 out there has the post and dot sights. It was also ultrasonically cleaned by SIG.  SIG also replaced the mainspring with one from a 225 so this gun doesn't have that 14 pound DA pull anymore, it's closer to the factory standard 10 pounds DA and 4.5 pounds on the SA. Check around Armslist, there's a lot of people asking more money for P6s that haven't been refurbished by SIG and don't have night sights. 

Comes with 1 factory SIG mag, and one Promag which works well, that I found at Kittery Trading Post. Also comes with original SIG box. 

For trades I'd consider a Walther PPS in 9mm, or a partial trade towards a Browning Hi-Power or HK USP 9mm."

Savage model 101 single shot .22lr pistol. This is an interesting little single shot pistol that has been styled to look like a single action revolver. It has a 5.5inch barrel, a windage adjustable rear sight, wood grips, and a unique swing out design in which the whole barrel rotates out of the frame with the cylinder. The ejection rod is functional. 
There is no rust or pitting, but  a few wear marks.  I would say it's  70% condition.

This sleek all black gun can be yours. I had a black sling on it but use it on my .308 now. Reason for selling is because I have my .308 I use now and this gun just sits around. Now that there is rifles allowed statewide you can use this anywhere!!! Great gun and looks awesome too. You will get the original magazine with this gun as well. Holds 4 rounds in the mag and one in the chamber so 5 total. 

The Leupold scope is not included in the price but can be for sale for the right price. This ad is for the gun only. No sling, No scope. I have the original paperwork for the gun as I am the single owner.

This has a 22"" barrel on it.
