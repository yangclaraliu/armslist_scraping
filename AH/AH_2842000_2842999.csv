Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

What sets the XDM apart from the regular XD models is the following:

(M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger: The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

 The Magpul MOE Stock – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

This buttstock is one month old and has no wear (like new).  I only went to the range once with it.  I just upgraded my AR15 with the Magpul ACS buttstock and won't need this one any longer.  One man's loss is another man's budget deal.  This stock retails new for a  MSRP of $59.95;  yours for $38.00.  Make sure your buffer tube is mil-spec, as this won't fit a commercial tube.

I also have a black and a flat dark earth standard 6-position buttstock.  These are both for commercial buffer tubes.  I will let these go for $5 a piece."

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

What sets the XDM apart from the regular XD models is the following:

(M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger: The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

I don't have any history on this gun other that what I have been able to research as it was left in the house when I bought it.  In discussions with a what I believe to be expert on this gun, he says the first 700 or so went to the police in Prussia and had the serial number on the side like this one has.  It does not have the original grips though.  But the holster and two magazines are desirable to some.  He also tells me it was probably used in WWI, and possibly WWII--most of the ones over here were captured in one of the two world wars, especially the ones in holsters like this one.  

It shoots standard .32 ACP, which was known in Europe as the 7.65mm Browning.

I am not committed to selling or trading as it is a piece of history, but for the right offer I might be.  I am not interested in anything less than $450 or valued less than that as I have a current offer for that.  

It is not in perfect condition and I cannot tell you if it actually works or not as I have not shot it...ammo that is with it seems very old. 

More info can be found at this website: http://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/07Dreyse/07dreyse.html

Comes with the gun, holster, two mags and the old ammo.  I will not sell the pieces individually.

Please no hate mail from you Springfield guys. Custom builders tend to agree with me on the issue of receiver quality. The internals were replaced with match grade parts. Then I ordered the $800 Sage EBR mod 0 chassis system in coyote tan and waited for 6 months for it to become available. This version was very hard to come by.

2nd- German made Sig Sauer P225(not the -6 model)

This is a gently used 1992 Sig Sauer P225 9mm. This is not the -6 model. I would rate the gun as being in 90% condition. It comes in the factory cardboard box which is also in great shape and all associated paperwork minus the test target ( I know, it hurts my feelings too). This model is no longer in production discontinued in 1998, and is a must have for serious Sig Collectors. It has some very light holster wear and comes with 1 factory magazine. I am currently looking to purchase a couple more mags but thought I would list it first and see what happens. I have seen The same gun on Buds @ $750 and there is one on GB with a 3 man bidding war that is currently at $675.

What’s an old guy got to do but to enjoy life as much as he can… as long as he can… while on Social Security and making payments to “Obama-Care” (until I can get “Medicare”)!

I “gun smith” Glocks.  That means I alter, repair and build Glock pistols to a customer’s specification.  I am not a Glock certified armorer.  I work with a licensed FFL dealer for any transfers of firearms.

I can build a Glock to your specs (no machining).  I can do a trigger job to shorten trigger pull distance and/or pull weight.  I can help you design your pistol to make it “yours”.  

You can see/test my work at “Shooters of Maumee” by appointment.  

I offer “Mech-Tech” Glock Carbine Conversion Units (CCU).  These convert your Glock frame into a pistol caliber carbine… and back into a pistol.  No FFL or special license is needed to purchase and it ships direct to you.  You can keep it simple or dress it to look like an AR with the many options that are offered.  See: http://library-village.net/mech/ ...and... http://www.mechtechsys.com/accessories.php

Let me know what you want.  I’m not cheap and will ignore any correspondence I feel is garbage.

My Mech-Tech offerings are always on GunBroker.  See:

http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=401290835

…and…

http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=401675083

The auction address changes each week so just save the auction on your GunBroker account and you’ll see the re listing address when you visit the expired auction again.

I also build Glock 6” Long Slide pistols for hunting.  The 10 MM version is popular but I am going to begin offering the same pistol in 45 ACP.  I have no auctions for these on GunBroker currently because barrels are on back-order but here’s an example of a past auction:

It's an inexpensive model - I think it was around $45+tax at WM - but it works fine.  Has a lot of presets for different functions & the rotating glass turntable.

I just purchased a Gen 4 Glock 27 USA version on March 15th for my wife. Put tru glow night sights and clip extenders in all 3 mags. It comes with all original accessories including 3 mags. Quick loader, glock box and 6 different back straps.  Original sights are also included.  We shot 100 rounds out of it today at calipers. It's just a little to much for her. I think I need to switch to a 9mm.  Would consider trades for a Beretta px4 compact model. Otherwise selling for $600. This setup will save you $110 from what I paid inside store. My walk out price was $710.  I have the receipt.  I also have two boxes of 50 of .40 ammo I will toss in for $30 more.  More pictures upon request.

The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

Some of you are already in compliance.  If so, please disregard this update.  If you are not in compliance, please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with how things work around here.

Because of the varied levels of confusion and miscommunication on this site regarding transactions, I just wanted to take a moment to suggest some rules for making sure everyone has an enjoyable productive experience on this site.  Proposed etiquette rules are as follows:

If you are a seller:

1) You are correct in assuming that you are the superior being in the transaction.  You are doing your fellow man a service and favor by offering your personal belongings up for sale.  Sellers should feel lucky to even receive a return email from you, much less actually engage in negotiations or transactions.

2) Because you are selling an item or items, you are also correct in assuming that the value of said item far exceeds the value that would be assigned in a retail store, pawn shop, or any other public or private market.  Its not ultra-valuable because of what it is, it is ultra-valuable because you’re selling it and you want the most money you can get for it.

3) Even if you have no intention of selling your item or items, and your Blue Book of Gun Values is more than four or five feet away from you, feel free to list your item anyway, making sure to indicate “make offer,” and/or “I’m just seeing what’s out there.”

(This reinforces the superiority of the seller as indicated in Rule #1.  It lets would be buyers know that you do not value money, or time, as you clearly have an abundance of both.)

4)  Referencing Rule #3, you can surely use the “make offer” price to see what people will pay for an item you actually want to sell.  Upon using this feature, feel free to respond to reasonable and low ball offers by becoming “butt hurt,” as you did not indicate the ballpark of what you might want to get out of the item.

5)  Upon becoming “butt hurt,” feel free to employ one of the following methods to cope with the emotional trauma of being so utterly disrespected:
	A. Completely ignore the offer, and do not, under any circumstances                 counter-offer.  This may lead to price negotiations. 
	B.  If you find yourself in the terrifying grips of negotiations somehow, reply with one or two word email/text responses, or more verbose, vague responses.  Be rude.  “Nope,” “Looking for more,” and “I’m not sure how much I’d like to sell it for” are all acceptable 	and recommended responses.  

These methods, if properly employed will achieve your ultimate goal of preventing a sale.

Remember, if you sell something, you may then take that money and spend it—This could possibly stimulate the economy:  Something which cannot happen, as Barack Obama will take credit for it.

6)  In the event you do sell something, don’t take your listing down.  In fact, bump the listing as much as you can.  This creates the confusion and frustration that Armslist is all about.

If you are a buyer:  

1)  Remember, Armslist is just like Walmart: you can browse, go to the bathroom, and complain about the ever rising costs of things.  

2)  You should email buyers in one of several ways.  Use whichever is most convenient:
	A.  “I only have 60% of your asking price.  Is that ok?”
	B. “ Will you take (insert lowball offer equivalent to half of what a pawn shop would give).”
	C.  “Do you still have it?” (This is potentially ok, referencing Rule 6 under buyers)
	D.  “I live two and a half hours away—you think you can drive to me?”

*Combining 2A and 2D is particularly effective—however it takes a master negotiator to pull this off.

3)  If the seller messes up and responds to your email with something resembling actual negotiation, you should under no circumstances respond in any meaningful way.  At best, you can ignore him/her completely.  If this is impossible, simply use the “buyer communication methods” found under Rule 5, Section B.  However, employing Rule 5, Section B is undesirable, as you may accidenty find yourself successfully negotiating.  

4)  Just like Walmart, you can commit to buying things, and then just leave your cart at checkout.  This is achieved in the armslist world by somehow getting a seller to negotiate and agree on a price, only to be saved from a sale by you not showing up.  While the buyer knows he is the superior being, you “stick it to him and show him who’s boss” by not meeting or showing up at a prescribed time and place.  Do not be tempted to show up because the buyer has lured you with ""a good price,"" and a ""convenient location.""

*Remember, as a buyer it is not your job to buy anything, only to waste the time of the seller and annoy him.  This is the male version of “retail therapy” that many women enjoy as they run salespeople around and try things on, only to say they’ll “think about it” and not buy anything.  

If you are a trader, things become more difficult.  You must use the rules of both the buyer and seller while avoiding a successful transaction at all costs.  For the novice trader, keep in mind that even if you and the other trader have comparable items, your items are far superior and higher in value, while his trading items must be regarded as having the same value as petting zoo feces.  I hope this helps."

Here's what I have:
1. Have a complete Trane HVAC system, including furnace, air handler and outside unit. Everything works great and was professionally removed to make way for a new system. Outside unit is a 99 model. Furnace looks great on the inside. $1,350.
2. For sale is a black Frigidaire 220V wall oven, a GE gas cooktop, a white GE dishwasher and a white Whirpool microwave. Used but in fine condition, guaranteed to work and much less expensive than new. $800 for all or $450 for oven, $250 for range, 80 for dishwasher and $40 for microwave. 
3. fantastic twin bed sized loft bed. It features a large desk, drawers in the steps and a cubby hole with electricity. This is a very nice unit in great condition. We paid more than $2,500 for the set. A matching wardrobe has a closet for hanging clothes on top and drawers beneath. I haven't measured the bed, but it's large and tall. $1,200.
4. Stihl fs45 trimmer. Works fine. $65
5. I have 46 Gateway white self-closing inset (3/8"") kitchen cabinet hinges for $1.50 each, that's half the cost of new. We didn't use these long and all are in perfect working order. You can see these at Lowes.com, model SC-1938W. I also have eight Amerock 1590 weathered nickel 3"" drawer pulls for $3 each. These sell new for more than $6 each. I have one Amerock 3"" weathered nickel cup pull for $6. This sells for more than $12 new. Take all hinges for $60, all pulls for $30 or the whole lot for $80.
6. Cub cadet zero turn commercial mower. $2,300.
