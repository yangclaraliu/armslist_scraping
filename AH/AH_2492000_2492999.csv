From the Pelican website:

The KingLite is a heavy duty, high powered spotlight packed with features. It uses a unique dual filament Xenon lamp that produces a bright beam that cuts through thick smoke, fog, and dust. The body is made of unbreakable ABS resin with a polycarbonate lens and thermoplastic rubber shroud that resists chemicals and corrosion. Two reflectors are included: a modified spot (stippled for a wide beam) and a laser spot (smooth for a tight collimated beam).

The dual direction switch is easy to operate, even with thick gloves. And there's a locking slide feature to prevent accidental activation. The pistol grip/lantern handle quickly converts to multiple positions for flexibility. The 4000 also comes with a shock absorbing internal battery module that protects both the cells and the lamp from hard knocks. Powered by 8 D alkaline cells.

Standard features ensure the kind of accuracy and dependability that made Kimber the most popular 1911 brand in the world, and 1911 ergonomics make it ideal for carry and defense. The Custom II has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom II is ready for everything from duty carry to recreational shooting and personal defense.

Match grade chamber and trigger
Extended magazine release button for faster operation

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W."

-getting off track here lol- Anyway I have about 50 of these phones ready to go, I can meet anywhere around the greenville area, prefer woodruff road. I will take offers and the more phones you buy then better deal I can make.  

Thank you, you can reach me at 864-350-868three (Which is one of these phones if you're wondering, I use PagePlus myself) 

Ps I also have virgin mobile phones and a couple refurb like new iPhones that I can activate on PagePlus for you, also any of these phones can be used on verizon if you need a cheap replacement."

Comes with everything it came with from factory. Three 15 round magazines. Manuals, factory expent shell casing, original case, all that. I've decided I want the tactical version which run around $1200 so I'm selling this one to fund that. Have plans to do the whole tax stamp thing an eventually get a silencer for the tactical when I get it. As stated in the title I test fired it 30 times with no problems, cleaned it and it's been in my night stand since. Only thing even worth mentioning as a negative is that the larger sized back strap is a little warped, like when it was molded it was still a little hot when removed from the mold. It functions fine, goes on and even feels just fine, it's purely cosmetic but that's how it came. These are in high demand and aren't always easy to stumble upon. Asking $750 cash, I paid over $800 after tax an everything. No trades, no shipping. Not required by law but I require seeing your permit to purchase/carry and MN ID.

Foremost model 6670H made by Savage Arms.  12 gauge, shoots 2 3/4 or 3"" shells, 28"" barrel.  Great price on a very reliable older gun.  This would be a great home defense gun, or a great gun to paint camo for duck hunting.  Not the best looking, has some ugly spots on the receiver, but the barrel looks very good, inside & out.  The forearm looks great.  The butt stock has a crack that was repaired before I got the gun, but seems rock solid.  The recoil pad looks like new, but was replaced before I owned it.

This is the standard DA/SA trigger version, and also comes with a blackhawk level III Serpa duty holster.  I will also throw in any .40 ammo I can find (which should be around 100 ball rounds and maybe 20-30 rounds of defensive ammo).  The trigger is sooooo smooth with the typical sig clean crisp break.

This is the handgun version of the AK47 in 7.62x39 . It is unfired in the box and the two 30 round polymer mags haven't been unwrapped. A friend let me shoot his a while ago and it was a hoot. I was impressed at how tight and solid the Hellpups are so I impulsively bought one. It has remained unfired in the safe ever since. It does not fit my personality and I don't have much ammo left anyway, So I figured I would see if someone else wanted it.

This is the handgun version of the AK47 in 7.62x39 . It is unfired in the box and the two 30 round polymer mags haven't been unwrapped. A friend let me shoot his a while ago and it was a hoot. I was impressed at how tight and solid the Hellpups are so I impulsively bought one. It has remained unfired in the safe ever since. It does not fit my personality and I don't have much ammo left anyway, So I figured I would see if someone else wanted it. 
Considering the nature of this firearm I WILL insist on a purchase permit. I don't ""NEED"" to sell it so lowball offers will be ignored. The only trades I may be interested in are a 1911 by either Les Baer, Colt Gold Cup, or Clark Custom, or possibly a Rock River Elite Operator AR15. For those I would be willing to add cash.

From the Manufacturer:

JP Original Fire Control Kit for .154 small pin receivers consisting of a JP trigger with engagement and overtravel screws and disconnector spring installed as an assembly, disconnector, Instructional video, and your choice of a trigger and hammer spring:

Spring selection:

Standard
The standard spring sets included in all JP Fire Control kits include the yellow hammer and trigger springs, which may be used for competition and recreational applications with hand loads or domestic made non-military ammunition. The yellow/yellow combination results in a release weight in the 3.0-3.5 lb range on most receivers. Also included Is the red hammer spring for use with military (5.56 NATO) or foreign manufactured ammo with low sensitivity primers. The red hammer spring MUST be used on any tactical duty (LE) installations and any AR-10 type installation for 100% ignition reliability. The yellow/red combination results in a release weight of 3.5-4.0 lbs on most receivers.
Duty
The tactical spring set includes a full powers (grey) hammer spring and yellow trigger spring. It may be required for agencies that specify a trigger release weight of over 4 lbs mandatory. This set up also insures 100% ignition reliability on both AR-15 and AR-10 type rifles.
CMP
To meet NRA Service Rifle Competition rules of a 4.5 lb release weight, order the CMP spring set up which includes the full power grey hammer spring and a custom trigger return spring (also grey) which will allow you to tune to a release weight just over 4.5 pounds to lift the NRA weights."

Comes with TWO MAGAZINES ONE (13) round Magazine and ONE (25) round magazine. This is a great weapon. From the Factory: Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time. Developed over a 5-year period in cooperation with the US Army ARDEC Picatinny Arsenal, the KRISS system has been designed and proven to meet or exceed the requirements of today’s changing tactical challenges. Due to its small platform envelope and light weight, the KRISS is easily deployed in CQB and mobile tactical situations; it can be quickly and effectively deployed from behind a patrol vehicle steering wheel, covert-carried or by mounted units storing easily in a saddlebox.

On the last one I had it was because the previous owner bent or broke the small slide release spring when he put it back together, easy to do if you've never disassembled a KAHR. This part can be ordered, and most experienced gun-owners can watch a video to learn to replace it. Also, the follower on the original 5-round magazine is broken. It feeds fine, but it's a pain to load. The gun looks good, it wasn't abused or neglected, and the trigger feels well ""broke-in"".

For those of you that don't know Palmetto state armory had great Black Friday / Christmas sales. You can buy uppers for $59 , BCG $89, uppers for $300 all kinds of ""PTAC "" parts  on sale - my parts just arrived and I imagine Armslist will be flooded with ads for people trying to double their money ( just so you know - I was able to put together a complete AR for $550) 

For example - some dude in Wilmington has a 2 rifles for like$1200 - nothing like trying to double your investment ( Happy Holidays :) ) 
As usual rifles built out of the cheapest possible components are often passed off as mil spec ( but in reality they are not ) ARs are easy to build and commonly available parts make this easy for people of questionable moral character to scam you.
If your not very familiar with ARs - buy a factory built rifle NEW from wal mart or some other gun shop ( local or online ) that way you get a warranty . I was in wal mart yesterday and the case was stocked with ARs from $677 to $977
For $977 you can buy a brand new COLT !"

This is my dream gun that took a lot of time and money to get.  I hate to sell it but financially I can't afford to keep it around.  Thank you for looking and I hope she'll find a good home.  She's a great gun and a real attention grabber."

As most people do, I wear a lot of shorts during these months and wanted something that wasn't going to be bulky, heavy or obnoxious when I chose to carry concealed with limited amount of clothes on!  With all that being said, this pistol did exactly the job I needed it to do.  No it's no 9mm, .40, .45, etc...but something is better than nothing should the situation ever call for such offense or defense.  I traded for this pistol and when I got it, it had looked like it was never shot.  I have had less than 50 rounds through this firearm.  Comes with all original hard case box, safety key (the PT 738's have a locking mechanism built into the firearm for safe storage.  There is a key that will insert just below the slide near the action on the right side/ejection side of the pistol), original papers, 1-6 round factory magazine and I'll include what I have left in .380 ACP ammunition which is about 50 rounds.

Getting rid of it and a Springfield XD9 SC to help fund another purchase I've got my eyes on. 

Asking $250 which I feel is an extremely fair asking price.  Not really interested in trading because it defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to accomplish in the long run, but I'll be willing to listen to what you have to offer.  Worst I can say is ""No"" right!?

I'm a firm supporter of the Right to Bear Arms and for those of you who have lost that right, whether it be by your own doing or through unfortunate circumstance beyond your control, I will require a Bill of Sale and a copy of your CCW or Pistol Purchase Permit.
