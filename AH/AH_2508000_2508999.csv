FEATURES OF ARMALASER

The ArmaLaser TR10 is the only laser system available for the SCCY CPX-Series.

Featuring a 5-year warranty, the TR10 turns on by human touch, not by a mechanical switch or button. As soon as you grasp your pistol, the True-Touch Activation sensor will turn the laser on and keep it on as long as you're grasping the pistol grip. Move your middle finger forward and the laser will shut off.

It is seamless and immediate and requires no button to be pushed or secondary operation.

The TR10 features a convenient battery door to replace its single CR1/3N battery (also can use 2 357 watch cells) so you won't lose any of the laser's ''zero'' when replacing batteries like with other lasers.

A master kill switch is recessed into the DuPont Zytel fiber-reinforced nylon housing (same material used in the SCCY grip/frame) to allow practice without the laser if needed.

Incredible 5 hours of run time and up to 2 years of standby time even if the TR10 is placed in ''ready to activate'' mode.

The laser module is a full 5mW, 635nm red laser which is the highest available by law and up to 5 times brighter than the 650nm competition. There is a very big difference in laser brightness between a 635nm laser and the 650nm one used in the TR10's main competitors, especially during daylight.

Incredibly strong and sturdy, the TR10 fits the CPX with incredible abuse-absorbing rigidity.

Requires no tools, pin removal, or gunsmithing. Installs easily in minutes and is simple to adjust to point of aim. Best of all, it stays adjusted no matter how many rounds you fire.

The TR10 can also switch between a steady laser beam mode and pulsing beam mode

Boattail Hollow Point T2 Ammo. The T2 bullet profile is specifically designed to enhance function and feeding in M16/M4 variant guns. This Ammo's propellant technology is custom designed to enhance weapon operation, and delivers phenomenal temperature stability. The cases are manufactured to mil-spec hardness and feature staked, Crimped and sealed primers and sealed case mouths. Barrier performance is simply unbeatable – no conventional .223 load can match the Hornady 5.56 NATO performance. Many rifles chambered in 5.56 NATO are not realizing their full potential because they are shooting 223 REM ammo. To get all the performance your 5.56 NATO can deliver, you need Hornady's high octane 5.56 NATO cartridge! Your 5.56 NATO chambered rifle was designed to take advantage of the higher pressure of the 5.56 NATO cartridge — which translates to higher velocity, higher retained energy and harder-hitting performance. This ammo is packed in 20rd. boxes. This ammo is extremely difficult to ge.  This ammo is supposed to be restricted to law enforcement only.

Glock 19: $549
Warren Tactical Sights: $70
Glock 17 Spare Magazine w/+2 round base-plate: $40

FYI, the side of the Warren Tactical sights (not the gun) got slightly banged up in installation. If that's an issue (1) you can buy gun black and black it out, (2) I still have the stock Glock sights you can put back on, or (3) of course you can just buy your own sights of choice and put them on.

The Warren Tactical sights have a narrow front post and wide rear posts, allowing you to see more of your target. They also have a fiber optic front sight for fast acquisition.

The spare magazine is for a Glock 17, but as you know, the Glock 17 magazine works in the Glock 19. It has a +2 base plate, increasing its capacity to a total of 19 rounds.

The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard.

For Sale is a very hard to find Ruger PC9GR 9mm Carbine in excellent shape.  

PC9GR = Police Carbine, 9mm, Ghost Ring (sights)

Ruger discontinued making these in 2006.  Carbine takes standard 9mm Ruger P-Series magazines which are easy to find.  Magazines usually come in 10, 15 , 20 & 30+ round capacities.  (if your state allows)  The advantage of the GR (Ghost Ring sights) is the aditional 9 inches between front and rear sights. A PC9 will have a regular sight much farther forward of the receiver.  This Carbine makes a great partner to your P85, P89, P93, P94 or P95 Ruger pistol due to compatibility of magazines.  Good quality 9mm carbines are hard to find.

This carbine has been sitting in the safe for a few years years and has had about 100 or less rounds through it.  Ruger reports this serial number as being made in 1999.

This Carbine features:

Very rare Ghost Ring Sights
A set of special Ruger rails for mounting optics
Two, 15-round magazines
Standard Black Synthetic Stock
Factory sling studs
Black Tactical soft case

From Wilson's website:
After a tremendous amount of research and testing by Bill Wilson and the Wilson Combat team we are excited to announce the availability of our custom AR platform rifles chambered in 6.8 SPC caliber.

The 6.8 SPC (6.8x43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an AR pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. When built to the level of quality and precision Wilson Combat has achieved the 6.8 SPC is also capable of outstanding accuracy and reliability.

In our match-grade, Spec II chambered 16"" barrels, The 6.8 SPC is capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85gr bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110gr bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition. Appropriate hand loading can achieve even higher velocities and enable the use of heavier projectiles up to 130 grains, which dramatically improves terminal ballistics over a 5.56 Nato/.223 Remington at long range.

This added ballistic performance makes the 6.8 SPC perfect for home protection and SRT/SWAT teams. The 6.8 is a truly ideal hunting round for medium to heavy game and turns the AR into a serious hunting rifle."

Browning Hi Power Mark III .40sw

buying for parts and or repair.

I called and talked to browning two times and three local gunsmiths.

I just cant see me investing another 400 into uit as I just bought it the day before.



850 on saturday
400 value for parts sunday. 
damn damn


ok, guys if anyone wants to work on this. It is a very nice browning hi power mark III in .40sw that has a underpressure ka boom. The trigger group works. The frame and slide visually inspected looks ok. I just bought it for xmas saturday and had a ka boom sunday. 
I have talked to three local gunsmiths and pretty much do not want to invest in the repair. The slide will not go all the way back as the barrel is swelled. The firing pin end is broken off. The extractor and extractor spring is missing now. The grips were opened up some but can be refitted. They have bendable inside a core around rubber stuff.
Barrel cost of a bar sto is 250 I think.
The value of this pistol on saturday was 850.
What value of it is it to you today?
frame, slide, trigger group.

So as far as i can see here it what is needed.

a barrel in .40sw
a extractor spring
a  extractor
grips if you do not like them.

email me with cell number to discuss. be happy to talk. I just paid a ton of cash for it saturday and can not see me putting another 250 for barrel , extractor and spring is only 25. But the smithing for the barrel work browning said was 80 dollars an hour. So about two hours.
total investment again would be
barrel 250
smith time 160
parts 25
of the parts I know about right now. There may be more once you get inside. but the trigger does drop.

gun would come with the 1 magazine , the gun . the memories... would go also"

Barrel is a non fluted Sendero barrel, which along with a 5R is widely known as the most accurate production barrel from Remington. The Charleston county SWAT team bought Senderos, and immediately changed out barrels and the gunsmith had a few sitting around and sold it to me and installed it, and he also glass bedded and trued the action for me. The barrel is of course free floating. 

So I can break down components. 
Original rifle - 400 at academy 
Stock - 300 at midway 
Bottom metal - 200 
Magazine - 90 
Barrel - 300 
Harris Bipod - 90 
Scope and hardware - 400 

Total for components-1780. That is no shipping and no labor.. Add another few hundred for labor. So as you can see you are getting a pretty good deal. I don't think you could build a gun this good for the price I'm asking, unless you're a gunsmith, and even then it would be tough. And this one was put together right, and it shoots. You won't need to tinker with it to make it work, I'll give you my ammo recipe and KAC ballistics data. 

If you want to get into the long range precision game this is a good starting point. The things that most shooters do to their rifles for accuracy and consistency are already done on this rifle, it's ready to go and zeroed for 200 yds. The only original part is the action. 

This gun is a .5 MOA gun with FGMM or handloads. I have shot steel at 800 yds with it. If you are local to the Charleston SC area and are interested you are welcome to shoot it first. Note the pic is of a group at 600 yds. The 4th shot is not a flier, I adjusted to hit center mass with a call from my spotter.

I prefer to do a face to face, I am willing to drive or ship if i need to. Pics are two posts down. Asking 1500 shipped, 1300 if you don't want the scope. I am selling to fund a SCAR17."

It currently has a Knoxx Spec-Ops adjustable buttstock and pistol grip on it along with an original 18.5"" barrel. This is an original Mossberg barrel, not one thats been cut down. 

Also included is the factory stock and a 28"" sporting barrel with vented sight rail and removable choke. It comes with a choke in it, but I don't know what type it is, I've never taken it out.


Gun is in fair shape, just clearing out some room in the safe for something new. The receiver,internals, and 18"" barrel are in good condition. The 28"" barrel shows a bit of wear, but nothing that will affect performance. I'm asking $350 for the gun, both stocks, and both barrels. I'm open to trades. Not really looking for anything too specific, just something that catches my attention. Can add a bit of cash if necessary.

 The 22"" barrel and ""pro-fire"" trigger make this a very accurate rifle with run of the mill bulk ammo. I have experimented with several kinds of 22LR ranging from subsonic to hyper velocity and different brands as well. The only ammo it does not love is Winchester white box. They won't feed reliably. It really likes the newer Remington Golden bullets as well as some other less expensive cartridges.

The M228 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety pin and pull ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the grenade body.  These come with the additional protective hard cardboard cylinder that encompasses the body of the fuze (the part the explodes).  These explode (nonscientific, just my personal observations) with about the same report and flash as a blasting cap, if you are familiar with those.  These are just components which based on the level of explosives contained within ARE LEGALE, no need of special permit.  What you decide to do with them afterwards is up to you, but know your laws before proceeding. 
These are new fresh production 2011, right out of the sealed factory case.  I'm looking to sell 1 for $99, 2 for $175, 3 for $225, 4 for $275, 5 for $310.  Will negotiate for larger quantities and or bartering.  Also interested in pre 65 US silver coins or (well known manufacturers of) sliver bars & or rounds.  Available for face to face transfer to NH residences with a NH DL and CCW or LEO.
If you still see the ad, then I still have them for sale.
Thanks for looking."

The exterior of this piece exhibits light to moderate pitting over the entire surface and the original finish is non-existent. The bore is in suprisingly good condition with only mild pitting but the rifling is still intact and strong. The chambers are in great shape with only very light pitting visible. This old wheel gun is fully functional and I would not hesitate to run some ammo through it and is a neat piece of history.

A medium frame, six shot, double action revolver, chambered in .38 special. The target market for this pistol was primarily law enforcement and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time. The Colt Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during WW II.

This revolver, according to Colt's Proof House was manufactured in 1943, is in very good condition. It is obvious when you look at this firearm, it was very important to the original owner and it has been well cared for over the years. Both the trigger and hammer have been jeweled and worked, resulting in an remarkably crisp trigger pull. Functionally the timing appears to be on and the cylinder locks up tight. At some point in time someone attached a grip adapter to this weapon and a small hole remains in the frame; however, rather than attaching another adapter I felt leaving the revolver in its original condition was the best thing to do. This firearm is in very good condition, while it has some minor wear on the high points as well as the barrel and the grips have been rubbed on the right side, I believe this is a gem. The photo's which are attached to this auction show an honest and fair representation of the condition of this revolver. This is a wonderful opportunity to own a very collectable Colt which is rich in its history and service to this country. If you have any questions, please contact me"

Based on the markings on the guard (WESTERN U.S.A. and W49), I believe this knife to be from the late 70's  to early 80's. It's definitely post Vietnam Era.

Aside from the giant crack in the handle and the oxidizing on the blade, this knife is still in very good shape. There is looseness to the handle or blade, and the oxidation hasn't pitted into the blade. If someone were so inclined to repair or remake the handle and polish the blade, this knife could definitely have life breathed back into it, allowing for many more years of use.
