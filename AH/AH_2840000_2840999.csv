Shoots excellent.  And yes, it is a legal pistol in MO & KS, in great condition. 

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

Uses any AR mag. 
Added foreend/heat shield included. 

I'll meet anywhere in the immediate metro. Must be 21. I'll sell to a CCW holder with just a bill of sale. Anyone else we will need to meet at local MO or KS FFL for transfer. 

If ad is up, it's still available. No trades please.  Thanks for looking."

Manufactured about 1995 and has seen about 20,000 rounds but in great shape.  If you like small frame EAA/Tanfoglio open guns here is a great place to start building one.
Frames alone cannot be purchased separately from EAA anymore, let alone a Competition Small frame.
It has a short dust cover; checkering on the front and back strap as well as the bottom of the trigger guard.  It uses current EAA/Tanfoglio short hammer springs
*Includes a Henning small frame magwell
*Includes a Quinn sideways/90 degrees C-more mount
*Duracoat finish, Remington 870 matte black color
*The holes in the frame that accept the grip screws had to be drilled out in order to use a bolt/nut to attach the grips.  The threads on those screws were starting to smooth out
and I could not get enough bite into the frame anymore. Original screws were a smaller metric thread than what Tanfoglio uses today and could not find replacements.

I'm asking $275 plus actual UPS Next Day Air shipping for everything described above.
Will be shipped to your FFL, only to states where it is legal.

I am someone who usually keeps guns and spares no expense building them up and maintaining them.... This is just too much gun for me and too nice to keep without ever being used, so I would rather sell it and get something else that I would use or trade for it. Action is smoother than any rifle I have ever owned (including Browning A-bolt and Remington 700 ADL). Rifle is well kept and very nice. Built for hunting trips with its light-weight, powerful caliber, and minimal recoil do to its custom stock (I paid extra for the nice recoil pad option that significantly cuts on recoil without affecting the length of the stock (comparable to a low grain 30-06...maybe less, most 7mm mags have a lot ""sharper"" recoil). Add a Bi-pod the the secondary lug on the stock and make it a bench rifle, or leave it like it is and have a lightweight powerhouse that will instantly drop anything in Alabama.

Introducing the XD-S 9mm. This slim, powerful addition to the XDS line delivers all the performance of a 9mm engineered to fit in any size hand. At only 1 in wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm designed the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Intended as an inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, Interdynamic did not find a government buyer, so it was brought to US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic KG-9 pistol. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full-auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full-auto by Title II manufacturers.[1][2]"

FMJ-FN (1350FPS / M.E.931 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Friday, March 21, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=230

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels. This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six. The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber. It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too."

474,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2840474,For Sale:  .30 Carbine brass - Processed and ready to load,"White Bear area, Minnesota, United States",$ 190,"Listed On: Thursday, March 27, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling for a friend whos Dad processed this years ago and passed away recently.
There is a total (by my count) of 1056 casings....his notes on the container said 1082, but I am going to call this 1000 plus just because my count might be off a bit.

Tese are once-fired military casings from 1952.....about half are WRA 52 and half are RA 52....some really nice brass.
These were cleaned lightly, sized and the case mouth expanded. (note that it all has that ""cleaned 30 years ago"" patina!). The primer pocket crimps were removed and the casings are all in nice shape.

On examining these, they were not trimmed BUT I measured about a hundred and came up with lengths from 1.280"" to 1.288"" so all should be good to go (of 100, only two were at 1.287/88"" - the rest were almost all at 1.282"")
Prier pockets are pretty clean but have not been brushed out....might want to hit those before reloading, but this is some really nice military brass that you just don't see much of anymore.....for that matter, you just don't see much of ANY Carbine brass available anymore, so I suspect this will go very quickly.

Take a look at the pics here:     http://tinypic.com/a/2uu4g/2
These are hi-res so you can save them and zoom in to see the details. Any questions, please ask!

Midway gets 260 bucks for 1000, plus shipping (new Remington commercial) so this is a nice deal at $190.00 cash for the big bag-O-brass! (a bit less than .19 cents each, ready to load with the additional 56 casings as a bonus! Heck, UNPROCESSED carbine brass is going for this price, so this will save you money AND TIME!

I will ship this anywhere CONUS for an additional $15.00 in a USPS Priority Bulk Rate box.

Amazingly accurate gun. I'm not the greatest shot in the world but this gun made me feel like a marksman. 

Gun is clean no scratches or scuffs. Never carried. Comes with all XDM goodies see pic below. 3 mags, gun holster, mag holster, changeable back straps for better comfort.

I believe in a fair price. I paid $750 for this brand new. I did some research on the web and most websites are selling it for $700 before shipping and FFL. With that said I think my price is pretty fair.

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety.

Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version, or 7 and 9 round magazines in .40 S&W. A low capacity-compliant version of the 9mm is available with two 10 round magazines. 

With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry."

Is it an FN Browning HP ,9 mm, 13 rd mag. made in 1961-63,exl. cond.all numbers is match.
-A number of these were imported several years back. This is a genuine Fabrique Nationale, manufactured in Belgium. They are not the Fabrica Militar licensed Hi Power that was made to FN specs on old HP equipment in Argentina. Later FM continued to produce HP's after their licensing contract expired. FM continues to produce an HP copy to this day.

-I've seen guys at a gun show turn their noses up and say this is ""only"" an argentine copy- it is NOT, it is as genuine FN as any Browning. 

All of the Argie FN HP's I've seen have the round hammer and internal extractor - both were standard until sometime in 1962 or '63. Supposedly the internal extractor was either weaker or more expensive to produce. Maybe both.

2. What is the meaning of the inscriptions on the gun? What is the history of the gun?
- JIMM, I think what you have is one of a batch of surplus FN Hi-Powers that were imported recently, which were sold to the various Argentine military and law enforcement agencies some years back. The ones I have seen have a rather large rollmarked Argentine crest on the top of the slide just forward of the rear sight. I have no idea if they have or will have any collector value now or in the future, but are genuine Belgian Hi-Powers, and as such, will lend themselves to any shooting or modifications that you could apply to any other HP. If you want to find about collector value, you might want to go to www.fnhipower.com , and see if there is anyone there with knowledge of the value or collectability of your piece. {this was by Don Williams, who I think is well-known!} Any question please text REDACTED"

Amazingly accurate gun. I'm not the greatest shot in the world but this gun made me feel like a marksman.

I believe in a fair price. I paid $750 for this brand new. I did some research on the web and most websites are selling it for $700 before shipping and FFL. With that said I think my price is pretty fair.

Stronger birch wood. Refinished by Uncle Sam to a light brown, reddish-brown, or in some cases, a pretty light blond-beige. Comes complete with all metal - ferule, front swivel, metal stock liner, rear swivel, and buttplate.

This would be a great stock for field or casual use, even tougher than the original because the expert refinishing it put in brass pins as reinforcement of areas - notably in the selector cutout area - where cracks were known to be likely. These pins are hardly visible when the stock is on the rifle. Ask any stock refinisher: Brass pins make the stock stronger than it was, before!"

There is also some minor wear on the floor plate and trigger guard.  This was my main huntin’ rifle for a couple years and went on a few deer outings and took my first wild pig.  I have consistently shot one inch or smaller groups at 100 yards with factory 150 grain Remington Corelokt and Federal Powershock loads.  It also shoots handloaded 150 grain Barnes TSX and Hornady GMX loads with similar precision.  The gun can be a little hold sensitive due to Ruger’s bedded forend but has a smooth, crisp trigger that breaks just a hair over 4 lbs.  The Ruger factory rings (Med. Height) are of course included with the rifle.  $450 OBO gets you an attractive, solid, and accurate traditional type hunting rifle."

There are cutting marks on the rim of the eye side of the scope, don't ask me how or why, probably some drunk Romanian, this doesn't have any effect on the operation of this scope whatsoever.  When I removed the eye boot is when I discovered this. 
The optics are in excellent condition and the turrets are solid and crisp when dialed. This will come with the front sun hood, rubber cap and pouch only. The clamp holds very securely and there are no cracks in the frame.

Finding the rubber eyepiece for these are easy to get and will cover the cut marks that are on the scope. Scope has the Light Hammer Finish.

The gun is in pretty good shape with a barely noticeable scratch on the barrel and some wear on the comb.  It also has a small hole drilled near the base of the stock for sling stud installation.   It currently has a modified choke in it but I’d throw in a factory full (steel compatible, $25 value) for serious buyers.  I’m letting this capable shotgun and extra choke go for the bargain price of $250 OBO."

The firing pin is stamped DA, which means it's British, but the furniture is all Aussie coachwood.  Awesome semi-auto and something you don't see at the range every day.  If you're looking for a great military battle rifle and already have an AK and an AR, this would be a worthy addition to your collection.  Accompanying magazine is inch pattern, but this rifle has shot just fine with a metric mag.  If you aren't familiar, 7.62 NATO and .308 are the same calibre-either will work in this rifle.

So you get 24 black parkerized reusable En-Bloc clips.  These are original US Gov. issue, most of the cans are marked between 1940's and 1950's.  The can's themselves have little to no signs of corossion.  

I am an avid M1 Garand Collector and have opened many of these cans over the years and have never found corroded bullets.  However, and that being said, with a can being sealed, I CANNOT guaruntee the quality of the ammo.  ALL of this ammo was purchased directly from the CMP to me.  The CMP estimates that something around 98%+ of the ""spam cans"" that they open up reveal ammo in perfect condition.  

Remember, if you own and shoot an M1 Garand, you HAVE to shoot ammo that has pressure ratings specific to this rifle.  I've got a bunch of these sealed cans and would like to sell a few.  The CMP currently has NO ""spam cans"" for sale and these are a dying breed.  

$170 for a sealed can, I can drop the price a bit if you want several.  Also, I am a FT police officer, so if you are not legally able to posses ammo or firearms DO NOT contact me."

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and greater control without having to adjust the wrist.

The disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
