Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR cartridges the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

These have been used by our military special forces. These are absolutely badass! Everything is in tact and fuctions 100%.
     If you are not familiar with these, they are arguably the best and most well built red dot optics available. These things are so bulletproof that's why they are issued to are elite military personal. The red dot is a 4moa very bright in any situation. Again these are used and have a few marks and scratches here and there but that just gives them character. 
    Red dot has multiple brightness levels, flip up covers work perfectly. The lenses are flawless. They have been cleaned up with a new battery and are ready to install on your AR or similar weapon system.
    These are $500+ new without mount, the mount alone is $120+ new.  Save yourself a grip, and get one that has character. These have been a vital part in protecting our freedoms, great for conversation.  The black ones are sold out! There are two in flat dark earth available both with Wilcox mounts. I read on a forum that guys were taking acetone and other paint removers to there fde aimpoints and the paint will come off then you of course have a black one. These are almost impossible to find, a rare opportunity. Looking for 350$ A PEICE. I can meet you somewhere near my area or I can ship these to you as well.  I absolutely promise these are 100% fully functional with a new battery. I will provide my gunbroker username to prove I have great feedback on request. Cash preferred, trade offers welcome, I would have to consider the trade good for me. I have cash or other things to throw in towards the right firearm.  Thank you."

The barrel has pitting on outside of barrel and bore is fair and serviceable with minor pitting here and there. This is a pretty collectibke piece but could be used for just about anything. This gun has 2 nazi eagles (dirty birds) on left side of gun-one on barrel and one on receiver and 3 on right side of receiver. All numbers match including stock and bands exect the bolt. 

This rifle is covered in waffenampts on metal and wood. The stock has been hit by shrapnel and i beleive there is a peice stuck in stock still by the floorplate. 

This rifle was used by germans in ww2 and sent to china at some point after the war so this thing has seem ALOT of action! This thing is kinda hard to find info on but ive gathered that germany sold alot of k98s to the chinese and the chinese fought in ww2 against the japs, in korea against US and in vietnam they supplied the vietnamese with weapons. Also it could have been a russian capture and supplied to vietnamese and used there. Its definitely been in a moist environment. But the russian capture idea wouldnt make any sense because the dirty birds are not peened and theres no ""X"" on receiver. 

My best guess on this gun is that it was sold to china by the germans and supplied to the NVA in vietnam and used there. It would explain the markings and non-peened eagles and pitting. 

In the deal you will be getting the rifle, areproduction leather sling and might throw in a few stripper clios and ammo. Im asking $575. This is a very collectible piece here but could be used for hunting and shooting as well it shoots great! Not a bad price for what it is. You can call or text me at REDACTED for quickest response.
