I have a Richland Arms 10 gauge made by Zabalay out of Spain. The shotgun has had the barrel professionally sawn down to 19 inches as well as having the stock cut down. I took the gun to a dealer to see if it was even legal to own and was told that the shotgun is completely legal to own and does not have to be classified as Class 3 firearm. The gun is in pretty good shape considering it was made somewhere between 1963-1985. I inherited the shotgun so I am not sure. This shotgun is not for the faint of heart. I have shot it on numerous occasions and it packs a wallop. I enjoy the gun mainly for a novelty item and seeing all my buddies afraid to shoot it. Shoot me a text only please at REDACTED.

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Comes with factory case, (2) FN 20-round magazines, (1) FN 20-round magazine with CMMG 10-round extension for 30 rounds total and Serpa holster. Contact me if you are interested and serious"

This rifle is not NIB, not immaculate, but all blemishes are minor, and it is an overall beautiful compact, light rifle, still powerful enough to be a legitimate deer rifle. It is a very short, lightweight and maneuverable rifle, excellent for a woman or youth. I have owned it since the 1990's and have figured out that it doesn't fit my needs, having been in my safe almost the entire time. This is, sadly, a hard to find rifle in this shorter barrel configuration, as I found out in my research, and if you want one, there are not many out there apparently. I do not have to sell it, and will not accept unreasonable lowball offers, so if you make an offer, copy and paste a lower priced current ad for one of these for comparison in your email. More photos available. Face to face local transaction to an Alabama resident ONLY, no shipping.
