These are not to be confused with the Pietta Great Western II. Great Western Arms Co. started around 1953 and only lasted about 10 years, producing just over 22,000 revolvers during the time that Colt quit producing the Single Action Army. This revolver is full sized, not a scaled down single action. 100% engraved with COA on the engraving, with stag grips. The action is smooth as glass. These revolvers were built from Colt specs. and the parts are Colt 1st and early 2nd generation interchangeable. These essentially are Colt guns without the Colt name. The cylinder stop, hand, cylinder, screws, bushing, etc. are all Colt interchangeable. John Wayne used a matched pair of Great Westerns in his last movie, The Shootist. They were not Colts. If interested, email me with your phone number and I will call you back. If you want it shipped, it will cost at least an extra $80.00 for overnight shipping to your FFL."

We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon

Military  it has all the markings on the stock and barrel he told me they were short used due to the design of the bolt it does not rotate down so if a soldier inserted it wrong it would shoot back into your face so he told me probably shouldn't shoot it.

First Choice Armor, Inc.

Synergy, the New Definition of Safety. First Choice Armor, Inc. of Brockton, MA has announced the introduction of its Synergy line of body armor. This latest innovation by First Choice Armor is available in both NIJ (National Institute of Justice) Level II and Level IIIA. The Synergy line offers the lightest Non-Zylon® concealable vest available in the market today, and is so distinctive that it is Patent Pending on the unique ballistic weave made from 100% aramid fiber located inside the vest.
The Synergy vests also have a unique built-in cooling system developed by First Choice. All Synergy vests use the extraordinary Evercool system which draws heat away from the body making the armor the most comfortable design ever.
During certification testing at NIJ, Synergy proved exceptional in its testing of the BFS (back face signature- simulation of blunt force trauma created from the stopped ammunition). NIJ standards allow up to a 44mm BFS. The Synergy Level II has a BFS as low as 23mm when shot with a 9mm round and as low as 30mm with a .357 round. The Level IIIA has a BFS as low as 22 mm with a 9mm and 32mm when tested with a .44 magnum; exemplifying outstanding performance for light weight body armor.
""Synergy is a breakthrough vest for officer protection and comfort. It offers a perfect balance and that's why Synergy seems like such a fitting name,"" stated Karen Harman, President of First Choice Armor. ""These vests offer police officers protection, flexibility, and comfort and reduce the feeling of 'overheating' while on the job."""

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desirable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

Hard to find exact importation numbers but looks it could be as low as a few hundred to a thousand total for the 44 mag version. All milled Israeli receiver with built in scope rail. 18.5” barrel, straight grip shotgun style stock with adjustable drop, blue finish, and 7 round tube magazine. Gun is in good condition with moderate finish wear. No rust and an absolutely beautiful bore. I'd say finish is 80-90%, most wear seems to be from handling and storage. Some minor dings on the stock. Rifle is very accurate and a blast to shoot. Runs well with an occasional weak extraction, not often if the chamber is clean and it is not short stroked. Will include an upgraded spare extractor. Purchased a while back but haven't installed as it's not really necessary. Very interesting and fantastic guns, it's a shame they are no longer produced. Quite a bit of information out there on them if you'd like a little more of the history. Payment by Money Order only. Rifle will ship immediately upon clearance of payment. I have an assortment of 44 mag ammo that can be added as well for a fair price if needed, of course in a separate shipment. Really hate to part with such a special and unique gun, but just really can't afford to keep it right now. Reserve is well under BIN, but these are nearly impossible to find, so..."
