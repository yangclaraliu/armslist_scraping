Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."

It has become a staple in our shop and in all of our range bags. When AAC came down to show off the new Ti-Rant 45M, we were all excited to see the new model but were initially skeptical of changes to something that we already knew and loved. That being said, any reservations we may have had are long forgotten.The Ti-Rant 45M offers every single one of the benefits of its predecessor, plus one obvious advantage. The ‘M’ in the name isn’t just for kicks, this is a truly Modular silencer. By removing the auxiliary baffle module at the front of the tube and replacing the front cap onto the main body, the user can drop 2 inches off of the overall length in a matter of seconds without any tools!The Ti-Rant 45M runs on the same set of A.S.A.P. CLUTCH Pistons (and fixed barrel spacer). The 1911 “flush mounted” piston also works in this model for 1911’s with G.I. guide rods or shorter making it an awesome looking pairing for that good ‘ol “slab sides” sitting in the safe.It is still user-serviceable but the old spanner type holes are gone from the front cap in lieu of exterior grooves that can be manipulated with your palm (or a strap wrench if you forget to clean it for a few thousand rounds). The baffles are also color coded for proper assembly."

An attack on a legal business is no laughing matter. First it was 'Operation Choke Point', and now this, all in the name of taking more of our 2nd Amendment rights from us, with the end result being the disarming of America, one step at a time, like a frog in boiling water, so we don't even notice. This is not being covered by anyone in the media. Google it, you won't see anything about it but just this one link that has prompted me to post this here. Americans should be all over this and calling the BATF out in droves. What makes a lawn service, a car washing service, a dog boarding service, a home cleaning service, etc., etc., any better than a home based FFL, so that they don't come under this type of scrutiny? Home based FFL's have to jump through all kinds of hoops to do business, keep meticulous records, etc., and yet they are being banned and treated as if they are criminals."

This is the standard thread for Mac10/11 sub guns and there are a lot of adapters to make it work on other threads. Its 2"" in diameter and 12-1/4"" long. I don't have a scale but we'll say its around 2lbs. It is non ferrous, I believe the tube to be aluminum with what is most likely stainless baffles. I do not have a Mac or anything threaded in 3/4-10 to go shoot it so I have no idea what it sounds like- if I had literally any use for it I'd keep it. The can does not appear to be user serviceable. With an adapter you can make this work on your 9mm AR15 or whatever you have in mind that is 9mm or smaller. It is designed for Mac10/11s and is full auto rated. $200 or best offer. All NFA rules apply. I am an SOT and can transfer it directly to an AL resident, a one time $200 tax to the ATF applies. The can is currently on a Form 3 and can be transferred out of state without an extra tax."

Thread protector installed. Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges.

The rear sight has the lock bar. The barrel is a '54 Springfield and has very very crisp rifling. I do not have MW or TE measures but everyone that's looked at this barrel is amazed. You are welcome to look it over before committing. I hit man sized targets at 500yrds with this rifle. An experienced shooter could do better than that! I have two stocks for this rifle. The lighter one (which is currently on it) fits better. It will come with a nylon sling (seen in first picture). Currently has a biathlon sling on it (seen in second set of pictures). I'll let the biathlon sling go for an extra charge. I also have around 400 once fired greek HXP brass, several enblocs, competition dies, and bullets if you are interested.  My price is $1200 for the rifle and nylon sling. Take a gamble at the CMP or know what your getting and get it from me.

Built around Beretta® PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm™ Semi-Auto Pistol delivers rapid shots with precise accuracy due to its ergonomic design and unique action. The PX4 utilizes a rotating barrel locking system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame comes with 3 interchangeable backstraps to obtain a proper fit according to the individual shooter's hand. Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. The Beretta PX4 Storm Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips quickly without tools into 5 subcomponents for cleaning and maintenance.- Modular, ergonomic design- Rotating barrel locking system for reduced recoil and muzzle rise- Fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame- Non-slip textured grip- Integral Picatinny rail- Ambidextrous safety/decocking lever- Bruniton non-reflective coating- Fieldstrips quickly without tools- Barrel length: 4 inches - Caliber: 9mm - Magazine: 17 + 1- Overall height: 5.51 inches - Overall length: 7.68 inches - Overall width: 1.42 inches"
