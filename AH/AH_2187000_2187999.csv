The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

I am a certified AK Armorer and have been modifying/building AKs since 2007 when I started breaking them apart to build my own at a US Infantry outpost in Iraq. I put love in my rifles/pistols. The only reason I'm putting this one up for trade is because I am also a marksman by duty. Money is tight, but I miss precision shooting.

So what is so cool about this AK?

First off, the tolerances. They are just right, but flexible. Lead rivets were used. The parts were selected from several models and put into an ideal package.

Romanian Receiver and trunion. Egyptian furniture (including a Hungarian RPK grip for that extra grip girth), Leather M1 Garand cheek pad, modified to fit the AK and reduce the sore cheekbone effect. TRITIUM night iron sights. Muzzle Brake chosen for versatility, ease of use/removal and quality. Steel Mags (2), steel, ambi enhanced magazine release. Recoil reducer (freebie) and quality bolt/piston. 
This is my ""Liberty or Death"" model. 
I can even throw in a superb TRS-25 red dot. Having tested it side by side with the Aimpoint, I can say with confidence that it is a quality alternative with much nicer Customer service.

Want a different receiver? I'll throw in a stainless blank Ak receiver.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics.

Not sure why but this particular glock says made in USA and has a stamp on slide that has the state of Georgia with a ""P"" in the center of the state.. I didn't know glock made firearms here. I always thought we just assembled them.

How to use your torque wrench:

3. To ensure perfect alignment of both action and stock carefully tighten screws in turn

It has all high end parts and components.  You will not find anyone who would not want this gun if you shot it.  I've shot 60 rounds through it without a hint of failure anywhere on it.  I'm not real sure I want to sell it but I'm itching to build another.  With all of the extra high quality parts on this baby I am asking 1,700 dollars.  If you add up the parts, and everything being brand new, the total is well over 2,000 dollars.  I won't have it on here longer than two days, so if interested, call Randy at three one seven nine 799559. If you're someone that knows AR-15's and want a completely awesome gun, when you see it, you'll know that the money is there and that it's a great deal."

Great Gun For Amateur Collectors 

On butt of gun has inscription of H.P.D. no 901 

This is a used condition revolver....it still shoots great. Still fully functional self defense weapon for male or female. 

I've shot it and cleaned it after wards, then it just got put up for 10 years, so I figured I'd see if anyone else would have more use for it. I do not have a box for it or any papers as I inherited it. Just a leather holster that came with it.

It has wear on the grips, the left is better than the right one and holster wear. The bluing is discolored. Best to look at pics and see gun first hand. Overall its in good shape for a gun from 1944. That's based on the serial number I looked up on Colts website and an independent website.

I've been watching them on gunbroker the past few months and they are listed anywhere from $425 for much worse condition up to $800 in better condition. So I figured I'd split it down the middle and ask $650 obo cash or open to trade offers for something I can use for home defense or fun with the kids. Make me reasonable offer, worst I can say is no thank you. I'm open, but don't need the cash.

Email me your number and I can text you more pics

Must be legal and show ID. I'm a private seller. CWP preferred.

FTF in Clermont area only. Must pick up near me, I can't drive to meet outside of Clermont due to family health issues, sorry.

Trade options at bottom of ad.


Thanx for looking......... 

I prefer to sell but if you have something that is a deal, I might consider it. 

Great condition guns only. If your offering trade, you need to send me offer price and model and condition of your gun. GUNS only!! 

I am not into inflated trade value prices. I would use gunbroker or walmart pricing to value your trade. I can just sell it and go there to buy cash but I like trading with reasonable people.

Main trade I'm looking for is an AR, nothing high end. $500-1100 range. Prefer factory built upper and lower from same company. I have lots of different ammo I can add to trade and a little cash or can accept your trade plus cash.

others
Prefer Gen 3 or Gen 4 Glocks $400-$550 range plus cash
Maybe a Judge or a Govenor. 
Possibly an M&P AR 22 or HK 416.
Sig P238 or P938
1911's
Higher end Tactical Shotgun plus cash
Possibly other tactical weapons plus or minus cash. No old beat up guns please.
Home defense Gun's .38, .380, 9mm, 40 or 45 cal 

For all trades other than AR 15 or AR 10, I will only add ammo to trades.......

But throw anything my way, I'm interested in anything that is in great to new condition that functions perfectly.

The GLOCK G19 is ideal for a more versatile role because of its reduced dimensions when compared to the standard sized option. Chambered in 9x19, the G19 has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.

Crimson Trace LG-417 Laser Grip - Gen 3 
The G-Series of LaserGrips for GLOCK pistols introduce an even more compact frame than traditional lasergrips, and provides instinctive grip activation while leaving the polymer GLOCK grips mostly exposed to maintain the gun's standard lightweight configuration. 

Crimson Trace Corporation takes seriously the life-saving potential and crime-deterring influence offered by laser gun-sight technology. All models have over four hours of ""on time"" and a battery shelf life of five years. Also, they range 30 feet in broad daylight. 

High-Brightness Lasergrips are designed and built on principles of high performance and quality, which is the foundation of every product Crimson Trace makes. Enhanced Visibility Optics ensure the laser beam is continual for uninterrupted high output. Energy efficient circuitry provides long battery life. No additional steps are required to activate the lasergrip, so you can continue to shoot instinctively. Reliable, durable, precise windage and elevation calibration ensures accurate sighting. 

Rubber Overmolded Lasergrips are based on the same super-quick and efficient sighting principals as the original lasergrips with the added comfort and recoil control of soft rubber overmolded construction.

This model was manufactured around 1974. Figure I can see what's out there and maybe get a gun I would use more often. I'm more of a handgun guy than a rifle guy.

I am willing to drive and meet you, and you are more than welcome to check the rifle out before trading. You must be at least 18 years old but I prefer 21. You must also have a valid Ohio ID. I will provide mine as well. I also have a CCW and a squeaky clean record. If you aren't from Ohio, are under aged, or have a felony conviction please don't contact me.

The SRS features a compact body without compromising the durability you expect from Trijicon. The short body also eliminates tube effect that is common of other tube-style red dot sights.

927,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2187927,For Trade:  PSE MACH 10 Bow and Accessories,"North OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, October 20, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for trade...extremely well cared for PSE Mach 10 bow.  This bow was hunted with twice and has been indoors and taken care the rest of the time.  The PSE Mach 10 is a few years old but still in like new condition.  The Mach 10 was  one of PSE's premiere pro shop bows and with included parts such as sight, quiver, stabilizer was over $1400.

  It will come with six high quality carbon arrows and 7 broadheads including Muzzy and Magnus (if I remember correctly), attachable quiver,  4 fiber optic pin Cobra sight, stabilizer (I believe it's a LimbSaver but I'm not sure but I do know it's a high end model),  camo soft bow bag, wrist strap.  This bow has a few years on it but extremely low use and very high quality.  The bow is completely ready for hunting, however, I would recommend a new string just to safe. She's got good speed and enough power to hunt anything that walks.  

Let's face it, high quality archery equipment is extremely expensive so buying a used but, well cared for high quality bow is the only option for shooters on a budget.  This bow was the best of the best during it's time so you're getting an excellent setup right off the bat.  

 You'll often see PSE Nova or Fireflite bows for sale on here for the same price I'm asking but the Nova or Fireflite, while being ok bows they were also PSE's base models which mean they were no where close to PSE's Pro Shop Mach series bows such as the Mach 10.  If you are going to invest in a used bow buying the best available in your price range makes the best sense, there is much truth in the fact that there is a wide disparity of quality in bows.  You can be assured with the Mach 10 you are getting a bow that was the very best available when it was released.

Folks a quick word on this ammo:

Every brick of this ammo is a back ordered item that finally arrived. Some of it has been on back order for many months. Also every brick came from an on-line store and had shipping charges added because I could never find or buy more than 500 rounds from any single supplier. So my asking price Is what I have in this (rounded up or down to the nearest dollar per brick), and I just won't sell it for less. The only reason I'm selling at all is because I've just about run out of space in my safe and I'm still expecting more between now and the end of the year. So please don't ask if I'll split this up or take any less because I won't. One thing I've learned this year is that there is no such thing as too much ammo, so holding on to this is no problem. On the other hand this is a chance to pick up a substantial supply of .22LR for a price that I was happy to pay to get it. To the best of my knowledge there is still no place where you can buy this quantity of ammo unless you happen to have a friend at Walmart who will tell you when the ammo truck arrives and some people have told me that even they are limiting purchases.
