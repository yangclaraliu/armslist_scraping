Our Brand New, High End AR-10 Upper features the incredibly hard to come by, 16 inch 7.62x51 Nitride heavy barrel, (HBAR) making it much stronger and far more accurate than any other chrome lined barrel on the market today.

They are made from 416 stainless, have M4 feed ramps, 5/8 muzzle break thread and finished in black with a carbine gas system. 

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset.

The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within 2 weeks of purchase. 

Our High-Quality, DPMS Style upper receiver comes in an A3 flattop configuration that offers plenty of flexibility in both open and optical sighting options. MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail has 17 cross-slots that accept popular AR-15/M16 accessories and scope mounts. Shell deflector and forward assist are machined as a single unit. Our standard receiver features a Bravo Company Mod 3 charging handle, custom port cover, and forward assist. Also standard is CMMG's .308 bolt carrier group making this a fully complete upper receiver that is ready to roll. 

The Complete TacticalARs.com ""Magnus"" High End Upper has a 12"" Carbine Free Float Rail System with precise fit to our upper receiver. Our proprietary rail system has been crafted out of 6061 T6 aircraft aluminum with a level III hard anodized finish and is mounted over our properly fitted micro gas block.

 Our Brand New, High End AR-10 Upper features the incredibly hard to come by, 16 inch 7.62x51 Nitride heavy barrel, (HBAR) making it much stronger and far more accurate than any other chrome lined barrel on the market today. It's chambered in .308 Winchester with a 1/10 twist rate. No detail is overlooked and each barrel is HPT and MPI inspected. They are made from 416 stainless, have M4 feed ramps, 5/8 muzzle break thread and finished in black with a carbine gas system. 

 We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset. We've found that when building for a specific person, it increases the attention to detail significantly and therefore, the finished product is second to no one and far superior than that of any mas-produced or store-bought brand out there. The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within 2 weeks of purchase. 

 Our High-Quality, DPMS Style upper receiver comes in an A3 flattop configuration that offers plenty of flexibility in both open and optical sighting options. MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail has 17 cross-slots that accept popular AR-15/M16 accessories and scope mounts. Shell deflector and forward assist are machined as a single unit. Our standard receiver features a Bravo Company Mod 3 charging handle, custom port cover, and forward assist. Also standard is CMMG's .308 bolt carrier group making this a fully complete upper receiver that is ready to roll. 

The Complete TacticalARs.com ""Magnus"" High End Upper has a 12"" Carbine Free Float Rail System with precise fit to our upper receiver. Our proprietary rail system has been crafted out of 6061 T6 aircraft aluminum with a level III hard anodized finish and is mounted over our properly fitted micro gas block.

Very accurate, selling for my father as he's getting up in age and wants a 20 gauge, although with the factory porting the gun has minimal recoil.  Patterns Feds, Rems, Hornady well in  2 3/4"" and 3"" but shot best with Lightfield Hybrids although they drop like a rock past 120 yds.  My father is a retired gun smith and he mounted the weaver rings and Simmons Whitetail II 1.5-5x20 himself; not a high dollar scope by any means but gets the job done out to 100-120 yds even in lower light with the smaller objective.  Gun has been fired 18-20 times and is in excellent condition with no damage, rust, scratches, etc.

The grip straps show some handling wear with 70% remaining on the front strap, 50% on the backstrap, and 90% on the bottom strap. Excellent fire blue on the trigger screws, and rear of the hammer which still retains its original bright polish on the profiles. Original walnut grips are excellent with no chips, cracks, or repairs. Excellent wood to metal fit and Excellent inspector car touches. Action is excellent. Bore is bright with three or four pits....Fine Overall. Just a great gun and the nicest US Army Colt Model 1894 we've had in several years."

1.  The Ballistic Tip® Hunting bullet's polycarbonate tip resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. 

2.  Fully tapered jacket and special lead alloy core allows controlled expansion and optimum weight retention at all practical velocity levels. 

3.  Heavy jacket base acts as a platform for large diameter mushroom. 

4.  Ballistically engineered Solid Base® boat tail configuration combines with the streamlined polycarbonate tip for extreme long range performance. 

5.  Nestled in the jacket mouth is the streamlined polycarbonate tip, color-coded by caliber. 

6.  The Ballistic Tip® Varmint's ultra thin jacket mouth assures violent expansion at either end of the velocity scale. 

7.  The uniform, gradual thickening of the jacket wall at the bullet's mid-section is designed to keep the Ballistic Tip® Varmint together until impact at any velocity.

This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters."

for those of you don't know this is a 870 express clone. Just about any 870 express accessory will fit on this gun. Is a proven and reliable system that has always worked. Disassembly is easy and quick and text makes cleaning the firearm also easy and quick. This gun also has the added muzzle brake for reduced recoil and reduced barrel rise.

this was a gift for my son but it's just a little too much for him to handle at age 13. This has had 5 shots put down range with the gun. I can also throw in a brand new never used S
Smith and Wesson M&P tactical soft case by allen company.  as I said it is brand new and still has the tags on it."

The 37mm STZ-Havoc Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology. Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 T-6 aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in a non-glare matte black finishing for maximum durability and ease of maintenance.Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any mil spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included."

 About the M6 Scout:
 Unlike nearly all other firearms, there is no ""furniture"" on the M6 -- no wooden or composite stock or forearm -- the only parts which are not steel are the rubber butt plate and cheek rest. The M6 stock is stamped sheet steel, while the removable barrel assembly is forged steel. Aircrew who were issued the M6 were instructed on a way to make a field expedient forestock by wrapping the barrels with a length of shroud line from their parachute. The USAF M6 Survival Weapon used iron sights, while the M6 Scout commercial model includes provision for mounting a telescopic sight. The stock holds four .410 shells and nine .22 Hornet rounds."

I have a large amount of 22LR that I would like to sell or trade. I am pricing it substantially lower than what I see it going for at shows, and lower than what others are selling for in private party. I am basically selling for what I have in it. So if you can get it somewhere else cheaper than by all means do so. I am not trying to gouge, just recoup what I have in them. That being said, here is what I have:
-3 boxes of 525rd Remington Golden Bullet- $45 each
-8 boxes of 325rd Federal Auto-Match-$30 each
I am not placing any kind of limit to purchase on these so you can buy as many, or as little as you would like. These prices are for pickup in norman only. If you want to buy everything I will sell them all for 350 which is much less than what the market has them at. I would also consider trading some or all towards a Pink SR22 in good or new condition. Please shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal on it

I have a 1952 Tula Russian SKS in perfect condition since its re-arsenal in Russia. I received this rifle in trade from a collector that bought 3 of these in the early 90's fired them 10 shots, and placed them in his safe until now. The only reason I am considering parting with it is the fact they are multiplying in my safe. EVERYTHING ON THIS RIFLE MATCH! I really mean this is GEM! I cleaned it after receiving it to check for cosmoline (which it still had everywhere but bore and chamber) and in doing so saw the true fit and finish of this rifle. Every part that can have serial does, and is matching: stock, milled trigger guard, magazine, top cover, bolt carrier, bolt, extractor, gas piston, gas tube, gas tube cover, and of course receiver. Has chrome-lined, threaded-on barrel that has mirror finish. All parts are finished with Russian answer to Parkerizing; black ""BBQ"" paint which I rate at 95-100% Stock is deep red finish with only minor handling marks. No gouges, or dents, or scrapes just shellac in a very few places. This rifle will truly be a good great shooter or safe queen. If you have been watching the value of the sks line you will know that unfired-near new Russian rifles are getting very hard to find, most will have a aftermarket stock and no bayonet or been ""bubba'd"" by someone and placed back in original stock. This one has never been molested. 
You will get: rifle w/ bayonet and cleaning rod. Sorry didn't have the sling or cleaning kit.

Details:

The TNW Firearms Aero Survival Rifle (ASR) is engineered to breakdown efficiently without the use of tools. This unique configuration allows for easy barrel removal and caliber changes. The ASR's compact design allows it to fit in small storage compartments or its optional specially designed three day pack (Bug Out Bag). This rifle is an essential piece of equipment for back-packing, boating, camping, back country flying, mountain biking, or hunting.

This carbine is set up for 9mm, but you can get the barrel and bolt to change it to .40 or .45 on the fly. This a perfect pistol caliber carbine for someone looking to have a viable exit strategy or wanting to get a no nonsense carbine.

It uses Glock magazines, which I have 1 15rd and 1 30rd magazine for it. 

Also I will include a nice TruGlo scope with it, not the original, low quality scope it came with.

Description:

The AR15 Lite Rail II™ is the next generation of Lite Rail from Daniel Defense.  The improved design enhances the rail’s structural integrity, improves functionality, aesthetics and ease of installation to the weapon system without compromising its best-known attributes, one of which being the lightest rail system on the market.  Enhanced features include a machined from one piece aluminum rail which replaces our previous two piece welded design, our patented Bolt-Up System™, requiring only 4 bolts instead of 6, with tabs that aid in alignment to the upper receiver during installation.  Front and Rear Sling Swivel Attachment Points are integrated into both the left and right side rails and are designed to limit the swivel’s rotation.

The AR15 Lite Rail II™ 9.5 FSP Free Float Rail System features a cut in the front of the top rail to accommodate the front sight post and gas block of a carbine length AR15 gas system, while at the same time, providing much needed additional rail space along the sides and bottom rails. More rail space means enhanced capability for modern rifle accessories."
