This is an awesome survival rifle and just fun to shoot.  It fits easily in your backpack or ""bug-out"" bag and makes a great truck gun.  Everything stores neatly in the stock and it assembles in less than a minute.  Also: When everything is stored in the stock, it floats!!  It’s very light, easy to handle with almost no felt-recoil and that makes it ideal for introducing an adult to shooting or training a youngster.  

This rifle has had only a few rounds through it and it looks as if it was brand new.  Mostly it lived a sheltered existence in my bug-out bag (even though the original shipping box does have a few dings).

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is NOT the original AR-7 or Charter Arms versions of the AR-7 that had many quality control problems in the past.  This is the latest incarnation of that firearm, called the Henry US Survival Rifle, produced by the Henry Repeating Arms Company. The Henry Company bought the production rights from Charter Arms and implemented many problem fixes, tightened quality control and made a few improvements.  Here’s an excerpt from the history of this gun on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-7) .
-------
“In 1980, the design and production rights passed on to Henry Repeating Arms and the compact rifle was slightly revised. The AR-7 is now (2011) known as the Henry U.S. Survival rifle. An ABS material replaced the original plastic, which was prone to cracking and failure. The receiver recess in the Henry stock allows storage of receiver with a magazine in place and the rifle is normally sold with two magazines. The latest versions of the Henry allow for storage of three magazines total, with two in the stock recess, and one in the receiver. The modern Henry U.S. Survival rifle is also waterproof (all prior versions were known to leak water inside the stock). They now include a full teflon coating on the outer surface. A 3/8 in. rail milled into the top of the receiver for mounting a wide variety of optics is now a standard.”
-------
I have added one extra mag to the two that originally shipped with the gun.  All three mags fit neatly in the stock.

This is a takedown model-black, 22lr semi-auto.  It Includes three (10) round factory magazines, in original box as shipped with all paperwork, lock,etc.

Crazier still this week since I bought yet another gun today. So one needs to go to make room in my bank account to pay for them. I would like cash on this one, though a partial trade might work if you have a Nagant or Tokarev only. 

For some reason, I looked in my gun safe and found I have more 9mm handguns than I will ever use or need. I am really more of an old revolver or antique gun guy. So, here is my SIG 2022 9mm. I only have a couple of boxes of ammo run through it, with zero malfunctions. It is more accurate than I am, and with its polymer frame, recoil feels almost non-existent to me. Google them, and you will see almost universally good reviews. This handgun is about a year old, so it was made after SIG had worked out the few bugs they had when introduced. The trigger is light and predictable. This will come in its original box with a second grip so you can make it fit you. When they come from the factory, the 2022 has a black coating on the barrel which immediately gets scratched when shooting. So I hand polished the breech, which shows through the ejection port, to a 2000 grit gloss. I did not use and power tools or files on it. The result looks pretty good to my eyes. Well actually, really good. There are no scratches or nicks on the gun, and it has never been carried in a holster, so there is no holster wear.

Now that 9mm ammo is becoming available again, I think you will have some fun with this. $14.99 a box at Walmart beats what I have been seeing online by a LOT!

I checked some of the online auctions on these and they seem to be selling at $450-$550 plus shipping and dealer transfer fees. I would like $450 for mine, which is about what I paid for it. I am not a dealer,  so of course, no transfer fee, lol.

Face to face only transactions in this, since if I am going to ship it, I might as well put it on an auction site and get more.

Email me through Armslist with your phone number, and I will call you so we can meet...Thanks for reading my long-winded ad. You will like this SIG. Doby Pilgrim, Santa Fe"

I own a Sig Sauer P226 9mm, and Im not saying this to push the Cougar, someone will want it either way, but the Cougar is literally twice as accurate and reliable. Its never jammed, and never strayed a shot more than a few inches from dead center at nearly any range. Im not desperate to move this thing, so don't offer me Kel-Tec's or Jennings 58's. This is a quality pistol, even if the MSRP isn't a thousand dollars. Don't let this one get away from you, you would never even know what you missed out on."

I'm in Sarasota but can get up to Tampa or down to North Port.

No crazies with your pricing please. I know the market and wasn't born last night, so if you make a silly offer I'll just ignore you.

Its great for learning or teaching basic shooting or for those shooting for a long time.  Awesome for self defense when panicking makes it easy to miss your target.  I would still take a great self defense course though.



It has a $350 Laser Max internal guide rod laser so you can carry it concealed.  It has night sites that still work but are a little faded.  If the average glock sells around $550 with night sites plus $350 Laser max, this gun retails for around $900 plus tax $63 and FFL.  I would trade it for around $775-800



3 mags.  Original Plastic Carry Case. 







Asking $775.   Trade options at bottom of ad too.  Email your number and I can text pics if you want more but gun works great; If you don't here from me in 2-3 hrs between 8am-9pm. I didn't get email so resend. I always check my spam filter but use aol, so dont always get messages.  Low ballers ignored. Please don't ask my bottom line. Looking for offers.

It's west of Orlando.   Im Located near Hwy 50 & 27 






Please only contact me if you are willing to come here to pick it up FTF.  I apologize but family health stuff keeps me from being able to drive outside of town right now. 



The price is already lower to accommodate me not meeting half way so please no low ball... 
FTF must pick up in Clermont.  FL DL required. CWP takes priority No Felons. Must be 21 and FL resident.  










I would really like an inexpensive or great valued AR 5.56/.223 or .308.  Prefer any of medium to high end brands and possibly local brands like Spikes.  Only want Ar's that upper and lower are matching from factory, not mismatches please.   Unless its just too good of a deal to pass up..... 
Other trades I would consider would be basic Glock plus cash trades . Tactical Rifle (w/ scope preferably) in .223 or .308 plus cash 1911's   Kimber, Smith, Sig, Colt or other cool 1911 that is a great deal plus cash on my side or (p938 lower cost models plus cash) )or other cool tactical weapon................ Can't add too much on my side so must be fairly close in price.  Not looking for any real high end guns unless price is close to mine. 



If you have something else cool to trade that you gotta great deal on that is too good to pass up. I might consider. But looking for great functioning weapons.



no mossberg shot guns,    no lcp's, no keltec pistols............not interested at this time in xd's, m&p's, taurus, baretta unless its just an awesome deal on my side

Keltec website:

""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.""

Bullet details....40-grain copper plated lead round nose bullet. Screaming hot and hard-hitting! Gives 1470 fps with a 40 grain bullet. Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where smith and wesson manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available, and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ... and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art."

will sell lot of ammo for $220 or trade for magazines for my 45's listed, or the .40 listed.. or a gun

Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 

Maverick bullpup shotgun.  18 inch barrel, only 28"" overall length!  5+1 capacity and the perfect size to deploy in small areas while still maintaining a full size barrel.  It is well used but still in perfect working order.  the bullpup frame will accommodate any mossberg 500 style reciever

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

The Millennium PRO"" features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. This gun is in good condition with one small finish wear spot.  one mag."

The night sights are special Trijicon HD night sights. These are 200 dollar sights. They have a black serrated rear sight with 2 tritium inserts and a bright orange front sight with a tritium insert. The orange also charges during day light and glows at night. Even with zero sun light the tritium inserts will still glow in darkness.

Either way, it's a pure pleasure to shoot. I had this to the range once, a few months ago, and I was shooting happy faces into silhouette heads  40' away while standing up. And I'm a novice. This is a hand cannon. It's not really a carry gun unless you're going Dirty Harry style.

I saw a dealer asking 799.99 for one not quite as nice as this. It wasn't a heavy barrel and it appeared to have wear on the bluing. You won't find that here... This was a safe queen until I bought it. Actually, it still is because I just don't shoot a lot. I'm more of a hunter."

Lots of research shows that a better picture has higher chances of selling an item.

For a very reasonable fee, I can use my high end professional camera to photograph your item as you'd like it done. Image editing included to really make the picture stand out. 

If you're selling an old VCR, a cell phone might work. When you intend to represent a near thousand dollar item in an attractive and detailed manner, my opinion is that the picture SHOULD do it justice.

I am not a professional photographer... I bought a nice camera for a hobby and I also enjoy firearms... This is a fun and interesting blend of the two, at a much lower cost than a professional studio.


I charge $20 for up to 30 mins and $25 for a 30-45 min session, with editing included afterwards until you are satisfied. 

NOTE: For safety reasons, I require a copy of your valid FOID and matching Illinois ID before we meet, and I will provide the same.

Whether you intend to use it on armslist or elsewhere, high quality photographs are a must for any serious seller."

It has been cryogenically dipped,trigger job,JP muzzle break,action job & recently checked out by gunsmith before being advertised for sale. This JP recoil reducing muzzle break is a beast! I don't think it kicks as hard as a .243. A kid could definitely shoot this gun. The bad news is it blows a 1 foot flame out both side of the tank break & the people at the gun range don't move down....they go home. This thing is obnoxiously LOUD! To the point of ear damage if you were to try & hunt without ear protection. You can feel the concussion in your chest if your anywhere near it.
It has been a safe queen & I have every box of Black Hills brass ever fired out of it! maybe 10-12 boxes. Just looking to start a new project.

Developed and manufactured in small numbers from 1964-68, patterned around the M3 Grease Gun and used genuine Thompson 1928 wood stocks in their construction. Made by the Eagle Gun Company, which operated out of Stratford, Connecticut.  The Eagle Mark I, followed later by the Mark II version, were the first of several open bolt carbines to be manufactured and sold in the 1960's. These were followed by the Spitfire, the Apache and the Commando Carbine which appeared in the early 1970's. All were semiauto carbines that fired either .45 ACP or 9mm pistol cartridges using surplus Thompson, M3 or Sten magazines. The Spitfire's and Apache's were later banned by the ATF and reclassified as ""machine guns"", in effect making the already rare Eagle Carbine one of the only legal versions of this type of firearm.  This is a very early one, under 100 serial number, in great condition and fun to shoot. Comes with two mags.   I would hang on to it if I could, but must sacrifice to fund other toys.

The P250 is a great gun for NJ.  You can very easily change slide, barrel and grip to .45ACP, .40 S&W or .357SIG without worrying about new permits.  Same goes for size.  Full size, compact, sub-compact, all using the same fire control unit.  These guns have one of the best DAO triggers you will ever shoot. 

I have another, and with the modularity I don't really need 2.  I don't even rememebr the last time I shot this one, so ti might as well find a new home where it will get some use.

Firearm Highlights 
It has the awesome RTK custom trigger. It is composed of aluminum with a beautiful anodized finish and adjustable screws for pre-travel and over travel. It is adjusted to where there is very little take up and over travel. 
This trigger it is a night and day difference over the factory polymer trigger.

i would prefer to do FTF with buyer in the southwest suburban area (Bolingbrook/Romeoville/Naperville/Plainfield/Joliet). 

To protect the buyer and me the seller, I will be asking to see both their FOID and DL. Buyer can view my valid cards as well.
