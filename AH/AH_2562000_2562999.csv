You will have an adrenaline rush for four hours. Seats in this section are going for  $600+ on nfl ticket exchange and stubhub per ticket.  I would part with them for an even $900 cash for the pair or $1000 trade value. You will not be disappointed unless maybe your a 49'ers fan. :-}   
I will be entertaining trade offers. I would prefer a partial trade for firearm/cash. But maybe a strait across trade for the right offer. I do have cash,guns,ammo that I would throw in for something that I just absolutely have to have.  Any reasonable offers I would like to hear. No I will not trade for a $200 gun and a roll of quarters. Good offers please as these tickets are valuable and in very high demand. I can send pics upon request. I would also like to meet face to face. I will not mail the tickets as I do not want any chance of you not receiving them."

About Our Barrels
The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and, where threaded, muzzle threaded .5-28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.  

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling,  producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

My friend is the Original owner and has only put maybe 150 rds through it.  So shes still pretty new.  Very few scuffs on the slide near the muzzle.  

Comes with 2 7round magazines.

That being said here is a very nice Stainless 10/22 with wood stock that I have done some nice upgrades to. I have added a Butler Creek extended magazine release, Volquartsen extended charge handle, Volquartsen auto bolt release, Weaver scope mount, and polished aluminum butt plate. It has an AIM Mil-Dot reticle scope on it that is mounted perpendicular to the bore axis and is very accurate. It is a fixed 4 power with a 32mm objective lens, I have it dead on at 35 yards, and using the second Mil-Dot as a holdover it busts clays every time at 100 yards. I am also including the steel lipped 25 round magazine, chamber flag and embroidered 10/22 case. There are 200 rounds of ammo, and this is not just your run of the mill plinking stuff. There are 100 rounds of Fiocchi and 100 rounds of Eley target ammo. The stickers pulled off the Eley boxes but you can see the headstamp on the cases. This is very precision target ammo, and it will group beautifully through this gun. So there it is, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I don't want trades, I am really only after money, I reckon about the only thing I may consider is a stock 10/22 and $150 as I wouldn't mind still having a 10/22 just for plinking.

I have listed this on Gunbroker as well so if you want it let me know ASAP as I can't end an auction once I get a bid, and I will sell for less locally as I don't like the hassle of shipping. The Ruger Alaskan is basically a short barrel of their proven Super Redhawk design. This gun is not for the faint of heart. The .454 is a nice compact size that has nearly 3 times the muzzle energy of a .44 magnum. I wouldn't call this gun pleasant, overly accurate, or pretty, but it will work every time you pull the trigger and stop a big brown bear if you need it to. Comes with a lot of ammo. Like most revolvers it can chamber the cartridge on which it was based, in this case the .45 Colt. I have 35 of those to get you into the gun, than you can step up to the hand loaded 250 grainers, from there you have 300 grain Sierra's that are hand loaded to a healthy thump. I keep em a little lighter than max as I don't want to push the gun or my luck, but if you really want a ride there are also 8 factory Hornady XTP/HP's that will just downright put a grin on your face. All reloads are done to the manual using 2nd fired brass on a Dillon 550 with the utmost Q.A. It also comes with the right hand Galco holster and box with original paperwork. Let me know if interested as it will sell on Gunbroker I am sure."

I have a Colt 1911A1 .45 ACP, serial number 1694XXX manufactured in 1944. It likely saw combat in WWII based on the light wear and patina, but despite that, survived the war completely intact. As far as I can tell, it is completely original and collector grade. Original finish, ""Colt .45"" barrel, grips, trigger, everything. The magazine, which has the correct C-S (Colt-Scoville) stamp, is a contracted magazine that late-WWII 1911A1s were shipped with. Internal parts are all factory original and in very good condition. Appropriate roll marks and proof marks are all present and strong.

I also have a Scoville ""S"" magazine that will be included. The Scoville magazines were not shipped with Colt 1911A1s, but were produced and shipped during WWII. It comes with a reproduction Kraft box that does have matching serial number and looks pretty cool as a display piece.

Spikes tactical lower with spikes parts.
Uppers from PSA (well known for quality parts) 
1:7 twist heavy barrel A2
BAD lever on for quick reloads. 
The scope does NOT come with the gun, it maybe if the offers right but consider it's a 1200 trijicon ACOG. 
I have extra parts to go on the rails and plenty of metal military mags as well for the right price. 

Only shot it twice , 60 rounds, cleaned it then I had a serious motorcycle accident, my left arm is paralyzed. I can still shot it with one arm, this rifle is amazing. The barrel and quad rail are perfect. 

Price is somewhat firm but don't offer 800 bucks and expect me to respond.


I also put up my Reminton 783 chambered in .308
It has a 6""-9"" bi-pod and a Osprey Global pro series 10-40x50 scope. 
The scope is worth more then the gun lol. I'll take 400 obo without scope and 750 with and I have ammo to add if interested. I sighted this bad boy in, in under 5 shots at 150yards. Bit to bad for a dude with one arm. The 783 is a great rifle, fully flueded barrel. The bolt on it is crisp. Holds 4+1. Light to no recoil.  I don't need to sell these guns but having some extra money never hurts. 

Also I have a new Marlin government 45-70 guide gun I could sell. 
Price is 650 on it. Less then 20 rounds threw it. 

I have a NEF 10g I'll sell to if interested. It's pretty unrealistic for me to have these
two guns, I don't need to sell them, but shooting a 10g with one arm is close to impossible."

I bought this right before  Christmas and then my girlfriend bought me a Ruger No. 1 in 300 mag, so guess which one gets sold...

This is quite a nice rifle. Has a nice piece of wood, engraved receiver, engraved floor plate, as well as engraved scope rings. It has been hunted with, so it does have the normal marks and here and there scratches that come with hunting. Still a very beautiful rifle. I put 6 rounds through it the weekend after purchasing and shot two groups of three at 120 yards that measured just over an inch.  The rifle is currently topped with a Weaver 2-7 scope that can be worked into a deal. It is one of the older Weavers that are known for being tough as nails.

I'm open to reasonable trade and cash offers. I will add or accept cash to even up a trade. I have my trade preferences listed (in no particular order). Thanks for looking and God bless!"

I have a PARA WARTHOG I got in a trade recently. This is a super compact .45 that holds 10 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber. At the time this came out it was the smallest .45 on the market weighing only 24 oz. It is 6.5 inches long with a 3"" barrel.
It comes with 3 10 round magazines with 1 having a pinky extension. Nothing else is included.
This does have a lifetime warranty.
It does have some scratches but not bad.
I will meet within a reasonable distance of Anderson...cash or PayPal if you pay the fees.
And unlike many on this site, I will answer all inquires.
Check Armslist for the price of my Warthog compared to other Warthogs around the country.
Thanks.

You are considering a VERY lightly used Sniper PMX32CB Tactical Scope.  I bought this for my AR-15.  I shot it with about 100 rounds to get it sighted in and removed it.  I just purchased a more expensive site for competition shooting.  This is in like new condition and is at a fraction of what you would buy a new one for.

Reticle is fixed at 100 yards and ranges out to 600 yards. The reticle is designed to allow you to make a precise shot on target very quickly without having to adjust the target knobs.
Knowing the distance helps you in aiming on target. However if the distance is not known, you can use the rapid ranging reticle to estimate the distance. This is a great in close quarter battle (CQB) Scenarios for quick and precise acquisition."

Seller must be willing to:

- Do FFL to FFL or FTF (with Bill of Sale) if in Georgia.  I'm not accepting a private shipment from you to an FFL.
- Allow for a three day inspection hold so I can have a gunsmith look it over (unless it's a FTF).
- Accept cash or personal check as payment (I'll discuss other payment methods on an individual basis).
- Provide detailed pictures of the weapon and the serial number.

I will:

- Pay for any and all shipping costs (standard rate, package insurance, one day air fees, etc.).  These will be added to the cost of the gun.
- NOT use pay pal or western union.  To many scammers trying this so don't even ask.
- Possibly be willing to pay a little more for an upper end gun (Colt Gold Cup, Springfield Trophy Match, etc.), but I'm trying to get a colt python and I paid for the wilson combat; so money is tight.

I'm not interested in guns by Para, GSG, RIA, etc.  If you're not sure just shoot me a message.  Worst I'll do is politely decline."

One is the Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 rifle and the other is the Walther P22 pistol. Both are wildly popular .22LR platforms that deliver AR and CQC style form factors in the .22LR caliber that allows reasonable shooting costs coupled with the look, feel, and handling of their popular larger caliber cousins.

Both combo kits allow the owner to buy a complete set-up and save time and money by getting them from one source at the same time. Both of these are perpetual go-to weapons in the Gateway Tactical demo collection. We have found that once someone tries either weapon with a solid .22LR silencer, they are hooked. This is what has lead us to offer these kits as an option for acquiring this particular configuration. All of these turn a .22LR with sub-sonic ammunition into ultra-low signature weapon in the range of a CO2 pellet gun. This allows people who may be intimidated by noise and recoil to try something less overwhelming to see if they like to shoot. It also is more inviting to children who may have an interest but are less likely to try handling a firearm due to the normal noise and recoil issues associated with shooting.

Federal NFA laws require that any NFA item sold by a licensed dealer can only be transferred directly to a resident of the state in which the dealer is licensed. We can transfer to NFA dealers in other states to have the product transferred to you directly.

For more info, visit: http://www.gatewaytactical.com/silencers/22combos.htm

* WARNING: Once you shoot a good silencer with sub-sonic ammunition in either of these weapons, you will be hooked and wonder how you ever shot without one. There is a distinct possibility that this will lead to future silencer purchases for other host weapons."

Affectionately known as “Higgins” the straight-shooter, no-nonsense. Ever. We used a frame lock design on this model, but due to the length of the blade & lock-tang, we placed a G-10 overlay on the lock side. This G-10 block functions similar to a ‘doorstop’ and adds a bit of color & grippability to the frame side. No matter how much outward force is applied, because of our “rogue block” the lock may never be rendered ‘over-extended’ and ineffective. The blade is an American-style tanto with a finger-guard that sees double duty as a flipper device. Finally when the knife is open, it reveals its symmetry and has ideal 4-corner lashing points using the hollowed chain ring bolts at the base of the handle and the through-holes at the base of the blade. A true tactical tool: hard, fast, sharp, ready for the world and more.
