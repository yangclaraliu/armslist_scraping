    Nosler’s lead alloy mix, dual core, provides superior mushrooming characteristics at virtually all impact velocities.  The fully tapered copper-alloy jacket ruptures instantly at the thin jacket mouth, yet the gradual thickening along the bullet’s axis controls expansion and curls the jacket uniformly outward at high and low velocities.  Nosler’s integral partition supports the expanded mushroom and retains the rear lead-alloy core. The enclosed rear core retains more than two-thirds of the original bullet weight for deep penetration.  Every Partition® bullet in the Nosler® line delivers optimum length, weight and ogive design for maximum in-flight and terminal performance.  Special crimp locks Add strength to resist deformation under the pressure of heavy magnums.

Overall this one is in really nice condition, the finish looks great overall, there are the very fine ""handling"" marks here, the ones you see in different light, which much of what I am referring to could be on all of them from the factory.  The only bad spot I can find is on the left side above the trigger area, you can see it in the pic.  I can't tell with my finger nail if it is on top of the finish and just needs to be cleaned off or if it is in the finish, but just want to be as accurate as possible on the description.  The wood grips look perfect.  I've seen prices on these all over the place recently from $600-$1,600, depending on of course the condition, finish, box, ppwk and barrel length etc., it looks like the 2.5"" models are more desireable/valuable over the 4"" and 6"" barrels in this model.

$850 cash or I will look at good trades as long as the value is there and it makes sense as I know cash is tight for many right now.

No hurry to get rid of this piece as it will only go up in value, I am only listing because I have other .357 mags and I will likely never carry or shoot this one, it will just sit.  On trades just let me know what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash or ammo, optics, silver etc. etc.  Please do not contact me with, ""I have a Beretta 92 I will trade"", I will think you want a straight trade and pass.

I completely understand this is obviously no Colt, Springfield, or Kimber, and naturally for that reason I do not expect to get $700 for it. HOWEVER, this pistol is reliable, accurate, and has great slide to frame, and barrel to slide fitment. There is no more play in this pistol than any of the other high end 1911.**
Now, as for the pistol, it has roughly 400 rounds down the tube and I've run about 4 different types of ammo with no FTF' s or FTE's, but the slide has slight wear from holster in and cycling. It has the black finish with gold/silver inlays. This model had 2 - dot Heine Novak style sights. Other features include skeltonized adjustable trigger, skeleton hammer, ambidextrous thumb safety, high rise beavertail, flat MSH that has 30-lpi checkering, same goes for the front checkering and u del the trigger gaurd. It also utilizes forward cooking serrations, full length guide rod, and a flared ejection port.
This pistol doesn't have the original case, but it does have just a universal case. Came with two Taurus mags, but I have two others totalling 3 8 Rd mags and one flush 7 Rd mag. Anything else you want to know, just ask!"

I dropped it off to have it cerakoted and the smith fucked it up. The magazine release has a small spring loaded pin that needs to be depressed before being taken apart. He obviously took a punch to it and knocked out the tiny part of the frame it grabs onto. I then had the area rewelded but it was too soft and the release worked itself out. It still functions flawlessly and worked great for several hundred rounds before the weld failed.

Its a shame since its getting harder to find W. German made sigs and this one was a nice one. Has a trigger job and newer spring kit installed last couple years. I even used it a couple times in IDPA at the Master level. 

I think my asking price is pretty fair considering what I have seen just the complete slide/barrel and original grips sell for. Use it for parts or if you have a competent smith they can very easily fix this. I just recently acquired a mk25 and x5 so I have decided not to pursue repairing this one.

For those of you who are skeptical of the Poly lower, watch this video. it helped me decide to purchase it. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qpnmi3XPP8&feature=player_embedded

This is a personally built rifle with the following major parts: - New Frontier Poly lower and parts kit (110.00) - UTG 6 position stock (30.00) - Sota Arms Upper (130.00) - Sota Arms Floating Guard (30.00) - JoeBobs premium Bolt Carrier Group (155.00) - (2)30 round poly magazines (40.00) - Bulldog AR15 hard/soft case (55.00) - Sota Arms 16inch Stainless M4 Barrel (150.00) - Forward grip with extracting bipod (20.00) - Reactive site with multiple settings (30.00) - AR15 multipurpose wrench (10.00) - Muzzle Brake (40.00)

purchased and assembled bit by bit. took it to the range and had a gunsmith check it over, he did the following: - replaced the poly trigger/hammer. - adjusted the gas block and buffer/stock - installed detents 

We tested with the poly magazines, The rifle hated the poly magazines, it would not reload after 2-3 rounds. We used a steel magazine and it was flawless, put 50 rounds through nice and smooth and no other hiccups. havnt had it out since then. 

So, you will need quality magazines, i will include the poly, but they are pretty much useless. I dont think we tested both mags, it is possible that one of the mags will work fine, but i cant remember if we did, so i wouldnt count on it.

I enjoyed putting this together, but my tastes change and need to fund a new hobby. :)"

The gun works fine.  Adjustable sight.  Finish is approximately 85%, primarily because the shine is starting to stipple and fade in some areas.  Photo is pretty representative of the finish.  The right wood grip has some minor holster wear.  The gun was made in the early 80’s for about 3 years, is all steel, and is a follow-on from the S&W Models 39 and 439.  The gun comes with one blued magazine.  The gun looks good and shoots good.  More photos available on request.  This was my truck gun for several years but I replaced it with a high capacity Hi-Power, so I'm selling the S&W so I can buy a good pocket-sized 9mm.  I will answer all e-mails.  Prefer cash but will trade for the right gun - e-mail me with what you have, but no shotguns.  Price is firm.  This gun in new condition sells in the $625 range, and used in the $500 range, so the $375 price is way more than fair.  Price includes the gun as shown, 1 mag, a Xerox copy of the owner’s manual, nothing more.  I prefer a local sale face to face, but will ship for $60 additional, which includes shipping from my FFL to another FFL.  For face to face, show me something that says you are 21 years old or older and tell me there’s no law preventing you from the purchase.  I will be willing to travel in a 20 mile radius from the Mobile, AL airport area to meet with you for the sale, in a public parking lot, daylight hours only. West Mobile area.  The sale is final.  I am not set up to send or receive telephonic text messages.  If the ad is up, the gun is still available."

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

I bought these because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about with Spyderco knives. I initially was interested in the Spyderco Dragonfly, but couldn't decide between that knife or the Delica or Endura. Rather than buying a single $70+ knife that I might regret or not use, I bought all three of their cousins to see what I liked best.The Byrd line is Spyderco's low cost version of their most popular folding knives. The three knives here are near clones of the Dragonfly, Delica, and Endura. I paid $21-$28 per knife retail, giving you a chance to own and try these knives out at a discount. These are like new, most have seen very little time out of the box, no hard use.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

I have no more than 300 rounds put through it and it's pretty darn accurate and reliable.  Comes with one 15 round magazine and owner's manual.  About the only issue with this is the bluing around the barrel is kind of light.  If you are one who's wanting to duplicolor, duracoat or cerakote the barrel then this is up your alley.  I have too many .22s so this one needs to go.

I don't care to sell it, as I'm more into making a trade for it.  I""m looking for a bare bones Mini 14 or 30...wood stock, one magazine, nothing fancy.  As long as it' shoots well, the stock can have dings or scratches as I would refinish it.  If the barrel needs to be refinished, I'll do a duracoat or cerakote on it.  I just want a simple mini that could use a little work, in order to make the trade fair.

Also, if not a Mini, I am looking for a Norinco Hunter to do a project gun.  I would not use the furniture on one, so if you have one that's seen better days, stock wise, then all the better.  I just want to make an even trade, so your gun doesn't have to be in very good condition.

Lastly, would trade for a Rossi lever action in .357 or CZ 527, in 7.62x39 and some cash toward the CZ."
