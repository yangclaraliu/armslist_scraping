This gun is in very nice condition especially considering its age. It comes with a bayonet, sling and cleaning kit still in the stock. It is chambered in 7.62x39. This is an awesome round that you can always find and for a good price. 

If you do not like the wood you can pick up synthetic stocks for very cheap and turn it into a tactical weapon.

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I have two of these rifles - they are tack drivers to say the least.  I never got around to using this ""backup"" model that I have for sale now - so I'm parting with it.

This whole set up (excluding ammo) is 725$ new. There is roughly 175$ worth of .22lr ammo. I am asking 700$ for this set up (including ammo). This gun is sighted in at 100 yards with the scope, I never used the iron sights. The gun is in mint condition other than some very minor handling wear around the grip and magazine chamber. It is great for a beginning shooter to the most experienced shooters. Can be used for hunting, competition and competitive shooting. Why buy new when you can get a full set up plus 1000 rounds of ammo for 700 and start shooting today!"

Gun has had 5 shots fired in total.  It was a gift for my son (what he had to have) and even though I told him it proved to be a bit too much for him to handle.  Now because of his grades I am getting rid if it.  I would keep it but I am not a fan of a pistol grip shotgun.  

This is a combat style gun.  Parkerized finish, double chrome lined barrel.  En longed pump, dual pump action bars, picatiny rail, fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front(red), very comfortable recoil pad and muzzle brake.  It has an 18.5 inch barrel.

The action is extremely smooth.  The pistol grip is cushioned nicely and large enough for someone with big hands.  This is a clone of an 870 so most accessories will work with this gun.  

There is not a spot on this gun and fit and finish is surprisingly great.  Like I said we took it to the range, fired it 5 times.  It was cleaned and put away.  

With this I am throwing in 2 boxes of slugs and a brand new never used smith and wesson m&p soft tactical case.  Has many pockets along with shoulder strap and carry handle.  External pockets are zippered and hook and loop.  Inside  Hook and loop straps secure your weapon.  It is 42inches long."

While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

I will ship to a C&R license holder. Make sure this firearm is legal in your area before committing to purchase. I had this shotgun evaluated by a local dealer that deals in a lot of older Browning firearms. He stated seeing that someone had installed a Cutts compensator was a disappointment but it looks to have been installed by a competent smith, the vent rib is beveled to fit the compensator body and there appears to be no damage to the bluing from the installation. Overall he rated the gun in 70-80% condition.  

I can meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range for a ""test drive"". My motto is ""Everything is for sale"" but I would honestly prefer to just keep all my guns. With that in mind the listed price is the least I would consider taking.

Here is a very nice Browning Double Auto ""Twentyweight"" 12ga 2.75"" semi automatic shotgun built in 1955, this was the first year they were available in the USA. This shotgun was originally built with bird hunters in mind but I have found they are excellent shotguns for any small game or trap shooting, this has been my squirrel gun for many years. This particular shotgun comes with a professionally installed Cutts Compensator, three different screw on choke tubes and a wrench for changing the chokes. The choke installed in the pictures is a .725""ID ""modified"", the longer choke is a .690""ID LR#3 (similar to what is known as extra full nowadays) and the shortest choke is a .820""ID ""spreader"" (similar to a cylinder choke or no choke). There are many other choke sizes available on the market but these are the three I have and all that is included in this sale. The forearm has several impression marks and the ""clear coat"" has flaked on the butt stock around the receiver."

Due to how much I'm including with it, I would be more inclined to trade with you if you're including a holster, mags, ammo, (or cash??) etc. As this ad mentions no where that I'm interested in selling it, I'm not going to reply to your email if you ask me if you can buy it.  

Respond to ad with questions/offers, I can email more pics. Thanks for looking!"

If you read reviews you will see that WOA is a top notch company that builds really accurate uppers. I ordered this upper nearly a year ago and received it a couple months ago. If you check the website you will see that there is nearly a year lead times on orders. The optic on the rifle is a Leopold mark at mod 1 with spr retical and the fire dot. It I'd mounted on a Leopold mount. This rifle is only been fired about 90 times to check function and sight the rifle in. $1550.00 cash but I'm really looking to trade for a bravo company light weight build with a eotech or aim point optic. May also consider colt with high end optic. The only reason I'm selling this rifle is because I am looking for a lightweight high quality ar.
