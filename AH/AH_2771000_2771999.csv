This is one great looking and very nice shooting AK-47 I've put 10 rounds thru it basically just to function check the rifle after I built it. I enjoy building them more than I do owning or shooting them. I'd have probably shot it more, but ran out of ammo, and just haven't had a chance to get out and get more. (I work a lot).

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonomics, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Price: $299 + tax. Choose from black or grey colored frame.

With proper magazines it can be used with a Glock 31, 22, and 17 lower receivers. I purchased it for Hog hunting so that I use the same ammo with my 6 inch Wolf Glock barrel. I am only selling to fund my new AR build. 
This configuration retails $480 from Mechtech. 

Free shipping!

NOTE: this is not a gun, it is not on any regulated firearms list, it does not include a pistol receiver, it cannot function or shoot by itself, it does not require FFL transfer. It is equivalent to changing the slide of your Glock. It is perfectly legal to convert your Glock into a 16 inch barrel rifle and then change it back into a pistol. See http://www.atf.gov/files/regulations-rulings/rulings/atf-rulings/atf-ruling-2011-4.pdf

To use remove the slide of your Glock, place the feeding ramp (included) on top of the locking block and slide into the Glock CCU just as you do with your slide. 

357 Sig is a formidable pistol round in a 6 inch barrel and it gains about 200 fps in the 16 inch Glock CCU upper. 

Typical uses are Hog hunting, home defense, zombie shootouts, 3 gun matches.
It shoots very accurately and I have shot 2 inch groups at 100 yards with a 3x9 50 mm Nikon  Prostaff scope with Underwood and Grizzly cartridge ammo from 90 to 147 grain bullets. It is also very fast, light and maneuverable for CQB.

This is a very handy rifle and such a nicer size than the 91/30 - it's the same size as the much more common M44, but without the bayonet attached. The trigger is smoother than any other Mosin I've had, and it cycles and ejects ammo flawlessly. The rifling and bore are perfect and the bluing is very nice as well.

297,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2771297,For Sale:  Alexander Arms Tactical Blade Trigger - Price Drop (again),"Georgia, Vermont, United States",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, April 13, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This trigger has approximately 100 rounds on it.  It sells new for $203.50 from Alexander Arms.  I'm not including the pins, but if you're replacing a trigger in your AR, you should have the pins already.

This tactical trigger unit has been designed specifically for field use and does not share a common heritage with a target trigger. For this reason, it is not recommended for target-type shooting, although it may be used with some success in this discipline. The trigger is basically a single stage unit with a bushing mounted disconnector, which is adjustable for engagement and over travel while the pull weight and disconnector engagement are fixed to ensure durability during hard use and inclement environments.

The trigger bow is intentionally narrower than those commonly found on target type triggers. This assists with accurate reference of the trigger finger if the unit is used with gloves or in cold/wet conditions. The pull weight allows manipulation of the trigger with gloves while minimizing the possibility of discharging a round unexpectedly in the manner of a target trigger. In extreme cold conditions the trigger can still be used with mitts with the trigger guard pivoted down, although this is not recommended.

The unit is manufactured from an S7 type tool steel and is through-hardened to provide a durable base. The surface is chrome-plated using a technique that creates a dense finish and a surface hardness in excess of 72 HRC. This surface provides the durability for the trigger in adverse conditions and, hence, the surfaces on both the trigger and the hammer should not be further polished or honed."

This gun shoots amazingly well for being almost 100 years old - nothing less than expected from an original Colt! The serial number on the frame traces to 1918, and the slide with the REAR rampant Colt is from 1915-ish to late 1917. There is an AA mark on the slide, meaning it went through an arsenal rebuild at Augusta Arsenal sometime after WWI, as did many USGI WWI and WWII firearms. Once there, they parkerized it and swapped out any faulty or damaged parts and put it back into service. Seeing how arsenal rebuilds focused more on functional parts and not keeping its original parts for collectibles, a lot of parts were mismatched. I do not know enough about the parts on it, but I do know the grips and the slide stop were replaced with later versions. The mainspring housing is still original to the gun and is not a 1911A1 housing. The gun likely  received the earlier slide and plastic Coltwood grips at Augusta as well. It is not a correct Colt 1918 M1911, but is what would many would consider a collectible shooter. 

I fired around 30 rounds through it after I received it and it shoots amazingly great for such an old gun. Very accurate. I was hitting steel at around 50 yards with it. The only ""damage"" to it is the off-coloring on the left side, near the muzzle. From the best I can tell, it does not appear to be rust, and is barely noticeable. Has all correct military markings and nice rifling in the barrel. Both slide and frame lock up great. Pistol includes 2 unmarked 7-round magazines. 

I also upgraded all of the springs in it because I did not know when the last time it received and upgrade on the mechanical/operational parts. Like I said, it shoots great and I hate to get rid of it because I love the gun and its history, but want to try something different.

The picture is a different pistol, but mine almost looks like it. The difference is the Colt is on the rear of the left side, by the hammer. Original pics to follow this weekend. Please let me know if you are interested. Thanks."

It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 
It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 
 The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left."

Here are some of the new upgrades: 
 It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 
It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.
The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left."

This gun shoots amazingly well for being almost 100 years old - nothing less than expected from an original Colt! The serial number on the frame traces to 1918, and the slide with the rear rampant Colt is from 1914 to late 1917. The AA mark on the slide means that it went through an arsenal rebuild at Augusta Arsenal sometime after the war, as did many USGI WWI and WWII firearms. Once there, they parkerized it and swapped out any faulty or damaged parts and put it back into service. Post-war arsenals rebuilds focused more on functional parts and not keeping its original parts for collectibles, a lot of parts were mismatched. I do not know enough about the parts on it, but I do know the grips and the slide stop were replaced with later versions. The mainspring housing is still original to the gun. The gun likely received the Coltwood grips at Augusta as well. It is what would many would consider a collectible shooter. 

I fired around 30 rounds through it after I received it and it shoots great and is very accurate. The only ""damage"" to it is a little off-coloring on the left side, near the muzzle. In my opinion, it does not appear to be rust or pitting, but is likely discoloration of the metal. All in all, it is barely noticeable. Has all correct military markings and nice rifling in the barrel. Both slide and frame lock up great. Pistol includes 2 unmarked 7-round magazines and blue Colt box.

I replaced the springs in it because I did not know when the last time it received and upgrade on the mechanical/operational parts. Like I said, it shoots great and I hate to get rid of it because I love the gun and its history, but want to try something different.

This rifle has delivered years of faithful and accurate service, as well as the pure joy of owning a beautiful firearm.  My friend was a finicky person, an avid, and very precise reloader, and took excellent care of his belongings.  I've taken care of this rifle just as he did.  I've personally fired approximately 56 rounds through the rifle, mostly at the range.  5 of those shots dropped Whitetail deer where they stood.  Although equipped with a removable drop/down magazine, there's no need for follow-up shots with this deer slaying rifle. 

I'm letting go of it because I actually own another identical rifle in .308, and I can only shoot one at a time!

Rifle Condition:  Super Clean.  Always well cared-for.  No scratches, corrosion, etc.  Clean, shiny bore.  Perfect muzzle crown.  The stock is shiny, and shows VERY LIGHT marks (upon close inspection) from carrying it to and from the tree stand.  22"" barrel

Scope and rings:  Burris rings, Nikon 3-7 Nikoplex reticle, Butler Creek scope caps.  This Nikon scope, like their other hunting optics, is clear, bright, and holds zero perfectly.

Extras: 

I installed a Timney LIGHT trigger spring.  I'll include the factory original spring as well.  But once you've shot the Timney, you won't prefer the factory trigger setup.

Leather Longhorn sling with swivels attached.

The Ruger Security Six was a .357 Magnum/.38 Special revolver introduced in 1968. It had adjustable rear sights and was designed as Ruger's flagship offering for the double action revolver market. They were very popular because they were well built and were competitively priced as compared to similar Colt or Smith & Wesson models. The First Security Six Revolvers were offered in Cobalt Blued finish. Starting in 1975, Ruger offered the Security Six in a stainless Steel version.
However, and this is the real reason why these guns are a solid buy, they will simply out last any other DA revolver over thousands of Magnum rounds. (With the exception, of course, of Ruger’s follow-on piece, the GP-100.) If one bought a Security Six, one could expect a lifetime of full use and still be able to hand it to one’s children with nary a problem. I once knew of an indoor range that had one as a rental gun and it digested, by their estimate, some 1,400,000 rounds with no parts breakages and minimal maintenance. That is the essence of a good deal!"

Kahr Arms CW45 45 ACP 3.64"" 6+1 CW4543 Black Poly Grip & Frame/SS The Kahr CW45 has the combination of features that makes it the best concealed carry pistol in the market. It has the ideal combination of stopping power and shooting comfort, and is smaller, slimmer and lighter than competitive brands. The CW45's natural point of aim and low felt recoil make them the ideal guns to shoot and carry. With the introduction of new manufacturing processes in the production of the CW45, the Kahr pistol represents an unrivaled value. I have put 40 rounds through this gun with no FTF/FTE.  Only reason I am selling is because I want a Bullup 223/556.  Tell me what you have for trade (I can put $ on top if necessary).  Looking to trade for AR pistol/AR/Bullup only in 223 or even 7.62.  Let me know what you got.  Asking $525.00 o.b.o.  Must sign BILL OF SALE w/ proof of Driver License and/or CWP License. NO FELLONS. Thanks for looking. TEXT OR CALL REDACTED
