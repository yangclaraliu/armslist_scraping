A flash hider from an L1A1 was welded on to obtain a minimum legal length.  A receiver extension was then crafted to allow the adjustable stock from an AR-15 to be attached which was then ‚Äúcrafted‚Äù into a homemade bump fire stock (no springs, etc.  = perfectly legal).  Finally, rails were added to the top to allow new sights and carry handle to be added.  

The result is the baddest, sickest, Mad Maxiest, Soviet-German-American-Britishiest mashup ever conceived by man.  Along with 5 original magazines (from which 9mm feeds beautifully), this is one serious lead spewing machine.  I also have a bayonet to go with it.  

It was a project and I‚Äôm not looking to, nor do I feel I will, make a profit on it.  I‚Äôm not a manufacturer by any means so I‚Äôm just looking to move on to new toys.

*****I would like 500 cash or a Marlin 1895 in 45-70***** (would take a Winchester 94 in 30-30 plus 150 cash)

I‚Äôm open to hearing other trades (provided they‚Äôre in nothing smaller than 9mm and NOT black powder) but really the cash or the Marlin is what I‚Äôm looking for.  I'm graduating college in December and a Marlin 1895 sounds roughly 3.7 million times cooler/more meaningful than a silly ol' class ring!

Item is located and will be sold in Murray, KY.  Face to Face.

Spanish Airforce Mauser All original and all matching numbers.Chambered in 8mm Mauser caliber marked ""Cal 7.92 [P] [R]"" on left side of receiver. 23 1/8"" barrel.There are no import marks defacing this rifle. This is NOT one of the more common Spanish made La Coruna M43 rifles.""S/42G"" marked rear sight, ""lxr"" marked magazine follower. Bolt, trigger-guard, floor-plate and receiver are all matching, other parts are un-numbered, as is correct for these rifles. Shiny and prominent Spanish Airforce eagle crest stamped center of receiver. Maintains 95% original bluing, walnut stock is in good condition except for small crack above rear stock plate. Nice prominent rifling, with some pitting which is typical for these rifles. Battled Communists in the streets of Germany during the Weimar Republic era, served in the early Nazi era German Army, and then went on to kill working class anarchists in the Spanish Civil War before being rebuilt for the Spanish Airforce in the late WW2 era. It has it's original correct cleaning rod, Spanish black leather sling with the distinctive Spanish curved brass buckle, correct Spanish bayonet along with bayonet scabbard and bayonet frog, that is a slightly lighter and thinner version of the German Mauser 98k bayonet, correct original muzzle cap cover made specifically for the Kar 98a front sight, and two black leather Spanish ammo pouches one marked ""EPI"". These are all scarce and desirable items that are worth it by themselves. This rifle is very difficult to find with all its' original accessories along with being in the condition that it is. This rifle is meant for collector's specifically Mauser enthusiasts, it has a lot of history behind it especially if you have read ""Homage to Catalonia"" by George Orwell. Made for Spanish military, high quality military craftsmanship unlike the common M43 Spanish Mausers which had heat treatment issues. $1500


Peruvian Model 1909 that was manufactured prior to WWI by Mauser in Oberndorf Germany.The first and original Mauser factory. Has ""Waffenfabrik Mauser-Oberndorf A/N"" left side receiver. Has the Lange Visier (""Roller Coaster"") long-range rear sight. It has a 29.13"" barrel with German ""H"" style bayonet lug. This rifle is beautifully made (pre-WWI build quality and attention to detail was absolutely superb) and is nicely marked with the Peruvian crest on the receiver partially removed, under which is marked ""MAUSER ORIGINAL"". This rifle is completely original.It is NOT import marked. The original blue finish rates about 80%. The stock is in very good shape with handling wear no cracks or chips...and never sanded or refinished. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is sharp and bright. A nice example of a very hard to find South American contract Mauser rifle.Safety is marked ""56"", bolt shroud ""56"", bolt ""3359"" and receiver ""30988"". If you need more pictures of how the rifle looks just ask. $900.

I forgot to write down the round count but it was about 125 rounds.  Let's round up to 400 rounds total so it isn't misrepresented. It will come with 2 Kimber 8 round magazines. It also has the Crimson Trace grips with an on/off switch and pressure pad activator for the laser.  In addition, it has night sights as well.  The picture was just taken and shows the current condition.

I am selling because I have my eye on something I would like to have as a carry weapon.

For those that have to haggle, the price is $1300...........oh alright you talked me down to $1200 which is my final firm price.  I will not respond to lowball offers.

The rifle appears to have been arsenal refurbished at some point judging by the mixed proof marks.  While the wood has definitely seen better days, the metal is still in great shape, with strong rifling, an undamaged crown, and tight action.  Of particular interest is that the receiver appears to be a pre-war model manufactured in Czechoslovakia at BRNO.  The action is, as Mausers are known for, buttery smooth.  This rifle will do 1.5 MOA at 100 yards with Prvi Partizan 8mm all day long and I have no reason to think it wouldn't do so at longer ranges.

Included with this rifle is a Nikon Prostaff scope with BDC reticle.  It is a 3-9 power scope with a 40mm objective lens.  It is a very crisp and clear scope in nearly new condition.  I'm even including the box the scope came in if you want it.

The scope is mounted with an S&K no-drill mount.  This is a very secure mount that reliably holds zero without having to drill into the receiver, a very nice feature on guns like the Kar98k that have very hard steel used in their receivers.  It does necessitate a small amount of inletting on the stock, however.

Lastly, this offer includes a supply of ammo and reloading components to get you going.  40 rounds of Prvi Partizan 8x57, 25 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 8x57, 100 ct Sierra Pro-Hunter 150 gr spitzer .323 bullets, a set of Lee carbide reloading dies for 8mm Mauser, and 95 cartridge cases ready to reload.  Note, pictured but not included are 3 green reusable ammo cases.

You get all of this for $500.  That's $400 for the rifle, $100 for the scope, and the mount, ammo, and reloading supplies are free.

It has a very small blemish in the barrel and small scuffs on the front sight.
The lever has two small patches of pitting that can easily be touched up.

The stock is good but could use a good sanding and a refinish to bring to perfection.
Overall this rifle should grade 8-10. Not to bad for a 30 year old rifle. Round count is unknown but judging by the internal condition and lack of scuffing on moving parts, I am guessing only around 50 down the tube. I have shot it only once and put 16 rounds through it.
This is one of my favorite rifles of all time.... but times are such that I have to
thin the herd.......
Some factory and some reloaded ammo available as well as used and new brass for purchase if you buy the rifle.

It has a small amount of water damage at the buttplate, but it extends barely an inch into the wood.  Under the buttplate can be found the traditional name and contact information for the soldier to whom it was issued.  It must have served him well, for it had earned itself a name at some point in its life: Miss Liddy.  This is a 1 MOA gun.  Yes, with irons.  It is a beautiful bit of workmanship with a crisp 2 stage, 3 lb trigger.

You also get 40 rounds of 7.5x55 Swiss Prvi Partizan.  This is reloadable ammunition and also very accurate in this rifle.  Lastly, you get two of the proper waxed cardboard stripper clips.  These are hard to find due to their material, but this pair is still in very good condition.

516,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2033516,For Sale:  Mernickle Cowboy Action Belt and Holsters - NEW - SASS - Real Nice!,"Rio Rancho, Albuquerque, New Mexico",$ 325,"Listed On: Friday, January 24, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here's a nice NEW Mernickle Cowboy Action double gun rig... or...

 There's the 42"" hand-tooled saddle tan belt, it's double thick, about 1/4' thick, with 7 adjustment holes - has 6 (six) bullet loops. It's my understanding from the Mernickle website you measure 1 1/2 to 2"" below where your pants belt sits and that's a good measurement for wearing the gun belt on the hip. the holster that can go with it is either of the two in the next paragraph. This belt plus one holster goes for $260 on Mernickleholsters.com plus shipping, so it's $225 firm from me. And with the additional holster originally priced at $120, then this double gun holster + belt rig goes for a total of $380 plus shipping online - if you want the double holster it's $325 from me.

 As to the holsters - they are Brand NEW Mernickle Cowboy Action hand tooled, saddle tan to match the belt, doubl- thick holsters, one is for 6 1/2"" barrel (or shorter) 357/38 Ruger Single Action (Blackhawk, Vaquero, etc) and the other is for the 5 1/2"" (or shorter) 357/38 Ruger Single Action (Blackhawk, Vaquero, etc). I believe they'll fit other western style pistols, so we'd have to give them a try for your particular setup. So if both holsters don't go with the rig as above, the one that's left is $100.

 And finally, there is a NEW 6-round 357/38 ""carrier"", it has screws & backing nuts that make it clasp around and fit securely to the belt, without scraping up the belt or cutting thru it. These go for $45 plus $8 shipping, looking for $30.
 I'm wearing out on the description stuff, so call if you have questions, Jeff at 917-4416 in Rio Rancho; I have more pictures, if needed; and the guns are shown for illustration purposes only, they are not part of the deal. Trades possible.... whaddya have?"

It is well worth the asking price and will not be lowered anymore. :) This is a Winchester 1300 Stainless Marine in near mint condition. (I would say probably 98 or 99%) It features a gorgeous bright stainless finish. It has only been shot 4 times and cleaned and been in my safe ever since. These are very rare since they stopped making them and have become highly collectible. They make great home defense guns as well. The 1300 features the smooth ""fast action"" pump action. Since it has become a safe queen and I never shoot it I have decided to sell it. This is NOT an inflated price at all.. if you look these up on the gun sites on the net you can see them anywhere from 1400 to 1800 and above. The sling is included with this shotgun but unfortunately over the years I have misplaced the original box. I may be open to a partial trade, depends on what you have. This gun is a gem if you are a collector or just want an awesome weapon for home defense! I would prefer a face to face transaction but may consider shipping, Thanks for looking and message me if you have questions.. God Bless"

Detailed Product Overview:

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

They are each 5' barrels and are in good shape, but were replaced by Wilson Combat match barrels. The markings are different for each as well. 

Barrel 1) Marked Colt .45 auto on top w/ 7791193 underneath. Has S&W on the right of lug, M P on left lug, and P in front of the lug. This barrel is parkarized w/ crome lining. This barrel will have a stainless Wilson Combat bushing. From my understanding this means this barrel was made by S&W for a military contract as replacement barrels. 

Barrel 2) Marked Colt .45 auto just above the left lug, a P on the left lug, and a G in front of the lug with a small F above it.

Barrel 3) Marked Colt .45 auto on the top of the barrel. The only other marking on this barrel is a small box w/ a C in it on the left lug.

Vintage, KLIPSCH KG-4 Floor Standing Stereo Speakers

Vintage Klipsch KG-4 Stereo Speakers with Oak Finished Cabinets. The Klipsch KG4 speaker system provides 100 watts of continuous power per channel; each speaker has a maximum power of 500 watts. The speakers have a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, lower than the 8 ohms standard on most speaker systems; this means that these speakers may draw more power from their source and put out more wattage per signal. It is recommended that you check the compatibility of your stereo device with a 6-ohm impedance speaker. The Klipsch KG4 speakers have a frequency range of 38-20,000 Hz, offering close to the full range of human hearing. The Klipsch KG4 speakers are each fitted with a tweeter and two woofer diaphragms set in a medium-density fiberboard enclosure. The woofers are each 8 inches and the tweeter is 1 inch. The speakers have a two-way design, meaning that input signals are split so that the low frequencies are routed through the woofer while the high frequencies are routed through the tweeter. This ensures that the sound will provide as close to a full and equal range as possible. Read more: http://www.ehow.com/info_8211458_klipsch-kg4-specs.html#ixzz2ZRRzovWn

Manufacturer: Glock

Generation:     3
Caliber: 	    9mm Luger 
Barrel Length: 3 inch
Capacity: 	    10 + 1

Often referred to as the ""Pocket Glock"" or ""Baby Glock,"" the Glock 26 debuted in 1995 as the perfect concealed carry pistol. Only about six and half inches long and four inches tall, the Glock 26 is simple and lightweight in a conceal carry holster. Backed by the quality and history of excellence carried by Glock, the Glock 26 remains a popular subcompact semi-automatic pistol nearly 20 years after its debut and is primarily used by civilians interested in concealed carry.

The Glock 26's size only allows for a two-finger pistol grip but its double-stacked magazine still carries ten rounds of 9mm ammunition. Not just a smaller version of its predecessors, the Glock 26 was created through an extensive redesign of the frame, spring assembly and locking block. Featuring no less than three independent safety systems, the Glock line utilizes two internal, automatic safeties as well as an external integrated trigger safety. The internal mechanisms are comprised of both a drop safety and a firing pin safety. Once the trigger is squeezed, the three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other. When the trigger is released, they automatically reactivate."

ONLY ONE is for sale/trade. I am keeping the other one for my Ruger 10/22 which eats this stuff like candy. This ammo is terrific for semi-auto rifles and pistols. It's 40 grain bullet and clean burning powder cycle them great without gumming up the action. 
 However, I do most of my shooting with a pair of bolt action 22s that actually prefer the cheaper 36 grain copper plated Federal Champion and Remington Golden bullets.
 I'll sell the whole case for $400.00, which is FAR CHEAPER than the .19 and .25 cents per round I just saw this stuff listed for from multiple internet retailers, who also charge shipping and handling further raising the price. They also limit the number of boxes you can buy. Incidentally, these were well known retailers and not entities that just popped up for the short term.
 I prefer not to sell it, but would rather trade it for Federal Champion 36 grain copper plated 22LR, or I'd even consider trading for Remington Golden Bullets 22LR. That way I won't have to spend the next 6-8 months trying to replace it.
 If you want a good 22LR cartridge that will cycle your semi-auto properly without gumming it up, this is it! Make a trade or buy it outright. (trades preferred)
 Trades would be: one box of FEDERAL AUTO MATCH for one box Federal Champion in either the 525 blue or 550 red box. Or, one box of auto match for one 525 round box of Remington Golden bullets 22LR."
