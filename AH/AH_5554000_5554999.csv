For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  Please note: This model has a Flat Dark Earth Frame. NOTE: This is the VP9 LE model, and comes with THREE 15-round mags and Tritium 3-dot night sights. In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $669.

Only want to trade for a Glock 43. My 26 has Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights (the rear sight is orange and the front sight is green), also comes with 4 magazines; one has a Glock +2 extension, one has a Pearce +2, one has a Pearce pinky extension, and the last mag is a flush fit magazine. The 26 has a Wolff self defense spring kit in it, so the trigger pull is about 3 - 3.5LB, also included is the factory springs. And the 4 different size back straps are also included. I have the original box and papers as well. Would like to trade for a Glock 43 that has at least night sights already installed on it."

And,  as so many were, this pistol was built on a commercial frame. ( I don't know who made this frame as it only appears to have a National Match serial number.) Commercial frames were used so the pistol actually belonged to the shooter, and not to the Government. It could go with the shooter to his next duty station. This pistol was ( I believe ) built for HARDBALL pistol matches. Also called Service Pistol Matches. I would have a > 4lb trigger. It is marked AF on the right leg of the barrel, so it was likely an Air Force unit pistol. The frame to slide fit is very tight and the bushing requires a bushing wrench to be removed. This pistol was made to "" hit what you are aimong at "". Notice the polished pins on the right side of the pistol....that's about as fancy as they made them...  Parkerized finish shows a little thinning on the front strap."
