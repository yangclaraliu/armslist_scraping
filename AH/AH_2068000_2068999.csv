Have 100 rounds up for sale/trade.  Yes, a magnet will stick to the bullet.  Would like to sell all rather than splitting up.  All of these came out of the same lot 1440 round wooden crate.  Now....maybe some of you are tired of seeing high asking prices for current production ammo which is somewhat hard to find.  Thing is, this ammo can't be found at any price anywhere now.  No longer imported since 1994.  If you feel like you need to school me on it, then feel free to do so through the listing.  These sometimes went for $20 per box ($1 per round) at auction late as 2010, and once in a while as low as $12 per box when there was still a small but disappearing supply.    In all seriousness, I'm not a collector.  I shoot my ammo......so...........  Shipping within Arkansas via UPS considered depending on terms and actual cost.  Please be serious before contacting me about this.  Do your research on the internet first (since you're already there anyway).  Cash price is straight up for local.  I don't play the make offer games some do.  This is not an auction site like gunbroker and such, and I'm no ammo gouger.   I just know what I have that somebody might want for their own good reasons, and I'm up for trades.  If you're still wet behind the ears, and you weren't around when an SKS cost you $69.95 at a gun show, then I figure this is not your cup of tea.  Current production ammo is your best bet, so keep buying that and having fun.  This ammo is for the scrupulous folks, the collector, and maybe the hardcore survivalist.  Steel core ammo in 30 caliber."

Here is the reply one unsatisfied customer got.

""Dear Mr Kelly Edwards,

I have received the following response from our Quality Systems Manager, following your email:

The Practice product you are referring to is an unusual product, it is not featured in the new product range and marketing materials because it is a very low quality cartridge which we don’t aim to manufacture. Every cartridge manufactured by ELEY is graded and the quality specification decides whether its Tenex grade, Match, Club and so on. Practice cartridges is a byproduct – basically cartridges which do not make even our lowest grade become Practice. With increasing production technology and quality control, we don’t produce high volumes of Practice – hence we don’t market it. On the occasion where we do have some practice this is sold to distributors as a special offer.

3106-30252

Looking back through our Quality records, the lot was originally proofed as Target 17 in 2006. It appears to have been downgraded to our cheapest and lowest quality product (Practice) at packing.

The performance of this low graded product can be erratic but safe. The projectiles that fail to reach the target appear to do so because they have insufficient energy. Such performance is often seen (this comment really bothers me)with Practice and can be the reason for being graded Practice. Our recommendation would be to try our Target or Club grade ammo as there are better options for target practice.

Kind Regards

Kate White

And if you bought the parts locally you would have sales tax on top of that. If ordered online there would be shipping.

KelTec p11, in good shape, belt clip installed, one 10 round mec gar magazine.

Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where smith and wesson manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available, and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

I bought this used at the beginning of the year and haven't shot it. 
Prior owner told me it had 22rds through it. He said its hard to initially break the fired brass free once fired. I've seen several complaints about this online so it seems to be a common issue with them not a defect in the upper. I haven't shot it to say if he was weak or if its truly a bear to break them free. 

I will include 18rds of American Eagle ammo with it the original owner gave me with it. Along with bipod and hammer Bohica recommended for the uppers.

- Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UP7 Motherboard in pristine condition (having used the ROG Z77 boards, and despite preferring the Asus BIOS, this is without a doubt THE Ivy Bridge motherboard to have if you want to do serious overclocking; chances are that you will exhaust your skills before the board even starts to sweat, I know I did!)
- 1 OR 2 2x4GB Kits of G.Skill Trident X DDR3-2400 9-11-11-31 memory (without question one of my absolute favorite memory kits for benching, but these are so new that they've only ever run at their XMP settings, although both can do so at ~1.605v or so; also, all four DIMM's are double-sided HYK0 as best I can tell, they're 100% certainly double-sided but I haven't taken the heatsinks off to check markings on IC's; these are MINT!)
- 1x MSI GeForce GTX 680 Lightning with fully unlocked voltage control and power limit (that's right, truly unlocked voltage! it came from MSI with a slightly different LN2 BIOS than what I'm used to, but it works better, feels more refined)
- 1x Samsung 840Pro 128GB Solid State Drive used as OS drive (still at full health, minimal amounts of writes to it since it was put into service, and benches exactly what it should)
- LG Blu-Ray Burner (can't remember the model number, but at the time of purchase it was the top model available...6 months ago)
- OCZ Z-Series 1000W 80+Gold Modular Power Supply (all voltages are well within limits, stability is good, it's a solid workhorse of a unit and still sells for $180 or more new! I have all modular cables)
- Bluetooth/WiFi mPCI-e Card (can't remember the brand/model off the top of my head, but it was the nicest one I could find locally; excellent range!)

- NZXT Switch 810 (Gunmetal, has the ""upgraded"" top to allow 3x140 rads without drilling; condition of the case is maybe 7-7.5/10)
- 3x Cougar 120/140mm PWM Case Fans (2x Front Intake, 1x Rear fan; radiator fans are listed separately, below)
- NZXT Individually-Sleeved Black Extensions for PCIe Power, 24pin ATX power, and 4pin/8pin EPS Power
- DemciFlex Dust Filters to replace the ""meh"" stock ones both up front for the 2x front intake fans and up top for the three ""outside"" top-rad fans
- Have a G.Skill Trident X RAM Fan if it's wanted, came with the memory (I don't use it because, well, 1: it doesn't need it, and 2: the LED's don't match at all)
- Scythe Kama Bay Fan Controller with 6 Channels and LCD Temperature and RPM Readout (has been extremely reliable, doesn't even get hot when under long periods of loading)

*Have a large collection of other fans, including some Noctua, Cooler Master, NZXT (painted orange), and a bunch of others that could be switched for some of the Cougar fans, although I would have to charge a bit more for some like the Noctua which have never been used and are literally more than 2x the price of the Cougars
**NOTE: Because of the amount of personal and important data on them; however, if not having a mechanical drive is truly a deal killer, I could always toss in a 2-3yr old 320GB WD Blue or HGST Deskstar for a few bucks??


WATER COOLING COMPONENTS
- XSPC Raystorm CPU Block with original sleeved LED's
*OPTIONAL: Can substitute a BNIB XSPC Raystorm Full-Copper Edition for extra
- XSPC Aluminum Hold-Down Plate for the Raystorm (turns the block from ""okay"" to ""incredibly good"", too bad it's not included and they charge so much for them)
- Aquacomputer G680Ltg AquagraFX Full-Coverage LIMITED EDITION GPU Block (literally the LAST ONE sold by Aquatuning; I am 150% impressed with it, in fact it is so nice and well made/effective that I am considering going with AC Kryographics ""window"" blocks next time I change cards, ""breaking"" my long running Heatkiller loyalty!)
- Koolance RP-401X2 Single 5.25"" Reservoir for 2x DDC pumps (practically brand new condition, and one of the best-made reservoirs I've ever seen)
- Bitspower Multi-Z Tank 250 with POM End-Caps
- 1 OR 2x Swiftech MCP35X pumps installed in the Koolance res (I would like to see a price for it with one or with both; one is 6mo old, the other is brand new; both work extremely well)
- Swiftech dual PWM Wire for MCP35X2 style use
- 1x BRAND NEW/NEVER USED Noise-Blocker 80x15mm Fan with all accessories (bought to use on pump heatsink, but as the MCP35X2-Heatsink doesn't work when using the Koolance res, and because there is quite a bit of airflow already keeping the pumps below 40C, it's never been needed; far and away the nicest/best and quietest fan you can get for direct pump cooling!!! I've used them all, and these are well worth the $20+)
- XSPC EX360 Radiator in the top with the exterior, not the fins, painted orange to match the board (excellent slim radiators, if not fighting for top place in its weight class wink.gif )
- 6x Cougar 120mm Fans in Push-Pull (fans are all less than 3 months old)
- Alphacool UT60 240 Radiator (current king of the 60mm-thick or less radiators, less than a month and a half old)
- 4x Cougar 120mm Fans in Push-Pull (fans are slightly newer than the radiator)
- Bitspower Rotary Angled Fittings, Extensions, Couplers, and 1/2x3/4 Compression Fittings (a very kind, awesome, amazing friend gave me a handful of his fittings as I was short biggrin.gif )
- Monsoon 1/2x3/4 Compression Fittings in matching matte black (again, very kind friend!)
- Misc other fittings (all said and done, at least $250 in fittings due to some tricky turns)


There is a bunch I KNOW that I am forgetting (sorry, I took a bad spill the other day and cracked a few ribs, broke + cracked + bruised the cartilage connecting my ribs to my sternum, and got a ""6 out of 10"" concussion; been having some nominaphasia and other memory difficulties aside from the pretty awful pain; at least I now have a sweet 2"" scar an inch below my hairline on the right side of my forehead... not.... :/ ).


Just to reiterate, this is less than 9 months old, has never seen sub-zero cooling or anything like that, and many of the parts are only a month or two old. This is pretty much as nice as you can go with Z77 and a single GPU setup, in terms of components, and while I'd love to keep it, I know that it just won't get used like it deserves... Therefore, I think it's time to let it go to a better home.

I am looking for assault type rifles and higher end handguns.
I do posses ccw and dl and would be willing to do a receipt if needed

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one. CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

DPMS Panther Oracle. Chrome moly 5.56 barrel with M4 feed ramps/chrome lined. Forged upper and lower receiver. Carbine length gas system with low pro YHM gas block. 13"" free float Troy TRX Extreme Battle rail. Magpul AFG, BUIS, grip, ASAP plate, BAD lever, and CTR stock. Streamlight Polytach flashlight with offset mount. Single point bungee sling made by Tuff. 5 PMags and pretty heavy duty rifle bag. Less than 100 rds through the gun. I haven't had the chance to shoot since installation of the Troy rail so the rifle needs to be zero'd. Other than that its good to go. Ill throw in 100rds of PMC .223. All this set up needs is a shooter. I am the original owner of this rifle. 

I love this rifle, but I have two. I need a car with better gas mileage to commute to school and work more than I need two AR15's. As far as cash goes, the market is absolutely flooded with AR15's so I understand its a buyers market for the time being. That being said, I will entertain cash offers above $1200. I bought pre-panic and still have more than that invested. I am not making a dime. Thanks for looking and please email with any questions or offers.

I have a year old Hornady LNL AP, Great condition. Everything needed to reload, just add DIES and a SHELL PLATE and you are good to go. I've loaded 3,000 9mm on this guy. Hornady has a great policy on parks breakage, anything I've ever needed from them they sent me for free (springs, etc)
This press has performed flawlessly. I have 3 of these presses, one for each of my favorite calibers. Instructional videos are available on Hornady's Youtube page.

It comes with one 13 round magazine and was worked flawlessly.  I am selling to sell to get an h&K usc 40 a friend is selling so i am not very interested in trades at this time. Below is the definition of the variant model and the description of the pistol from HK's site.

Variant 2:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on right side of frame.

USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device"
