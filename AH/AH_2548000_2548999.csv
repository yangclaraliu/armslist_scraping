If you put a little time and effort into your search, you could find these for under 10 cents a round!

This is a Generation I scope, but is much better performing than the commonly available commercial grade models. Civilian market Generation I commercial scopes use a single Image Intensifier Tube (IIT) , amplifying the light and providing an image to the user. This scope however, was designed for military application, and uses three IIT's in a cascading layout, running the light from one tube to the next, further enhancing the image and giving a much better picture. Image quality from this scope can be compared to commercial Gen II, which usually run in the $2000 range.

The Z-51 was developed around 1976 by renowned optics maker Carl Zeiss AG, designed for use by the German Army (Bundeswehr) during the Cold War. The scope features a large objective diameter lens, adjustable magnification, flash protection from bursts of light, and a rugged build quality designed to thrive in a battlefield environment. This is an incredibly well designed scope, and has much better glass than its Soviet counterparts, like the 1PN34, giving a superior image with very little fish-eye and a clearer picture. The rubberized protective cap on the objective lens is intact, and removable. The removable eyepiece is also rubberized and attached to the scope with a steel string, and features two small shutters that open when the user looks through it, preventing light from escaping and revealing the user.

The scope is carried in an original Bundeswehr heavy-duty waterproof fiberglass case, with serial numbers and labeling stamped on each side. Inside the case are the mounts used to attach the scope to a variety of weapons, a sight adjustment tool, Allen wrenches, cleaning cloth, plastic sleeves, 4 brand new C-Cell batteries, and the 4 original batteries than came with the kit. All of the claw mounts are solid metal machined by Heckler & Koch, and still retain most of their finish, with no rust present. The carrying case has two latches, one of which is damaged, but the case still provides a strong seal against the elements.

The scope can be attached to any Picatinny rail on a firearm, but make sure you have high enough clearance for the objective lens to clear the receiver.

These arrived in the United States a few years ago and were being sold online from $750 and up per kit, and were sold out within days of arrival. This is a rare piece to find in a complete and functioning condition. This is an excellent value as both a collectors item and as a functioning, useable night vision scope."

For those who aren't familiar with these, they were made in the same valley as Beretta in Italy by Tanfoglio, but these pistols were made for the Israeli military under contract and thus have ""MOSSAD"" with two 6 point ""Star of David"" on the slide. This classic pistol is based upon the classic loved CZ-75 design. Frame says ""Made by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.P.A. for ""Weapons House LTD"" - Israel"".  Bore/barrel look good, no pitting and good distinct grooves, 9mm 16 round mag double stack. One mag included. Additional mags are plentiful as they take the same mags as current CZ75, Baby Eagle, Jericho, Springfield p9 and Tanfoglio Witness pistols - this pistol is the same basic design as all of these (CZ75 clones that are still being made today). 

This is neat opportunity to own a very uniquely marked and rich historic pistol used to defend the nation of Israel. Many believe that Israeli Mossad officers originally may used this weapon as their ""home"" carry protection. For those that may not know, the Israeli Mossad is roughly the equivalent of our FBI/CIA. A very rare and potentially valuable addition to many collections.

This gun is absolutely in amazing condition. Wood furniture is like new. The previous owner had the gun professionally refinished. It’s got the tough Moly Resin finish on it right now. Nothing was wrong with the factory finish. Previous owner just wanted a better finish than the factory. Which I totally agree. Moly resin is really hard, durable, long lasting, self-lubricating, and has that always like-new-look finish to it. The gun has enough U.S. made parts for the 922(r) compliance. The pictures does not do the gun justice. This gun looks way better and nicer in person than the pictures. My fault, not really a very good photographer.

 A little background on the Bulgarian SLR-95:

The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world.

Please read up on these if you are not familiar with them.  Below is a little about it, and can be confirmed with a little bit of googling...

It was built in Turkey by MKE on HK tooling and licensed through HK. Everything is to HK specs, closet clone to an HK SP-89 as you can get.  Everything is fully swappable with an HK SP-89. (A gentleman at OCGA swapped everything out to show me.) They made 2 runs into the country and on the 3rd, MKE wanted to raise their prices, and so ATI quit importing them.

I posted a video on youtube.com so that potential buyer may see it in action.  Unfortunately my phone was low on memory so it’s quite a short clip.  (It shows about 7 shots being fired)

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical Pistol. This is a world-class .40 S&W Pistol, with night sights, black polycoat, and featuring a 12-round mag. 

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell for only $689.00 (cash price). 

CZ 91157 75 SP-01 Tactical .40 S&W Pistol, Full Size, SA/DA, Black Polycoat, Night Sights, 12-Round Mags 

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. 

Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions. 

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the fi eld of sport and target shooting. 

Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Glock 22, .40 SW, Gen 3 with the RTF2 frame. In excellent condition, less than 1000 rounds through it. Always cleaned after firing, never over-oiled. The rough textured frame is really nice. Comes with the standard Glock carrying case. I don't want to sell these items separate, so don't ask for just the case.

9mm Lone Wolf conversion barrel. Converts the Glock from .40 SW to .9mm. Like-new condition, less than 500 rounds through it. I notice no difference in accuracy between this barrel and the standard Glock barrel. 

Two 15 round .40 SW, one 17 round 9mm, and one 31 round 9mm magazine. The 31 round is not Glock made. The other three are made by Glock.

One inside the waist band holster (IWB). Unsure of manufacturer, but it is some place located near Bellingham, WA if I am not mistaken. Sits on the right hip. Genuine leather, it has always been comfortable for me, and the Glock fits very nicely in it. Some blemishes on the leather, but it is a concealed carry holster so no one will ever see it anyways!

I am also selling Crimson Trace lasergrips that fit this Glock. The listing can be found here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/2548429/seattle-washington-tactical-gear-for-sale--crimson-trace-lasergrips-lg-617--fits-glock-17--17l--22--24--31--34--35--37--20sf--21sf

These rifles are externally almost identical to the M1917 ""Enfield"", and were produced for Britian during the First World War prior to 1917. When we entered the war the factories were retooled to .30-60, resulting in the M1917. This particular rifle has matching numbers, but is missing both arms of the long range volley sight. Unless you're firing at over 1,600 yards (1 mile) this shouldn't be an issue, it was probably done by the British Army. Bluing is worn and the stock has the usual service rifle dings, but rifle has matching numbers and is covered in British proofmarks, barrel is very clean and crisp. No import marks. Overall an excellent example of a very hard to find WWI era rifle.

The Sig Sauer P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP
and featuring a fixed barrel blow back action, the P232 is one of the most
reliable back-up pistols available. It has a well-earned reputation as a
rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth
contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal
protection. It's the pistol's small size that makes it easy to carry
concealed, whether in a discreet holster, purse, or on the ankle, and yet
the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable
shooting, even in large hands. At under 19 oz in the blued version, the
sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No
wonder it's one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and
law enforcement professionals today.

History of Rock Island Amory

Rock Island Armory, the leading M1911 manufacturer and developer, was acquired by Armscor Precision International in 1985. Armscor traces its roots back as far as 1905 to a small trading post in the Philippines but it wasn't until 1980 after the formerly Squires Bingham Manufacturing, was reorganized and renamed ""Arms Corporation of the Philippines.""

A third generation family company, Armscor is becoming a global force – now exporting to over 50 countries on 6 continents. Rock Island Armory is now the sole producer of Armscor firearms.

Rock Island Armory 1911

The Rock Island Amory (RIA) 1911 series consists of single-action recoil operated Semi-Automatic Pistols manufactured in the Philippines. The RIA 1911 is a clone of the US Military G.I. 1911-A1, the standard issue pistol from 1911 to 1985. With a smaller price tag, Rock Island Armory 1911s are an entry-level gun for the 1911 model; however the Tactical, Compact and Match models offer some additional high-end features like enhanced combat sights, ambidextrous safety, and target-grade hammer and trigger."
