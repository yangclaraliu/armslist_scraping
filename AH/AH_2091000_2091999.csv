This is a LeFever Nitro Special that got crossed with a Western Field special order at the Ithaca factory. It has WESTERN FIELD DELUXE & MONTGOMERY WARDS & CO. on the barrels. It has two of the few options available with the Western Field guns: dual bead sights and a soft rubber butt pad. The only other option was the ejector that came later.

Now, here’s where the anomalies come in. None of the Western Field guns frames were case hardened, this one was. There are traces of case hardening color under the front of the trigger guard, and on the top tang. The Western Field guns had a setter at point stamped into the frame sides. This one has the LeFever Nitro Special Duck in the Swamp scene. It has serial numbers matching on the frame, for end and barrels that are consistent with a LeFever Nitro Special made in 1929. The serial numbers are not even in the Western Field range. The Western Field guns stocks were not checkered and were not normally good Walnut, the stocks on this gun are checkered and have a bit of natural tiger striping in the walnut.

This is a VERY unusual gun. It’s in an unadulterated form and in perfect functioning condition.

The bores are pristine. Both of the sighting beads have been broken. Bluing on the barrels is excellent with a very few minor surface scratches. The Duck in the Swamp scenes are light, but distinguishable. They aren’t worn, just lightly stamped. The frame is dark, but there is no indication that it has been blued.

The barrels are 12 Ga., 30” choked full and modified.

Here’s your opportunity to own a true Ithaca special order and mistake gun…

Price is $425.00 cash picked up in Midtown Houston. I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I can send more photos if you are seriously interested.

It will fit an M1A (I actually dry fit it fine on mine).  It is Vietnam war era with handle and side cartouche marks.  The stock has all the metal including front ferrule, front swivel, plates inside action and full rear folding plate.  Also comes with aluminum brown hand guard.
This was a service stock with service wear.  As such there are some dents dings and scratches that you would expect.  There are two ""fingernail"" scratches on the stock that could be sanded out on the forearm, but there are no cracks in the stock.  This is a perfect candidate for refinishing if you so chose.  Work I have done includes removing butt plate then steaming it to remove cosmoline.  It was then wiped down with mineral spirits and washed it with Murphy's oil soap. Lastly the stock was hand rubbed with 100% Tung oil and the butt plate was wiped with Rem-oil and re-installed. I did not remove the tape where the armorer had indicated windage and elevation for the rifle when in service.  I feel strongly that I did not want to sand or strip all the layers of age,oil and dents off the stock as they give it character and are actual signs of it's history.  If fully stripped and sanded the stock would be much lighter in color.

Ruger's Manufacturer Description and Specs:Weighing just 9.4 oz (266.5 g) this is Ruger's first entry into the field of tiny, ultra-light defensive pistols.[3] LCP stands for ""Lightweight Compact Pistol"" and was designed in direct response to customer requests for a compact firearm for use by police as a back-up, and as a defensive handgun for civilian concealed carry needs.[4]

The pistol has a glass-filled nylon frame, a two-finger grip, and a through-hardened blued steel slide. It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop."

I am negotiable on price.I bought this gun brand new back in January for $379 through a gun store here in Colorado. This small, concealable, lightweight firearm is what you need for comfort while carrying. It takes standard .380 caliber rounds, which I can & will throw in when you purchase it. For safety it has a long trigger pull and this firearm has many other options for holsters and red-dot sighting. ******For fast response Text any inquiries to:REDACTED

Ruger's Manufacturer Description and Specs:Weighing just 9.4 oz (266.5 g) this is Ruger's first entry into the field of tiny, ultra-light defensive pistols.[3] LCP stands for ""Lightweight Compact Pistol"" and was designed in direct response to customer requests for a compact firearm for use by police as a back-up, and as a defensive handgun for civilian concealed carry needs.[4]

The pistol has a glass-filled nylon frame, a two-finger grip, and a through-hardened blued steel slide. It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop."

Comes with the XD(M) Gear Package  3.8"" match-grade barrelRugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finishUltra Safety Assurance Trigger SystemThe easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

60 Glenfield made in 1969 complete with the original 4x Glenfield scope that came with it when it was new.  Still very functional, clear & accurate.  It's the model with the squirrels on the grip.  $325

I only want to sell one of these, but would trade for either for a few Pmags & .223 ammo.  No GI or steel or other mags wanted.  Will only trade for current priced mags/ammo, not gouger rates.  Ammo is available & so are Pmags at a little over the pre-scare prices.  I would also consider a trade for both that involved a 60s-70s model Ruger 10/22 with no modifications.  I would also sell them combined for $850 without the Redfield scope.  REDACTED  Call or text.  Thanks"

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A.  3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B.  Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C.  Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a
Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment
of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D.  Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has
an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E.  Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the
sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.



The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing
the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions.

Beretta PX4 Storm Full Size

Low barrel axis position

Thanks to the design of the direct barrel-slide locking system, the low barrel axis reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise.

Newly designed slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in moist conditions.

3-Dot Sight System

Features a white '3-dot' sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

Simple Field Stripping

Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

External Hammer Design

A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

Ambidextrous Safety (Type F)

The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it's either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol's decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever.) Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block

The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the bloack is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer

No Glare Finish

Beretta's exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish

Slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions

Accessory Rail

The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapic attachment of tacitcal lights and laser aiming devices

Reversible Magazine Release

Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual's hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use

Individual Size Grips

Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large back-straps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

Magazine

High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).

(M)odel Contour Frame The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XDM, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. (M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. (M)ega-Lock Texture The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XDM isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. (M)elonite Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XDM is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. (M)atch Grade Barrel Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDM match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. (M)inimal Reset Trigger The new XDM trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The Standards In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that…. Loaded Chamber Indicator The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. Striker Status Indicator The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. Grip Safety Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. USA Trigger System™ The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

This is a Smith &Wesson M&P compact in .40 cal. Absolutely fantastic gun. I have this exact gun in 9mm and love it. I find myself shooting the 9 more than the .40, so the .40 has to go. This gun has been meticulously maintained. It has been to 4 range sessions and has been cleaning and lubed after each session. Less than 150 rounds have been put through it. 

The M&Pc comes with box, docs, S&W lock, 3 standard magazines (1 w/ flat base, 2 w/ pinkie extension) and 2 extended magazines w/ X-grips.  These M&P magazines are extremely hard to get. The M&P also comes with Trjicon night sights. That is over $250 in extras alone.

The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.  The patented BOSS® device available on certain models of the BAR MK II Safari model allows your to dial-in barrel harmonics to maximize accuracy with your favorite load.

The seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.  The strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.  The buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.  The bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.

You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.  The Walnut stock on the BAR MK II Safari has cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, and a beautiful deep gloss finish that brings out every nuance of the warm grain of the wood.  The traditional recoil pad on the BAR MK II Safari greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.  Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling. prefer cash but can take plastic"

Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 1911 is a rim-fire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semi-automatic-pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rim-fire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

I can't find the damn camera so all I can offer right now are cell phone pictures.  I'll update the thread with nice pictures as soon as the camera turns up.

There is some bluing wear on the bolt handle, trigger guard and mag base.  It's obvious this rifle was hunted with but I don't think it's left the house in my lifetime.

I considered making this my deer rifle but decided to stick with the 30-30. 

I'm looking mostly for trade offers and value it under 1000 for trading purposes.  I don't HAVE to sell it.  

I'm looking for a quality used AR upper and possibly lower too.  I prefer 14.5 pinned/welded or 16 inch barrels. Something I can strap to the quad and not worry about killing its resale value but not something that will fail to run when I need it. I'll consider a complete rifle or any other AR related parts. Lowers uppers etc. 
I have some interest in .308 or .223 bolt guns.
I could also use another Mossberg 500.
I'd consider an ak-74 depending on what it came with.
I'll consider any offer so don't be afraid of insulting me and if you have something I want worth more or less than this cash can go either way too.

I don't really need anymore handguns unless you want to trade me a Delta Elite and 10,000 rounds of 10mm
