It has the high quality pinned barrel.  It's is in great condition with very low rounds and barely any drag marks on the cylinder. It's history is that it was made around 1977-1981 and was a police trade-in spending most of its time in a holster.  I am the second owner, and have only put 100 rounds through it.  This sturdy quality built revolver can easily handle any Plus P .38 spl rounds you put through it! This is a gun that will last so long, you can hand it down for generations. It shoots like a laser pointer and locks up good.  You won't find another smith and Wesson 10-8 in this condition! Im looking for $475 cash OBO, or open to trade for other revolvers. You can call or text me at (248) 379-649three.  It only let me post one picture, so if you would like more please feel free to ask! *must have CPL  or purchase permit and be willing to trade or buy in a public place."

The story behind this rifle: it was built by one of Czechoslovakia's armories under contract for the Yugoslavian government. The rifles were used throughout the WWII era, then sent to the Yugo arsenal (starting in 1952, hence the 52, and C denotes Czech contract rifle) to be refurbished for use by the civil guard in times of emergency. Typically, upper handguards were replaced, and all received new barrels. This particular rifle came to me still packed with the cosmoline from its refurbishment. This rifle looks brand new, with only a few handling marks. The barrel is new, perfect bore and crown. I detail stripped it and cleaned every bit of cosmoline out of it, including from the wood itself. I fired 40 rounds through this rifle, all non-corrosive Federal blue box ammo. It's a great weapon, with a proud history. I've decided to focus my collection on pistols, and am clearing space in the safe. Fell free to ask questions. Thanks for looking! $300 OBO"

These mausers are the creme of the crop of mausers. They are some of the most accurate milsurps you can own. The trifecta of milsurp are the m39, K31 and the Persian mauser. This one is the carbine version of that rifle made by the Czechs and later the Iranians off of the same tools. Their accuracy and beauty are amazing for the era and still to this day. This rifle is near mint and is absolutely beautiful. It has 98+% of its bluing and all of the farsi, the Shah of Iran's crest are still deeply struck and visible in the rifle. Add this one of a kind rifle to your collection and boast to all your friends because these are not only scarce on the market, but scarce for anything near mint. I will not trade for anything. Period. I will ignore anyone attempting to trade. I will only accept cash. 1500. Not a dime less."

It comes with 4x30rnd pmags, and 3x30 round 22 mags, one 25 round 22 mag, and one 20 round mag for bench shooting. The conversion kit is simple, all you do is slide the stock bolt out and put the conversion in and insert a 22 mag. This is great for cheap practice and also allows you to save money for something bigger and better than one center fire and one 22 semi auto, two birds with one stone. I am interested in 800$ cash or a CZ EVO."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

I do flitz the feed ramp and the breech face after I clean it.  If you know about the Sig p320, you know it has a great trigger and reset, is very accurate- better than the XDM 45 and S&W compact 45 I used to own.  It has been a pleasure to shoot, but I need to sell some pistols to get ready to take my wife on a cruise.  No trade offers, please, cause I won't respond. Buyer must valid NC i.d. and valid pistol purchase permit or cancel carry card. I am the original owner and the pistol has had about 400 rounds thru it."

Has the houge overmold stock and has a couple scuffs which are not bad at all hard to explain with the houge stock on how they look hard to wipe off with the rubber so haven't worried about them. Has a 0 Moa rail. And has 250-300 rounds loaded for it. She's kind of wanting an AR so would trade it for a good AR. would be nice if it had a 1 in scope mount with it. I'm sure I got a set of rings to throw in with the Remington if yours has a mount. Let me know what ya got and I will run it by her and see what she thinks.
