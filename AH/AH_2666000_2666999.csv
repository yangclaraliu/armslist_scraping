If purchasing more than one item I will ship for free.

GEIGERRIG Hydration Engines, often referred to as ""reservoirs"" or ""bladders"", are compatible with most other packs. Spray to cool, clean, share, and drink. Ready for GEIGERRIG plug-n-play, on-the-go, in-line filtration. Reversible and dishwasher safe (top shelf). Really, it should be called a Personal Water System rather than a Hydration System. Why? Because a hydration system has come to be known as a plastic bag with a drink tube that can only be used for hydration for one person. The GEIGERRIG system dramatically expands the uses and access to water. BPA FREE - PTHALATE FREE.


Features
1. The Engine: Slide Top, Water Tube, Air Tube, Reservoir, and Power Bulb. (Power bulb has a depressurization button, but you can also depressurize by disconnecting the tube from the bulb. Either way works just fine.)
2. Wide Mouth: The Engine has a large, wide-mouth opening for easy refill with water and ice. It also provide convenience for maintenance, cleaning and drying.
3. Slide Top: The Hydrapak Slide Top provides a very strong seal that is leak free and holds back the pressure of the GEIGERRIG system.
4. Quick Release Valves: The quick release valves allow you to easily disconnect the tubes and leave them positioned in the hydration pack while you remove the reservoir for filling and cleaning.
5. Filter Ready: Ready for plug-and-play, on-the-go, in-line water filtration using a GEIGERRIG filter or other in-line filters. The water found along the trail is now available for your use-ON-THE-GO!
6 and 7. Reversible and Dishwasher Safe: Reach down inside through the large wide-mouth opening, grab the port at the bottom of the Engine, and turn the system inside out for placement in the top shelf of the dishwasher or for easy cleaning in your sink.

Barrett
M82A1
29"" Fluted Barrel
w/ BORS

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

After 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down.

For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.

As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1800 with scope or $1600 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion.

Hey.  


I'm selling two of my great hunting rifles and I decided to make a bundle of them.  For $800.00 you get 2 bolt action rifles, some ammo, and their accessories.  The price is FIRM and you would need to pay the (FFL) transfer fees for the 2 rifles.

So 800.00 bucks buys you
1. BRAND NEW Mossberg 4X4 in .30-06
-never fired/kept in a gun safe for about 1 year
-RedHead Epic rifle scope (professionally mounted and bore sighted to 100yds)
-Weaver rings
-40 rounds of Winchester ammo
-Mossy Oak scoped rifle case by Allen
-rifle cleaning brush head
-all manuals and small parts
-everything included with the rifle is brand new

2. Mossberg 817 .17HMR rifle
-BSA Huntsman illuminated 3-9X40 scope with Red/green/blue dot (sighted at 50yds)
-low profile Weaver rings
-Butler Creek scope caps

-Krylon coated
-comes with entire cleaning kit

I am the original owner for both rifles and they are in pristine working condition.  The price is firm and i am in no hurry to sell them.  The reason why i am selling them is that i primarily hunt with my shotgun and am not using both of these rifles.  Let me know if youd like to see more pics of the rifles.  I am willing to drive an hour ( 1 ) tops from my location inbetween Aptos and Watsonville CA. 

I would be willing to consider trades.  Im looking for new or very lightly used AR uppers, preferrably not in a standard 223/5.56 platform.  Also id be willing to take new Magpul gear, glock 19 stuff, and perhaps ammo in 9mm or 223/5.56.

A300 OUTLANDER

The key to superior performance in semiautomatic shotguns is simplicity.

In keeping with the Beretta tradition, the new A300 Outlander is a soft-shooting gas-operated system semi-auto which combines the reliable Beretta bolt with falling block (locked breech) with an improved gas valve with a self-cleaning cylinder and piston, so that excess pressure caused by the most powerful cartridges can be decreased automatically.

TOTAL DESIGN

The rugged A300 outlander it is elegant, yet efficient. Sleek yet strong. With slim, graceful lines that leave an indelible impression at first sight.

The receiver: Completely and precisely machined from a solid block of special light alloy aluminium, it has moveable parts in steel, and high quality light alloys, assembled with particular care, checked and polished to ensure exceptional operation. All metal parts are protected by special finishes against wear, and tear and rusting. The ergonomically rounded back of the light alloy receiver fits smoothly into the stock, enabling rapid and instinctive target acquisition. The top of the receiver is designed to accept (with an optional base) optics and other aiming system. Constructed using a special aluminium alloy, the A300 Outlander receiver has undergone an anodic oxidation process that protects the firearm from rusting and scratching. The safety button can be reversed for left-handed shooters.

The trigger guard is made of heavy duty polymer. Its new semi-square shape makes finger positioning easier. The rounded shape and absence of sharp corners have been designed for more rapid, more secure trigger grip. The use of a technopolymer ensures that the colour will remain in the parts traditionally subject to rubbing while at the same time enhancing sensitivity of touch in cold climates. The opening of the trigger guard is bigger so the trigger is accessible even to a gloved hand. The chromed carrier and bolt withstand rust and wear and offer more sturdiness in the execution of their vital function. The safety button, also newly designed, now offers a wider surface for easier operation. For accidental engaging or disengaging, the safety is protected and topped by a protruding edge that also enhances its appearance. The trigger is chrome-plated for ultimate rust protection. Its silver colour sets it apart from the other parts of the shotgun.

The fore-end has long, slender contours that add to the harmony of the A300 Outlander overall design. The cap has a new polymer structure that makes it very lightweight, weather and rust-resistant. In front of the fore-end cap is applied a practical swivel stud. The stock provides superior comfort and a secure grip to ensure the highest performance during firing. Made of fine walnut carefully selected for its design and resistant finish, its grip contour is designed to optimally accommodate the hand of the user with a top ambidextrous finger rest.

REDUCED NUMBER OF COMPONENTS

The Beretta semi-automatic A300 Outlander is characterised by a particularly small number of assemblies. The shotgun is composed of five main assembly groups which can be field stripped by the user, for quick and easy disassembly. A firearm that can be easily taken apart is also easier to clean. Easy cleaning encourages to perform more careful maintenance on the firearm ensuring long-term reliability.

GAS-OPERATED SYSTEM WITH EXHAUST VALVE

The exclusive gas-operated system, patented by Beretta, with a self-cleaning cylinder and piston, has a self-cleaning exhaust valve, so that excess pressure caused by the most powerful cartridges can be decreased automatically: as a result, the shotgun without any adjustment or intervention can shoot cartridges from 70 mm (2 3/4 in) /24 g (7/8 oz), to 76 mm (3 in) /57 g (2 oz). The semi-automatic gas-operated A400 Xplor has also been optimised to ensure lower gas dispersal. As a result, the system has a self-cleaning feature that further minimises maintenance and significantly reduces the stress to which the operating parts are subjected to at higher charges, thereby ensuring the greatest possible service life of the firearm. The new piston has been designed to constantly clean out gunpowder residue in the cylinder, increasing the efficiency of the firearm and reducing the need for maintenance. The elastic piston seal has a rough finish to optimise cleaning. shotgun

ASSEMBLY WARNING

In order to prevent damage to the elastic piston seal, first insert the piston into the chamber cylinder and then insert the magazine tube cap shaft through the piston hole. The valve unit is connected to the barrel, making assembly and disassembly of the barrel itself easier.

MOBILCHOKE® BARREL/MOBILCHOKE TUBES

In alloy steel, made with the exclusive cold hammering process to ensure perfect concentricity, the barrel of the new Beretta semi-automatic A300 Outlander is exceptionally robust and lightweight at the same time. Designed for use with steel shot cartridges, it has a Mobilchoke internal profile. The bore is chrome plated to ensure the longest life and resistance to rust, wear and tear and to increase the shot velocity, while it is deep blued on the exterior. The Beretta Mobilchoke internal choke tubes are designed to reduce shot deformation and to enhance shot pattern distribution and concentration. Made in high performance nickel plated steel, the Beretta Mobilchoke choke tubes ensure the highest protection against rust and resistance to use of steel shot.

DROP AND CAST SPACERS

Between the stock and the receiver is a technopolymer spacer and inside the stock is a stainless steel plate that can be used to change the drop and cast of the stock by simply modifying the assembly configuration. A set of additional spacers is also provided to further change the drop by replacing the spacer pair.

MAGAZINE CAPACITY

The magazine has a two-shot capacity, in line with current hunting regulations in many countries, made possible by the insertion of a reducer. This reducer restricts firearm use to no more than three shots (two in the magazine, and one in the cartridge chamber). This device is fitted by Beretta during manufacture and assembly of the A300 Outlander. In certain specific areas, hunting is only authorised with firearms of not more than two rounds.

TA31RCO-M4CP: Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope with BAC USMC Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) for the M4 and M4A1 (14.5 barrel)

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

RM04: Trijicon RMR Dual-Illuminated Sight – 7.0 MOA Amber Dot

Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM04 is a battery free sight, featuring Trijicon fiber optics and tritium. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. The new Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

""...do not expect to walk into a gun/pawn shop or gun show and think that the proprietor/dealer/collector should pay you the retail price listed within this text for your gun(s). Resale offers on many models could be anywhere from near retail to 20%-50% less than the values listed, depending upon locality, desirability, dealer inventory, and profitability.

Barrett
M99A1
.50BMG

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.
The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 Would meet face to face anywhere between Lynnwood and Arlington Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

I will not respond to email inquiries asking if this is still available (I don't have time to deal with spammers wanting me to buy vacation property or any other fly-by-night propositions).

 I can do weekday daytime transaction around West Chester / Union Centre Blvd area.

 I'm not driving 10-15 minutes to make a delivery. I've already put miles on my vehicle bringing this ammo down to Butler/Warren area from as far west as Richmond, Indiana and as far north as Vandalia (all from former Armslist listings---not retail establishments)

 I do not have a smart phone or mobile internet connection, so initial contacts will be via email until a meet is scheduled.

 I'm dealing with the 1st person who says they will commit to an ""A.S.A.Please"" (Si Robertson, Duck Dynasty) transaction (meaning, I'm not going to hold items without a firm commitment on time and place of completing the transaction)!

 Cash is King... DL proving age and eligibility required. 

 I live in the Turtlecreek Twsp. area near Traders World Flea Market and the new Racino.
 I work 1-mile off I-75 and Union Centre weekdays, and I head north on I-75 between 4:00 and 4:30

 If you have to wait a day or two, this may be gone (I'll put you on my waiting list, but I will not hold ammo for an extended period of time---you want it, come get it... no limit on number of boxes like the stores, who by-the-way do not offer ""layaway"" on ammo)

 After 4:00 weekdays, and weekend hours: The closer I can meet someone near the Monroe (29) and Middletown (32) exits off I-75 the better.

 I won't schedule a late afternoon meet on weekends (unless I'm en route to a destination and we can hook up on the way).

 Thanks for inquiring and understanding ... what I'm offering is:
 (8) Boxes of Remington 22 THUNDERBOLT 40 GRAIN 1255 FPS VELOCITY LEAD ROUND NOZE - 50-ROUNDS/BOX . $40.00 for all EIGHT boxes

It is the black version with 16"" barrel. Has fired around 500 rounds, no malfunctions. Comes in its original box with everything it came with from the factory except the 30 round mag, since that cant be transferred anymore (I will ship it to any address you would like outside of CO, however). It also includes an IWI sling (2/3 point convertible), and a second front handguard with a rail attachment and a Magpul MOE grip attached (you can use the original handguard, or replace it with the railed handguard and attach the grip if you want).

I've had it since July of last year (SN of T00024XX), firing around 500 rounds through it. I was really waiting for the 5.45 conversion kit, but now IWI says they wont be selling it. That made it lose a lot of its appeal for me, and I have other rifles I would rather have. Doesnt make this one a bad rifle at all, it has never had a malfunction, and I have tried everything to get it to. Limp-wristed, 1 handed, upside down, sideways, weak ammo, and all combinations of everything else. It is ultra-reliable.

Will meet at an FFL of your choice anywhere around the Denver area. I know of a few good ones around Parker, Centennial and Denver if you dont have one already. I will split the transfer cost with the buyer (its usually $20)."

This is an Accurized Serbian Zastava AK Krink type of pistol in 5.56 x45. Obviously the original krink had a triangle stock and was 5.45 but its close. Very close. It has the correct Krink flash suppressor. Arsenal makes the closest thing to this and it costs $900 and mine is made better! Also this is one of the few CAI marked guns that they thankfully had nothing to do with building. They just import them like the rifle variant. The pistols are fully Serbian made and imported as such and thusly don't have to follow the 922r compliance game.
This started life as a PAP M85 pistol. It has had the bolt, hammer face and rails polished. It has a stainless bolt, fold up top cover and dual aperture front and rear sights. Three sets of pistol grips are included. It has a Krinkov muzzle device properly installed with spring and detent pin. This kind has the fence cutter cut outs in front of the brake which could come in handy. Brake and hammer work performed by Mike at Coastal Gun Works in Virginia Beach.
The stocks are Russian Walnut I scored from Sarco. I sanded it for a long while and then put 4 coats of foliage stain on. I finished it in 3 coats of minwax satin poly. Came out pretty nice. This is alot like the M92 except this gun is based around the slightly beefier M85 gun with true RPK receiver, heavy rails and bulged trunion. This one also comes with an Magpul Ak grip, a CAA grip and the original Kvar grip. Also comes with a new single point sling. ( you will need the $12 sling plate). A box of wolf 223 is included as well. Also a $35 Allen Large pistol case brand new is included. 
$700 cash or trade for a G41 brand new and $100.

From Magpul's website:
Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The Magpul MOE Stock – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Rifle is Colt in M4 model not the others cheapie :)
It's bought new in box last year. Shot less than 100 ( due to the ""f#*^king"" price of ammo)
The pistol was bought 2 years ago, it went to have fun at the NRA range couple times.

Yes, I cleaned and oil/fluid them every time after the fun time.
So far never jammed on both of them.

Currently, it is wearing the original-style P229 grips (as shown in first picture) which I will also include. Price is $795. No trades. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask any questions!

In reply to smeadly19@ and whoever had the same thought, this old girl has been carried, a lot. This quality, all metal pistol has probably launched more rounds downrange than most of you kids with your plastic guns have even handled in the boxes. All the humorous chatter aside, this gun will most likely continue doing what it was made to do, provide it's owner with a reliable defense, for a very long time.

Casull CA2000!!

The Casull CA 2000
Casull Arms, now known as Freedom Arms, is famous for making high end large caliber large frame single action revolvers. Not kidding, some of their products can sell between $1,000-$2,000. In 2000 they decided to create something different, the CA 2000 revolver. Inspired by vintage Velodog revolvers, the CA 2000 is a tiny five shot double action .22 revolver. It has a folding trigger and concealed hammer for easy carrying.

There was suppose to be only 2000 of these made (hence CA2000) but they stopped making them at just over 900 because they turned out to be too expensive to make. These things are truly a collectors piece as because they will never be made again. This pistol is in pristine condition and has never been shot. The book is also in pristine condition.

The last time this was sold that I could find was in 2012 for $675. 

So I will start this one at $675

Don't pass this one up because you may not see one again for a very long time."

This is not a 25 year old Sig like most people are trying to sell on Armslist; it was manufactured 2 years ago. The best part about a 229 chambered in .40 S&W is the ability to easily switch to .357 SIG or 9mm by simply purchasing a drop-in barrel. The handgun will come in the original box with all manuals, two 12-round magazines and safety lock. Currently, it is wearing the original-style P229 grips (as shown in first picture) which I will also include. Price is $795. No trades. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask any questions!

I have 5 boxes of Tula and 350 loose rounds in ziplock bags ( Ram Precision Ammunition brand ). As I don't have any 9mm firearms now, so they have to go.

I paid $250 for 1000 rounds of Ram ammo. So, 100 rounds is $25. And the Tula is $10/box. 

I don't make any money from the ammo like  other hoarders are doing up here on Armslist. I strongly believe buying, scoring all the ammo in the stores then turn around and sell them for profit is completely immoral and unacceptable.  So, you're more welcome to check the prices around in store or internet and see that my price is the same as what they're selling for. 

I also have some 22lr ammo laying around. They're my personal needed. I think 4 bricks or so. I can't sell you all but whoever buy the 9mm ammo from me and you need some 22lr ammo to hunt, teaching the young kids or just want to have fun at the range but can't find the ammo anywhere. Yes, I'll sell you 1 or two bricks and keep the rest for myself use. I won't sell the 22lr ammo separately.

I'm looking for some Makarov ammo, the 9x18 Mak. If you do have some and you think we can trade, yes I'll be happy to do that.

I searched high and low for these 4 several years ago and paid $12 each way back then!


As for the lead ingots, the whole batch was sorted thoroughly. Clip weights only were melted down in this batch, I have 10lbs or so of soft lead from stick-on ingots for sale too. All steel and zinc weights were removed and only lead clipped weights were melted down. I fluxed the batch with sawdust and tealight candles.  They were molded in muffin trays, so they are muffin-sized.  Should fit in all casting pots.

$0.80/lb

Lead ingots are going for just over $1.00/lb on ebay, so I figured I'd try listing some here.

I also have over 300lbs of unsorted clip-type wheelweights I can sell you for $0.60/lb if you want to smelt your own. I just have way more than I can use, so I'm seeing if there is a market for them!

It has a 4"" barrel and the finish is Royal Blue. This Colt Python was manufactured in 1965 (based on what I found online researching the serial number). This Python has a bright shiny bore and perfect timing and tight lock up. The gun shoots perfect and out performs any automatic hand gun I own with twice the capacity. I have become a revolver person after plenty of visits to the range and shooting my Python with one hand better than my HK, Ruger, Kimber and every other auto pistol I have in varying sizes and calibers using two hands. You can't go wrong with this Python. Whether you are a collector or a shooter or just interested in buying a good investment firearm, this is the best of all worlds. It's never too late to buy a Colt Python and this Python is the perfect one to love. Your not going to pay the crazy high prices of a brand new old one in the original box untouched and stored away since 1956 and your going to get a fine specimen of the best revolver ever produced at a price you can afford and be able to shoot it when ever you want. I have bought and sold many Pythons through the years and they are my favorite guns to collect, shoot, buy and sell. They are the best looking revolver out there and if you do some research you'll understand why everybody says the ""Colt Python is the Rolls Royce of revolvers"".You can buy this gun today and next year turn around and sell it for more than you paid and........ THIS GUN MAKES YOU A BETTER SHOOTER!!!! It just performs better than any other gun you will buy. I'm no world class shooter by any means but I can outshoot all my buddies when I have this Python in my hand. The finish is fair. It has about 85% of its original Royal Blue finish (conservatively) and it doesn't have any nicks or gouges. The bluing is just worn on the barrel ends from a holster and throughout the cylinder. Also around the frame of the gun where another set of previously installed grips wore some of the finish off. It still shines beautifully though and is a fine weapon. I took lots of pictures outside to get the most accurate depiction and to show the areas of wear as good as I could. The grips are aftermarket rubber grips. There is no box. I will pack it in a hard plastic pistol case and bubble wrap that tightly and ship so that it arrives safely. Ill only ship to your FFL. Ill be sending it personally with a copy of my Drivers License. Shipping is 45.00. It includes insurance and cost of packing supplies. Im very particular about the packaging to ensure NO DAMAGE. I won't ship to the gun scared states. If you have any questions, want more pics or need anything else, please let me know."
