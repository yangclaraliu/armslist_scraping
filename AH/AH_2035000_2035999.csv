This gun is more reliable than my glock 17 with prefect ejection unlike the new glocks and has the accuracy and trigger of a custom 1911. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is to fund another CZ project so I'm not looking for any trades. With the parts alone the gun is worth well over a 1000 dollars and that doesn't even include the cost of gunsmithing so someone is getting a hell of a deal."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

I have 3 used Colt 1911 .45 barrels for sale. They are each 5' barrels and are in good shape, but were replaced by Wilson Combat match barrels. The markings are different for each as well. 

Barrel 1) Marked Colt .45 auto on top w/ 7791193 underneath. Has S&W on the right of lug, M P on left lug, and P in front of the lug. This barrel is parkarized w/ crome lining. This barrel will have a stainless Wilson Combat bushing. From my understanding this means this barrel was made by S&W for a military contract as replacement barrels. 

Barrel 2) Marked Colt .45 auto just above the left lug, a P on the left lug, and a G in front of the lug with a small F above it.

Barrel 3) Marked Colt .45 auto on the top of the barrel. The only other marking on this barrel is a small box w/ a C in it on the left lug.

 This can either be a parts gun or a project gun. It has pitting from past rust in various places but nothing that would make the rifle unsafe to fire.

 The stock is junk in my opinion, but will go with the gun. The bore looks clean and free of major defects/pitting.

 This will need the top end parts - ie bolt/cover, etc. Not hard to find parts for these rifles.

 As stated before, it can be a parts gun, or a revival project. It would be worth it to find the parts and make a complete rifle again.

I bought this about 5 years ago and it functions flawlessly on any type of ammo.  I believe the kit is a Romanian parts kit and barrel with some AMD65 furniture.  Has a 6 position stock on it currently but also comes with the wood stock too.  The only thing the rifle needs is the receiver reblued or duracoated.  This in no way affects the way the rifle operates, purely looks only. Only reason I'm selling is because I'm consolidating calibers.

Ruger's Super Blackhawk revolvers are all equipped standard with a ramp front sight with a fully adjustable square notch rear sight. 
With the introduction of the New Model revolvers all are equipped with a transfer bar safety mechanism. 
This prevents the hammer from resting against the firing pin as with older models and makes them safe to carry fully loaded.
Another useful refinement is the interlock of the loading gate with the cylinder lock and hammer. 
This means that there is no need to bring the hammer to half-cock in order to release the cylinder. 
Simply opening the loading gate accomplishes this. 
While the loading gate is opened, the hammer is held firmly in place and cannot be drawn back.

 Semiautomatic 3"" Magnum

 Shows Good-Honest Wear...no abuse, but it's not perfect. If I had to do the whole Fjestad's rating thing...I'd call the finish 80-85%

 Mechanically, it is absolutely perfect, but it HAS had many hunting seasons under its belt. I took it to the gun show in Mesa last Saturday, and saw 3 of them priced between $575 and $775. Obviously, this is why they were still sitting there at the end of the show...so, I am asking $100 LESS THAN THE LOWEST PRICE I SAW THERE, and I think that is more than fair. 

 The guy with the one for $775 offered me $475 for it...but because he was such a douchebag gouger (he was trying to sell .22lr for $150/500), I told him to piss off and wouldn't sell it to him anyway (He was the same guy who offered a fellow in front of me $275 for a Gen 3 Glock 17 and was selling HIS used Glocks for $600). 

 But....that being said, I'd like a real gun guy who will actually use, appreciate, and shoot this shotgun to own it, and for that I am willing to make a deal. I'd keep it myself, but multiple shoulder injuries make it impossible for me to use it.

 I included pics to show everything, and hide nothing.

 $475 CASH. I am holding firm on the $475.  I would consider an RIA 5"" 1911 or a Glock Pistol in trade (no other trades please).

It has 3745 miles, plus a couple if I take the bike out this weekend. I've had the bike for a few months now and don't ride as much as I thought I would. I have a 30 minute commute, one way, each day and I was getting 60+ miles per gallon.

This is my first bike and it took me no time at all to learn to ride. This bike is great for beginners or someone who wants a low cost ride. I mentioned how good the gas mileage was, but it is also very cheap to maintain and own. I have full coverage insurance with a $150 deductible and road side assistance, my monthly bill is $19. The bike is belt driven which takes the maintenance out of dealing with a train driven bike. Also, it has a single 500cc engine which also make maintenance easy.

The bike comes with the helmet, seat bag, cell phone holder and extra windshield. It has a brand new Vance and Hines exhaust, maybe 3 miles on it as of Friday the 23rd. The exhaust sounds awesome compared to the crap stock exhaust.

I am asking $1400 for the bike minus trade. I am looking for nice shotgun. I would prefer a semi auto 3 or 3 1\2"" magnum but I'll take a pump as well.  I'm looking for a 12 or 10ga.

I will be fair with a trade in value as long as you are fair with me. I will not take any inflated prices or over assessed value for your hunting gear.

There will be no joy rides unless you are a serious buyer and you have a motorcycle license.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol(.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates
on a unique hybrid blow back /locked-breech system. This operation system
allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts
between locked breach and blow back operation, depending on the pressure of
the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30
rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a
crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb
activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide
locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also
provided. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip,
slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced
Nylon (Zytel). The magazine is also Zytel with round count ports. Other

release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight,
Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive
coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective
heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single
pin.

This gun is a tac driver and I do not use that term lightly. I was hitting the 10 ring consistently at 25 yards. The only reason I am getting rid of it is to consolidate all of my guns to 9mm, this is the last of my 45's to go.

The price is 700 but I would be more interested in trading it for another handgun in 9mm with my preference being another Sig or a competition length barrel polymer frame (glock, springfield). I will entertain all offers but I am not trading this at a loss so if you are interested in trading a pocket 380 it should come with a shotgun or another gun. I would also be interested in trading for a 9mm 1911 style pistol.

The stock is of course fixed, but it is the older model that can easily be converted all you have to do is get a 16"" barrel (or a weld on extender from hellboxarmory) and an original rear section with the folding stock and do a little work to switch the stocks out (I say 16"" barrel because if you do the stock and not the barrel its considered a SBR and will be a class III weapon). 

Mainly looking to trade even to a Sterling Rifle.  The Wiselite or CIA brand.  Both guns sell for the same so even trade.  I will trade equal amounts of 7.62x25 ammo if you have 9mm ammo.

Also will trade toward a Norinco 320 in good shape.

I am the only owner and have had it for a little over a year, I got it, cleaned it and put it in the safe.  I have around 800 rounds of 7.62x25 so if you dont have 9mm I will sell the ammo at a good price (I dont believe in gouging).  I could sell the ammo on gunbroker anytime for $300 plus so please don't offer me $100 for just the ammo."

It is a Romanian slide action version of the AK, imported for only a couple of years in the early 1990s. It was originally designed for the California market, but makes a great hunting rifle. Before you poo-poo this pump version, it is a tack driver. I consistently hit tin cans at 100 yards with a Walther red dot sight, and at 200 yards with the 2.5x Konus Pro. The Konus has an etched reticle like many high end tactical scopes do, and is a much better scope than the typical Bushnell, Weaver, NcStar, etc. The Konus 2.5 x scope has a diamond reticle that can also be used as a simple rangefinder. It has very bright and clear optics, with a 4 to five inch eye relief. Also  the included Walther 40mm red dot sight that is just a great one. You will get 2 quick detachable scope rails with the scopes mounted and zeroed, and a round top dust cover for use with them along with the original one with the open rear sight. Other accessories include the front sight adjustment tool, an extended rubber recoil pad, and both magazines that came with the rifle. I never got around to getting any hi-cap mags for it, but it accepts the high quality NATO Hungarian (and other) hi cap magazines out there that are in the $30-40  range. The original pistol grip also comes with it, as well as the adjustable custom one that is installed. Lastly, since I am getting out of the 5.56/.223 caliber, you can also have a bit over 400 rounds of this ammunition. 80 rounds are 62 grains, 320 rounds are 55 grain loads, and there are also about 10 or 20 are 45 grain. It likes all of them, and is a tin can killer! All ammunition is new brand name, commercial US made, brass cased, and none of it is Tula! I am not a fan of steel cased ammo, and Tula is dirty so I never use it.

Anyway, the reason for selling, is that I have found an antique gun I want to buy, and I need to supplement my cash onhand so my wife doesn't flat out divorce me for buying yet ANOTHER gun. I think if you look at all that is included in this package, you will agree that this is a deal. 

Email me through Armslist with your phone number and we can meet so you can see it. Thanks for reading my long winded ad. Doby Pilgrim,  Santa Fe

P.S.
I can shoot this pump accurately about as fast as a semiauto, and theoretically it should be more reliable, since you provide the extraction and loading by pumping it. These were built on military AK actions, and can be converted to semiautos by some parts and doing a bit of gunsmithing. With the price of semiauto AKs these days, that would actually be a pretty cost effective way of doing it."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano is extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

I have 100 rounds of American Eagle 180gr FMJ and 20 rounds of Hornady 200gr XTP, and/or a Blackhawk holster that I can add if necessary to make a more equitable deal.  If this gun interests you and you have something interesting to trade (and we can add or subtract cash, ammo etc), please shoot me a note. All reasonable offers will be considered and all emails will be answered"

Sig just released the double striker feature where if the round fails the first pull simply pull the trigger again.

Thats a great feature but what what truly makes this pistol unique is the finish on the titanium slide. It changes color in different lighting and at different angles. It will look gold, purple, blue or green according to how you look at it. Sig has made this model in .380 caliber before with great success but this is the first 9mm. 

No two are alike. So you will truly have a one of a kind firearm that you can say no one else in the world has one just like like it. All the finishes from the factory turn out a little different. Some have more purple. Some have more green or gold. I had 4 of them with consecutive serial numbers and while the guns themselves were all uniform each gun had its own unique color features. 

Oh yeah! It comes with a 6 and 8 round extended clips, nice kydex holster and all the factory paperwork in a nice Sig Sauer hard lock box.

I originally picked this one, my last one, out to keep but unfortunately I must sell it to pay for an AR-15 I have in layaway.

This revolver is not only collectible but it is unlike any other .38 revolver on the market now as it is small but larger than a .38 snub gun, holds 6 shots instead of 5, has fully adjustable target type sights, the 3"" barrel has a vent rib and a full underlug, and it has beautiful Brazilian hardwood grips that fit nice and tight are are just about flawless. I have not seen another Rossi Model 951 with 3"" barrel anywhere. I will pay for the FFL dealer's fee, the Maryland State Police fee, and there is no sales tax on a person to person sale. Transfer must be thru the gunshop I use in Brandywine MD, Precision Ballistics. He does a Maryland State Police compliant 8 business day transfer with a NICS background check, has regular hours six days a week, and is good to work with. If you have ANY kind of criminal record or are prohibited from owning firearms for ANY reason, do not contact me, nor will I do any kind of 'strawman' transfer or any kind of sale w/o the proper paperwork. Buyer must be legal Maryland resident or active duty military stationed in MD with orders. I will include a box of new .38 Special ammo with the deal at no extra cost. Thanks for looking looking, pls email me with any questions. Not interested in trades of any sort or counter offers. New highly restrictive gun laws commence in Maryland Oct 1 that will cost you alot more to buy a gun."

Brand New Just Released

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

These are the “bread-and-butter” of reloading, the most commonly called-for primers in reloading recipes. CCI standard primers are remarkably clean-burning, leaving primer pockets cleaner and extending the time between pocket cleaning. That’s a huge benefit for progressive reloaders. They are more sensitive and easier to seat than older CCI primers, and engineered for smooth feeding in automated equipment.
