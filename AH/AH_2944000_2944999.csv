First up is my Bulgarian Makarov!

It was police surplus. It has 99% of it's finish left, and from what I can tell it was never even fired. I only put 150 rounds of quality brass cased ammo through it myself. It comes with three eight round magazines, a Fobus holster, a Fobus double magazine pouch, and a box of quality 9x18 brass cased full metal jacket! I am mainly looking to trade this for another pistol, otherwise I'm looking for $500 cash.

Next I've got a 1942 Izhevesk M91/30 Mosin Nagant. I've put about 250 rounds through it. It retains 95% of it's finish. It was very nice when I got it. I still have the bayonet however I do not have the original stock. It comes with a black synthetic ATI stock, all matching parts, the original butt plate, and a nylon sling. I'm mainly looking to trade this too, otherwise $250 cash.

Finally I've got a very nice Sino-Soviet SKS. It was still in the cosmoline when I got it. This is one of the best SKS rifles out there. It was built under Russian supervision on Russian machinery by the Chinese. It's got all matching serials except for the bolt cover. The stock does have some battle scars. It retains 90% of it's finish. It comes with a sling, the original bayonet, 20 stripper clips, about 50 - 60 rounds of ammo, and 20 rounds of special ballistic tip explosive rounds. I'm mainly looking to trade this for a more compact semi automatic rifle, possibly pistol caliber. Otherwise $500 cash.

The Japanese swords of the Emperor Series have proven, since their initial introduction almost five years ago, to be quite popular with many of our customers. Still, we are aware that there are some people who want a battle ready sword but hope to find one at a more affordable price. Our Warrior Series addresses this problem directly. In our efforts to reduce the costliness of the blades, we have omitted the expensive mirror polishing that we used on our Emperor Swords to create a new series of Japanese swords with a more practical finish.
The Warrior Series swords are very handsome in their own right and share the same steel, heat treatment, and sharpness as their more expensive Emperor counterparts. Like the Emperor swords, they have Samé covered, cord wrapped handles and quality fittings. If you're in the market for a strong, good looking, reasonably priced Japanese sword we know you'll be happy to own one of these. All come complete with a BLACK LACQUERED SCABBARD and a BLUE/VIOLET COVER BAG.

This grade of rifle is no longer available in the CMP stores or by mail order. It's a CMP auction item only and the lowest they close at have been $2300. You are welcome to search the CMPs past post war correct auction listings to see for yourself. Rifle comes with all the correct paper work and green Plano style CMP plastic rifle case. This is the best CMP Garand you will see on Armslist by a long shot! If you have a specific 5mil. HRA serial number you are looking for please reply with that info and I will let you know if you've won the Garand lottery. Serious inquiries only! I will send more photos to your email upon request. This is not a hoax, bluesky, cai, dane, or greek import!!! This rifle appears to be original, unaltered, or messed with since it left HRA. In my opinion HRAs of this vintage are much nicer than any International Harvester or Springfield. This rifle will double in value in the next 15 years! If its here it's still available. This is a CMP certified correct grade rifle. This is not a corrected mixmaster! Serious inquiries only, price is firm! Buyer pays all shipping and FFL transfer fees."

Original receipt available. Comes with the original Pelican case, ScopeCoat, LaRue LT681 RCO Mount, Thumbscrew Flattop Adapter (TA51), KillFLASH. Rarely used and in brand new condition. No scratches.

The USMC TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16A4 Weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

This isn't the cheapest AR you will find on Armslist, but it may be the best ""bang for your buck"". If you want CHEAP, go to WalMart.

This is NOT a ""consumer grade"" AR-15. This is a LEO/Military grade AR that you can depend on in the unfortunate event that your life depends on it. No offense to the cheap stuff that everyone and their brother has been buying at Walmart, but if I'm trusting my life to my rifle working, I won't be carrying a consumer-grade, Walmart rifle. I'll go for an Agency-grade rifle like the DoubleStar.

Who is DoubleStar?
The DoubleStar brand is well known among Agencies that purchase ARs and 1911s for service, as they have been making professional quality weapons for the government for years. However, selling to consumers is relatively recent and they don't spend nearly as much on marketing as any of the ""bigger name"" brands. 
Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DoubleStar Corp (DSC) has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on.  Every rifle built uses only US made parts, but is built with precision, care, and pride.  Each rifle is built and test fired in their Kentucky facility.

The DoubleStar DS-4 Carbine AR-15 / M4 rifle was modeled as a civilian version of the military M-4.  This model comes with the M203 Mounting groove in front of the forged “F” marked front sight base and double heat shielded DS4 handguards standard.  It also comes standard with a 16” chromemoly 1x9 twist barrel and 6 position commercial spec stock.

Included in the sell would be the stag hard case, original paperwork, military style cleaning kit, and two metal 30 round magazines. 

Also included is an AIM 1-4X illuminated sight (shown in picture), with three different color options, also with all the original paper work, an extra battery and original alen wrench. I picked this sight up for $160 at a gun show, after it had been marked down. I've seen them for $130 though. 

I have multiple other polymer mags from tasco and pmag that I could sell in addition the the riffle. I also have around 200 5.56 and .223 rounds that I will sell for .60 cents a round. 

I'm willing to negotiate on the price a little.

The standard rear sight is not currently installed and it will come with the package. It hits bowling pins at 50 yards. It's a great gun for a left handed shooter. The action is very smooth on this one. The wood stock has ""Veratis"" wood burned into the right side of the receiver area.If you shoot right handed the cheek rest raises your face too high to see through the peep sight. I had thought it would be cool to have a Boondocks Saints SKS. That would be why I'm not trying to get for it what I've got into it.

True Strength Platform 
The innovative True Strength(TS) Platform is a signature scope construction platform. Most significantly, it includes a Smart Spherical Structure(SSS) controlling the joint-like interaction between a scope’s inner and outer tubes. The design provides long lasting reliability in these interactions to guarantee precise and responsive windage/elevation adjustment over time. TS has been at the heart of every genuine Leapers scope for more than a decade and has been fully tested on scope-killer airguns and elephant rifles with extreme recoil.

Most Demanding Tests 
We perform our testing based on actual users' input. We gather usage intelligence from all deployment aspects, carefully analyze their impacts and develop appropriate test parameters to ensure optimal performance under all conditions. TS has been at the heart of every genuine Leapers scope for more than a decade and has been fully tested on scope-killer airguns and elephant rifles with extreme recoil.

Premium Lockable and Resettable Turrets 
Well-designed and constructed target turrets allow for crisp, consistent and precise windage and elevation adjustments. Its locking and re-setting features protect and complement one of the most critical parts in the optic for proper zeroing.

Parallax Free View from 3 Yards to Infinity 
Uncommon throughout the market, this particular scope series achieves an impressive and unparalleled parallax free view from as close in as 3 yards out to infinity using its adjustable wide angle front objective.

RGB Side Wheel Illumination 
Leapers/UTG pioneered red AND green reticle illumination in this industry in 2004, allowing for even more effective scope use under diverse environments and lighting conditions. The innovative side wheel control was then introduced for the RGB illumination, getting away from the traditional bulky rheostat on the eye piece and giving users quick and easy access for reticle light.

Range Estimating Mil-dot Reticle 
Leapers/UTG started introducing mil-dot reticle optics from as early as 2003, pioneering the Range Estimating concept as a useful tool for hunters and shooters around the world. Today, the mil-dot reticle is widely accepted and used in this industry. Leveraging our years of experience in this area, UTG developed and refined the unique Tactical Range Estimating(TRE) mil-dot reticle and offers this feature in almost all of our optics. With some patient learning and practice using our TRE, shooters can enhance accuracy and performance in ways not imagined before. Regular mil-dot reticles found on the market usually have 4 dots in each direction of the cross hair, giving you 9 different aiming points for either windage or elevation. If you count the 2 inner tips of the opposite duplex cross hairs, you get 11 aiming points. In contrast, Leapers/UTG 36 Mil-Dot Tactical Range Estimating Reticle (TRE) has 9 dots on each direction of the cross hair, giving you 19 aiming points or 21 including the inner tips of the duplex cross hairs.

Accessories 
UTG aims to provide application and solution oriented products, including useful and most commonly sough-after accessories. In addition to the flip-open lens caps, a 2” sunshade and a pair of medium profile Max Strength heavy duty rings are included. The rings, with a saddle height of 15mm, fit on Picatinny/Weaver rails and are secured with patented, fully adjustable quick detach lever locks."

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

I am in Hudson so, if you are in MN, we will need to go through an FFL.  I'll cover the FFL fees up to $25.  Since Minnesota considers this an ""assault rifle"" you'll need a PTP or PTC.  However, if you don't have that, I can put the original stock back on so you'll be able to get it done as a simple rifle transfer.

I bought this gun in 2012 and have only taking it dove hunting once and have also shot clays with it a few times and that's it. The bluing on this gun is amazing and has been a safe queen and well taken care of and kept well oiled. I have gotten away from bird hunting and been more into handgun target shooting and that's why I'm selling. Don't really need to sell it but if anyone is interested in this just E-mail me and I will dig it out of the safe and take a few pictures of it. Will post stock picture at this time. Three chokes included, may also have original box and paperwork somewhere. May consider trading towards a Colt Python or higher end 1911's. Thanks for looking!"

OEM grip installed on it (I will put it back on it)
Good Iron muzzle brake (mounted) + OEM muzzle device 
Blue Force Gear Universal Wire Loop Sling Mount
I have a few charging handles, you can pick which one you want: OEM, tangodown, GG&G and IMW.

**OPTICS NOT INCLUDED** - unless you want to buy them.

Comes in a Boyt H48 hard case with 5 brand new troy battle mags still in packaging.


Details on the SCAR:

Has roughly between 10,000-12,500 rounds through it. I have not counted, but I am sure it is in that area. The barrel is in good condition and has no flier when zeroing it which would suggest an issue with the barrel. The OEM sights were removed and put back on (including the front sight) and the PWS SRX was torqued to spec during install. The rifle keeps zero without issue and cycles anything you put into it. It has seen several classes and is not in ""new"" condition. It has scratches, marks and scrapes, nothing that impedes its use or function in any way. 

Buyer is responsible for all costs, shipping, transfers.

I will ship it to your FFL after payment.

Please contact me with any questions you may have I will do my best to answer them. First come, first serve.

Never used. Fits most all AR rifles with adjustable stocks

Whether you are carrying your rifle to the range or need to pack it in the field, this Voodoo Tactical brand padded weapons case is a terrific way to carry two long guns, two pistols and a great deal of related gear.
The 36"" padded case from Voodoo Tactical safely holds just about any compact rifle or carbine. 
Inside are adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.
Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.
This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six magazines and the center pouch is even larger.
This gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

It was mounted on my 30-06 rifle and it holds zero perfectly. 
It's a really clear scope (picture doesn't do any justice)
I only took it out once to sight it in and ran about 20+ rounds thru it to test if it holds zero and it was great. I even banged my rifle to see if it would hold and it did. 
Only reason I'm selling it is because I don't need a high power optic on my 30-06. And it looks too bulky for my ar.
