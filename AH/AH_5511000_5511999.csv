Designed for sniper and AR style rifles the model 5573 scope will meet and exceed the demands of worldwide military and Law Enforcement agencies. Offering a true 5x magnification with Duo-Scale elevation knobs that provide both visual and tactile indication of rotational position. It also features a rugged 34mm, one-piece extruded aluminum main tube and world-class Steiner optical elements, featuring broadband anti-reflective lens coating for over 90% light transmission. The glass-etched reticle is located on the front focal plane so sub-tension remains unchanged over the magnification range for quick and easy target identification, ranging and accuracy. The model 5573 boasts a MSR (Multi-purpose Sniper Reticle).What's in the box: Butler Creek ocular and objective covers, allen wrench, warranty card, manualTrue 15x magnification — STEINER’s larger magnification of true 15x results in more details for the rifleman to see for quick & precise target identification.Increased field of view and elimination of tunnel effect — Quick & easy target acquisition with low 5x magnification thanks to extra large XL field of view. Increased visual convenience for the rifleman thanks to elimination of tunnel effect (tunnel effect is a visual proof for imperfect optical calculation).Exterior product design optimized for maximum operator convenience and ease of handling. XL extra large & non-slip knobs for use with or without gloves (elevation, windage, parallax and illumination knob). Non-slip diopter adjustment and non-slip magnification (power) ring.Interior product design optimized to reach maximum elimination of stray light. Special interior design and surface treatment eliminates stray light. Stray light interferes with the optical path and results in significantly reduced visual performance.Illumination mechanism with tactile stand-by position in between each setting. Quick & easy stand-by position helps to avoid excessive battery consumption. Within a split of seconds the rifleman is back in the required illumination setting.Elevation adjustment with unique, patented “STEINER DuoScale” — a unique double turn construction with second rotation hiding while not active. No more confusion if the elevation is on 1st or 2nd turn. Very fast & simple to read the scale and no more risk of misinterpretation (1st or 2nd turn).XL elevation & windage knobs contain also an extra large XL mechanism which performs with maximum precision. Large diameters allow more accurate & precise clicks. This increases the repeating accuracy within the complete adjustment range of 260 clicks of elevation and 120 clicks of windage.Parallax setting visible from shooting position — immediate information and quick adjustment.Tube and knob configuration optimized to allow maximum options for mounting purposes. Illumination knob is integrated with minimum space requirements in the parallax adjustment knob (no extra illumination knob!) Simple & easy to mount on various rifles without having problems caused by limited mounting space. Scope can be mounted in the optimum position to allow maximum operator convenience. Additional equipment (e. g. flash light, laser, …) can easily be mounted alongside the scopeAll adjustment knobs are 100 % sealed with latest state-of-the-art sealing technology. Absolutely no water can get underneath the STEINER knobs. Performance of click mechanism is secured and can not be obstructed or damaged by frozen ice or humidity."

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features: Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Dark Earth Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

There is also some stabilized cracks in the upper handguard that should not pose any real problem as well.-The metal has an overall pleasing brown patina. There is fairly heavy pitting near and under the wood line/rear of receiver however and in some other places as well, which is pretty standard for these old war-horses. The bolt is great, and it cycles extremely smoothly and reliably in the receiver. -The barrel is dark with worn lands and grooves remaining however, mixed with some pitting/heavy wear. The rifle has seen hard use throughout it's life, fighting either for or against the communist takeover post WW2 (actually probably both!). This rifle will make a great representative example in your collection of WW2 or Chinese weaponry. I have not shot it, but if you want to I would recommend that you take it to a licensed gunsmith so he or she can give it a good once over.

The Nikon is crystal clear and improved my shooting greatly once i started using it. The cheek rest has 8 bullet slots, a smooth cheek surface, and unzips for convenient storage. The bipod is not high end but works great. It's very durable and sturdy making it alot easier for me to shoot at longer distances. The hard case im including is very durable and kept the rifle safe when traveling. I am selling this rifle because i just dont shoot it that much since i have been really into my AR-15."
