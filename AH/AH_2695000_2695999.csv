I also got true glow night sights that will cost you $300 .and the 33 round make was $300 also. And I also got a green stencil and colored in the lettering so now its a custom. And because its a custom I want $1000 for it heck ill throw in a 100 rnd box of ammo 9mm that is that also cost $50. Dont worry ill be up at 6am because I have nothing better to do with my life to get more at walmart and make it hard for all of you guys that want to protect your families have a hard time practicing or even getting it. But yes this is so customized just like my romanian ak I bought 3 years ago for $275 but I put a forend on it and a tapco buttstock and a tapco grip  but its customized so I want $2000 for that to. Or better yet I got a saiga that I converted so its now an arsenal. Dont worry the saiga was only $450 and the conversion kit was $100 but all that blood sweat and tears makes it an arsenal so your gonna have to pay $1500 for that. Im sure one of you will report me for a scam but im not a scam allof you that sit in lune buy all the ammo and sell it to your fellow americans for twice the ammount is a scam. Your over priced ""customed"" guns are a scam
 I really do have every gun mentioned by the way so if you du,mb enough to buy these guns for the ammount then by all means lets make a deal. But im telling you a used glock with even one shot ran through it is only worth $400 at best. Your romanian ak is 500 at best. And all you buying the ammo up.

Comes with 6 Chip McCormick Stainless 8 round mags with removable bottom bumpers, Packmyer rubber and wood grips, Factory box, papers, takedown tool and factory grips. I'm asking $1000 for this gun (20% off new for ""used"" gun prices) I also have 4 different holsters for it...I will throw in two of them of your choice. Two holsters are for Tactical carry and two are for concealed!
Below are some links of what this gun costs new. If you can find one in stock at all...look for yourself. No low ballers, if you can find one cheaper then mine with the extras then buy it and simply pass this one by...it is what it is guys (a good deal)! Transfer will be done with an FFL (you pay for it unless it's a trade then we each pay for our own). 

For the right trade (FNH Five-Seven Pistol in FDE) I also have 650 rounds of 45 ACP ammo to throw into the deal!!! Thanks for looking!

I just traded into a Kimber from my dad. It's a bit small for my hands, so I thought I'd throw it up for trade and see what kind of offers are out there. I'm not looking to sell it right now.

Here are the specs...

Kimber Ultra Carry. This is the first series and does not have the Schwartz safety.
Crimson Trace Laser Grips
2 6-rd stainless mags
Galco IWB holster

This Kimber shows honest carry wear on the safety, grip safety and slide release, but other than that, it is a great firearm in really good condition the internals are nearly perfect. This pistol has the blackout sights and is extremely accurate."

It is a 1942-dated Ishevsk, The first year year that they made the PU style sniper rifle.  It is an early built rifle, according to the prefix and serial number.  Includes rifle, scope set-up, scope cover/caps, sling, bayonet, and ammo pouch with tools and oiler.

This is a genuine sniper that was imported as a regular rifle.  I re-snipered it using an original scope and scope mount. The scope is not matching numbers to the rifle, But it is a 1942-dated scope that is correct for this rifle.  The scope base is an exact reproduction, and the turn-down bolt was  proffesionally made using the bolt that came with the rifle, So it is matching numbers.  The original scope number stamped on the side of the barrel has NOT been scrubbed.  The stock is a very unusual beechwood stock.   I have never fired this rifle. 

Price is $550.  Prefer FTF in/around the New Ulm/Mankato area, But I will drive a little bit to meet and do a deal.  I have many many more pics- Email me for more or if you have any questions.

This is the model that has the adjustable muzzle brake, you can shoot it closed, or open, reducing recoil by as much as 30%.

From Savage:

""The FHSAK  features a hinged floorplate, muzzle brake, swivel studs, and Savage’s AccuTrigger system. The AccuTrigger system features a dual-stage trigger design. The first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism, allowing the second trigger to be depressed in order to activate the firing pin. The trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The FHSAK also features Savage’s patented AccuStock system. The AccuStock includes an integral aluminum spine that runs the length of the forearm, resulting in a more rigid stock that allows the barrel to float freely. In addition, the AccuStock is bedded so as to apply both horizontal and vertical (3-dimensional) pressure to the action. This achieves in a tighter fit between stock and action, resulting in increased overall gun accuracy. The Model 16 FHSAK is drilled and tapped for scope mounts.""

It will include a Simmons AETEK 2.5-10X44 Master Series scope, rings, and sling.  Includes 60 rounds (3 boxes) of 145gr FMJ BT PPU .308 ammo.  This will be at the Fort Worth Gun Show tomorrow unless someone makes a deal first.  Act Fast.  You can contact me by text at REDACTED, I am in Denton and will meet FTF for a cash deal.

This was my primary carry sidearm. It's in solid condition--functionally and cosmetically. It's impeccably accurate at 10-15 yards (although this depends on the shooter). I can see why the Walther PPK was so popular as this piece makes for a perfect carry/ concealed pistol.

I did research on the holster before I purchased it and concluded it was the best one with no slippage or pop out.

I'm relatively firm on the price given the ammunition and accessories. I might be open to part trade for a shotgun plus cash.

Although they are built like tanks and shoot perfectly, the CZ 82 pistols are all retired Czech police guns and show wear of the painted finish. These guns are not as easy to find as they once were and are only going up in value. Great option to avoid the ammo shortage. 9mm Makarov is cheap and plentiful and fun to shoot.

For $350 you get everything pictured: Pistol, over $350 rounds of ammo, IWB leather CZ holster, and 2 CZ shoulder holsters."

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

 It is a brand new, unfired, still tagged, 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun. I have very little information from the seller and cannot find much on the web about it. From what I gather it is a Huglu brand, Turkish shotgun that was custom ordered from the manufacturer and later brought to the U.S. by a military officer stationed in Turkey. Huglu is known for making top notch over under and side by side hunting shotguns that are truly world class. They normally sell for a good deal of money and are next to impossible to find in the states. This one has a more tactical look with a muzzle brake and composite stock and fore grip instead of the usual wood stocks. It is labeled as a G-505 ""STAR"" model and is fully nickel plated, beautifully engraved and well finished from top to bottom. The bolt is polished to a mirror finish and the whole trigger action is smooth as silk with a great trigger break and the drilled muzzle brake just tops the whole package off. It is (by all possible research and stated from the translation) chambered to accept 2-3/4 as well as 3"" mags although I have not tried them as I have no 12GA shells. This gun is truly top quality from top to bottom and honestly just a great bird gun. This company does not export to the U.S.A. I cannot find this layout anywhere on the web period for this model. It is unbelievably light and agile (I would estimate half the weight of an 1150 Remington) and is just gorgeous. A truly one of a kind shotgun. If you want something well built, super light and definitely one of a kind, no matter where you are; this is your gun. Pictures don't do it justice!!! I have posted under this everything I have found on this including some translation on specifics to this gun.

I will lose my A#$ on this one but it is what it is.  This is such a nice gun and honestly the price asked is far less than it is worth. Pictures don't do this gun justice, it is gorgeous!!!

Comes with a Crimson Trace laser that activates with your middle finger of shooting hand when you grip it. Very nice feature that does not require any flipping of switches. This is the same exact size as the Springfield XDS series. I know because I recently just bought one ... which is the only reason I'm getting rid of this. (I'm a Springfield guy and only bought this while waiting for the XDS to come out in 9mm).

Also comes with case, keys and brush. The keys will lock the gun so that it can not be shot even if safety is taken off. Very, very nice feature. Wish all guns had this.

The Dragster

The Dragster Weapon Case system has taken over 6 months to develop and has been through 4 generations of design. Through a collaborative effort with SOF Snipers, we’ve refined the drag bag concept. Our first goal was to dramatically reduce the weight without sacrificing performance or protection, and at 4lb 9oz, we’ve certainly accomplished that. The bag zips open and lays flat to turn into a shooting mat. On the leading end of the bag, a silent, quick scabbard opening allows nearly instant access to the rifle. The shoulder straps and handles tuck away into zippered compartments and the bag can be attached to our CHIEF Patrol pack by connecting into the packs’ side compression side release buckles. There are 3 pocket systems well suited to carrying the sniper essentials, and there is also a system for attaching ghillie material for the ultimate camouflage system. This is one of those “it needs to be seen and used” to be fully appreciated!

The previous owner of Bushmaster came out of retirement and started Windham Weaponry and re-employed all the former workers.

But this also will be the last weekend it will be offered; if it sells great,but if it doesn't then back in the safe it goes until I take it to a trade show. 
 I paid $1200 for it,have only owned it for a few months and and have another couple hundred invested in holsters since so all in all I have over $1400 wrapped up in it.The pistol only has about 250 rounds through it-Tritium night sights glow like new.It comes with a form fitted case that holds two extra magazines (three total), a paddle holster, belt slide/holster to carry two extra magazines,a bore brush,a break-down tool and a manual.Also comes with a Crossbreed hybrid IWB holster,a nice Italian leather cross draw OWB holster and a Galco Lite shoulder holster-again, all in all well over $1400.Price is FIRM at $900 for everything.A great deal for someone wanting a EMP.These are hard to find used as owners won't part with them.I've went round and round myself whether to part with it or not,but I do have my eye on something else now.

I have a nice custom built Para Ordnance LTC 9mm. The gun was built by a personal friend and fully certified custom Gunsmith, John Indell who has partnered with famous Gunsmith Terry Tussey in the past and currently works with Gene Shuey, a well known custom Gunsmith in his own right.

 The pistol is 4.25 commander with a match barrel and full length guide rod. Its also been checkered and under cut beneath the trigger guard for a better grip. It has standard Novak style three dot sights. Its bi-tone with black slide and a stainless frame. I will include two mag's and the thick padded soft case it resides in.

I have used Para Ordnance 1911's for years and can vouch for their reliability. I am a 1911 guy and I'm particular when it comes to 1911's I wont settle for a crap gun. I bought it for my wife but she is looking for a smaller carry gun. Its very accurate with the match barrel and has light recoil.

Let me know if you are interested and I will send more pictures.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

I am NOT in a hurry to sell or trade so low or ridiculous offers will be politely ignored.  So with that out of the way - on to the main event.  I have a great looking LWRC M6A2 that is one of the best of AR Gas Piston riffles on the market.  This is one of the most accurate AR platforms I have ever shot and that is why I got 2 of them so I figured I might let one go if the right deal comes by.  Here are the specs from online.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Caliber: 5.56 NATO
Barrel Length: 16.1""
Weight (unloaded): 7.3 lbs (16.1"" barrel)
Length (overall): 33.3"" - 36.5"" (16.1"" barrel)

Just look online for reviews if you have not seen one before and want to know the difference between a gas impingement system vs. gas piston system.  You will be greatly surprised of the reviews and even more so when you get a chance to fire one.  So let me hear what you have to offer and I will take all into consideration except for cheap firearms (only firearms nothing else like tools, audio and so on.). This is a quality fire arm so I expect to have offers of the same.  So just email me for any questions or further information.  Asking $1850 which includes the LWRC M6A2 with Troy iron sights.

992,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2695992,"For Sale:  For Sale: DESERT EAGLE 440 COR-BON CORBON COR®BON Rare Desert Eagle 50AE, .440 CORBON Magnum, 44 Magnum, and 357 Magnum Collection","Junction, Western Slope, Colorado","$ 5,550","Listed On: Saturday, February 15, 2014",Handguns,Israel Weapon Industries                                                                                ,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Desert Eagle Mark XIX 50AE Magnum, 440 COR-BON CORBON COR®BON Magnum, 44 Magnum, and 357 Magnum Collection which includes 9 barrels. Two each (6 inch and 10 inch) in each designated Caliber with an additional 10 inch 50AE barrel. (Total of 3 barrels in 50AE). 7 Barrels have never been mounted. 2 Barrels have only had 3 rounds through them. These barrels are preferable to the new ""picatinny"" railed barrels for the experienced operator and DE collector. The 440 Barrels are the original rare FACTORY STAMPED BARRELS.

Please notice the custom fitted MP5 TYPE Forearm which fits all the long barrels, including the laser when the laser is mounted with the long barrels. The MP5 fore-grip is ""quick"" off and on as needed. The strong RED laser is extremely rare, brand new in the box, fits the pistol frame with any mounted barrel, and was custom made for the Desert Eagle as shown. Also, I may include the holographic water and fog proof site.

The package includes Ammo> 50AE (6 Boxes Hornady XMP and 80 rounds FMJ), 100 rounds of Rare 440 Magnum COR®BON factory built ammo, and high quality ""Silver Plated"" FMJ 44 Magnum Ammo. Custom $250 ""Cross Shoulder"" or ""over the Shoulder"" Black Leather Quick Draw Holster (you can aim and shoot the DE from the holster without having to draw the weapon!) with an Additional DE Emblem Factory tactical holster and separate custom made tactical DE leg holster. 

The Package Includes a full set of rare .440 COR®BON Magnum RCBS reload dies with rare custom factory made .440 reamer. Includes 44 Magnum RCBS reload dies. Also comes with the 357 Bolt and assembly tool and original owners manual. Notice the HOGUE rubber grips with unique D RING. Original grip included. 

A heavy duty two layer dual key lockable aluminum ""strong box"" holds barrels and accessories. High end BOYT Black Waterproof Case with sheepskin lining (as shown) customized for the DE Pistol and Mags. Six Magazines, two in each caliber (the 440 rounds use the 50AE Mags) are included with the package. The 400+ rounds of ammo and reload dies also come with their own lockable aluminum case. I have seen the ammo going for as much as $8-10 a round on Gunbroker if you can find it. 

This is the Ultimate DE Collection that took over 5 years to build and complete and is EXTREMELY RARE and one of a kind. The individual items, along with the design and fabrication of the MP5 fore-grip, add up to considerably more than my price.

So to recap:
DE Mark XIX 50AE Pistol with 9 Barrels including TWO Extremely Rare FACTORY MADE AND STAMPED COR®BON 440 Magnum in 6 and 10 inches/ 400+ ROUNDS OF AMMO/ 3 Custom Holsters/ 3 High End Cases/ Custom DE Red Laser/ Custom MP5 Forearm_Fore-grip/ Hogue Grips with D-ring/ and Reload dies for the 440 COR®BON and the 44 Magnum. Also, I may include the holographic water and fog proof sight.

If you are interested in buying just the 440 Barrels, ammo, and reload die set with custom 440 reamer I would need to get a premium of 2.5k to break up the set. This amount is firm and intended to discourage less than serious inquires. I can arrange a lay away through my FFL but Please don't contact me IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY AT THE TIME YOU make Contact! I have received many offers but I'm simply not interested in breaking up the collection for less than a premium. The best deal for the buyer is the whole collection as a package. MARCH UPDATE: THE 440 COLLECTION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS PART OF THIS OFFER. PRICE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED.

I WILL SELL THE OTHER 6 BARRELS AND THE REMAINDER OF THE COLLECTION (50AE AMMO, CUSTOM DE LASER, ETC) WITHOUT THE PISTOL (AND ONE 44 BARREL) FOR @ $3550.

This Package will be transferred through my Colorado FFL and is not intended as, advertised as, or should be interpreted as a ""Private Sale Offering"" in Colorado.

I'm a registered member with ARMSLIST but when I changed my email  with this listing it came up showing me as an unregistered user. Guess the software automatically does that when you change your original email address.

This investment grade package is meant for someone who can really appreciate it ... and what it took to make it happen. Not really meant for the bargain shopper looking for a desperate seller, this collection is indeed just what it is, and the only complete one like it that I have ever seen in over 25 years as a DE collector.

Shooting the Desert Eagle in 440 CorBon is a truly unique experience that will put a smile on your face for a week or so! I will also include  the hard to find Reloading Specifications and details for the Corbon 440."
