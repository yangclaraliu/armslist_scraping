I have a used FN Hi power that I bought off of a gentleman in FL. I have since decided it is not the gun for me (not a fan of the small safety, and I get hammer bite like no other) I have since decided to stick with my 1911's and Beretta's. 

The gun comes with Pachmayer grips and 1 FN mag. I actually have 2 more mags on the way as well as a Wolf Performance spring kit to replace all springs with extra power ones. The mags and springs should be delivered any day now. I can work a deal on those as well if you'd like. 

This is an ACTUAL FN made Hi power, not FEG or FM clone. Check out prices online for the FN's and Brownings new/used. You will see this is a decent deal for one. The price reflects the holster wear this one has. It was carried A good amount but not shot much, (evident by the sharp clear rifling as well as clean and perfect internals.

The gun functions flawlessly like all Hi-powers do! I am located in Wooster, OH and looking to get 450 for the gun, 1 mag, and pachmayer grips. for 500 I will throw in the Extra mags and spring kit when they come in!

If you know quality rimfire rifles, you know the CZ 452.  This one is the left-hander's version of the beautiful LUX configuration.  It is in the box, unfired.  It has very nicely grained Turkish walnut wood.  Out of production now, this gun is getting hard to find, especially in the left hand configuration.  

I bought it to shoot, not just sit in the safe.  Life changed.  

Yeah, your AR-22 looks cool, but this is the survival rifle to grab when you need to shoot out the deer's left eye.

My price is fair and firm.  No trade or lowball offers please.

The P250Â®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUERÂ® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

 NEVER USED
Leupold 2.5-8x32 VX-3 Handgun Scope - Matte Black Finish, Duplex Reticle (#67825)

LeupoldÂ® Handgun scopes deliver the extended eye relief, generous eyebox, and the bright, crystal-clear optics you need to shoot accurately with todayâ¢s modern, high-powered handguns. Theyâ¢re also extensively tested, to ensure theyâ¢re ready to withstand the crushing recoil dealt out by these hard-kicking guns. The Leupold Golden RingÂ® is your performance guarantee. A variable power handgun scope that has proven itself on the hunt.
â¢
The Xtended Twilight Lens SystemâÂ¢ optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.

â¢
DiamondCoat 2âÂ¢ lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provide the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered.

â¢
The twin bias spring exerts up to 30 percent more holding force on the erector, virtually eliminating erector system backlash and stress on the vital internal working of the scope, for longer life.

â¢
Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooterâ¢s eye, for a brighter image with higher resolution.

â¢
Finger-adjustable, cryogenically treated, Â¼-MOA click windage and elevation adjustments with resettable pointer dials marking the zero point.

â¢
Tactile power indicator also features built-in range estimation functions and graphite O-rings for easy operation. 

â¢
Internally threaded, lockable, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Alumina rubber eyepiece guard.

â¢
A durable Leupold Scope Cover is included to protect your valuable VX-3 riflescope during transport or when not in use.

â¢
Incredibly rugged, with absolute waterproof integrity.

â¢
As a final touch to the VX-3, Leupold mounts a 24k gold-plated ring and medallion to each scope.

185,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2179185,For Sale:  32acp. Aguila 71gr FMJ. Over 700 rounds.  1/2 box extra for free.,"Romulus, Detroit, Michigan",$ 240,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 15, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check the internet. You won't find this much 32acp ammo with shipping or tax cheaper than this. If you do let me know.

I have 13.5 boxes of Aguila 32acp ammo. I purchased them earlier this year so they are not old leftovers and it is a pretty good shooting ammo from the Kel Tec P-32 based on personal experience. Low recoil, 905fps advertised velocity, decent muzzle flash, and I would say it falls in the middle in terms of soot and residue. It is a full length, round nose, FMJ so it won't rim lock. Reloadable brass. The last box is a combo of 27 rounds of Aguila and 23 rounds of high velocity (1000fps) Sellier and Bellot 73gr FMJ

Reason I'm selling is because I might want to buy another gun(s) and this would net me part of the cash I need. I'm only asking exactly what I paid for it, $17.25 a box (I actually paid a few cents more due to shipping) so $69 for 4 boxes MINIMUM. I won't sell less than 4 boxes at a time.

If someone buys all 14 boxes for $240 I will throw in 12 more rounds of S&B and 10 rounds Fiocchi high velocity 73gr FMJ for free.

The price is firm. I would rather shoot the stuff than take a loss. Local pick up only. Located a few miles northwest of Metro Airport. 18 and over. Thanks for looking."

This gun is the rarest of the rare! The .30-1903 was adopted by the Army in 1903 to replace the aging .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) which had been adopted in 1892. Winchester first offered the model 1895 in the .30-03 cartridge in 1905. Unfortunately, the '03 cartridge became all but obsolete only a year later with the adoption by the Army of the .30-06 in 1906. (Commercial ammo for the '03 was made up until WWI.) It wasn't until 1908 that Winchester produced the 1895 in '06. This pictured gun was born in 1912. Bright bore with great rifling, 50% bluing, wood has no cracks and has great wood to metal fit, originally had a Lyman 21 sight which was removed and a rear marble was installed. I would replace marble with a Lyman 21 to bring it back to originally configuration. This gun is also more desirable because it does not come with the standard 28"" barrel, but the 24""."

390,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2179390,For Sale:  Rustic Custom Patio Table,"Prosper, Dallas, Texas",$ 325,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 29, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I I built this out of a giant spool. I trimmed 8"" off of one side, so chairs would slide underneath. I sanded the entire table down and stained it. Then applied 3 coats of polyurethane. I wanted to add some feet to the table so water from rain wouldn't get underneath and cause rot. I cut the center tread out of a tire and cut strips to attach to the bottom of the table as feet. I attached them with 305 stainless steel screws to remove the possibility of rust. I attached a round 5'x5'x1"" beveled edge solid marble table top. The marble is broken in 3 pieces as you can see in the pictures. The marble got broken in a move and I decided it would make a great patio table top. This marble top was a 3K table prior to me breaking it.  I also applied a almond silicone to the cracks of the marble top to eliminate the possibility of water seeping through them and resting on the wood underneath. It measures 60""x60""x38"". Would be best with bar stools (not included). This table would look great on a large covered patio. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and would like to come see it. 

I can deliver local as long as you supply some help. Or trade for guns and or ammo.  Looking for 9mm, 45acp, 44mag, 38spl and 22 guns and ammo.

I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.

Gun is in fair to good condition, the rear sight elevator is bent, replacing it generally runs $5-7 but I never bothered replacing it because it always shot well for me.

The gun sells for $750 plus tax new.  I am asking $675.  You're saving well over $100 on a nice remington rifle.  I will not travel anywhere far.  I can meet you in a public place in the Sidney or Piqua area.

The story on the triangular barrel is that a triangle surrounding a circular axis will move the heat to the furthest points away from the axis.  In doing so, preventing fouling or warping of the rifling and a quicker dissipation of heat from the barrel.  The barrel is ported(they come this way new in the box) to supposedly help reduce felt recoil.

I do have the box and the owners manual and the purchaser will get those as well.  I also have more photos but I cannot upload them because of the size of the image.  I would gladly email or text pictures to interested buyers.

I am open to trades.  No 22's or junk.  Not interested in hi point or other low end firearms.  Mostly interested in cash.

The SIG SAUERÂ® P226Â® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIGâs entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

The SIG SAUERÂ® SP2022Â® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIGâs black NitronÂ® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

The SIG SAUERÂ® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in 9mm its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Have a few in mind so i'll list them here:

Talo Birdshead Vaquero - Preferably stainless. Had one previously and traded it, if anyone might know where my original Vaquero is I'd greatly appreciate it, serial number 511-34540. Will consider a basic Vaquero but will pay less for one. ""New Vaquero"" model prefered

Springfield GI or Mil Spec - Looking for stainless ONLY. Prefer a GI but will take a good condition Mil Spec. Looking to pay the same for either ($550-$600). Interested in like new condition on these Springfields and very much prefer the Illinois frame stamp over the Brazil-Imbel frame stamp

Smith & Wesson Model 13 or 65 - Looking for either of these in 4"" barrel configuration. Round or square butt either is fine. Looking in the $500 and under range, would really prefer to spend $350-$400. Condition isn't a big factor for me as long as it functions well. Looking for a shooter not a safe queen, something I don't have to worry about scuffing up or getting holster wear. Will also consider a 612, 581, or 681. Not real interested in 686s as I'm much more of a fan of fixed sights

Colt 1991/Series 70 - Willing to pay up to $900 for a very good condition Colt Series 70 custom shop reproduction especially in stainless. Will consider a 1991 but very much prefer the new Series 70 models

I will not pay retail price for used guns. As soon as it passes over the counter it is considered used even if it never leaves the box. The retail prices on the Vaquero and Springfields are $580 and $710 so $500 and $550-$600 is realistic
