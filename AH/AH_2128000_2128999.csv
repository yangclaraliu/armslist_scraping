With the bullet proof in line v6. It has just under 191 miles. There are no rips or stains on the interior and it comes from a non-smoking home. All of the following things have been done in the last year and I have the shop receipts for most of it.

 Tune up with platinum spark plugs, coolant flush and fill, new radiator, alternator, serpentine belt, battery, brake pads (rotors were resurfaced), all four shocks, hood and tailgate lift support struts, new dash speakers(the jeep has an infinity sound system.), it also has very nice firestone destination tires that are less then two years old.

 I just had it into the shop to get it all checked out before I put it up for sale and it needed new sway bar links and bushings in the rear end and a new valve cover gaskets so I had that done. Along with an engine degreasing and a oil change.

 The only issue that I did not get to is the air bag light is on. It may need a new clock spring (about $80 for the part online.) or it just may need to be reconnected. Other then that it needs nothing. The 4 wheel dive works great and so does the heat so it is all ready for the upcoming winter. Clean and clear title in hand. Tabs are good until June. It has not been in any accidents. I am asking $3300 OBO. Email with any questions and thank you for your time."

ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Smith & Wesson .38 Special Model 14-3. K-38 

Masterpiece is a great find for the Advanced Smith & Wesson Collector! 

Made in 1967, the pistol almost looks like it walked out of the S&W 

factory yesterday. The 8 3/8” pinned factory barrel has an adjustable 

rear sight and a high partridge front sight. Built on the “K” frame, 

the pistol has a high-polish factory blue finish with gold-filled 

wording and logo, and a beautiful set of S&W “Goncalo Alves” wooden 

checkered factory grips with S&W medallions. It is an understatement to 

say this is an attractive handgun! If you look real close you will see 

faint turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s about it as far as finish 

issues, the gun easily rates 95-98%+ condition. The bore on this gun is 

MINT, and double-action trigger pull is very smooth. Back in the day, 

the K-38 Masterpiece was coveted by Competition Shooters, now 

Collectors love them, and you will not find a nice one than this one,

Built on the same high-performance glass-filled nylon frame,
the SR40 offers all the great ergonomic features that made
the SR9 and SR9c a success: a slim, narrow frame with a short
trigger reach, reversible backstrap for an arched or flat
configuration, and fully ambidextrous controls. The
through-hardened, stainless steel slide on the SR40 is .060""
wider than that of the SR9; the added mass of the slide
reduces slide velocity during cycling, reducing recoil and
improving service life.  It offers modern safety features such
as a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator, striker
blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, and a
frame-mounted ambidextrous manual safety.

PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Rapid Deployment Stock™ (RDS™) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded. The unique 5-position sliding stock means that whether you are 5-foot 4"" or 6-foot 4"" the Tactical Target Rifle will fit you.Caliber: 5.56 Nato Barrel: 16.5 inches Chrome Lined Twist: 1 in 9 inches Action: Semi-automatic Receiver: Flat topped with full length Picatinny Rail Magazines: 1 - 30-round Overall Length: Stock Open and Fully Extended - 36 inches Stock Open and telescoped in - 33 inches Stock Folded - 26.25 inches Weight: 7.6 pounds"

Sound familiar? Why do they frequently seem to have 3, 6, or 9 boxes? Because 3 is the walmart limit. Take your wife and a friend and you can buy up to 9. Want to know what these clowns actually paid and how bad they are reaming your behind?

Much of what is posted on this site came from Walmart. I have been lucky enough to be there at the right time and able to get what I need to keep going to the range. I do not sell any of my ammo, I shoot it.
Here are some prices that I can back up with receipts. Some quite recent. I did not include tax, but I never paid as much in sales tax as I did for the ammo, doubling the prices here.

 1,000 Round box of Winchester M-22 LR $49.99
 550 Round box of Federal 36 grain copper plated 22LR $23.97
 555 Round box of Winchester white box 22LR $23.97

 525 Round box of Remington Golden bullets 22LR $22.97
 225 Round box of Remington Golden bullets 22LR $10.27
 50 Round box of Federal Champion 9mm luger $14.97
 325 Round box of Federal Auto Match 22LR $18.97  (although these are getting rare and the supply seems to be drying up in my area)

 These are just the ones I can find receipts for that I bought over the last 5 months!
 The prices have gone up from last year, but not all that much!
 It takes a lot of patience and persistence to get this ammo at Walmart. I sometimes check in everyday on the way to work or on my way home. If I am lucky, I average a successful purchase every 3-6 weeks. That's' all it takes to keep me shooting, and set a box aside for when I don't find any.
 Keep buying from these clowns at their mega inflated prices and they'll keep packing it in your rear.
 By the way,to all you scalpers who will send me nasty emails for exposing you. I will post your email addresses and comments. So you might think twice and keep your comments to yourselves."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

Blackhole Weaponry Barrels employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

The sticker ring in picture one has been cleaned off. I don't recall ever actually using the element as I generally smoked one cigar after the other when I was using this travel case. Keeps smokes VERY good, have used it on more than a few camping trips. You can fit a lot more in this case if you take the foam out (I have fit 42 in this one, XI18-24)


Next are the Padrons. Folks, I can't tell you how awesome and consistent Padron cigars are. These particular cigars are the king of their line ups. The Padron 1926 80th Anniversary Perfectos and the Padron 1926 40th Anniversary.

The 80th Anniversaries retail for $31. These were purchased in 2008 and have pretty much been sitting since then, with me occasionally taking them out to look at them lovingly. The two Perfectos on the bottom are Maduros, the rest are naturals. I'm going to sell these for $29 each

The 40th Anniversaries retail for $26. These were also purchased in 2008 and have pretty much been sitting since then, with me occasionally taking them out to look at them lovingly. These belicosos I believe are all maduros, but honestly, I couldn't tell you, they all look dark to me. I'm going to sell these for $24 each.

These prices are firm. I am not willing to trade on these right now, I'm trying to fund my 1911 purchase. I will however ship the smokes on my dime. Buy 1, buy 5, I don't care. I will send them first class if you buy 1, priority if you buy more. Or you could meet me where I work in Lincoln, MA (Outside of Hanscom AFB) or in Nashua, NH (my home town).

The travel humidor is pick up only, same places.

I will take PayPal. Don't worry about the fee, I'll pay it. Like I said, just trying to fund my 1911, and get people some quality kick as cigars that have been lovingly aged for you. If I can sell them all, I'd be pretty friggen happy. If you want to buy all of the cigars at once, because that's the way you roll, I'll give you 10% off ($294 x .90 = $264. It's like getting one of them for free!)

So as a review: I take PayPal, and will ship only the cigars on my dime. If you would rather pick them up, I live in Nashua, NH and work in Lincoln, MA (outside of Hanscom). The humidor is PICK UP ONLY.

Buy these smokes, they will curl your toes, blow up your skirt and put hair on your chest. One warning though, you may never want to smoke anything else......."

I probably put 300-500 rounds thru it over the years.  It is a good shooter with an excellent bore.  It is a keyhole forged upper with a 20 inch heavy barrel.  Barrel and upper are not brand marked anywhere that I can see.  Lower is a Fulton Armory forged lower that I built using a milspec lower parts kit.  Parts kit is either RRA or DPMS...cant remember which but I always bought milspec.  Has standard A2 buttstock with trap door.  There are a couple knicks and scratches here and there which is to be expected.  Some finish loss on underside of carry handle from the nut where I once had optics mounted.  Will throw in a couple of used 30 round military mags.  Will consider reasonable cash offer....Cash is King.  Would also consider a partial trade on any Glock 9MM in good shape with cash coming this way or I am also interested in a CZ P07 9MM in good shape with cash coming this way  .

This rifle started life as a Bushmaster Varmint/Predator rifle.  I decided that I did not like the barrel on it so I sent the gun to Compass Lake engineering in Florida to do some work to it.  
They replaced the barrel with a Krieger premium SS barrel, and then turned it down under the handguard and cut deep full length fluting and fitted a custom made and lathe turned removable muzzle brake on it.  The new bolt was headspaced to the barrel correctly to ensure the most accuracy possible.  A new Nordic vented handguard was fitted, along with a low profile railed gas block.  They installed their two stage match trigger system and tuned it for correct function.  It also has a Magpul MOE stock and a Target grip installed.  The scope is available if you would like it, it is a SWFA SS 10X scope in SWFA heavy rings, if you dont want that I will discount the rifle $200, but I will not sell the scope separately.
Overall this is a fantastic shooting rifle that will make little holes at long distances with ease.  It has been 100% reliable for me but I am getting into some different shooting disciplines so it needs to go.  If I add up the entire cost of buying and building this rifle it is over twenty five hundred dollars, but I am asking only $1600 with the scope and mounts, $1400 without them. I am not interested in trades, I need the cash.

The SR45 has a unique reversible backstrap that's either flat or arched, allowing shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip without the use of separate inserts of special tools. Its high-visibility 3-dot sighting system features a raked-forward front sight for easy removal from the holster and a rear sight that's windage and elevation adjustable. The ambidextrous thumb safety and d-shaped magazine release are easy to reach and actuate, while an integral accessory mounting rail provides space for mounting lights, lasers, and other tactical accessories. Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber. Every SR45 ships with two 10-round, flush-fit magazines, a magazine loader, and a hard plastic case."

 Certified CCH Instructor
 NRA Instructor

 By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

 The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

 There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

 I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

 You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet I have a .22 Rugger that you may use. it is free to use my pistol If you bring ammo with you (it shoots .22 long rifle) or you may purchase ammo from me for an additional $5.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

HISTORY:The AP-9 is a pistol that was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, North Carolina, US AAArms began distributing the AP-9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001. The AP-9 looks like a small submachinegun, but has no automatic fire function. This firearm is basically a large pistol that looks very much like the Intratec TEC-9.
The standard AP9 has a 5"" barrel; the AP-9 target began with a 12"" barrel (AP-9/12), but this was later reduced to 11"" (AP-9/11 Target); they both have a separate fore end and a fluted barrel. These firearms were banned by most states after the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and other pieces of legislation, even after more cosmetic changes designed to make them appear to be less threatening. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 a ten round magazine was introduced. Original magazine capacities included 5 round, 10 round, 20 round and 32 round capacities."

The gun is all factory stock and has had just under 250 flawless rds fired to test for function.  I have tested cheap Brown Bear steel cased, hand loads, and factory surplus ammo in the gun with no issues.  This gun is a tack driver, sub MOA, I was getting 3/4"" groups at 100 yards! With an upgraded trigger and better optics this thing could probably get closer to 1/2""!

It will come with a total of (11) 20 round mags.  (6) C Products mags, 5 still NIP, (3) factory DPMS mags, and (2) Magpul LR308 Pmags.  It will also include the factory hard case.

I'm asking $1,200 OBO for the entire package. I'm not interested in parting out any of the mags unless the rifle sells first without the mags. I prefer FTF in central AL, but I will ship on your dime.  We can work out actual shipping costs once a deal is agreed upon.  It would probably be easier for me to send through an FFL since finding a big enough box will be very difficult. I'll accept DISCREET paypal gift or add 3% fees.  I'll also accept USPS MO or cash for FTF.  

I'm need of some cash to help get caught up on bills so I'm not looking for any trades for the most part.  I may willing to look at a .308 bolt gun that I could use for deer hunting.  The trade would need to come with at least $700-$800.
