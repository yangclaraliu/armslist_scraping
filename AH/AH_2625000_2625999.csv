Sneaky Pete Holster has double belt clips which can accommodate a belt up to 1.5"" inches wide.  The holster is made of high quality soft leather, and when worn on the belt resembles a cell phone case.  The advantage of this design is that it allows you to carry your XDS concealed, but with full and easy access.  Now it's possible to wear whatever you want, whenever you want to.  Don't dress around your gun anymore.
The holster is made inside and out of glove-quality leather, and uses two magnets to stay closed.  Each holster is designed for your specific firearm, and the opening is made in such a way that you cannot accidentally  place your finger on the trigger during draw.  The Kydex insert ensures that a smooth, silent draw occurs every time.
The use of double stitching and steel rivets guarantees that this holster will last for years to come.  All available options are listed above, and the holster can be ordered either with the belt loop, or optional belt clip. We design every holster to be as small as possible and still fit your pistol."

206,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2625206,For Sale:  PRICE REDUCED - $700 OBO - Musket composed of US Model 1816 stock and parts from other antique guns,"Eastside, Tucson, Arizona",$ 700,"Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"REDUCED - $700 OBO

I am selling a musket that is composed of parts from different guns.  A local dealer here in Tucson has identified the stock as that of a US Model 1816 Musket.   The other parts are more mysterious.  Here is the descriptive information on those parts:

Barrel: The barrel is .69 caliber, so I am guessing that it is early American (or perhaps French) rather than British.  It is 42.5 inches long with the tang (40.25 inches without).  Someone belled out the barrel at some point, however, and I do not know whether the length was altered when that was done.  The barrel is round and smooth-bore.  (There are some faint lines inside the barrel, but they do not appear to be rifling.)  The barrel has the initials ""N J"" on the side opposite the lock. On the bottom, I found the marks ""6⁰ N 10"" grouped together at one spot, and the single letter ""S"" at another spot. The barrel has a production year on top, in the breech area. It appears to be 1801, but the third digit in the year is gouged and difficult to read. A little farther forward on the top of the barrel, I found some initials, but they are very difficult to read. I think the initials consist of one or two letters followed by “& P” (or maybe “& D”).

Lock: The lock is a would-be Tower lock.  It has the word ""Tower"" and the crown in the right places, but lacks the year and the monarch's initials. Inside, it appears to have the letter “D” on the mainspring.  I have read that a lot of imported English locks with imitation Tower markings were sold in America the early 19th Century.

Ramrod: The ramrod, which appears to be from yet another gun, has the numbers “5 5” and small crown on it.

Other information:  The musket is from the New York area, and the “N J” on the barrel may refer to New Jersey.  The stock has the words “1827 US” hand-carved on it.

I have sought help in identifying the parts by posting the above information and pictures of the musket on a few different forums.  I have received a lot of different opinions and helpful information, but nothing definitive.

My best guess is that an early American gunsmith or militiaman or hunter assembled this musket from spare parts in 1827 or earlier.  This is only a guess, however, so use your own judgment.

Price: $700 or best offer.  All reasonable offers considered.

In addition to the two pictures here, I have posted a lot of detailed pictures of the musket at Photobucket:

It's a 5 round bolt action riffle. This gun is in perfect condition. Although I have been told (based upon seeing the pictures) that is gun has been refurbished, but my friend who sold it to me assured me that it was not. I am willing to take pictures of any part if requested. 
Ether way, this riffle is very nice and I do not particularly want to give it away simply because I collect World War Two items and I love that it has a soviet stamp on it, sadly however I would like a pistol and have plenty of riffles. This gun is great for collectors of soviet memorabilia, especially with the hammer and sickle stamp located at the top of the riffle.
So if you have a pistol and would like to trade, text me. REDACTED

Small rant: SERIOUSLY, I hate that people mix up price with quality. This gun is not only reliable, but it's dirt cheap to shoot! It's ether equal to it better then most modern riffles, which are expensive to shoot. This guns history is outstanding! Two snipers had 500+ kills with this gun during World War Two, not to mention you can use it as a standard combat riffle. 
I have two of these riffles! I use them for self defense for my home. I'd like to see a man break into my house and survive a bullet from this gun... And keep em comin! I got enough rounds to last me a life time! Know how much I paid for a lifetime ammount of these bullets? 500 bucks. Zombie apocalypse? I don't have a thing to worry about, thanks to the reliability of this gun, and the cheap as dirt ammo, I got enough to supply myself as my friends for whatever happens... Face it! While your buying expensive hard to find bullets for your 30x30 or whatever you have, I've already spend a small sum for a life times ammout of bullets for this gun that has own most of Russia's wars! Nazis didn't see this gun coming did they? I have two! I don t need two of these guns, and all I'm asking for is a god damn handgun, of any kind! Why is that so hard of a trade? I mean sure I could just buy a handgun right?? But what about Obama????? You know, the man who will take every last gun you own? Yeah, register your guns, and watch the government take those away when Obama declares martial law. This is AMERICA! We shouldn't have to worry about te government spyin on us and taking our rights now should we? You want a Reliable gun that will get you far and is cheap to shoot? I got you, brother. What do I want in return? A handgun, so I can make use of my concealed carry permit. God Bless America, THANK YOU!"

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

 For those of you who know what this gun is about, It was manufactured in 1961 (92XXX)
 Engraved by ""Legeirs"" who was a contract engraver for Browning in Belgium and not regular staff such as the likes of Angelo Bee and others. Legiers is one of the more rare names of browning engravers.
 This gun has been shot, so I am not about to claim it as pristine or anything like that. It has been to a few gun clubs in its lifetime, some by me, some by others before me.
 As a trap gun, it shoots like having your head on a pillow. It is soft and no face bite. The wood is gorgeous and has a lot of figure, 32 line per inch checkering, long tang flat knob pistol grip, original blueing is turning plum, wood has some handling marks on it. Original Browning recoil pad, standard 14 1/4 LOP with cast-on.
 The gun will come in a Browning traditional tan hard case, however it probably is not the case it left belgium in.
 Its not a gun I need to sell, but would like to convert it into a newer Polaris Sportsman, either an 800 or 500. We can talk about those details offline.
 My terms will be cash, green foldable money or a clear titled Polaris Sportsman or combination thereof.
 This will be a face to face transaction, meeting place to be decided mutually.
 I will NOT ship this gun. this will be mano a mano.
 $6300 or trade for a Polaris, other guns maybe. We should talk

Excellent condition.  It has been to the range a couple of times, but it sits in the closet and longs for adventure in the great outdoors.  I'd like to sell it to put funds towards another shooting project.

No trades please.  I've had trade offers for a guitar, an old truck muffler, a big box of Legos that the kids don't play with anymore, and an iRobot Roomba thats battery just doesn't hold a charge like it use to.  Come on people!  It's an inexpensive 22.   Pony up with the cash!

I'm asking the ridiculous price of $180.  You would be crazy to pay that much.  If you are a shrewd negotiator you can get work me down to $150 and then brag to your friends about how you got me to come down $30 on the price.  Please don't ask for anything lower.  I won't respond.

Oh, and local Savannah area sale only.  I love the guys that will methodically negotiate the price down to their fancy, only then to inform me that they live in Kentucky, that it might be a stretch to drive that far, and that they are going to have to pass on the purchase.

$650 with the LONE WOLF Conversion Barrel and 9mm Factory Magazine 

The 40-9 Conversion Barrel is a great accessory.  I bought this barrel and the 9mm  factory magazine brand new about 2 weeks ago.  It allows you to shoot 9mm ammo from your .40 firearm.  Cheaper range practice, less recoil, ability to fire 2 calibers from the same gun - it is basically like having a Glock 19 for an extra $100.  It works flawlessly with 9mm 115 and 124 grain ammos.  It even eats up the dirty stuff like Brown Bear 115.  The only problems I ran into was with the really cheap steel cased TulAmmo (Russian) Ammo.

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

I carry it for work occasionally, but besides that it sits in its case. I am meticulous about cleaning my firearms so it has never been neglected, and I am the original owner.

Figured it would be worth a shot, maybe someone bought a 23 and does not like the ""snappy"" recoil and would prefer the more straight back recoil of a .45.

I understand wear and tear, so I am okay with it not being in as great of shape as my 21 is. It comes with the 2 mags, case, and whatever ammo is in the mags (1 mag hollow points, 1 mag ball.)
