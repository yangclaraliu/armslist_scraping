I am selling (I fear I wouldn't be able to resist an appealing trade, tentatively open to offers) my Sig Sauer Adaptive Carbine Platform. Adds 5 picatiny rails to your pistol on the top, bottom, and sides. Made of aircraft aluminum and greatly decreases felt recoil and greatly increases range and controllability. Comes with 1 point sling, push button sling swivel, removable forward hand stop, and I will include CAA flip up sights. 

 Connects very easily and sturdily to most full size pistols with a rail. Sig claims ""universal"" compatibility, I have used it with both my Glock model 22 .40 cal and my Sig sp2022 9mm and can say it only takes maybe a minute to change the gun it is attached to. I can also attest to its sturdiness while firing and can honestly say this product works as I expected if not a little better. I lament to sell it, but figure it is better than selling any of my actual firearms and I have invested too much into my firearms and accessories collection at this point and have to liquidate.

The original Intratec recoil buffers were manufactured off-shore with materials that do not react well with the oil used to clean firearms. When the buffer come in contact with the oil used to clean the firearm they become very thirsty and expanded as the oil was absorbed. The expansion of the buffers interfered with the travel of the bolt and caused all sort's of problems. After a few years, the buffers begin to dry-rot. Eventually they crumbl and fall apart. as do the plate's. Replacing the buffer with our new a buffers and plates will insure the proper travel, reduce the felt recoil and improve the overall operation of the firearm. The buffer's and plate's do not come attached. Use a very small amount of ""Krazy Glue"" (not-part of this package) to attach the buffer to the backer plate.

The aforementioned overboring to a .733 bore and the lengthened forcing cones is for better patterning.  The gun has a 3 inch chamber. Included as extras for this gun are a Benelli cryo treated XF (extra full) choke for you turkey hunters out there, plus a second recoil pad so you can vary your length of pull according to how thick your winter jacket is.  Thicker jacket equals use the shorter recoil pad. Summertime equals use the longer. Fall? It's a toss up, up to you.  The extra pad and choke are about a $170 value. Also included are the factory shims for adjustment, a patterning test done by Benelli, Owners manual, and original Benelli case.  This is by far the finest automatic I have bought. You'll love the feel of this gun and be amazed at how fast it is, and with control. 

This gun also features a camo tape over most of the metal parts and the stock, done by hand. You can leave on the max-4 tape to protect the finish on the gun, or take it off and the tape won't affect the quality of the finish. 

The  ported barrel (standard from the factory) does a great job of eliminating muzzle rise. The gun is easy to shoot, and comfortable, and quick and steady.

97,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2863097,For Sale:  All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!,"USA, New Jersey, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 26, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"A SAID DAY IN HELL HAS COME.
HELL? THE UNITED STATED OF AMERICA.

people something needs fixing.

How the Obama administration Executive branch of our government uses the Environmental Protection Agency, Executive Orders, etc. to circumvent our Constitution and Congress to achieve a virtual dictatorship and transform our USA into the United Socialist States of America.

Subject:  LAST SMELTING PLANT GONE ................

All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas! 
This move will also make the cost 100 LL (100 low lead aviation fuel) UNAFFORDABLE. Approximately 2 g of lead is added to each gallon of aviation fuel!

There are numerous alarming reasons why the US government and the military have been buying up all the ammo. Here’s one of them.


Obama and the EPA just shut down the last lead smelting plant in the US. They raised the EPA regulations by 10 fold and it would have cost the plant $100 million to comply. You can own all the guns you want, but if you can’t get ammo, you are out of luck.

Remember when Obama promised his minions that he was working on gun control behind the scenes?

Welcome to it. Now, all domestic mined lead ore will have to be shipped overseas, refined and then shipped back to the US. Not only will ammo now be even harder to come by, the demand and the process of supply will cause the price to skyrocket even more.

And ponder this… there is an excellent chance that Obama will rig the market to where all ammo has to be purchased from a government entity instituting de facto ammo registration.

So much for the Second Amendment. There has not been a peep about this in the major news outlets and it is done.

With the US no longer producing lead, all supplies will now have to come from China, Australia or Peru, with the overwhelming emphasis on China. More redistribution of wealth; more economic and liberty crippling of the US on tap.


The idiots at the EPA had this to say:


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the company “made a business decision” to shut down the smelter instead of installing pollution control technologies needed to reduce sulfur dioxide and lead emissions as required by the Clean Air Act.


The Doe Run Co. announced last year that it had dropped plans to build a new lead processing facility in Herculaneum that would have used a new, cleaner lead production technology. The company cited the $100 million project as too financially risky.





The EPA is playing Mafioso I guess — we didn’t make them shut down, they made a business decision. In other words, they couldn’t pay the extortion, so the thugs shut them down.




But Marxists will do or die and are doubling down on the destruction of energy in America, our way of life and the Constitution.


The smelting plant has known since 2010 this was coming. They couldn’t stop it and no one else rose up to stop it either. The business had been in production for 120 years and now goes the way of our auto industry.

The military’s obsession with ammo was related to security and supply. They knew this was coming too, so they bought up all they could get before the plug was pulled. Screw the average American. It’s as Chris Muir said, he’s not as worried about where the bullets will come from, as much as how the government will deliver them and I’m right there with him on that one.


So, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with shiny stuff, our Second Amendment rights are just about gone. Obama is one Marxist dictator who is savvy at political chess. He has flanked the Second Amendment. Now it’s our move.


You can Google this if you don’t believe it, or read this article:http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/16881-epa-closure-of-last-lead-smelting-plant-to-impact-ammunition-production


Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that’s for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you? Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50"

This Taurus is a very scarce variant of Taurus's Tracker series of revolvers, the Model 450 chambered in .45 Colt Caliber. Barrel is full shroud 2 inch ported with 6 vents. only a few that Taurus had on hand and sold early in 2008. Fjiestad's Blue Book indicates that the model was only produced from 1999 until 2002, and there are definitely no more .45 Colt Revolvers in Taurus's offerings for the past three years. This specimen is excellent mechanically; bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism with only light surface scratches. Capacity is 5 rounds of .45 Colt, and weight empty is a Night-Guard rivaling 20 ounces. We're offering this unique Taurus .45 Colt Tracker for only $500 plus tax and PICS. We will ship this to your local FFL dealer anywhere in the country for an additional fee.

This is a consignment sale and terms are up to the customer, not us. We will NOT hold the gun for anyone. First person to pay in full receives the gun! We can accept credit cards on out of area sales for fast processing.

No BS, smooth transactions. Local pickup is available for those around Pittsburgh, PA or we can ship to your local FFL for an additional fee. PA sales tax of 6% for local sales. All firearms sold with PICS check and all ATF paperwork required.

SIG SAUER's P238 pistol. Engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame Hogue Pebble texture grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

I have put about 100 rounds through this pistol and it is a soft shooter. The slide is very easy to rack and it has a nice grip. This gun is ideal for people that have a hard time with slides and recoil. 

From their website:
The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful.

This paticular rifle is a great shooter, accurate, and feeds reliably with good quality ammo.  But I am reducing my gun collection down to a few calibers.  So it must go and has been priced to move!

This rifle was one of the lot that Century manufactured out of ex-South African and Rhodesian R1 parts.  The reciever has a South African stamp and the bolt is Rhodesian.  It comes with two (admittedly well used) 20 round magazines.  Like I noted above, the rifle functions well and has a clean bore.  I put less than 4-500 rounds through it in the time I owned it, but as an old war veteran (well, at least parts of it) it has no doubt seen some previous use.

Now the boring bits...
The asking price is firm.  I prefer to sell local, but will drive as far as San Antonio or Waco to meet up with a buyer.  I will only ship to an FFL as a last resort.  I would consider a trade for a ""shooter"" grade M1 Garand or military M1 Carbine, but aside from that I am not interested in trades.  In replying to this ad you agree that you are legally able to own a firearm in the state of Texas.  Finally I reserve the right to refuse to sell to any person for any reason.

The intensity of the reticle can be adjusted to your specific lighting conditions. Two revolutionary new lens coatings add even more value to this feature packed scope. The Everlight and Proshield lens coatings were designed to help prevent glare and scratches, while providing you with a sharp image in both bright and low light conditions. When it comes to value you will have to agree the ATN 5x33L is the best illuminated reticle riflescope for your dollar.

I will not ship nor will I meet more than halfway from my living room recliner to my front door. Will only sell to idiots and morons that post outrageous priced guns and ammo ads on Armslist. Sorry
no trades even if you have a mint Colt Python. Its still not worth what my SKS is.

$500 cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know, I can add ammo, cash or??
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool.

1911 pistols

With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads.

$500 cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know, I can add ammo, cash or??
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool. 
Daewoo 
FAL 308/7.62 
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal.  
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too. 
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
1911 pistols
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models,
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,

.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Build details are below:

- Seekins Precision stripped lower
- Palmetto State Armory (PSA) lower parts kit

- Magpul MOE polymer trigger guard, Black

Lower was function checked after assembly and is good to go.

If a firearm trade is agreed upon, I'll do my best to meet you half way, within reason.  Email me through this page and we will work something out."

Thanks for all the offers and good trades, and... unique trades... 

I bought later last summer brand new and I have all the box, mags, glock mag loader, backstraps, glock tool, and paperwork for the gun. I shot about 30 or 40 rounds through it, and just can't get a Glock to feel right for me.  

I bought locally in Maryville, I had the gunsmith add TruGlo TRO Tritium and Fiber sights, and also a Ghost Rocket Trigger custom tune. It comes with three different firing pin springs, with one spring it's a 2.5lb pull, with another is 4.5lb, and with the other it's 5.5lbs, allowing one to pick the trigger pull for carry or for the range/competition. You'll get the OEM factory trigger setup, the Ghost Rocket and all the extra springs. The reset is the shortest I've felt on the glocks I've tried, and I think you'll find the same if you decide to look at it or buy. The gun is perfect and flawless and you wouldn't be able to tell it's been out of the box.

I have $630 in the gun, $100 more for the TRO sights, and another $35 for the trigger kit and install,and $45 for the light. I have $810 all totaled, I'm looking to sell for $650 which I think is a very fair price for the gun - you would be getting a competition, carry ready, and home defense FDE Glock 17 gun all-in-one at really fair price. If you'll drive to meet me, I'll throw in a box of winchester 9mm target ammo to get you started. 

If you want more detailed pictures I can send more and will take more if you want to see something specific. While it's in 99.99% condition, I understand you may want to see more pictures. 

I would prefer that we do a formal transfer at a local gun shop, and we can decide which one you prefer or is close to West Knoxville. I'm guessing the fee would be $10 for the transfer paperwork and processing since it's not being received/shipped, which I'll pay for. If you have a TCP and willing to sign a bill of sale, that will work as well. Unfortunately, I'm only interested in meeting in West Knoxville or Lenoir City area based on time available."

The guns works great, and is a lot of fun to shoot. These are becoming harder and harder to find and from what I've seen the prices are going up if you do find one. I am fortunate enough to have two of them, but I figure I might as well give someone else a chance to own one. I am in no hurry to get rid of this. I am just seeing what is out there, so feel free to offer. Looking more for trade but might sell if the price is right. The only price I could find was on impactguns.com for $800 but they were out of stock. Like I said Im really looking for a trade.

I called the Lexington ATF office, and they confirmed that: Since I'm not a manufacturer, there is no marking requirements and since this is a private, in state sale, there are no FFL requirements. Given those two things, they said it is *completely legal* to transfer this firearm in its current, unmarked configuration to another individual from Kentucky. That is straight from the ATF's mouth.


I'm selling my kit built AK, comes with two 30rd magazines and the buttstock cleaning kit. It has NO ATF recognized serial number, all of the original Romanian numbers match. The barrel is the original chrome lined barrel and is clean with strong rifling. It has a very nice Texas AK trigger, and a Tapco slotted brake that does a very good job at eliminating muzzle rise and reducing felt recoil. All engagement surfaces are polished, including the bottom of the bolt carrier, the hammer surfaces, disconnector, and trigger hook. The front trunnion is held in place with M6 hex bolts and loctite red, the trigger guard is screwed in with M5 hex bolts, and the rear trunnion is held in with rivets. None of the bolts have loosened at all in the 500 rounds I've fired through it.

It's a bit of a mismash build, but it's quite accurate and the trigger is very nice. Mechanically, it's a very sound rifle. I refinished the stock set with wine rit dye and tru oil after stripping the old finish and sanding to 320 grit.

As far as pricing goes, I'd like to at least recoup my kit and tool cost which is $700. I'd consider a trade to a Vz58 with some boot. If interested email through armslist or , send me a text message at (8five9)394-2one84.

The Troy Industries 13"" Bravo BattleRail is the latest advancement based on the incredibly successful TRX Extreme design. The new low-profile mounting system locks directly onto the standard factory 5.56mm rifle barrel nut and offers unparalleled strength and stability. The large, circular cooling holes help disperse heat allowing the rail to run cooler than other close to the barrel rail systems on the market.

The Bravo Rails are a one-piece, free floating quad rail handguard that offers enhanced accuracy over non-free-float designs, and unlimited mounting solutions thanks to the 4 full length M1913 Picatinny rails. All four rails are T-marked for consistent replacement of optics and accessories.

The Troy Industries 13"" Bravo BattleRail is manufactured from 6061 T6 hardened aircraft grade aluminum and MIL-SPEC Type III Hard coat anodized in matte black.

Features



Easy installation, mounts directly to standard factory AR-15 barrel nuts.

Konus KONUSPOT 20-60x80mm Spotting Scope w/ Tabletop Tripod, Camera Adapter and Carrying Case 7120 represents one of the best values in an 80mm spotting scope on the market today. When your 60mm spotting scope starts to fade at higher magnifications, you need the 80mm of aperture provided by the Konuspot 20-60x80. 80mm means not only an increase in brightness over smaller spotting scopes, it also means better image quality, especially at higher magnifications. Yet despite its size, the KONUS 20-60x80mm is a very reasonable 55 oz in weight. This makes it a perfect companion on your next outing to the shooting range.
The Konus KONUSPOT 20-60x80 Spotting Scope and Tripod also includes many of the nice touches you would expect on a great spotting scope, including the Konus 1300 Camera Adapter. You get an extendable sunshade, lockable collar that allows the scope to rotate 360 degrees when mounted on a tripod, a forty-five degree angled eyepiece, smooth precise focusing with a conveniently located focusing knob, objective cover, and a zippered nylon case. Simply put, you will not find a better  80mm spotting scope than the Konus Konuspot 20-60 x 80 mm Spotting Scope."

These Stainless Steel 30-30's are hard to find due to the fact that SS versions doesnt rust EVER, so no one wants to sell them, and also the fact that a 30-30 Winchester round isnt for the faintest of hearts. $800 obo Prefer cash but open to trades ie Glock, M&P 9,40,45 with laser+ etc etc or possibly a decent AR.

Awhile back I started making the transition from the AK47 to the Ar15/M4 platform, and this Sig was my last holdout. But, it's time for us to part ways as I have another project I want to work on and I have too many firearms as it is. 

Up for grabs is a gently used Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($199 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical needs. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2600 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. I prefer to deal with CHL/CCW owners (like myself), but no required. 
I am not looking to, or interested in, splitting up this package up. Please don't ask me how much for just the rfile, the magazines, etc. Lowballer’s need not waste your time or mine. I know what this is worth, and if you know what it is, then you know what its worth as well.

Awhile back I started making the transition from the AK47 to the Ar15/M4 platform, and this Sig was my last holdout. But, it's time for us to part ways as I have another project I want to work on and I have too many firearms as it is. 

Up for grabs is a gently used Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($199 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical needs. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2600 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. I prefer to deal with CHL/CCW owners (like myself), but no required. 
I am not looking to, or interested in, splitting up this package up. Please don't ask me how much for just the rfile, the magazines, etc. Lowballer’s need not waste your time or mine. I know what this is worth, and if you know what it is, then you know what its worth as well.

I have a CZ-82 stamped she 86 that I would like to sell or trade. I bought this gun from a private party vendor at a gun show here in Fond du Lac last year. Of the six that I looked at last year, this one was the best.

This gun is in typical condition for these types of handguns. The finish is paint and shows wear from being carried. Although, this one is fitted very well compared to the others I have seen. I have never fired any cheap surplus ammo through it, only quality ammunition as with all my guns. I have fired about 100 rounds through it.

I have a full set of replacement springs in the gun minus the sear/auto safety spring.

It is a real sweetheart to shoot.

I have 82 Winchester 9X18 95 gr. FMJ ammunition and 15 Hornady Custom 9X18 95 gr XTP ammunition as well as some brass. As well as a Lee 3 die 9mm Makarov set, case trimmer, and powder scoop. And a little over 100 Hornady  9x18 Makarov 95 gr bullets. All of these items are only going to be sold along with the handgun.

I would like to sell this gun. I have about 500.00 wrapped up in it, 300 for gun 100 for magazines, and about 100 for everything else.

I am not a felon and I will only sell to people who are legal to own this handgun. I am willing to travel short distances to meet with interested parties. Leave your phone number in the email you send me and I will get back to you promptly, if you do not I will not take your inquiry seriously. I will offer a better price to concealed carry permit holders. Valid Wisconsin ID required for the sale. I will not sell to people out of state. I can have it shipped to an FFL at the buyer's expense, but not before money is transferred to me. Face to Face sales preferred.

Thank you for reading, and have a nice day.

 The guns works great, and is a lot of fun to shoot. These are becoming harder and harder to find and from what I've seen the prices are going up if you do find one. I am fortunate enough to have two of them, but I figure I might as well give someone else a chance to own one. I am in no hurry to get rid of this. I am just seeing what is out there, so feel free to offer. Looking more for trade but might sell if the price is right. The only price I could find was on impactguns.com for $800 but they were out of stock. Like I said Im really looking for a trade.

Don't get me wrong, the Socom is a cool looking gun and friends that have one say they are a blast to shoot but it's just not what I wanted. I never took the tags off, just put it in my safe for 6 months trying to decide if I should keep it. 

Obviously I have come to my decision and I'm hoping to trade it more than sell it. I'm looking for a few different things and will kick in cash, ammo, or both to make a deal work and vice versa. Here's what I'm looking for in no particular order: M1A Scout Squad, M1A Loaded, HK P7M8, FN SCAR 17, DPMS G2 SASS, DPMS REPR, LWRC REPR, Colt LE901, FN FAL, HK91, PWS MK2, POF 308, and Ruger SR762.

I prefer to trade but I'll also sell it for $1,500, which is about $100 less than I paid for it. I'll also throw in a 5 rd mag and a 20 rd mag to go along with the 10 rounder it already comes with. Again it is unfired and will come with the original box, manual, M14 field manual, etc. 

No low ball offers, especially that guy who blindly offers you 20% of what your asking price is within minutes of posting. I'm not desperate to get rid of this thing. That being said, if you have something you think I'll be interested in feel free to shoot me an email. Not really interested in hunting rifles and shotguns though."
