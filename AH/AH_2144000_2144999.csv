I have for sale or trade a Daewoo K2 (DR-200). She is a 223/556, South Korean modern day battle rifle. She uses M16/AR15 Magazines, has a FAL adjustable gas system, cycles using AKM gas piston technology. The K2 basically took the best parts of the M16/FAL/AKM to make an outstanding battle rifle. I added a $250 ACE stock to her that gives her the ability to side fold and deploy. These are pretty rare now and I haven't seen any at any gun shows. She has only had about 400 rounds through her total. She was cleaned after each shooting and never abused. I took her shooting last month (100) rounds and she fired flawlessly. 

I am only open to cash or trades in equal of posted amount (firearms only and no black powder or shotguns). Make me some offers.

The holsters are sized to fit a pair of Colt SAA 1873 revolvers chambered in .45 LC and having 5 ½ "" barrels.  The holsters will nicely accommodate similar style single action revolvers having 4 ¾ "" barrels and even the 3 ½ "" barrels featured on many Sheriff or Express Rider models without looking like “too much holster” for the gun.  The 18 cartridge loops centered on the back of the gunbelt, as described below, are sized to fit .45 LC cartridges snuggly.  Rounds in calibers smaller than .44 Special (Colt) or .44 mag might wobble in the cartridge loops.  I bought the rig for my own use and wore it very little.  It is in excellent condition and still has that new leather smell!  The holster rig is made from premium Grade A vegetable tanned double shoulder cowhide leather and finished to a hand oiled natural brown color. It is fully lined with soft lining leather, with special metal reinforcement at the cylinder area.  The rig includes beautiful custom hand tooled border decoration in a unique scallop and dot pattern along the upper and lower edges of the gunbelt and repeated in an oblong oval border shape on the front of each holster.  The rig’s hardware consists of clipped Cody style silver buckles on the ornamental holster straps that run across the middle of each holster and a full size frontier style clipped corner smooth silver Cody style main belt buckle.  The beautifully finished and tooled belt is 2.75 inches wide and is hand cut contoured to drop at the right hip, whether worn with the left side CrossDraw holster or as a single right side only holster rig.  The belt has 18 cartridge loops centered in the back of the belt.  The cartridge loops are hand-laced wet (not sewn) and dry molded to fit a .45 LC cartridge size.  The CrossDraw holster is right-handed (positioned on the left hip) and can be easily removed by sliding it down the belt and over the main buckle, to turn the rig into a right handed single rig.  All in all, a beautiful and functional reproduction of American Old-West cowboy “gear”, with a big dose of 1930’s through 1960’s Hollywood thrown in to boot!  It’s an item that any “Cowboy Gun” enthusiast would be pleased to own.

Info about sizing from Circle KB© website (http://www.circlekb.com/):

For Gun Belt sizes please measure yourself and select the inches at which you will buckle at the center hole of your gun belt. This is an important measurement and is different than your normal pant belt or true waist size. Typically your gun belt size will be 4-5 inches larger than your regular blue jean size or pant belt depending on your gender, confirmation and build.
Remember you will be buckling your gun belt below your normal pant waist, wearing clothing, chaps or winter gear so please take this into consideration when providing your gun belt size measurement. We provide 8 holes spaced one inch apart in the billet providing a 2-3 inch adjustment out and in from center to accommodate different clothing and weight gain or loss.

See Circle KB© website:  http://www.circlekb.com/  for more information and lots of interesting cowboy gun leather and accessories.

The holsters are sized to fit a pair of USFA Reproduction Colt SAA 1873 revolvers chambered in .45 LC and having 7 ½ "" barrels.  The holsters will nicely accommodate similar style single action revolvers having 5 ½ "" and even 4 ¾ "" barrels without looking like “too much holster” for the gun.  The 18 cartridge loops centered on the back of the gunbelt, as described below, are sized to fit .45 LC cartridges snuggly.  Rounds in calibers smaller than .44 Special (Colt) or .44 Mag might wobble in the cartridge loops.  I bought the rig for my own use and wore it very little.  It is in excellent condition and still has that new leather smell!  There are some minor scuff marks on the tongue piece of the 3 piece silver buckle set.  The blemishes are from running the tongue piece through the silver stay while buckling or unbuckling the belt.  The marks rub out with a chamois or soft cloth and some silver polish or auto wax.  I’ve done it before.  The holster rig is made from top-grade double shoulder vegetable tanned cowhide and finished to a hand dyed deep black color. It is fully lined with soft lining leather, with special metal reinforcement at the cylinder area.  Hand tooled into the face side of each of the rig’s two holsters is a rich Basketweave pattern, which is embellished further with Circle KB©’s special Santa Fe style border pattern that is hand tooled into each holster as a border surrounding the Basketweave field tooled into the holsters.  This pattern is also hand tooled into the top and bottom edges of the 2""wide leather accent straps that go across the middle of each holster.  Each of these holster straps are also decorated with one 3/4"" silver concho affixed to the center of each strap (see hardware description below).  The Santa Fe style border pattern is also hand tooled into the top and bottom edges of the rig’s 2 ¾ "" wide gun belt.  Tooling the Santa Fe style border pattern takes 6 marks per 3/4"" and creates an outstanding finish.  The rig’s hardware includes an elegant silver Rope Edge 3-piece buckle set (on a 1 ½"" belt buckle strap attached to the 2 ¾ "" wide gun belt).  The hardware also includes 4 round silver High Sierra, Rope Edge pattern conchos.  Two of the conchos are ¾ "" diameter and are placed in the center of the 2"" wide leather accent strap going across the middle of both of the 2 holsters.  The other two conchos are each 1 ½ "" in diameter and are placed in the middle of the gun belt flanking each side of the row of cartridge loops located in the middle of the back side of the gunbelt.  The belt has 18 cartridge loops centered in the back of the belt.  The cartridge loops are hand-laced wet (not sewn) and dry molded to fit a .45 LC cartridge size.  The rig can easily be converted to either a right or left hand single rig by sliding either of the holsters down to the nearest end of the gun belt and slipping it over the buckle.  All in all, a beautiful and functional reproduction of American Old-West cowboy “gear”, with a big dose of 1930’s through 1960’s Hollywood thrown in to boot!  It’s an item that any “Cowboy Gun” enthusiast would be pleased to own.

Typically your gun belt size will be 4-5 inches larger than your regular blue jean size or pant belt depending on your gender, confirmation and build.
Remember you will be buckling your gun belt below your normal pant waist, wearing clothing, chaps or winter gear so please take this into consideration when providing your gun belt size measurement. We provide 8 holes spaced one inch apart in the billet providing a 2-3 inch adjustment out and in from center to accommodate different clothing and weight gain or loss.

It is a 28"" barrel with improved cylinder, modified and full chokes for 3"" mags.  It also has an X-Full turkey choke.  I bought this gun in 1995 new with the intention of using it for turkey and duck hunting.  Patterned it with 5 turkey loads and shot one box of shells through it and realized I didn't like a pump.  Grew up with an A-5 and Citori and just couldn't make the switch to a pump.  

You can't buy them like this any more.  This is a Field Grade with heavy scroll work on the receiver with great walnut on the stock.  The Hunter grade you get today is plain walnut with a matt finish and plain receiver for more than I'm asking for this one.

If you are a lefty...this is the gun for you as the BPS is a bottom eject gun.

This is for sale as a personal transaction which will be face to face...no shipping.  I'm in the Madison area and am asking $525 which is a great price for this gun.  The Hunter grades goes for $579 - 640 on Gun broker and you have to pay for shipping, FFL transfer and sales tax.  While this is a private sale, I will complete a bill of sale as proof of the sale, to protect both of us.  I will also require seeing your driver’s license to prove you are the person on the bill of sale, to protect me.

I would prefer a new one with the box but might also be interested in a used one with a low round count. I would be willing to pay up to 400 dollars for a new one and up to 340 dollars for a used one, but price depends on round count. I would also like multiple Ruger BX-25 magazines and/or extra rounds of .22LR ammo included in the purchase if available, and I would also pay more for the extra magazines and ammo.    

I would prefer one that is not black in color, but the desert tan or battleship grey color instead. I also would like one that comes with a plinking scope or at least a scope mount. I do realize that with a scope or the mounts the price would be more than my original offered price. I would offer up to 75 more dollars for a scope and an extra 10/15 dollars for the scope mounts depending on the brand of mounts. 

Must be an authentic Talo Edition not just a 10/22 with the ATI Strikeforce stock. I will pay cash and I am willing to travel and meet to purchase. I live an hour north of Indianapolis and a little more than hour southwest of Fort Wayne.

 I will travel an hour and a half in any direction to purchase a rifle, and must be FTF anywhere other than the place you reside, unless buying from an authorized dealer and you want to meet in your store. Do not ask for my License to Carry a Handgun, I do not have my license yet but currently in the process of receiving it. If you will not sell unless I have my LTCH (License to Carry a Handgun) then I will bring a receipt of a pistol I bought from a licensed dealer about a month ago.

The new P226® Elite Platinum is the next generation P226 Elite and features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, custom aluminum grips, SIGLITE® Combat Adjustable Night Sights and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The P226 Elite Platinum is available in 9mm, or .40 S&W.

I have a Mauser 1909. It has been sporterized, but is unlike a great many sporters here in the US. the job was done by Chet Paulson out of Tacoma in the late 50s to early 60s. It resides in a handmade stock by Paulson himself, and sports vintage Redfield sights. It is in the original 7.65x53 Argentine, unlike it`s thousands of similar sporters, which were converted to .30-06. In my limited experience, I`ve found that it is a lot cheaper than .30-06 too. The weapon has been used, and it shows. It has no Rust, just some patina on the Bolt face. Mr. Paulson is now deceased, and that only makes this Mauser worth more. Most of his work is in private collections, too. I had it priced at about $700-$750 by a friend who is very knowledgeable on this subject. It only needs a good bolt cleaning, although everything functions exactly as it should.

The Springfield Armory Loaded Full Size MC Operator 1911 pistol is designed from the ground up to be a serious combat pistol. The black slide and OD green frame have Springfield's Armory Kote finish for maximum durability. The Pachmyr wrap around rubber grips are checkered on both sides and on the front, giving you a slip-free hold no matter what the weather.

The pistol has a universal style accessory rail for mounting lights, lasers or other devices. (Please note that a Picatinny or 1913 rail is not the same as a universal rail, and will not accept devices made for universal rails. See photos).example photo of Springfield Armory universal rail

The sights on the MC Operator are low-profile combat sights, with three tritium dots for fast target pickup in bright daylight or on a dark street. The edges of the sights are smoothed for snag-free draws.

The barrel is match grade stainless, supported at the front with a match grade stainless barrel bushing. The pistol has a G.I. style guide rod.

The trigger on the MC Operator is match grade, too, with a pull weight of 4.5 to 5 pounds, example photo of Picatinny railwhich is just right for combat or target shooting.

An ambidextrous safety makes the gun easier to operate for lefties, or for those who need to shoot with either hand.

If you're looking for a serious combat pistol loaded with features, you just found it.

Every Springfield Armory 1911 pistol is equipped with a trigger locking device. A key inserted into a hole in the rear grip strap positively locks the trigger, making it impossible for a child to accidentally discharge the gun. This system gives you a choice as to whether or not you need to lock your gun. Unlike trigger locks on other brands of guns, the keyhole is small, so that it doesn't ruin the looks of the gun."

706,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2144706,For Trade:  WTT Glock 17 compatible Kel Tec Sub 2000,"Coeur D Alene, Idaho, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, September 22, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"...This Subby is the version that takes Glock 17 magazines. I've had it for several years and she's accurate, dependable, soft recoiling, very light weight and of course, she folds in half. When folded she's a hair longer than 16"" and fits in backpack deigned to carry a Camel Back hydration system. This is the ultimate in a truck gun, ""get outta Dodge"" style rifle that can be left under the seat of your vehicle without raising any suspicion. These things are a real bitch to find, especially in the Glock compatible versions. This rifle is not for sale. What I do want to do is trade her straight up for an AMD 65 AK47, a Saiga 12 gauge or a Draco pistol in 7.62x39 only.  For your trade you get the Sub2000 (equipped a Picatinney rail on the left and right side, a MagPul AFB forward grip, the tactical light and a Tacti-cool brand tube pad, butt pad extension and charging handle cover), three 33 round magazines as well as the carry case/backpack. You can either reply on the board or by PM. Thanks, in advance.....Clydedog"

Belts can be made from 1 inch to 3 inches wide. All items will be returned and the end of production. Also half of the required funds that are agreed upon by both parties will be required at the start of the production to insure all items are available before the job is started so that delays maybe avoided. I can supply pictures of completed works for proof of craftsmanship. I currently have a 1911-22 and a kel tec pf9 so those firearms would not be required for production. We can also check my existing 1911 holster for fit to yours so as to avoid you leaving a firearm with myself.

The rifle is in 100% condition and shows no handling/storage marks.

I purchased this rifle from a collector friend over 23 years ago and have had it safely stored ever since.

Far fewer MAS 49 semi-auto long rifles were made as compared to the more common 49/56 carbine. My research shows that 20,600 Model 1949 rifles were made while over 275,000 of the 49/56 were produced. This rifle is a true collectors piece and it's sure to continue to increase in value. 

Rifle comes with all the factory accessories that were originally shipped with it. There are two heavy poly bags of equipment - the first has cleaning kit, tools, sling, pouches, spare parts, & operating manual (in French). Then the second bag has (4) 10 round magazines that are packed in oil. Both bags are factory sealed and have never been opened. There is also five original boxes of French 7.5mm ball ammo. This ammo is brass case, bright & shiny so I know it would shoot just fine, however it's collectible by itself so I'd suggest buying some new production ammo from PPU or S&B if you intend to shoot this rifle.  

I'm asking $1050. Rifle is local sale only (no shipping) with pickup in the Brandon area by a Florida resident that is at least 21 years old. A bill of sale will be furnished.

Please remember this is a 34 year old boat and the vinyl is a little shot but tolerable.  I did however rebuild all the engine housing and rear seats.  So that wood is in next to new condition.

I bought the camera body new in September of 2010 and it was my primary camera until I bought my D7000 about a year and half ago, I kept the D90 around for a back up and it handled the job very well, picture quality between the two is hard to see without pixel counting.  The main reason I upgraded was for the two SD slots on the 7000...and just to upgrade of course...lol.  Honestly there is no real reason I can give for upgrading, the D90 performs just as good as the ""newer"" models, image quality will be a very minimal improvement with the new entry level D3XXX or D5XXX...The D90 is still faster than these though.  You really won't make a huge leap in quality until you go to the newest ""prosumer"" models like the D7XXX and the like.  

All lenses were purchased separately over the last few years for either mine or my wife's cameras and have always been fitted with lens filters.  When not in use/in storage they have always had both caps installed.  Each piece was purchased brand new by me and has been taken care of very well.  The entire package looks and performs like new with the exception of the plastic cover that protects the rear LCD, it has minor scratches from use, the LCD however is flawless.

About the Remington Model 788 (From Wikipedia): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_788
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."
