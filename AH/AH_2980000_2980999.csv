Or Want a all American made hand crafted rifle ? Do you participate in Cowboy Action Shooting? Are you an avid big-game hunter? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you're ready to step up to the new Henry Big Boys. Rooted in history, the .44 magnum version is the first American-made .44-caliber Henry lever action featuring a solid brass receiver since the original Henry rifle of 1860. A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The .44 is the cartridge that was said to have “killed more game, big and small, and more men, good and bad, than any other in existence.” Our tubular magazine can pack ten of these powerful bruisers. The .44 Mag is a serious hunting tool, and has proven itself time and time again on all of the world’s game. We trust the Henry Big Boy .44 will soon become a favorite of big game hunters due to its handsome looks, rugged reliability and proven knockdown power. These guns are loaded with the adventure and romance of America's Old West with distinctive octagonal barrels, straight-grip American walnut stocks with brass buttplates and brass barrel bands. A nice 19th-century history."

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

Ruger 10 + 1 Round 22 Long Rifle w/6″ Barrel/Fixed Sights/Blue Finish
Ruger Mark III™ pistols represent the evolution of Ruger .22 LR pistols, continuing the legacy created by the Ruger Standard, Mark I and Mark II pistols and yet incorporating many new engineering refinements. They are simple, rugged, and affordable, making them a great value for any sporting purpose – whether target shooting, plinking or small game hunting. All Mark III pistols feature a rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. This Standard model is the ideal first .22 LR pistol, with a tapered alloy steel barrel and fixed front and rear sights.

189,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2980189,For Sale:  Glock 22 Lone Wolf 40-9 Conversion Barrel,"Lynnwood, Seattle, Washington",$ 130,"Listed On: Sunday, July 6, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I purchased this conversion for my Glock 22 .40 so I could also shoot cheaper 9mm and also get less recoil for my wife (and because I like the idea of shooting two types of caliber from one pistol). To appropriately “seat the barrel” with the G22 I broke it in with 200 rounds of 147 grain 9mm (pricey stuff) -- per the recommendation of the manufacturer. After the break in period I started shooting cheaper 115 grain 9mm REMAN without a single failure to fire (FTF). In fact, after the break in period, I put another 300 rounds of 115 reman 9mm down range without a single glitch or FTF.  It’s a great setup and a different experience from the same gun. All in all the barrel now has exactly 500 rounds through it, so it’s ready to go. 

I’m selling this because I later purchased a dedicated 9mm Glock specifically for my wife (at the time I didn’t know if she’d like shooting).  Here’s what I paid (see below). I don’t need the cash, so please don’t low ball, the price is firm (and a great deal too).

224,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2980224,"For Sale:  Mossberg 500 18"" 12 gauge Barrel for model 500 5 shot 3 inch bead Sight with Trench type Heat Shield NIB","Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 149,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 27, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our # XB90015HS

Many if not most gun owning households have a Mossberg 500 on the premises. The Mossberg might not be as prestigious as a Remington 870P, but it is just as durable, if not more so. Photos show a specimen of Mossberg’s 18 inch barrel for standard model 500s, and we have outfitted it with a Trench type heat shield. This apparatus will give a wood stocked 12 gauge model 500 an appearance similar to the classic Winchester model 12s issued to many of our soldiers in Conflicts from World War Two through Vietnam. It will also turn a model 500 field gun into a compact and formidable home protection device. Barrel Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg of Torreon, Mexico, the facility where most of the company’s barrels have been made for the past 20 years. Construction is U.S. steel, explicitly labeled on the barrel. Chambering is for 12 gauge shells, both for 2 3/4 inch and for 3 inch shells interchangeably. Finish is semi-gloss blue. Length is 18 5/8 inches of bore proper, measured from the muzzle to the breech face. Overall length is 19 11/16 inches from the muzzle to the end of the chamber hood. Heat shield is black polymer construction, manufactured in the world’s most populous nation. It attaches with four screws in front of the barrel lug, with an additional brace over the chamber area of the barrel, as the photos show. This barrel will fit any Mossberg model 500 shotgun chambered in 12 gauge whose magazine tube will hold 5 each 2 3/4 inch shells, and whose magazine tube measures 13 1/2 inches from the receiver face to the end of its magazine tube. That includes over 95 percent of Mossberg 500s in existence today. It also fits Western Auto Revelation 310 series 12 gauge pump shotguns; it also fits Wards Western Field models 505, 509, 524, 534, 536, 539, 550 all variants, because those were made by Mossberg for Western Auto and for Montgomery Wards beginning in the 1960s. It will not fit an 8 shot model 500 whose magazine tube is 19 inches long. It will not fit a 20 gauge Mossberg; will not fit a .410 gauge Mossberg; will not fit the dump lever of a 1947 John Deere Manure Spreader. It will only fit Mossberg 500 series pump or slide action shotguns whose magazine tubes hold five 2 3/4 inch 12 gauge shells. It will not render 1960s and 1970s production shotguns that were chambered only for 2 3/4 inch shells magnum capable. A similarly configured Winchester model 12 like the one showing in our World War II photo will command prices in the four figure range. We’re offering this brand new Mossberg 18 inch barrel, complete with Trench type Heat Shield, all for only $ 149.00.

I have four New and Unopened Bulgarian-made Circle-10 5.56/.223 AK magazines for sale. They are CLEAR, not solid black, so you can see how many rounds you have remaining. Some people like this, other people hate it, the preference is yours. Steel locking lugs, these are the ones you want.

I am asking $40 ea, shipped. That's a hell of a deal, check for yourself. The bags themselves are marked for $49.95. K-Var wants $45 plus shipping.

That's the exact magazine you will be receiving.

I must receive payment before shipping, Post Office Money Order only.
I will meet within a reasonable distance, preferably somewhere along I-30 in Mesquite or Rockwall.



I'm selling these because I had to sell my SLR-106 and I won't be able to afford another one for quite some time, if ever. :(

From a Mossberg Factory Demo release comes this pristine barrel that will fit any 12 gauge Model 500 shotgun that has a 5 shot magazine tube. Almost all Mossberg 500 twelves are five shot, and the magazine tube measures exactly 14 inches long from the receiver. Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, Connecticut. Factory sku number is 90130. Construction is entirely steel, except for the white bead front sight’s exterior, and the brass middle alignment bead that sits between the fifth and sixth posts of the ventilated rib. Finish is standard Mossberg blue. Sight system is standard .370 wide serrated Ventilated rib with double bead, .125 inch clearance above the lug. Length is 28 inches. Choke system is Mossberg Accu-Choke, interchangeable with old style Winchester Winchoke and old style short Browning Invector. Each barrel comes with a total of one choke tube, a Modified, .715 diameter at the muzzle, and capable of handling steel shot, lead shot, bismuth, and even rifled slugs and buckshot. Photo is representative, but each barrel comes from a number 52120, 500 All Purpose® shotgun that was in mint condition, and that we specimens of listed for sale in other ads, principally Gun s Amer ica. Surface detractions are negligible. Few if any of the parent shotguns were ever even fired, simply transported with Mossberg sales reps and serving as showgirls at industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show. Replacement pricing on this barrel is well over $200 in most areas. We’re offering the Mossberg 12 gauge 28 inch Ported Vent Rib, double beaded Accu-Choke Barrel in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 149.00. Add $15.00 for a .694 new Factory Full Choke Tube, $9.00 for a Carlson Wrench. A US Quarter Coin works pretty well for a choke tube wrench.

From a Mossberg Factory Demo release comes this pristine barrel that will fit any 12 gauge Model 500 shotgun that has a 5 shot magazine tube. Almost all Mossberg 500 twelves are five shot, and the magazine tube measures exactly 14 inches long from the receiver. Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, Connecticut. Factory sku number is 90135. Construction is entirely steel, except for the white bead front sight’s exterior, and the brass middle alignment bead that sits between the fifth and sixth posts of the ventilated rib. Finish is standard Mossberg blue. Sight system is standard .370 wide serrated Ventilated rib with double bead, .125 inch clearance above the lug. Length is 24 inches. Choke system is Mossberg Accu-Choke, interchangeable with old style Winchester Winchoke and old style short Browning Invector. Each barrel comes with a total of one choke tube, a Modified, .715 diameter at the muzzle, and capable of handling steel shot, lead shot, bismuth, and even rifled slugs and buckshot. Photo is representative, but each barrel comes from a number 52132, 500 All Purpose Bantam® shotgun that was in mint condition, and that we specimens of listed for sale in other ads, principally Gun s Amer ica. Surface detractions are negligible. Few if any of the parent shotguns were ever even fired, simply transported with Mossberg sales reps and serving as showgirls at industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show. Replacement pricing on this barrel is well over $200 in most areas. We’re offering the Mossberg 12 gauge 24 inch Ported Vent Rib, double beaded Accu-Choke Barrel in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 149.00. Add $15.00 for a .694 new Factory Full Choke Tube, $9.00 for a Carlson Wrench. A US Quarter Coin works pretty well for a choke tube wrench.

 Product Description

 Built using the Ultimate Sighting System (USS), the Mark III Tactical Mil Dot 3-9x42 scope combines the benefits of a Mark III tactical scope with the advantage of a backup red dot sight. The system is equipped with a Mark III tactical scope and a specially designed MRD34 ring. The ring, which mounts directly to the ocular lens housing with a built-in Weaver-style platform, stabilizes the red dot sight so you can lock confidently lock on your target. With the scope and sight, the USS is perfect for both close quarter battle and long-range shooting.

 The scope also includes fully multicoated lenses for brightness and clarity, along with a red/green illuminated Mil Dot reticle with multiple brightness settings. Other features include open target turrets, a bullet drop compensator calibrated for the .223 cartridge with a 55-grain bullet, a rotating mount for users who prefer offset functionality, a built-in sunshade, and a quick-focus eyepiece.

The rifle is manufactured at the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (owned by FN de Herstal) to FN specifications using Winchester Model 70 actions. All current models of the SPR come in one of a variety of McMillan synthetic stocks. The earliest rifles were shipped in the H-S Precision aluminum chassis fiberglass version of the Winchester Marksman stock. While these ""First Generation"" rifles were simply dropped into the aluminum bedding blocks of the H-S Precision stock, the later guns are all glass bedded by hand.

FN Special Police Rifles of all iterations are noted for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome lined bore in the barrel. A chrome lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier to clean barrel for the end user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt action sniper rifles. The barrels of the ""First Generation"" rifles were said to be made from the hammer-forged blanks used for M240 General Purpose Machine Gun production at the FN Manufacturing Inc. plant in Columbia, South Carolina. Later barrels are said to be from hammer-forged blanks intended exclusively for FN Special Police Rifle production

This gun never had any problems, and it has no damages or scratches anywhere. I have original box and w/e came in the box from when I got it. And I also managed to find a snub hip leather tan holster for it too, that was very hard to find. I would of got it in black leather but because it was soo hard to find I wasnt going to be picky about it. The gun has about 100 rounds through it. Previous owner who was a ffl dealer sold it to me pretty much new. He had only put 5 rounds through it because he was curious of the gun b4 he sold it to me. Some fun facts about the gun, S&W does not make this snub model anymore. I found this out after taking it to a gun shop to get a estimated value and after looking up the serial number of the gun they told me its no longer made. Also another cool fact about this guy is that it shoots 3 different calibers, 45 long colt, S&W 460, and 454 casull. The 45 long colt feels like a 9mm because of the weight of the gun. The other two calibers kick big time! Im pretty firm on the price for this but I am open to parcial trades, worst I can say is no thanks."

Smith and Wesson Model M&P15A Rifle

Both, this version, and model (#811002) are no longer being manufactured by S&W, and i'm only able to offer these due to one of my distributors overstock inventory (it will soon be almost impossible to find this model available anywhere in NIB/Unfired condition).  *See pics for Model Info.

**Update 05-27-2014 -  Down to only a few remaining.  Have .223 ammo available in stock**

**Now Accepting Visa, Mastercard, and Discover Card as Payment Options.** 

“The M&P15A, is essentially a variant of the M&P15 Standard. It comes without the detachable carry/handle/rear sight assembly, which is replaced with a detachable Troy Folding Battle Sight mounted on the flattop receiver rail and allowing perfect co-witness of the standard front sight. The full windage adjustment knob is located in same position as standard M16A2, A3, A4 weapon sights, and each click equals a .25 MOA shift in impact. In the “up” position, a stainless-steel cross lock provides 1000 pounds of shear strength, guaranteeing return to zero, and eliminating the possibility of accidental folding.”

Product Information: 
RCBS - RCBS Case Trimmers are designed to be user friendly and provide very accurate results, the Trim Pro Power Case Trimmer Kit is no different. The low RPM motor delivers plenty of torque and the spring fed cutter requires no pushing or feeding pressure so cases are trimmed accurately and squarely. The spring fed cutter also allows reloaders to have their hands free while trimming so the can deburr cases or do other tasks helping to speed up the reloading process. Trimmer works with standard pilots and features a micrometer fine adjustment bushing calibrated for setting exact trim length. The positive locking handle and integral power switch make this unit simple and safe to use.

Armscor of the Philippines launched its business the same year we did, 1952; but it was a little over a decade before we began carrying their products. Since the earliest Armscor .22 rifles, to their long produced .22 Magnum ammo marketed by Fiocchi, we have had positive experience with Armscor products, and that is especially true with their Rock Island Armory series of Government 1911 style pistols. We admit that the Taurus Revolvers are winners hands down over Armscor’s; but the Filipino Gunsmiths have many more years of experience with their 1911A1 pistols than the Brazilians do. This offering is for Armscor / Rock Island’s top of the line 1911A1 Tactical, a pistol that holds its traditional looks and lines while incorporating custom features. Construction is all steel, with traditional military parkerized finish. Barrel is conventional 5 inch, and note the full length stainless guide rod. Hammer is modified Commander skeleton style .272 wide, and with matching skeleton serrated face black anodized trigger. Felt creep is minimal on all specimens we have handled. Sights are non-snag dovetailed in Novak style, black ramp front. Grip safety is Beavertail type, and with extended ambidextrous main safety. This pistol comes furnished with a total of one 8 shot blue steel magazine. Grips are nicely grained Filipino hardwood. This pistol is an exceptional value at only $ 449.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card. Not transferable to civilians in Massachusetts. CA Roster status expires 9/20/14, affects D.C. too.

For three decades now, we have had excellent customer satisfaction and quality performance from the Armscorp Center Fire Autos, and this is their bread-and-butter piece, the solid, reliable 1911A1 Parkerized Military Spec .45. Photo shows one of our stock Rock Island .45 Government Size autos, made by Armscorp of the Philippines, that we had in stock. Type is 1911 family blowback action semi automatic pistol, John M. Browning designed. Safety system is Series 80 type firing pin safety, lever safety, and grip safety that readily engage in cocked-and-locked carry. Each comes with standard fixed sights, non-glare, weather impervious parkerized finish; nicely grained Filipino hardwood grip panels; and one blue steel Novak 8 round magazine. Note the Rock Island embellishment on the left side of the slide, this is Armscor’s latest upgrade. Accuracy is second to none, with 6-land, 6-groove 1:16 rifling in the standard 5 inch barrel. Few of us will ever get the chance to own a real GI Government .45, and this opportunity is one of the best on the market. These are quality pistols, we’ve sold lots of them locally here in West Tennessee for many years. Own one of these fine pistols, the one in the photo or one of its identical mates, for only $ 399.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States.

The AK-302 mount system is a rugged family of mounts for side rail equipped Kalashnikov rifles.

Based on the highly successful and exceptionally durable RS proprietary technology, the AK-302 system adds the capability to change upper optic mounts as needed and to position optics not only directly over-bore, but front-to-back. The AK-302 system also introduces the new low profile RS lock system built with titanium and aluminum that does not protrude from the mount or into the trigger guard area.

Front-Biased Optic Rail is under 3.0oz, ideal for the ultimate light-weight use.

Side mount rail base only, DOES NOT include optics mounts.

I am asking $75 firm. These run $120.00 normally so I don't think I am unreasonable. Only selling because I decided on a top mount rather than a side mount."

Perfect operating condition and cosmetically perfect.  Only 50 rounds through it at the range the day I picked it up.  Have attached a new sling to the swivels.

The best thing about these is that, because it fires a pistol round, you can use them at most indoor ranges.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns"
