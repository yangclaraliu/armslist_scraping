The ONLY negative is there is a small plastic piece that fell off after a few shots. You can see it in the pictures. It doesn't effect performance at all, just a cosmetic flaw.

The picture is a representative rifle. It is not the rifle you will get, but the condition is close.

I have a bunch of them that Century classified as ""good, with cracked stocks"". Some stocks have gouges, but I am yet to discover cracks. I would classify stocks as ""fair"" by NRA grading standards.

Bores are average (NRA ""good"") - pitting, but with strong rifling. I have done a study of accuracy of these rifles vs bore condition, you can find the results here: http://www.preciseshooter.com/blog/BoreConditionAndAccuracy.aspx. The bores on the ones I have for sale would be somewhere between ""like new"" and ""worn bore"" in the study: the amount of pitting is roughly the same as in ""worn"", but the rifling is sharper, except for one rifle that has bore very similar to ""worn"".

These rifles do not have anything coming with them, just the rifles (no cleaning kit, no sling, no ammo pouches). Some (few) have cleaning rods. The distribution of cleaning rods to bore/stock condition is random, just like I received them from the distributor.

Please note, these are USED, MILITARY SURPLUS firearms, and need to be examined by a COMPETENT GUNSMITH prior to firing.

Henry Big Boy Cowboy Edition II In the 1800s, the cowboys who drove the herds through untamed territory relied on their pistols and rifles for protection from man and beast alike. So it's only fitting that we pay tribute those cowpunchers and wranglers who risked their lives to drive cattle across the frontier with this limitededition Big Boy rifle. Each select American Walnut stock and forearm is masterfully engraved using techniques that combine the latest technologies with traditional craftsmanship passed from one generation to the next. The stock depicts a band of cowboys huddled around an open fire at the end of a long day on the range. The forearm is detailed with the image of a thundering herd of wild horses, kicking up dust as they gallop across the plains. After engraving, our highly skilled artisans painstakingly hand paint each detailed image using multiple, permanent acrylic colors with a final sealant coating applied for life-long protection. The result is artwork you'll be proud to display on the mantle or wall in a lodge, den or office, but are built for the reliability and accuracy that have made Henry Big Boy rifles the choice of hunters and traditional shooters everywhere. Henry Big Boy Cowboy Special EditionThe Big Boy's classic look includes a 20"" octagonal barrel outfitted with a Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with a white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. Just like the rifles preferred by the cowboys of that bygone era, it sports a 10-round tubular magazine the legendary smooth action that could only come from authentic American-made Henry rifle.

Regent Umarex

The Regent R200S comes equipped with the same quality as the R100, but with a stainless finish, serrated slide, ventilated trigger, and hammer, a beavertail safety, combat 3-dot sight system and an extended thumb safety. It is an affordable semi-automatic 1911 pistol built with a level of quality that you can customize. This reasonably priced, high-quality .45 ACP caliber M1911 is one of only a few guns of its style and quality that retails for around $600.


Along with the R100, the R200 is a rendition of the M1911A1 that is visually faithful to the original design. It has a spur hammer, M1911A1-style grip safety, and arched mainspring housing. Offered in .45 ACP only, the R200S has a stainless finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.


The Regent R200S accepts virtually all aftermarket parts made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your pistol. Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911-styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations.

I've gotten several questions about the German markings on the slide: 

The gun is a .380 but is marked 9mm kurz on the slide because kurz is German for ""short."" 9mm kurz, or short, and .380 rounds are the same thing, just different names. So basically it is for the German and American reference. Which also explains why in Bond movies they refer to his guns as 9mm, when in reality Bond is carrying the .380 PPK as offered here."

The revolver is no longer being manufactured by Ruger because they wanted to concentrate their manufacturing process on their semi-auto handguns.  Reviews of the Sp101 in 327 Fed.
