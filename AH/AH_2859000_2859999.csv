From the Northwoods to the Texas hill country and in every deer camp and lodge in between, the .30-30 rifle remains the perennial choice of whitetail hunters. More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it's a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America's most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. 

Like every Henry rifle, it's 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

I'm sure most are unfamiliar with and never heard of Mark X rifles, so I will explain. The Mark X was manufactured by the world famed Zastava plant in Yugoslavia, assembled in Manchester, England and imported by Interarms Firearms Corp of Alexandria, Virginia. These are very well made commercial Mauser rifles, similar to FN commercial Mausers but no quite on the same level. The 98 Mauser action is THE MOST RELIABLE bolt rifle action ever designed. It was designed SPECIFICALLY for combat; to be able to reliably function under the most austere conditions. It's design has been copied by even the US in its own military rifles because of its reliability (M1903 and M1917). Ever wonder why the pre 64 Winchester Model 70s are so sought after and bring in premium prices? You guessed it...because of its Mauser type action. Ever wonder what kind of bolt rifle African Professional Hunters use when hunting dangerous game? Ding, ding, ding...you're right again...Mauser action rifles. When it comes to self preservation or the ""one in a lifetime"" opportunity at a trophy kill, there are those who leave nothing to chance...and they use Mauser action rifles. Now on to this firearm. The bluing is immaculate (99.9%). It comes scoped, but has good ol' iron sights in case of optics failure or loss of zero in the field. The stock is beautiful with no cracks or splits and VERY minimal handling marks. You would be hard pressed to find a finer rifle at this price point. Search around and try. I guarantee you will come up empty handed. If you require more info or pics, just shoot me a message. Located in Enterprise."

Great shooting gun, no problems, great condition.. Just need cash to finish other projects. 

As you can see it has a custom vinyl ghost skull wrap which is pretty cool. Its the same stuff that mossy oak uses to wrap shotguns in camo. 

If you dont like the wrap, you can easily remove with a knife and by applying constant heat with hair dryer... If you like it- the wrap is durable, actually stays on, helps protect gun etc

I ordered this Boss 1911 with a green fiber optic front sight (I have the red insert) and hex grip screws vs. the straight as pictured. The following is from Les Baer:

A fitting tribute to the high performance 1970s muscle car that inspired it. Les Baer is still the king of custom built 1911 pistols in addition to being a well known aficionado of high performance American muscle cars. That’s why Les named his newest 1911 model after the Boss 429 Mustangs he admires above all other cars. Like our entire pistol line, our newest .45 is based on our popular Premier II, but it has enough thoughtful extra touches to really make it the new Boss of custom .45s. As with our other pistols, the new Boss is guaranteed to shoot 3” groups at 50 yards. 

Special features include:

• Rear slide serrations • Baer fiber optic front sight (red) • Flat mainspring housing, checkered at 20 lpi • Extended combat safety • Special tactical package • Chromed complete lower • Blued slide • (2) 8-round premium magazines

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

GEAR DRIVE LOCKING SYSTEM:
This locking system uses robust cam locks and a large, multiple diversion bar system to prevent bolt or handle pressure from reaching the lock. Forces go to the cams and diversion bars, not the lock. A 300 degree rotating gear makes operation of this mechanism three times easier to turn.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP CORNER BOLTS:
Pry-Stop Corner Bolts provide better protection than other pry-defense designs. Innovative long locking bolts extend diagonally from a reinforced support at the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending):
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending):
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

Honor your firearms and valuables with a Prestige safe. Finely crafted and impeccably finished, a Prestige safe will protect your possessions from fire and theft with a steel body that is formed and continuously welded—no spot welded—for an outstanding rigidity and flawless appearance.

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

GEAR DRIVE LOCKING SYSTEM:
This locking system uses robust cam locks and a large, multiple diversion bar system to prevent bolt or handle pressure from reaching the lock. Forces go to the cams and diversion bars, not the lock. A 300 degree rotating gear makes operation of this mechanism three times easier to turn.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP CORNER BOLTS:
Pry-Stop Corner Bolts provide better protection than other pry-defense designs. Innovative long locking bolts extend diagonally from a reinforced support at the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

GEAR DRIVE LOCKING SYSTEM:
This locking system uses robust cam locks and a large, multiple diversion bar system to prevent bolt or handle pressure from reaching the lock. Forces go to the cams and diversion bars, not the lock. A 300 degree rotating gear makes operation of this mechanism three times easier to turn.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP CORNER BOLTS:
Pry-Stop Corner Bolts provide better protection than other pry-defense designs. Innovative long locking bolts extend diagonally from a reinforced support at the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending):
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

Dubbed the VZ2008, this carbine sports the side-folding steel stock and features a combination of original Czech and new US-made parts for legality.
light and compact handling characteristics of the carbine. With the stock folded, the 7-pound VZ2008 measures just over 26 inches long. This compact size, combined with the powerful 7.62x39mm chambering and 30 + 1 capacity makes it extremely well suited as a law enforcement patrol rifle.
Over the course of a few hundred rounds, the rifle performed without a hitch. Despite its light weight and compact dimensions, the perceived recoil of the 7.62x39mm carbine proved to be quite pleasant and manageable. Accuracy at 100 yards was also quite good; particularly considering the fact the rifle was tested with only the iron sights.
•	All VZ58  - 2008 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped. 
•	Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
•	The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
•	The VZ 2008 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
•	The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ2008.
•	The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ2008.
•	The VZ2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
•	The alloy magazine of the VZ2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine.
•	The VZ2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.
The Good: 
•	700 rounds, no cleaning, no problems at all 
•	Battle rifle accuracy that I am sure I could improve 
•	At $599.00 this rifle is an absolute steal 
•	Came with a bayonet, scabbard, sling, four mags, and a cleaning kit 
•	Minimal buildup after shooting 
•	Easy to take down 
•	Surplus parts available for low prices 
•	Ejects to 1:00 consistently, away from other shooters 
The Ugly: 
•	Not enough people know about these!"

This model has a oil circulating system and not the splash system the newer model use.

Mower has new blades on the 48"" cutting deck, it also has brand new tires all 4 front and back were just put on it, comes with a 1 week old battery I just installed and comes with a brand new 6 month old Craftsman heavy duty pull behind utility trailer, it pulls behind and also has a pin that can be removed and the whole bed dumps whatever is inside. 

This mower has some issues, it ran perfectly last summer and I got it to start a couple times this year. When it is running it has a knocking noise that I am not sure what it it, unfortunately I am not mechanically inclined at all! So I just got a new mower and I am selling this one cheap so that if someone wants to tackle this and see if they can fix it they can. 

I have the total done to this mower and really just trying to the money for parts I put in it, so basically you will get the mower FOR FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It is the aluminum frame, steel slide version. Very light for a full-size .45 at about 30.5 ounces unloaded. 

I bought this pistol in mid-2013, and it only has about 350 rounds through it. 

It has the Hogue, OD-green finger-groove grips, which are uber-comfortable. Sorry, the original, plastic factory grips are gone. Those are only about $25 straight from Sig if you want to go back to factory grips. The barrel is a brushed stainless. The finish wears off the barrels on Sigs pretty quick, so I took it down to a brushed stainless finish. It looks great. 

Included are the 2 original 8-round factory mags. In addition, there are two, factory, flush-fit 7-round mags, an extra factory 8-round mag and a factory 10-round mag. This is about an extra $150 worth of mags. 

Also comes with original Sig hard-case and manual. 

This thing is accurate and shoots like a dream. Zero malfunctions. It's a good one. I am only selling to fund some other gun projects. I will be sad to see it go. 

I also have about 350 rounds of quality, factory ammo in 230gr FMJ (Fiocchi, American Eagle, Remington UMC) if you are interested.

Strong Safe.","Grove City, Columbus, Ohio",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 29, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"High Quality AmSec Time Delay Safe. - $500  (Grove City, Ohio)  Very fair price at $500. This safe will hold most private collections of hand-guns to keep them safe from thieves.  It also anchors to the floor so they cannot wheel it away.    

This is a H.D. Safe that weights in about 300 lbs. It is very H.D. with a timed delayed entry, anchors to the floor, has a cash drop with a hidden separate lockable compartment inside.  In other words, what you put into it will stay safe without worry of theft.

This safe is similar to the AmSec CE3524 TL 15/TL30 that sells new today for $2,948.00. This safe is actually better with even more features like a time delay door to open plus a phone backup system if forced to open under duress maybe under gun-point?  Excellent for cash, gold, hand guns and can fit nicely inside a closet hidden away.   Plenty of pockets for different ammo as well inside the door.

The pictures are of this actual safe.   Call me today at REDACTED

This is a commercial grade AmSec American Securities safe (Which are Top Rated Safes).   This is a solid safe, but is sold as-is.   Its still just as strong as if you went out
and paid $3k to $4k for a new one just like it!   

This safe's exact measurements are as follows:
It stands 32"" high x 20"" wide x 19 1/2"" deep with re-enforced triple 1"" bars across the front door to secure what hand guns and cash that is inside. This is an older safe, but well worth the now $500.  This safe is not large enough inside to handle rifles or shotguns, but you can fit about 50+ handguns plus your ammo inside it for safe keeping.

This safe even says TIME DELAY on a big sign on the front of the safe so the thief knows it will take some time (THAT a crook does not have to waste) to open and if you enter the secret code, it calls the cops just in case you are opening it under duress.  

Don't be fooled by other junk safes from Sports stores  and the likes of Home Depot, Dicks, or others as these lower end safes offer paper thin steel so you get a false since of security and most cheap safes can be opened within 2min. by even a stupid thief with a crow-bar.  

Not this safe.  The thief will not get this safe open unless he has hours  to try and maybe not even then unless he/she is a professional thief with the expensive correct tools and knowledge needed which few people have today that are thieves. 


Call me anytime.   Cash only.  Price is firm and fair  for this quality of this safe.    REDACTED  Call John anytime day or night.    Sold as-is. Safe has electronic keypad. 

If you are out of State,  I  will only ship this safe out of state if money is wired first to my bank account and then shipping cost is extra from Columbus, Ohio. No PayPal accepted.   

Pictures show it  sitting inside my semi-trailer today and I can help you load it up right into your pickup fairly easy."

Century International Arms VZ2008 7.62x39 caliber semi-automatic Rifles. Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Includes 5-30rd magazines, Magazine Pouch, Bayonet & Scabbard and Sling. Leather mag pouch will vary in color and condition!

The gun appears to have had corrosion in the past, as evident by spots on the slide, front strap and back strap, but retains most of the bluing.  Has the real wood grips.  All numbers match.

I am selling my Glock 23 Gen 4. It was purchased new from local gun store November 2013 (built in September 2013).

I had the local gun store add green Trijicon night sights during purchase and glock armorer installed them on site.

I have decided to part ways with it in favor of a different firearm.

It has roughly 100 rds of brass ammo (no steel) through it and that was at the local indoor range.

It fired flawlessly and accurately. Absolutely NO malfunctions of any kind.

I think I carried it for a week and decided against it being my carry gun.



I take care of my stuff and it has been babied and VERY well maintained.

Package includes:

- Glock 23 Gen 4 w 3 mags and all original box, paperwork, test case, backstraps, etc.

- Trijicon Night Sites mounted ($100).

- Original box for trijicons for any warranty issues which has OEM polymer sites in it.

- Comp Tac Paddle hoster ($65 plus shipping on amazon).



Whole package for $625. Please no low ball. The best prices would put this setup at (600 for gun+tax, $70 for holster+shipping, and $80-$100 for sites) = $750 - $770.

Can meet face to face in Plano area and I do prefer a firearm bill of sale.

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor."
