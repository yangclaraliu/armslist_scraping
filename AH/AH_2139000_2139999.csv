The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider

Had a pretty bad magwell opening job done to it (too tight), finish was damn near non-existent, wood in bad shape, awful trigger, etc. I fixed the bad magwell job and tested fit with many different mags (US Palm, surplus steel, Tapco, Thermold, Pro-mags, Bulgarian polymer, etc) and verified that there is no wobble whatsoever. I gutted this entire gun, re-coated it with Brownell's Aluma-Hyde in matte black, polished and installed a new Tapco G2 trigger & axis pin retaining plate. Gun also has an AK-74 style muzzle brake, but will come with the original slant brake. It is wearing a US Palm/Tango Down BattleGrip and a somehow not awful UTG quad-rail handguard and Tapco 6-position M4 stock.

If you don't lilke the ""tacticool"" look, I have a couple different furniture sets I can install. One that I refinished in Russian Red, a Romanian brown set with ""donkey dong"" forward grip, and a sweet set that has some ""trench-art.""

Mags include 2 Tapco mags, 3 East German steel, and one 48-round Thermold

I will include 400 rounds of Golden Tiger 124gr FMJBT ammo if this goes for asking price, a penny less... you get no ammo.

Barrels have a Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and the Hunter comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action.

This is a rare AK, and one of the best with a LOW Serial number (0XXX) 

It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desirable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver. 

It is top of the line when it comes to AK's. Have any questions just ask. I can send more pictures upon request. Thanks for looking"

I have shot it once roughly 50-75 rounds through it. It's works perfectly I'm just not a .45 guy. I've always wanted a 1911 but now that I have it I think I'd like something else. I don't need to sell and don't mind keeping it is a really neat gun. Just curious if I could get a decent trade offer or close to my money back to get something different. My phone is acting up but I will get pictures on here soon. I'm looking for something in .40sw or 9mm would prefer compact or sub but open. Would consider trading down with cash possibly on the perfect gun would trade up but I just bought this so my play funds are tight. No super low ball offers please I know i'm asking new price that's because its only been shot once and i'm throwing in 100 rounds.

The XD line is my favorite of the polymer guns but I recently traded for a smaller carry gun.
This one is almost new and has only had 200 rounds through it, and comes with all the XD gear and two 9 round mags.

I'm interested in trading for a 1911, either a 4 inch commander size or a 5 inch full sized.  I'm primarily interested in the Para Ordnance GI Expert, but I'm pretty open to other makes, but no Taurus PT1911's, I had a taurus come apart on me while shooting recently so I'm not so sure that I trust them.
I have between 50-100 rounds of .40 that I will trade for .45 if you have some, and I have an assortment of extra gear for the XD to even out a trade for a higher end 1911.

I'd also be interested in other SA or SA/DA full sized handguns in 9mm or .40.  Im particularly interested in a Beretta 92 or 96, or cz75 style guns, such as CZ's or Baby Eagles/Jericho's.
I would also be interested in a SIG P238 or 938.

(Right now my finger is itching to pull the trigger on a set of PVS-14's and class 1 IR laser for night shooting!)

But I've never went ahead with any such purchase. Every range I've been to in the area does not allow full-auto fire, does not allow .50 BMG, and is closed before dark.

When I've asked about it, the consensus seems to be that people who own such stuff must have private property to shoot on.

I thought I would ask here on Armslist. 

Does anyone know of a public place where such shooting is possible? Is there anyone with private property around here who would be willing to allow another shooter on their range, maybe for a fee or something?

671,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2139671,For Sale/Trade:  Offroad go kart,"Owasso, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 800,"Listed On: Thursday, September 26, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale here a Hammerhead 80t go kart. This kart is pretty bad, and meant for bigger kids or smaller adults. I am just over 6 foot and 185 lbs and I can cruise in this pretty comfortably with my boy in the passenger seat. It has 4 wheel suspension, hydraulic disk brake for the back two wheels, constantly variable transmission, a 6.5 hp honda clone engine, rack and pinion steering, electric start with pull rope backup, adjusable driver seat, a horn!, roll cage, seat belts. If you are concerned about this being too much for your child you can throttle back the engine with a simple screw to limit the top speed. As it sits right now it tops out around 25 mph. The company that makes these carts has a really good website that details the models, I think they changed the name to mudhead if you look it up. On this site you can buy almost every piece of the kart if anything needs replaced and they also sell upgrade parts and kits to make it even badder. I have just freshened it up with a new pull rope, new battery, new drive belt, and new brake pads. It is ready to ride, fires right up off of the starter and idles like a champ. I will include the drive belt I just replaced as it still worked fine, keep it as a spare or to get the part number off of it without pulling the cover. I need $800 for this kart, I will also consider trade offers but I am really looking for cash. Trades that will be the most recieved are handguns and shotguns of a tactical nature, 9mm or .45 would be best and since Id rather have the cash your trade needs to be able to be sold used for at least about $900. Email me with any trade offers or questions.

I will include a sling and 200+ of the orange primer discs. I can also make a copy of the pertinent pages of the owner's manual. Price is shipped.

  FYI, I just tried a bolt and breech plug from an 'Extreme' Knight M-L in this gun. The primers fired just fine. All it would take is a Bolt and a BP from an Extreme/Elite to convert this to that setup. Then one could use the red plastic primer holders, or go to a NPJ BP, no plastic jacket. You don't really need the whole 'conversion kit', just the bolt & breech plug. Not that there is anything wrong with the orange jackets.

This Savage 116 I picked up at Cabela's as one of their exclusive offerings. 

From their site:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Savage® Arms Long-Range Stainless Fluted Barrel Rifle
(SKU 03206552)
Cabela’s-exclusive 24"" fluted stainless steel barrel
Adjustable AccuTrigger
AccuStock bedding
Available in magnum chamberings
Cabela’s and Savage partnered to build a long-action rifle loaded with features for long-range hunting precision. Features include: a synthetic AccuStock™; an adjustable, sweet-shooting AccuTrigger™; and, best of all, a 24"" stainless steel barrel with the tight-grouping accuracy that’s made Savage rifles famous.""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rifle has exactly 30 shots down the tube. I don't have any pics of the targets, but groups were under 3/4 MOA using HSM 180gr factory reloads.

The glass is an IOR Valdada 3-18x42 FFP Sniper's Hide Edition GEN 4 with Butler Creek caps sitting in low rings on top of a steel Warne 20MOA mount that's been bedded to the receiver. The glass is perfect, though there may be a ring mark if you undo the rings (don't know as I have no reason to take the scope out of the rings).

It also has a Harris 9-13"" notched leg bipod with a pod-loc, a cheek riser, and a Tactical Works tactical bolt handle.

Total outlay was probably around $2400. Asking $1900/obo shipped, and I'll throw in the IOR RDS Edge I got with the glass in a promo. Also, a local deal will include ammo."

The guns is missing the rear trigger guard bolt/screw, which you can get for under $20.00.  The barrel does have the threads for the blank firing adapter, and a reproduction thread cover (I think it's a reproduction, as the bluing is new).  Does not have a cleaning rod or a bayonet.  Price is firm, and is a little less than what they are selling for elsewhere.  Great gun and they do not make them like this anymore!  Also available, a set of Lee dies in 6.55 x 55 Swedish.  If you buy them with the rifle, I'll sell them for $20.00 more.  $295.00 firm, this is less than what they are retailing for right now.  I'm guessing that your wife/girlfriend wasn't considerate enough to buy you one of these for Christmas....so celebrate the new year and buy one for yourself!  Sorry, but no shipping, local sale only."
