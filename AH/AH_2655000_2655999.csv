 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 WSSM and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1800 with scope or $1600 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

367,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2655367,"For Sale:  BUFFALO BORE AMMO - DEER GRENADE .44 MAGNUM +P AMMO - 240 GR.SOFT CAST - G.C. (1,550 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","Azusa, California, United States",$ 35,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 5, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=232

Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade 44 Mag. +P is a 240gr. Massive, Hollow Nosed, 12 BHN cast bullet with a gas check traveling at the below velocities out of stock, real world, over-the-counter firearms:

1. 1935 fps -- Marlin 1894 20 inch

2. 1897 fps -- Marlin 1894 18 inch

3. 1871 fps -- Marlin 1894 16.5 inch

4. 1578 fps -- Ruger Super Blackhawk 5.5 inch

5. 1535 fps -- Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch

6. 1466 fps -- S&W MT Gun 4 inch

This load is designed as the world's premier deer load for 44 mag. The cast bullet is not considered soft, but it is not really a HARD cast bullet either as it only has a BHN (Brinell Hardness Numnber) of 12 so, it could be termed a medium/hard cast bullet. It performs as follows:

At an impact velocity of 1,100 fps it will mushroom to about 75 Cal. and should push right through any deer with a broadside shot.

At an impact velocity of 1,500 fps it will mushroom and some of the mushroom will fragment off and send bullet particles flying through the deer, but much of the mushroom and shank will remain intact and should push through any deer hit broadside.

At an impact velocity of 1,900 fps the entire mushroom will turn into shrapnel and send bullet particles all throughout the deer. The shank will remain intact, but will re-mushroom and do horrific damage inside the deer and will probably push through any deer hit broadside.

Of course all these results will vary depending on how much bone, if any, you hit, etc. This load was designed specifically to do horrific damage to deer sized game and as such does not penetrate like a hard cast flat nosed bullet. This bullet only penetrates about 30% as deep as a typical flat nosed hard cast bullet, which is perfect penetration for shallow game like deer, and medium sized pigs or black bear. This load is your best bet for immediately anchoring any deer with the 44 mag. cartridge that is not CNS (central nervous system) hit.

This bullet is properly alloyed, lubed and is gas checked; it will NOT lead-foul barrels.

This load is designed to be safe in ALL/ANY, all steel firearms that are in normal operating condition. We do not recommend its use in lightweight alloyed revolvers as the bullets may jump the crimp."

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. This is an amazing rifle. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. By bidding and/or buying the above firearm you are agreeing that you may legally own this firearm in reference to all of your local laws. Above Price reflects a cash/U.S.P.S.

How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragonov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers a magazine adapter to use AK47 mags. $575.00 Cash only at this time.

I will have it listed for two more days, and then it will go to the gun show to get traded to a dealer. 

 I'd prefer it go to someone local with a decent trade, rather than get raped on the value, but if no one has any high end AKs they want to trade, so be it.

AR15 built on an Aero Precision lower and upper. Rock River Arms lower parts kit. Milspec buffer tube with Magpul CTR stock. Magpul MOE+ grip. Troy Industries ambidextrous bolt release lever. Windham Weaponry SRC barrel, chrome lined bore and chamber with railed gas block. Windham Weaponry bolt carrier group. UTG Pro carbine length quad rail. Streamlight Polytac LED torch with offset rail attachment. Bushnell TRS red dot sight on a .8"" UTG riser (cowitnesses with any standard front sight). I made my own 45° offset rapid transition sights from two 45° picatinny attachments and a Troy Industries Dioptic fixed rear sight (with diamond aperture) and Troy fixed front battle sight. Rock solid.

Entertaining all reasonable offers. I can itemize if needed, but I have well over 1150.00 in the rifle build, not to mention time spent building it, but that part is just fun. Please bear that in mind. It's never been fired and I considered keeping it but I have one too many ARs and I am actually partial to AK platform weapons.

Will come with 7 Magpul gen2 PMags and about 200 rounds of various .223/5.56 ammo."

What I'd really like to do is trade my good condition m&m m10 ak47 (30 rounds fired since brand new, great ak-check reviews online), 2000 rounds of 7.62x39 (1000x golden tiger-great ak ammo), 5 ak47 surplus mags plus cash for the rifle.

If the deal is right I'd be willing to do a pure cash but it's in your best interest to take the ak+cash deal, I just don't have time to sell it then try to buy the rifle.

Setup as it now stands includes:
1) RRA Tri rail system, new cost $170
2) forward grip
3) diamond head flip up BUIS 
4) Trijicon ACOG 
5) premium stock with additional space for storage

Typically the rifle without these additions retails for about $1600-1700 when you can find them. Since the Rock River piston system doesn't require a buffer tube the entire stock is now available for storage. For example if you have a small Tac light you can put that where the buffer would have been, throw in a couple of extra batteries and keep them with you while keeping your AR as streamlined as possible until you need that light, or laser or whatnot. Maybe the coolest part is that the absence of the buffer lets the stock fold. The RRA folding system doesn't interfere with charging or firing the gun in either position, locks solidly and deploys quickly. It also has a 2 position gas block so that if you're in a field situation, as round count and fouling increase, you can change to HIGH to allow more gas to drive the piston. This keeps you firing when standard gas op ARs may have failed. There are a lot of cool features to this AR, and Rock River is an excellent manufacturer. Since I can't stand folks who say ""I don't need to sell, just seeing what's out there"" I'll try to be more specific. I'm interested in cash, precious metals, and other quality firearms. Sig 226 family in 9mm, lever action .22s, and other quality ARs get preference, but all will be considered.  Not all of the accessories listed have to go with the rifle (except the Tri Rail of course) so let me know what you have to offer and what you want and we can try to make a deal. Mags and Ammo are a possibility if needed. Thanks for reading. Pics on request. All offers get a response."

The rear sight was removed by the second owner when a larger obj scope was installed in the 70's. The mount is a older Redfield. Gun has original barrel with no internal pitting and great rifling. I've personal shot maybe 20-30 rounds of Winchester ammo out of the gun as it's been in storage about 14 years, it is a sub moa shooter very impressive. I was told the gun was sporterized around its manufacture date. I purchased it from the second owner about 18 years ago. The stock has hand/finger reliefs carved in it and was told the mans father had it done when the gun was setup originally for a sheriff dept. sniper rifle by the mans father. Can email or text more pics if needed. Would make a great deer rifle. Eddy Stone"
