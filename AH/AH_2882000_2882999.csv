Comes equipped with built in Insight laser that I sighted in with the tools provided as best I could for the small amount of ammo that this gun has fired (30 rds).  Seems to be pretty spot on though at 7 yds at least.

I bought this gun a month ago at Targetmaster in Chadds Ford for my girlfriend brand new I paid $469.99 plus taxes.  It has been to the range once before where we put 30 rounds downrange before she decided the recoil was too much for her to handle (we were shooting +P rounds so that didn't help with recoil on a lightweight snubby as you might imagine, I had a ton of fun shooting this gun though, functions flawlessly).  Anyway, I bought an aftermarket Hogue Tamer grip (was about $22, this is what is equipped now and in all of the pictures).  I haven't shot it since but it feels SO much better equipped to fire hot rounds now.  It feels like follow up shots will be incredibly easier than they were with the tiny original grip and from what I've read greatly improves accuracy though I can't vouch for that myself.  So we were going to pick up some standard pressure .38 Spl rounds and head to the range to try it out with the new grip and lighter rounds when she informed me that she didn't like revolvers and wanted a small semi auto instead.  Wish I knew this before I bought it but hey it happens.  So after handling a bunch of semi's she's set on the Ruger LC9.

Price includes everything that came new with the gun (Cardboard box, Soft case that zips up with sewn in holster and loop to hold a speed loader (looks like a CD/DVD case you could walk around with it and nobody would think twice), User Manual, lock, tools to adjust the laser, etc. the usual stuff).  Only thing with it that it does not have is the spent shell casing from the factory since the instructions that came with the Hogue Tamer grip said to use a spent .38 casing to pry the bottom of the grip onto the pin and that was the only one I had which dented the casing to all hell (the grip is tough), but it has the signed envelope.  Also included is the original grip with the roll pin to attach it (You may want to pick up a new roll pin if you reinstall the original grip but I have no idea why anyone would want to go back to the original very hard rubber grip but it's there anyway), an Uncle Mike's IWB Concealed Carry holster, 23 rounds of .38 Spl +P Remington 125 gr SJHP's and a box of Buffalo Bore standard pressure short barrel low flash heavy 38 Spl 125 gr JHP's (Non +P but they're Buffalo Bore and advertise at 900 fps muzzle velocity and designed to expand at much lower than that, they're designed for snubbies).  Saving my cheap FMJ's to fire out of my GP-100 .357 Mag.  

Overall, this is an awesome gun and if I didn't already have an XDs .45 for a CCW, I'd happily keep it for myself.  I hate to get rid of it after using it so little but I promised her a gun and can't afford to keep it while buying an LC9 and I also need to save up for a Glock 20 for myself so I really have no choice but to sell/trade it.

Email me with any questions, concerns, offers.  I'm open to all offers worst I can say is no.  Will only meet FTF at an FFL within a reasonable distance (Targetmaster, French Creek, Double Action, etc)  I will not ship it anywhere.  Buyer also pays the transfer fee to the FFL.  Thanks for looking.  Asking $450 for everything.  I'll take $425 if you don't want the ammo.  I've put about $575 total into all this and it's basically brand new.  I have all of the paperwork for it."

I wanted to get into the AK-74 platform because of the cheap milsurp ammo, but it looks like we’re in for another period of panic buying.  I’m selling this ammo at near-cost to me to recoup all the fees I’m accruing from canceling orders.  Get it while you can.

I opened one of the cans and a 30-round packet on Saturday 3/29 because I wanted to see what the ammo looked like.  This was before I heard about this crazy news.  Other than that, it’s all here and intact.  The other can is unopened.  The ammo will come with a can opener, but no wooden crate.  I will not ship this ammo, local pickup and cash only.

2 Extended Magazines
1 Standard Magazine
Padded Pistol Case

Estimate 4 or 5 trips to the range with 50 to 100 rounds shot each trip.  Barrel shows a VERY faint ""Glock Smile"" in the finish only (I have close up pics).  I could easily say that it only had 100 rounds down the pipe (like everyone else does) and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
Exterior shows NO wear
Bought it as a carry, but never carried it (which is why the holster listed below is still new)

I bought it for a carry piece and decided I would prefer a single stack (which I've already bought).

This pistol was bought through West Coast Armory who had taken it back in trade with very few rounds through it.  It did not come with the original box and I didn't want to spend $30 on Ebay for an original Glock box so I've kept it in a padded pistol case.

I have many pics, but bottom line, it shows well and if I didn't decided on a slimmer pistol, I wouldn't be getting rid of it.  It shoots comfortably and reliably.  No issues with defensive rounds or range ammo.  I really like this pistol, but I now have a new carry piece and I already have other range guns.

Pistol and accessories listed above is $525.  I will sell for $500 IF I don't have to travel outside of Gig Harbor to meet you.  I'm not discounting if you want me to deliver.  I will only respond to offers that are acceptable.  Just for comparison a new Gen 3 runs $490-$525 new; Trijicon Sights run about $100 plus cost of install, 2 extensions are another $20.  Add tax and you'll see your saving $150+ in exchange for a handful of trips to the range.

I also have a NIB (took it out for pics) Blackhawk Leather Pancake holster that I will sell for $30 (cost $50+ at Sportco).

Not interested in trades.  Cash only.  Face to face.  Only sold to a Concealed Permit Holder with a WA drivers license.

It has aftermarket sights, and there are some marks on the front of the frame where on the grip, I don't know why they are there, if some one thought they could do their own checkering, or if they go back to the war and some one made some marks for some other reason. This did have the lanyard loop which is missing, the holes are there but loop is gone.  The rest of the gun I think is in great shape.

This rifle was purchased NEW from SHOOOTERS towards the end of January of this year 2014, as pictured. I have only been able to take it out to the range twice and it only has 270 rounds through it. I am including the 230 rounds i have left over from the brick i bought when i first purchased this rifle. As shown this rifle has the official Magpul MBUS sights, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip, Magpul rail covers, and the Magpul Stock. This model also has the threaded barrel with flash hider. I still have everything the rifle came with: original box, papers, registration card, and also will be including a vism 5 mag rifle case that fits perfectly. It has thick padding and 5 magazine slots that fit the 25 rounders great. This M&P 15-22 is of newer production and hasn't given me any problems. I am a college student at UNF and don't have as much time to shoot as i thought i would. The two times I shot this rifle at the gun gallery it performed flawlessly. Im looking to sell the rifle with everything pictured including 230 rounds of ammo, and a rifle case for $550. As you can see from the receipt i practically paid this for just the gun alone. This gun is only 2 month old and has been kept very clean.

I'm open to trades, in particular I'm looking for a good 22lr or 9mm pistol for a more portable range gun for when i have the time, not too interested in rifles or shotguns or anything that takes up too much space. Thanks for looking and i can provide more pics upon request, of the rifle case and etc."

The LDA trigger has a long arc of movement with a relatively low level of resistance to pressure from the shooter's finger both through the stroke and, most critically, at the point of release. And the 7.45 still features the thumb safety and grip safety of the original 1911A1, making it easy to secure against unintended discharges, and fast into action from the holster. The incredibly accurate fully ramped, match-type barrel is also crowned and forged, something normally seen only on a custom 1911. The gun is very smoothly finished and its sight has deep lateral serrations to cut down glare. This pistol features 3-white-dot sights, wooden grips and a 7-round magazine.

JSE Upper, purchased complete w/ 1:7 twist barrel, bolt carrier group and bayonet lug. I pinned it to my lower and was good to go. If you've never heard of JSE Surplus, give 'em a look-over. They seem to be one of those 'best-kept-secrets' in the AR shooting world.
LRB Arms Lower: To quote one post on ar15 dot com: ""Good, strong finish, no casting flash or burrs, and the LPKs fit perfectly."" My upper pinned right up.
Rear Dual Aperture Sight, Adjustable for Windage & Elevation
S&W Adjustable stock
Magpul Trigger Guard
Ambidextrous sling adapter
Complete bolt carrier group

The rifle has been broken in, meaning the upper was cleaned between rounds for the first shots to satisfy the warranty requirement. It is very accurate. I fired about 60 rounds through it after the break-in, give or take. All told, this rifle has less than 100 rounds through it.
One 40-round magazine and one 20-round magazine and the Hogue grip accessory that allows you to store small items in the Hogue grip come with the rifle. The case in the photograph is not included.
The price of $700 is firm.
No warranty is offered or should be assumed with this rifle."

This includes disassembling the gun completely, removing any rust, soaking every part in a heavy degreaser, and scrubbing the gun entirely. After, it is soaked in the degreaser again. Then, all parts are polished by hand, then are put in the ultrasonic bath to remove any lingering polishing compounds, and then all of the parts are put in pressure soak with a deep penetrating lubricant to ensure that the lubricant gets into the pores of the metal, and doesn't just coat it.

This process keeps your gun running smoother, and more accurate for way longer than the typical ""basic"" clean that people do to their firearms.

All of my work is ensured by 100% cash payment, no questions asked. If anything gets damaged, which it never has, I will pay for the gun in full.

I have up for sale a 2001 Nissan Xterra. It is the powerful 6-cylinder engine and is 4x4. This is the automatic transmission. This also has power windows and locks. The tires on it are decent and the 4x4 works great (as the recent snowstorms have shown us!). This has keyless entry and rear wiper. This shows 123K miles and it still runs fine. This has two keys and two keyless entry remotes. This is a fantastic truck and would be great for anyone needing a reliable car. The A/C blows cold and the heater blows hot! It has the sunroof and the rack insert that covers the glass up when not in use (the thing everyone breaks or loses). This also comes with a Haynes repair manual that lists out everything I have done to the vehicle for the time that we have owned it. This also has the trailer hitch installed as well. Here is a brief list of what has been done to it recently 
-Fresh oil and filter change 
-Brand new front Windshield 
-Spectre Performance Air Filter 
-New Headlight Bulbs 
-Aftermarket Grille guard (Light ready!) 
-New SSL 6.5 door speakers 
-New 6x9 rear speakers 
-Brand New Radiator and Flushed Coolant System! 

If you have any questions please shoot me an email on here, or shoot me a text only to REDACTED and I will respond ASAP. For any specifics or any questions don't hesitate to message me! This is a used vehicle so please don't expect it to be perfect; she has her dings and a few fluid leaks, but nothing that would make it ""ugly"". We would be asking a significant amount more if I had the time to fix the leak and the light was off, I just dont have time and we need it gone.It appears to have a valve cover gasket leak causing a decent oil spot under the truck. I have already bought the gaskets and grommets (will come with the truck at no extra cost) I just don't have the time to put it on yet due to school, work, and my internship. It is minor enough of a leak that I have been driving it this whole time with no other problems or noticeable issues, i just monitor the fluid level. Just like most other Xterras out there the check engine light occasionally pops on (it's on as of now). We've taken it into the shop a couple times and every time they tell us that it is nothing major and that it wont effect anything mechanical. (usually like a loose connector issue or occasionally the O2 or cat sensor) Either way, it has been this way since we bought it about a year ago and it has never given us any kind of issue with it. Also, if you let the truck sit for a few days and do not start it the battery seems weak. but with regular driving it seems fine. Even if it needed replaced it is a comparatively cheap fix. Plus, we have it priced very fair considering taking into account the relatively low costs of the probable repairs. This drove perfect through the snow like nothing was out of the ordinary! This has an up to date tag and clear title ready to become yours! Spend your tax return on something that will last! This is obviously ""as is"" ""where is"" so feel free to ask any and all questions and I will answer them ASAP! Really not looking for any trades but would consider ""partial"" trades for firearm related items. But we are mainly just looking for cash.

This includes disassembling the gun completely, removing any rust, soaking every part in a heavy degreaser, and scrubbing the gun entirely. After, it is soaked in the degreaser again. Then, all parts are polished by hand, then are put in the ultrasonic bath to remove any lingering polishing compounds, and then all of the parts are put in pressure soak with a deep penetrating lubricant to ensure that the lubricant gets into the pores of the metal, and doesn't just coat it.

This process keeps your gun running smoother, and more accurate for way longer than the typical ""basic"" clean that people do to their firearms.

All of my work is ensured by 100% cash payment, no questions asked. If anything gets damaged, which it never has, I will pay for the gun in full.

For those who may not know, AR pistols are 100% legal to own, as long as it is used as a pistol. If you add a 6 position shoulder stock, it is a short barreled rifle! If you add a vertical foregrip, it becomes a short barreled rifle! If you put this pistol upper receiver/barrel assembly on an AR lower from a rifle, it is a short barreled rifle!
The good news...this was built as an AR pistol from a virgin lower, and is 100% compliant with all ATF rules & regulations. Ready to fire and have fun.

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

My dad and I used to reload many years (and guns) ago (when he was around) and I did buy a few of these (bullets, ammo cases) new the last few years as I was intending to get started reloading this rifle again; but there is just no time for this right now so I have sold the rifle and have no other items to sale but what is listed below.

I'll meet on a weekend where my wife and I can be available in KC, Topeka, Lawrence, Wichita or another nearby town by an agreed to time and day (and she gets to shop).  Or I'd meet within 30 miles or so of Emporia, KS (about any time-- if I'm available and I usually am if not out-of-town on business).

I'd like to just sell off this entire lot, but offers will be accepted for anything over $60 are now being accepted and I'll MAIL most items (at USPS Post rates as best I can determine them).  But the live ammo (which is illegal for me to mail) is only available face-to-face.  I'm happy to meet face-to-face with a knowledgeable, sincere local buyer over 21 yrs old for this lot.

ALL items below are 25-06:

Brass: NEW
99 new (never primed), ""R-P"" head-stamped (Remington) cases

Brass: (each inspected, all are full resized, trimmed, and most are chamfered/deburred)
50 matched head-stamped ""R-P"" (Remington) cases (ready to prime, chamfer/load)
75 Assorted (with some necked down .270 to .25-06) cases (ready to prime/load).

Dies:
RCBS #12001 ""F L Die Set .25-06""  Set with full length resize die and bullet seating die.

Bullets: (ALL .257"")
Sierra GameKing  120 gr. HP (sealed box of 100)
Nosler Ballistic Tip 115 gr. SP (sealed box of 50)
Sierra 75 gr. HP (one sealed box of 100, one open box with 80)
Sierra 100 gr. SPBT (one box of 54 newer, one box of 72 older (all same #1625 model)

35 live rounds- reloads (with notes), and (six) factory Winchester CPX-2 ballistic tip rounds

The bullets and new Remington 100 count brass alone would cost over $200 shipped... and so you get the dies, the other 125 pieces of good brass, the loaded rounds and ammo boxes (see the picture) for the full offer here.

Cash at a face-to-face meeting with a local buyer is preferred and I'd take $20 less for this lot (without the live rounds or ammo boxes; to keep shipping costs/hassles down for us both) IF I sell this lot over the mail... and I'LL PAY the shipping to any LEGAL US state via USPS Priority Mail-- for a flat $230 in this case.

PS... dies are in a green RCBS standard die box, not pictured and are in clean, rust-free condition and includes the shell holder-- just as they came in the 80s (when they were purchased new).

Sincere, clear minded buyers only need reply with a name and phone number for a sincere reply in kind."

The gas mask is one of the most essential items for survival scenarios. Now, you have the chance to own an authentic USGI gas mask that has been proven in battle. The MCU-2/P gas mask is one of the best gas masks that are commercially available, seeing time with both the United States Navy and the United States Air Force.



The MCU-2/P gas mask is an authentic piece of United States Military history. This USGI mask was originally adopted in the early 1990s and was used by both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force. The mask was used during the Gulf War after replacing the M17 gas mask, but was later replaced by the current-issue M50 Joint Service general purpose mask. Though it is no longer in production, these gas masks are still very much sought after for numerous reasons, including their comfort, tight seal, wide lens and protective capabilities.

The MCU-2/P gas mask was manufactured by MSA, one of the industry’s leading manufacturers of gas masks and other safety products designed for personal protection. MSA is one of the U.S. Military’s top suppliers of gas masks and protective gear, which means you can rest assured that ordering this mask means receiving a mask of only the highest quality. If you are ordering a mask and intending to use it for real-life protection, your best bet would be to buy something of this quality rather than opting to save a few bucks for an older surplus mask. Of course, that is only what I would do. That said let us learn a little more about this fine gas mask.

MSA’s MCU-2/P is easily one of our best gas masks. To start out, the gas mask is fully adjustable with the inclusion of a six-point adjustable harness. The harness features zip-pulls for a quick and proper fitting. The face piece is made from a tough, silicone polymer that provides a comfortable fit as well as a tight seal around the face of the user – just do not forget to shave! Also noteworthy is the wide ballistic polycarbonate lens that provides a panoramic view, virtually eliminating the visual problems associated with lesser masks. The exhalation valve makes breathing a breeze and the use of a front-mounted voice emitter makes speech both audible and clear. Finally, this mask features a drinking tube, permitting you to drink from a compatible canteen without the need to remove the mask.

The MCU-2/P gas mask accepts standard NATO 40mm filters. The addition of dual filter ports makes the use of a rifle in conjunction with the mask very simple. A filter can be installed on either side of the face, providing a clear field of vision while shooting.

As noted, the MCU-2/P gas mask provides proven protection. This mask has been used in combat and is now ready to serve you as well. If you are preparing for a disaster, spend a little more and get a mask that you know will protect you from nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological threats. Consider this gas mask for:

- Nuclear threats

- Biological threats

- Chemical threats

- Radiological threats

- Survival kits

- Reenactments

- Collections

- Much more…
