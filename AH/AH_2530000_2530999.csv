Purchased new around Christmas, sticker on the case says the pistol was made November 2013, so it's very new. Basically I bought it and ended up getting another M11-A1 from my wife for Christmas. So since I have 2 new M11's I am selling one of them. The pistol is new and unfired and includes the original case, (3) 15rd mags, lock and manual.

The M11A1 is a total package Sig. It is compact yet can hold 15 rounds + one in the chamber and great for concealed carry if you have a permit. It includes the Short Reset Trigger (SRT) which makes the S/A trigger pull extremely short. Also has the  SIGLITE® tritium night sights, and the internal parts are coated in a phosphate corrosion resistant coating.

The only thing that I have done to the pistol is I removed the UID sticker from the frame (assumed it was meant to be taken off) which looked much better in my opinion. However it comes with another UID sticker on the case (see picture below) which you could put on the pistol if needed.

I also cleaned the factory grease and lubricated the necessary parts.

Will meet locally, must be able to legally buy a firearm, cash only please.
Priced to sell fast, this is probably the cheapest you will find an M11-A1 anywhere.

Included are a set of Sig factory 3-dot tritium night sights, a Sig-brand .22LR conversion slide and barrel with adjustable 3-dot target sights installed, rubber hogue grips, original Sig Sauer brand grips, one Sig Sauer brand .45ACP magazine, 4 Act-Mag brand .45ACP magazines, two .22LR magazines, original box/lock/accessories and paperwork.

This is a well cared for Sig. I'm found it a blast to shoot and relaxing to clean. So much so that  cleaned it after every trip to the range. Its in great shape and relatively new. I bought it from a local a year ago who said he put about 200 rounds through the 45 barrell, and 100 rounds through the .22. I've added another 600 .45 rounds, and 300 .22 rounds or so since then. 

The additional conversion kit is really convenient. The additional slide, barrel and magazines allow the owner to fire .22 LR with the simple changing of the slide (takes less than half a minute to switch it). It allows for cheap plinking

503,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2530503,For Sale:  LaRue Tactical LT123 Scope Rings,"Alamogordo, Las Cruces, New Mexico",$ 140,"Listed On: Monday, January 6, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a 2 month old set of LT123 rings from LaRue Tactical that I no longer need. These are 30mm rings with the VFZ style mount. Additional info below straight from the LaRue website. Text me at 9one0-six33-2two39 if you are interested. Will ship at buyers expense.

""Standard-height rifle scope rings with QD functionality.
The LT123 rings are ideal when mounting rifle scopes with extra large objective lenses, where clearance is a concern. These 30mm rings attach to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail, but are the perfect-match for the LT113 on Remington 700 model rifles.

The LT123 positions the centerline of the optic 1.28"" above the top of the rail.""

""About VFZ™ Mounts:
VFZ™ is a new theory in the concept of clamping accessories to MIL-STD-1913 rails. Instead of using a horizontal cross-bolt, the VFZ™ uses a vertical bolt that draws up a clamping foot against the lower angle of the rail, seating the mount similarly to a fully-closed LaRue lever. Once installed on the firearm, index marks allow the user to remove the mount, then reattach to the same tension, providing unprecedented return to zero for a non-QD-levered mount. The unique vertical alignment of the clamp allows components that are structurally stronger than traditional cross-bolt designs.

Why should I select VFZ™ Mounts instead of a QD Lever Mount?:
If you intend to leave an optic or accessory on a rail for the life of the rifle, the VFZ™ option is for you. The VFZ™ is intended as a longer-term, semi-permanent mounting alternative to our well-known Speed Levers. While both mounts will allow the user to remove the mount from the weapon, reinstall it in the same position, and return to zero, the VFZ™ mount is intended for users that will not need to constantly remove and install their mounts (especially in the field).

Provides the same bore height and sight picture as standard USGI A2 sights.

Locking bar and crossbolt attachment system clamps securely to MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rails and sits only .20"" above the rail, so there’s no interference with the main sighting system. Front sight base won’t interfere with the beam path of military IR laser/illuminators. No special tools needed; installs using a slot tip screwdriver."

The length of pull and comb height are fully adjustable and can be changed as needed without any tools. The 24inch barrel is threaded and comes with a muzzle break. Given this rifles recoil eliminating features it is easy to get back on target after your shot to see your impacts. I am selling the rifle only to finance an AR 10. While i do live in Rangely I make fairly frequent trips to Grand Junction, and go to Denver about once a month.

Would consider a trade or partial trade for a ""high end AR 10"".
email me at REDACTED I can send more pictures if need be. Thanks

I have two new Sig select/full auto lower-Ar15/M4 556 (I have my paperwork for fast sale). If you know what these are then you want them :)

This is a select fire and full auto (fun switch). I am looking to sell as I purchased in February 2013 for a project that I never completed. They have had after market work done. the entire trigger group was worked on (minor machine work and polish). It has all the normal magpul furniture. This is a complete lower! You need to add a complete upper to make it functional. I was going to make a premium tier 1 fully auto 556. I do not want trades (I have enough guns and ammo already). I only want cash for them. $3,500.00 each or $6,700.00 for both. They are brand new in the box. I have the receipts for everything. 

We must be in person at a local gun shop to Dayton, Ohio. You but it from me directly. You pay the transfer fees or paperwork fees. You do need the tax stamp, but what you do after the transfer is between you and the gun shop. Will not ship!

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

Up for sale is a NHM91, featuring a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches, and comes along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. The bi-pod has never been installed. Also comes with sling and cleaning kit. Comes with 3 mags, a 30 rd, 20, rd and 10 rd. Each one of these mags has a USA made mag follower (counts as 1 USA made part).Now, let’s talk about the changes we did. First we replaced the original wood furniture with a set of original PolyTech AK-47 blonde furniture (Very Rare - at least $250 in value, if you can find a matching set). FYI. The original PolyTech AK-47 parts are NOS (New Old Stock) originally manufactured by Poly Technologies, Inc. of China between 1985 and 1989. These were produced at State Arsenals 416 and 386 during that time.

Next we made the rifle 922 compliant. We replace the fire control group with a USA made Tapco trigger assembly (Counts as 3 USA made parts). Replaced the gas piston with a new USA made Tapco gas piston (counts as 1 USA made part). Next we removed the tac welded muzzle thread protector, replaced the front site detent pin and installed a brand new customized, USA made, muzzle brake (counts as 1 USA made part). Overall in making this rifle 922 compliant, we needed to exchange 6 parts out. So, if we count them up, we now have 6 USA made parts on the gun.

The NHM91 does not come with a scope rail. So, we ordered a relatively new product from Parabellum Armament, their AKARS – adaptive rail system ($130 Value Retail). This will allow you to scope your NHM91 without changing the original config by drilling into the receiver and installing a scope rail. AKARS™—is a weapon upgrade that replaces the rear sight leaf and the receiver’s bolt cover on the Kalashnikov assault rifle. We found that this design is excellent and that field stripping and cleaning does not take away from obtaining zero once you have mounted and dialed in your scope. Included is the original dust cover.

Please make sure your local dealer will accept a firearm from a non-FFL01 dealer for transferring the gun. We are a collector not a dealer.
