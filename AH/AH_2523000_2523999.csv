For my asking price, I'll also throw in a box (25 rounds) of Remington Golden Sabre 124gr JHP ammo and an Uncle Mike's IWB nylon holster. It had been carried once and to the range once, 87 rounds down the barrel. It's been cleaned probably 4 or 5 times since it's range visit. Gun is in excellent shape. I'm only looking to sell because it never gets carried, just sits in the safe. I'll listen to firearms trades, just send me an email. Any questions feel free to email through Armslist. Price is $450.

I hate to sell it, but I just dont get to shoot as much as I want and its just sitting in my safe. This is a 1988 JJ West German stamped Sig Sauer P226 9mm. This pistol was one of my grandfathers police friends and we found it in his attic about three years ago in the original box. He used it for about three years as a service pistol, then they switched to glocks and he put it away in the box in his attic. 
I took it to a gun smith in Greensboro, he replaced all the springs with factory Sig parts completely dissassembled, cleaned, and light polished the internals. He also took out the original guide rod and replaced it with a polished stainless steel one made in usa.  I have put at least 500 rounds down range with zero issues and a trigger that breaks like glass. It has some wear marks and holster wear, but overall in good condition and I would trust my life with it.

Whenever you need the very best in fast handling, easy to carry, travel

Lightweight Takedown w/Pistol Grip. Nearly identical to the one piece
models, it takes a keen eye to notice the uniqueness of the rifle. The easy
to use Takedown system is unobtrusive and allows the rifle to be rapidly
assembled or disassembled with just the flip of the flush mount lever. A
traditional scope can be affixed to the receiver, or a long eye relief
scope can be mounted directly to the barrel with an optional one piece
alloy scout style scope mount that stays attached to the barrel to maintain
zero when the rifle is taken down.

Henry H004SE Silver Eagle .22S/L/LR Lever-Action Rifle w/ 20″ Octagon Barrel, Nickel Receiver, Walnut Buttstock

The Henry Silver Eagle is based on the engraved scroll and silver plated Serial Number 9 Henry Rifle presented to US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles by The New Haven Arms Company. Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy’s Medal of Honor.
Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover.
The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20″ octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860.

I hate to sell it, but I need to let someone have it that will use it. It sits in a holster un used most of the time. It has a hogue outter grip that is less than a year old, brand new night sights, XS BIG DOT front and rear night sights. Comes with LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY with factory date stamp mag which is rare. 15 rounds. Comes in original black ""tupperware"" GLOCK BOX which is hard to find as well. These generation 2 series came with polished interiors and had what 
i consider the best triggers of any I have shot. I also replaced the guiderod with a brand new factory guide rod maybe 6 months ago.

Must have permit, ID, and I will have a bill of sale. Thanks for looking."

Kahr
CW380

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

This Pair, a .32 caliber pocket pistol and a .25 caliber vest pistol, came from an elderly man and they were said to be German Officer's Pistols taken as war prizes in WWII. I don't know much about them other than they are in really nice shape for pistols nearing 100 years old.  I have seen others that are not nearly as nice going for more money, but these will be offered only as a pair since they have historical significance as being taken in war as a pair.  If you purchase them and want to split them, you can, but I think they have more value as a pair considering their story.  My number is REDACTED and prefer texts since I work midnights and sleep during the day.  I will call you when awake if you text me.

Deutsche Werke was a German shipbuilding company founded in 1925 when Kaiserliche Werft Kiel and other shipyards were merged. It came as a result of the Treaty of Versailles after World War I that forced the German defence industry to shrink. The company was owned by the government of the Weimar Republic and its headquarters was in Berlin."

GARMIN RINO 130 Details: 
Keep tabs on your friends and keep your eye on the weather with Rino 130. This waterproof FRS/GMRS radio plus GPS navigator has a built-in barometric altimeter and electronic compass, NOAA weather radio and vibrate mode for your wildest outdoor adventures.

Stay Aware of Your Surroundings
Rino 130’s barometric altimeter pinpoints your precise altitude, and its built-in electronic compass provides bearing information even while you're standing still. To help you keep tabs on changing weather conditions, Rino 130 has a built-in weather radio that scans for the nearest NOAA weather radio station. You also can set up a weather alert tone, so when your radio is on, it will alert you when a storm warning is being broadcast for your area.

Find Your Friends
Like the rest of the Rino series, Rino 130 offers a Position Reporting feature so you can send your exact location to other Rino users in your group so they can see your position on the map page. And, because Rino is a standard FRS/GMRS radio, you can use it to communicate with any other conventional FRS/GMRS radio around.

Add More Detail
Rino 130 can save up to 500 of your favorite places in memory as waypoints so you can visit them later. The 130 also has a built-in Americas highway basemap and 24 MB of internal memory so you can load additional detailed maps from optional MapSource® products."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in black nitrite finish.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Get your comp gun now! The pistol was purchased a few months ago. It has had approximately 200-300 rounds shot through it. 

With the exception of some very minor wear on the rear sight (see photo) due to sight removal and reinstallation, the pistol looks brand new. The wear was re-blued so it is barely even noticeable and if not for that, I would call its condition MINT or LNIB. This pistol functions flawlessly and is a very accurate pistol. It has the newer 1/10 barrel. 

It comes with all accessories, two 17 round magazines, back straps, manual, box, lock, etc just as if new. 

I am asking $575 or best offer (OBO). Will trade up or down for steel framed CZ with cash as necessary. 

This item is located in Winston-Salem. I am willing to drive halfway to help facilitate the transaction but not more than a hour or so.

Very amazing rifle and was going to keep and use until I found out when it was manufactured.  I would never feel OK with using such a beauty.  I even been purchasing 30-30 rounds until I found out the manufacture date.  I recently asked dad if he wanted it back, he said no, and that I should sell/trade to a collector.  Dad did not know how old it was either.  He said the old rancher stated it was old when he purchased it. I have a bunch of photos if you would like.  The only piece I wonder is original is the front sight.  I have no idea if they used brass front sights in 1899. I am hoping a collector knows and can let me know.

Milled receiver and chromed bore. Threaded barrel. This gun is absolutely in amazing condition. Wood furniture is like new. The previous owner had the gun professionally refinished. It’s got the tough Moly Resin finish on it right now. Nothing was wrong with the factory finish. Previous owner just wanted a better finish than the factory. Which I totally agreed. Moly resin is really hard, durable, long lasting, self-lubricating, and has that always like-new-look finish to it. You must be at least 18 years old or older to buy/trade this gun. Kentucky resident with proper ID. Pictures does not do the gun justice. The gun looks way better and nicer in person than the pictures. My fault, not really a very good photographer. Thanks for looking.

A little background on the Bulgarian SLR-95:
The SLR-95(s) is/are 100% made in Bulgaria, has Steyr cold hammer forged barrels, and factory hot dipped hammer forge receivers. No longer being imported. The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world.

Really, think about it…

Don’t be a victim. Keep your eyes open for a box at the store, or go to a gun show. There was plenty of .22lr at the recent gun show in Clarence for 9 and 10 cents a round."
